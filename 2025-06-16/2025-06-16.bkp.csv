            The Louvre, the world's most-visited museum and a global symbol of art, beauty and endurance, remained shuttered Monday — not by war, not by terror, but by its own exhausted staff, who say the institution is crumbling from within.
    


            It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization's greatest treasures — paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.
    


            And yet, the moment felt bigger than a labor protest. The Louvre has become a bellwether of global overtourism — a gilded palace overwhelmed by its own popularity. As tourism magnets from Venice to the Acropolis scramble to cap crowds, the world's most iconic museum is reaching a reckoning of its own.
    


            The spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called “untenable” working conditions.
    


            “It's the Mona Lisa moan out here,” said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee, one of thousands of confused visitors corralled into unmoving lines beneath I.M. Pei's glass pyramid. “Thousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.”
    


            It's a rare thing for the Louvre to close its doors to the public. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes — including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it felt quite like this: tourists lining the plaza, tickets in hand, with no clear explanation for why the museum had, without warning, simply stopped.
    


            The disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decade-long plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over — water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle.
    


            But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.
    


            “We can't wait six years for help,” said Sarah Sefian of the CGT-Culture union. “Our teams are under pressure now. It's not just about the art — it's about the people protecting it.”
    


            At the center of it all, as always, is the Mona Lisa — a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience.
    


            Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des États, the museum's largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci's enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her — works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.
    


            “You don't see a painting,” said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. “You see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you're pushed out.”
    


            Macron's renovation blueprint, dubbed the “Louvre New Renaissance,” promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.
    


            “Conditions of display, explanation and presentation will be up to what the Mona Lisa deserves,” Macron said in January.
    


            The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year — more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid's greenhouse effect.
    


            In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are “no longer watertight,” that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs — food, restrooms, signage — fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as “a physical ordeal.”

            “What began as a scheduled monthly information session turned into a mass expression of exasperation,” Sefian said. Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon. As of the early afternoon, the museum remained closed.
    


            The full renovation plan — with a projected cost of €700–800 million — is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds, and licensing fees from the Louvre's Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.
    


            But workers say their needs are more urgent than any 10-year plan.
    


            Unlike other major sites in Paris, such as Notre-Dame cathedral or the Centre Pompidou museum, both of which are undergoing government-backed restorations, the Louvre remains stuck in limbo — neither fully funded nor fully functional.
    


            President Macron, who delivered his 2017 election victory speech at the Louvre and showcased it during the 2024 Paris Olympics, has promised a safer, more modern museum by the end of the decade.
    


            Until then, France's greatest cultural treasure — and the crowds who flock to it — remain caught between the cracks.

Live Updates


• Happening now: The jury in Sean “Diddy” Combs' trial is taking a lunch break. When it returns, DeLeassa Penland, a special agent with the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, is expected to continue testifying.
    


            • Juror dismissed: The judge dismissed juror No. 6 over the juror's inconsistent disclosures about where he lives. Juror No. 6 — a 41-year-old man who works as a clerk at a correctional facility and said he was a fan of '90s hip-hop — is replaced with the first alternate juror.
    


            • Federal charges: Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. If convicted on all counts, he could face up to life in prison.
    


            • Editor's Note: If you or someone you know is struggling with intimate partner violence, there are resources available, including the National Domestic Violence Hotline.



            While the prosecution has called over 30 witnesses, the case against Sean “Diddy” Combs has primarily relied on a handful of people who have accused the hip-hop mogul of sex trafficking, prostitution, kidnapping, arson, forced labor and more.
    


            These people include:
    


            Here's a closer look at these key witnesses, what they said on the stand, how their allegations against Combs are tied to the charges and the defense's counterpoints.

            The jury has been dismissed for a lunch break. Proceedings are expected to resume around 1:45 p.m. ET.
    


            The prosecution indicated the current summary witness will testify through today, and likely into tomorrow morning.
    


            Brendan Paul, Combs' former assistant, is expected to testify tomorrow and take most of the day. The prosecution's final witness, a law enforcement agent, is expected to testify most of Wednesday before the prosecution rests.
    


            The trial will take a day off on Thursday. Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo indicated three witnesses are lined up to begin the defense's case Friday. That is expected to include Vashta Dunlap, a human resources chief for Combs' company, the defense indicated.
    


            Court is expected to break for today around 3 p.m. ET.
    


            Special agent DeLeassa Penland walked the jury through a summary chart that shows the date, location, attendees, and travel records related to different “meetings.”
    


            One meeting in December 2009 involved Sean “Diddy” Combs, Cassie Ventura and a man at the London Hotel in New York City. Ventura previously testified that man often joined them for “Freak Offs.”
    


            Penland read aloud some messages between Combs and the man coordinating travel for the trip. Combs then sent an email to the personal finance director for his executive office saying he needed a flight booked under the man's name.
    


            The finance director then sent back a flight itinerary. Penland said the man's flight itinerary was found in records for Combs Global.
    


            Penland explained that flight records for the man and Ventura indicate they were both in the city at that time.
    


            DeLeassa Penland is now on the stand. She is another summary witness.
    


            Penland is a special agent with the US Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York. She testified her role in this case was to review charts and data and ensure the information is correct.
    


            Defense attorney Teny Geragos finished her cross-examination of summary witness and paralegal specialist Ananya Sankar.
    


            Sankar is now off the stand.
    


            The jury is seeing messages between Sean “Diddy” Combs and his chief of staff Kristina Khorram from November 2023.
    


            “If you cannot be honest with me, this doesn't work,” Khorram wrote in part. “We all know what your Kryptonite is and where you don't make the best choices.”
    


            She said she felt like Combs was lying and said it wasn't sitting well with her.
    


            “Come take my phone,” Combs wrote in response.
    


            Khorram responded that it wasn't about his phone. She said if he was starting to lie, “that will break me.”
    


            With summary witness and paralegal specialist Ananya Sankar under cross-examination, defense attorney Teny Geragos highlighted a few messages from Faheem Muhammad to Sean “Diddy” Combs, Combs' chief of staff Kristina Khorram and Combs' account manager.
    


            In the messages, Muhammad, Combs' head of security, asked for approval for a disbursement from “PD personal” to pay a variety of expenses.
    


Remember: A former Combs assistant testified last week that he sometimes used his company card to buy personal items for Combs, but didn't know whether these charges on the card were paid off with company funds or Combs' personal money.
    


            Defense attorney Teny Geragos pointed to a text conversation between Kristina Khorram, Sean “Diddy” Combs' former chief of staff, and Jane, who dated Combs from 2021 to 2024, on February 25, 2023.
    


            In the messages, Khorram twice asked Jane to call her and said Combs was pushing her to figure out plans.
    


            “My answer to him is no and it is still no,” Jane responded in part.
    


            Khorram said she would let him know and told Jane to keep her posted if anything changes.
    


            With summary witness and paralegal specialist Ananya Sankar under cross-examination, defense attorney Teny Geragos pointed to a message exchange between Kristina Khorram and “Jane” around Valentine's Day 2022.
    


            In one of the messages, Jane, who dated Sean “Diddy” Combs from 2021 to 2024, said: “I'm excited to surprise him.” Jane later sent Khorram, then the chief of staff for Combs, photos of a hotel room decorated with rose petals and heart balloons.
    


Remember: Jane, one of Combs' accusers who testified in this trial under a pseudonym,  testified extensively about going with Combs to what she called “hotel nights,” which she described as sexual encounters with a male “entertainer,” typically in a hotel room. She testified last week about a Valentine's Day 2022 “hotel night.”
    


            Defense attorney Teny Geragos is now starting cross-examination of paralegal specialist Ananya Sankar.
    


            Geragos read some messages in which Sean “Diddy” Combs reached out to Mia, one of his former assistants. The messages showed that D-Roc told Mia that Combs wanted to speak with her and also told her that Combs didn't want anything from her.
    


            Geragos read a message Combs sent Mia on February 7, 2024:
    


                    “Hey. I don't wanna be blowing up your phone. Just needed to talk to you for 10 minutes. Just need my memory jogged on some things. You were my right hand for years, so I just to speak to you to remember who was even around me. And it would be good to hear your voice. But if you don't want to, all good. Just let me know. Love. Hope you're well.”
                





            Geragos confirmed with Sankar that after that, D-Roc told Combs that Mia's number was ringing as if she was out of the country.
    


            She also confirmed that there are no records that suggest Combs called Mia again after that.
    


            The jury continued to see a series of 2023-2024 texts between former Sean “Diddy” Combs assistant “Mia” and Combs security guard “D-Roc.”
    


            Picking up after the February 2024 texts described earlier: D-Roc sent more messages over a few days, with Mia telling him she was out of the country on a scuba diving trip. In one message, D-Roc said, “Let me know how I can send you something.” Mia responded that her debt was her problem and she would figure it out one day.
    


            The records showed D-Roc tried to get on the phone with Mia several times.
    


            “Hey bro she hit me back I'm trying to call her now,” D-Roc texted Combs on February 4, 2024. He also sent Combs a copy of a previous message Mia had sent him.
    


            “Let me know when you reach her,” Combs responded.
    


            Later that day, Combs texted Mia, “Hey Mia it's Puff, let me know when you get 10 min to talk. Love.”
    


            Over the following days, Combs tried to call Mia several times.
    


            “Hey. I don't wanna be blowing up your phone. Just needed to talk to you for 10 minutes. Just need my memory jogged on some things. You were my right hand for years, so I just to speak to you to remember who was even around me. And it would be good to hear your voice. But if you don't want to, all good. Just let me know. Love. Hope you're well,” Combs texted her on February 7, 2024.
    


            The same day, Combs sent D-Roc the same message he sent to Mia and told him it was the message he sent to her. “I've been trying to reach her, she ain't picking up the phone,” Combs said to D-Roc.
    


            D-Roc then tried to call Mia twice.
    


Remember: “Mia,” a Combs assistant from 2009 to 2017, testified in this trial under a pseudonym that Combs had sexually assaulted her on multiple occasions. The jury heard that D-Roc began texting Mia in late November 2023 (for the first time since 2021), days after former Combs girlfriend Cassie Ventura filed a lawsuit against Combs, accusing him of rape and physical abuse.
    


            On Thanksgiving that year, Sean “Diddy” Combs' former security guard Damion Butler, who goes by D-Roc, wished Combs a Happy Thanksgiving.
    


            He also told Combs, “I feel I need to see you and chill with you for a couple days. If you need a real friend, I'm here.” Combs responded, “Love you calling you.”
    


            D-Roc texted Combs a few days later that he would see him the next day.
    


            The jury saw messages between D-Roc and Mia, a Combs assistant from 2009 to 2017, that were first shown during Mia's testimony. D-Roc texted Mia on November 30, 2023, for the first time since 2021. He said what's up and when she responded, he said, “D-Roc then says, a lot has been going on.”
    


            The jury saw a call recorded that day. Mia testified that she spoke to D-Roc that day, and he brought up Combs and Cassie Ventura's relationship.
    


            Records show that D-Roc sent Mia's phone number to Combs, who then tried to call her.
    


            A few days after that, Combs texted D-Roc, “Thank you again for coming and being here with me love you brother.”
    


            D-Roc texted Mia on December 5, 2023, “Your boy said to call him. He doesn't want or need you to do anything. He just called me.”
    


            Then on February 2, 2024, D-Roc texted Mia, “Good morning. How are you doing? Did you ever speak to P. He called me a couple days ago.”
    


            Records in the summary chart show D-Roc was in contact with Combs around this time.
    


            Judge Arun Subramanian is back on the bench, and Ananya Sankar, a paralegal specialist at the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, is back on the stand.
    


            The jury is seeing another summary chart of messages — including messages involving Sean “Diddy” Combs; “Mia,” a Combs assistant from 2009 to 2017 who testified in this trial that Combs had sexually assaulted her on multiple occasions; and Combs' former security guard Damion Butler, who goes by D-Roc.
    


            On November 19, 2023, D-Roc texted Combs: “Need to hear your voice bro, love you.”
    


            Combs responded, “Thank you for checking on me really appreciate you, love you.”
    


            That exchange came days after former Combs girlfriend Cassie Ventura filed a lawsuit against Combs, accusing him of rape and physical abuse. (The suit was filed on November 16, 2023, and it was settled a day later.)
    


The witness: Sankar is a summary witness — a government employee used by the prosecution to submit summary charts into evidence in an attempt to make things more clear. These charts are meant to show the jury text messages and other information that haven't been discussed in testimony but were submitted into evidence.
    


Also in court: Combs' mother is in attendance. While Combs' children have attended on other days, they are not yet in court today.
    


            The jury is taking a morning break. They will hear more testimony after the break.
    


            The jury saw text messages between Kristina Khorram, Sean “Diddy” Combs' former chief of staff, and Combs' assistant, Brendan Paul.
    


            In the messages, Paul keeps Khorram informed as he escorts Combs to Jane's house.
    


            Khorram warned Paul that he “might need king stuff potentially.”
    


            While Combs is with Jane, Paul tells Khorram, “He's just going with the flow.”
    


            Khorram says, “Lol okay so basically he's lit.”
    


            Paul responds, “Lol isn't lit lit.”
    


            Later, Paul texts her, “PD active now, running to Walmart now.”
    


            Khorram says, “Wild king mode actie or gucci bag active?”
    


            Paul responded, “In between the two if that makes sense.”
    


Remember: A Combs' assistant previously described “king nights” as “going to (a) hotel to have private time with a female.”
    


            The jury listened to two recordings — which the prosecution says was found on Kristina Khorram's devices — of phone calls between Sean “Diddy” Combs and his then-girlfriend “Jane” days after Cassie Ventura's lawsuit was field in November 2023.
    


            The jury first heard the recorded calls during Jane's direct testimony. (The messages came after Ventura's lawsuit in which Ventura accused Combs of rape and physical abuse. In the calls, which Jane testified she didn't know were recorded, Jane and Combs talked about the lawsuit.)
    


            The jury also saw photos that the prosecution says was recovered from Khorram's device that showed messages on another phone. The photos were taken on December 28, 2023.
    


            “I don't believe the lovey dovey stuff. You don't need to go there for me. I was confused and couldn't concentrate for three years and feel extremely exploited, heartbroken and manipulated by you,” one of the messages said, in part.
    


            “You're the only opportunist here. You exploited the fuck out of me. You win. 3 years of being used and you had three years of fun with my body,” messages in the other photo said.
    


            Jane previously testified she sent those messages to Combs.
    


            A few hours after the photos were taken, Jane texted Khorram saying, in part, “he just threatened me about my sex tapes that he has of me on two phones. He said that he would expose me and send them to my child's father.”
    


            The jury saw messages between Sean “Diddy” Combs' chief of staff Kristina Khorram and Cassie Ventura from May 2017.
    


            Ventura texted Khorram “wtf” and then Khorram asked if she was okay.
    


            “No but you should talk to him,” Ventura responded.
    


            “No one deserves being dragged by their hair. I locked the door for my safety,” Ventura said in the message. She added that she didn't have her belongings or any money.
    


            Khorram responded that she would try to talk to Combs and help Ventura get her stuff.
    


            The jury saw messages between Kristina Khorram, Sean “Diddy” Combs' former chief of staff, Combs, and one of his security guards, Faheem Muhammad.
    


            “Puff, can you text Fah what you need him to pick up before his flight to Miami?” Khorram said.
    


            Combs responded that he had already told her, and Khorram said that he didn't give the final information.
    


            “Molly, 15 pills,” Combs responded in part.
    


            The jury saw a message Muhammad sent to Combs, Khorram, and Combs' account manager in April 2023.
    


            “Just gave $5k to Brendan for hotel,” Muhammad said.
    


            The jury continues to review texts brought up while Ananya Sankar, a paralegal specialist at the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, is on the stand.
    


            The jury has viewed a series of messages between Sean “Diddy” Combs and his staff about buying drugs from a dealer called “Guido.”
    


            In one message thread from December 2021 between Combs and Kristina Khorram (then Combs' chief of staff), they discuss a package that Guido eventually drops off and Khorram deals with.
    


            Khorram also confirms in the thread that she's working on setting up a hotel room that Combs requested.
    


            In another thread, Faheem Muhammad, Combs' head of security, gets approval to pay Guido for thousands of dollars of drugs. One text references “flower,” which has been established at trial to be a reference to marijuana. That thread included Combs, Khorram, Combs' accountant, and Muhammad.
    


The witness on the stand: Sankar is a summary witness — a government employee used by the prosecution to submit summary charts into evidence in an attempt to make things more clear. These charts are meant to show the jury text messages and other information that haven't been discussed in testimony but were submitted into evidence.
    


            The jury was shown messages that Kristina Khorram, Sean “Diddy” Combs' former chief of staff, sent to Jane and Combs between February 12 and 14, 2022, discussing a hotel room.
    


            One of Khorram's messages said, in part, “Your damage charges on the one hotel are always high.”
    


            Khorram later sent a message to Jane, who dated Combs from 2021 to 2024, telling her to “ask them if they can bring up like 15 bath towels.”
    


            Jane texted Khorram saying that Combs always brought cash, and asking if his security could bring around $5,000 to $10,000.
    


            Khorram later texted Combs, saying, “Jane asked if you could bring 5-10k cash, it's all in your safe.”

            A crystal-covered chair inspired by one of Vincent Van Gogh's most famous paintings was seriously damaged when a tourist sat on it while posing for a photograph, according to the Italian museum where the artwork is on display.
    


            Footage released by the Palazzo Maffei in Verona shows a man and woman taking turns to pose with the museum's “Van Gogh” chair, before the man sits on it, breaking its seat and two front legs.
    


            The woman then helps him up, before both hurry out of the room.
    


            Taking its name from the renowned Dutch painter, the work by Italian artist Nicola Bolla was inspired by Van Gogh's 1888 painting “Van Gogh's Chair,” which depicts a simple wooden chair positioned on a tile floor.
    


            Bolla's modern interpretation, which was made between 2006 and 2007, is covered with hundreds of Swarovski crystals.
    


            “They waited for the staff to leave the room,” Vanessa Carlon, the museum's director, said in a video posted on its social media. “And then… off they went, indifferent to what had happened.”

            Commenting on the CCTV footage, Carlon said: “What you just saw would be ridiculous if it hadn't, unfortunately, actually happened. The ultimate nightmare for any museum.”
    


            Initially, the museum was concerned that the chair would be unfixable because of its delicate design, but restorers did an “outstanding job,” Carlon said.

            “A special thanks to all of you who walk through the museum's rooms every day with care, attention and wonder,” it said in a statement. “Because art is not just to be seen. It is to be loved.”
    


            Other artworks have also fallen victim to gallery-goers in recent years.

The US has reportedly deployed more than 30 aerial refueling tankers across the Atlantic toward the Middle East, Military Watch Magazine reported on Monday. The outlet has described the buildup as “unprecedented,” claiming it could suggest broader US involvement in the ongoing Israeli-Iranian war.

West Jerusalem and Tehran have entered the fourth day of open hostilities. Last Thursday, Israeli forces launched airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets, killing senior military officials and scientists and prompting retaliatory missile barrages on Israeli cities such as Tel Aviv and Haifa.

The US has expressed support for the Israeli strikes, with President Donald Trump calling them “excellent.” He has also warned that Washington could become directly involved in the conflict if American interests are threatened but has yet to announce any plans to involve US forces.

However, according to flight tracking data, the US has already started deploying KC-135 and KC-46 aerial refueling tankers to the Middle East. Military Watch Magazine has suggested that the aircraft may be intended to support Israeli Air Force operations or refuel US fighters and bombers if Washington expands its role in the conflict.

The report also claims that tankers from other Western countries have participated in Israeli aerial refueling efforts, while the US is believed to have provided intelligence, satellite targeting data, and missile defense support.

On Sunday, Axios reported that Israeli officials had asked the US to directly take part in the military operation, specifically requesting assistance in striking Iran's Fordow enrichment facility. However, US officials cited by the outlet said the request was declined, with one stating that the Trump administration is not considering any such involvement.

Nevertheless, Tehran has claimed that Washington's support for West Jerusalem has made the US complicit in Israel's aggression against Iran. Sources within the Iranian military have also reportedly indicated that Tehran's response to Israeli strikes would “spread to all areas occupied by this [Israeli] regime and related US bases in the region in the coming days.”

In response, Trump has warned that any Iranian attack on US forces would trigger a military response, writing on his Truth Social platform that “if we are attacked in any way, shape, or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the US Armed Forces will come down on you at levels never seen before.” He also insisted that the US “had nothing to do with the attack on Iran” and called on Tehran to return to negotiations.

Pakistani Defense Minister Khawaja Asif has called on all Muslim nations to unite against Israel following its strikes on Iranian military and nuclear sites. He warned that failing to act collectively would only encourage further attacks across the Middle East.



Speaking in the National Assembly on Saturday, Asif argued that Israel “did not act alone” and had received “intelligence, cover, and support.” He said the Muslim world remained “militarily vulnerable” and urged a joint response.



“Just as Israel is currently targeting Yemen, Iran, and Palestine, if the Muslim world does not unite today and continues to prioritize its own interests and agendas, then everyone's turn will come,” he told lawmakers.



Asif called for the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to convene and devise a strategy to confront Israel. “Wherever there are diplomatic ties with Israel in the Muslim world, they should be severed,” he said.

“We stand behind Iran and will support them at every international forum to protect their interests,” the defense minister added.



On Friday morning, IDF jets bombed military and nuclear sites across Iran and carried out assassinations of several of its senior military commanders and veteran nuclear scientists. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strikes were aimed at preventing the Islamic Republic from acquiring nuclear weapons. In response, Tehran launched multiple ballistic missiles at Israeli cities, including Tel Aviv.



While the US has denied involvement, President Donald Trump endorsed Israel's operation. Iran has since suspended nuclear talks with Washington.

The intelligence chief of Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has been killed in an Israeli strike.

Brigadier General Mohammad Kazemi, head of the IRGC's Intelligence Organization, was assassinated along with two other intelligence officers, Hassan Mohaghdeh and Mohsen Bagheri, the Guards confirmed in a statement on Sunday evening.

The IRGC said it responded by launching missiles at Israeli “intelligence centers” as part of the third wave of its ongoing barrage, dubbed Operation True Promise III.

The killing of Kazemi was first announced by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in an interview with Fox News on Sunday. “I think we've set them back quite a bit,” Netanyahu told journalist Bret Baier.

Open hostilities erupted on Friday morning when IDF jets bombed military and nuclear sites across Iran in what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described as an operation to prevent the Islamic Republic from acquiring nuclear weapons. Tehran responded with a barrage of missiles, some of which struck residential areas in Tel Aviv and Bat Yam.

Israel also carried out targeted assassinations of senior Iranian commanders and veteran nuclear scientists after reportedly smuggling kamikaze drones into the country.

Iranian security officials said they discovered Israeli drones and explosives hidden in Tehran following the attacks.

Performer says Dodgers told her to sing in English

Protests have erupted across LA in response to raids

Singer Vanessa Hernández says she chose to sing the Spanish version of the US national anthem at Dodger Stadium on Saturday as a protest against recent immigration raids.

Hernández, who performs under the name Nezza, says she was warned by a member of the Dodgers staff before the team's game against the San Francisco Giants to perform the anthem in English.

After her performance Hernández posted a video to TikTok, with the caption “Watch the Dodgers tell me I can't sing the Spanish Star Spangled Banner that Roosevelt literally commissioned in 1945 – so I did it anyway.” The video shows an apparent conversation with the Dodgers staff member. “We are going to do the song in English today, so I don't know if that wasn't translated – er, communicated,” the employee says.

However, Hernández went on to sing El Pendón Estrellado, which the US government commissioned as the Spanish version of the Star-Spangled Banner in 1945. She explained her decision in another social media video.

“I didn't think I would be met with any sort of ‘No,' especially because we're in LA with everything happening,” said Hernández whose parents are from the Dominican Republic. “I've sang the national anthem many times in my life, but today I could not. I'm sorry ... I just could not believe, when she walked in and told me ‘No,' but I just felt like I needed to do it, para mi gente [for my people].

“My parents are immigrants. They've been citizens my whole life at this point, they got documented really early, but I just can't imagine them being ripped away from me, even at this age, let alone a little kid. Like, what are we doing?”

The Dodgers have yet to comment on the incident but The Athletic reports the club did not punish her for her decision.

Hernández was not the only person over the weekend to make a statement on the immigration raids in LA. Angel City, LA's NWSL team, wore shirts that proclaimed themselves “Immigrant City Football Club” before Saturday night's game against the North Carolina Courage.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Concerns raised that section 899 could backfire and also undermine dollar's safe haven status

Foreign investment into the US could be threatened by Donald Trump's new “revenge” taxes, analysts have warned.

A provision within the president's One Big Beautiful Bill Act will allow the US to apply higher taxes on foreign individuals, businesses and investors connected to jurisdictions that impose “unfair foreign taxes” on US individuals and companies.

Companies listed on the London Stock Exchange could choose to avoid the measure by redomiciling in New York.

Section 899, as it is called, classes digital service taxes and “diverted profits taxes” as unfair, along with any taxes that target US entities. It would allow US authorities to impose an additional tax starting at 5% and increasing by five percentage points annually, up to 20%.

Max Yoeli, a senior research fellow in the US and the Americas programme at Chatham House, says section 899 “threatens to further alienate foreign investors”.

It could chill investment into the US by calling into question its “fundamental openness”, he added in a comment piece.

The Italian bank UniCredit agrees that section 899 could further damage foreign investor sentiment towards US dollar-denominated assets. It could backfire on the US, it says, given the large amount of domestic assets held by foreigners.

“The list of countries that would fall into this category is long and encompasses most European countries, including Italy and Germany,” UniCredit told clients, saying that foreign investors had more than doubled their holdings of US assets over the past decade.

“Not only would this additional tax serve to finance corporate tax reductions, but it would also likely be used as a negotiating tool for the US in trade deals, especially as Republicans seem willing to withdraw from the global minimum tax framework.”

UniCredit also fears the dollar's safe haven status could be undermined if there are fresh tax disputes between the US and other countries.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act was passed by the US House of Representatives last month. The Senate is yet to approve the bill, with the White House setting a deadline of 4 July.

George Saravelos, the global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, warned last month that section 899 could allow the US administration to transform its trade war into a capital war by “explicitly using taxation on foreign holdings of US assets as leverage to further US economic goals”.

UK companies could certainly fall foul of section 899, as Britain operates a digital services tax aimed at tech multinationals, and a diverted profits tax designed to clamp down on tax avoidance by multinationals.

Goldman Sachs has calculated that UK corporates are “particularly exposed” to section 899, as roughly 30% of the revenues of companies listed on the FTSE 100 are generated in the US.

However, as companies that are majority-owned by US shareholders are exempt, City bosses may consider moving their stock market listing to New York, to dodge section 899.

“This ownership dynamic not only mitigates tax risk but also reinforces the strategic case for relisting in the US, where investor bases are deeper and more aligned with US revenue exposure,” the Goldman Sachs analysts said.

According to Goldman, the large UK companies with the most significant exposure to the US, and who are not majority-owned by US investors, are the media group Pearson, the business services group Experian, the pest control business Rentokil and the pharmaceuticals manufacturer Hikma.

Ashtead Group, Compass and Melrose also generate a large proportion of their sales stateside, but as they have majority US ownership they should be exempt from section 899.

French companies could also be at risk, as Paris operates a digital services tax on the revenues that large tech companies generate in France.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Cambodia's influential former leader Hun Sen yesterday issued an ultimatum to Thailand to lift border crossing restrictions or his country would ban all Thai fruit and vegetable imports in the latest round of the border spat between the two countries.

One Cambodian soldier was killed on May 28, as troops exchanged fire in a disputed area known as the Emerald Triangle, where the borders of Cambodia, Thailand and Laos meet.

The Thai and Cambodian armies both said they acted in self-defense.

Thailand has tightened border controls with Cambodia in recent days, while Cambodia on Friday ordered troops to stay on “full alert,” banned Thai dramas from TV and cinemas, closed a popular border checkpoint and cut Internet bandwidth from Thailand.

In an address to the nation, Hun Sen — father of current Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet — threatened to ban all fruit and vegetables from Thailand unless Bangkok lifted all border crossing restrictions within 24 hours.

“If the Thai side does not open border crossings to normalcy today, tomorrow we will implement throughout the border banning the imports of fruit and vegetables to Cambodia,” Hun Sen said.

He said Hun Manet had already told his Thai counterpart about the measures.

Cambodia on Sunday formally asked the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to help resolve the border dispute in four areas — the site of last month's clash and three ancient temples.

Hun Sen said his country had to go to the ICJ because Cambodia wanted “peace” as the two countries would never reach an agreement in the four areas.

Cambodia has repeatedly asked Thailand to jointly bring the case to the ICJ.

“Only a thief is afraid of a court,” Hun Sen said.

He said Cambodia would not back off and would respect the ICJ's ruling.

Hun Sen also called on tens of thousands of Cambodian migrants working in Thailand to return home, saying they would face increasing discrimination as the border spat drags on.

“We must come back home, and it is the suitable time. The border dispute will not end easily, so insults happen at times, and this time is more serious,” he added.

The row dates back to the drawing of the countries' 800km frontier in the early 20th century during the French occupation of Indochina.

Cambodia has previously sought help from the ICJ in a territorial dispute over a border temple.

In 1962, the court ruled then the disputed Preah Vihear temple belonged to Cambodia and in 2013, the ICJ awarded an area next to the temple to Cambodia, too. Thailand said it did not accept the court's jurisdiction.

Violence sparked by the dispute has led to 28 deaths in the region since 2008.

UNITED NATIONS

Funding cuts hit aid

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) yesterday said it was drastically scaling back its global humanitarian aid plans due to the “deepest funding cuts ever.” The agency said in a statement that it was seeking US$29 billion in funding compared with US$44 billion requested in December, in a “hyper-prioritized” appeal. The US, the world's top donor, has heavily slashed its foreign aid under President Donald Trump. Other donor nations have cut back their contributions in the face of an uncertain economic outlook. “Brutal funding cuts leave us with brutal choices,” OCHA Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher said. Nearly midway through the year, the agency has received only US$5.6 billion out of the US$44 billion that it had requested while facing surging crises in Sudan, Gaza and Myanmar, among others.

N Korea casualties in Kursk 

More than 6,000 North Korean soldiers are believed to have been injured or killed while fighting in Russia's Kursk region in support of Moscow's war on Ukraine, according to estimates by British intelligence, underscoring North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's role as a key ally of President Vladimir Putin in a war now in its fourth year. The number amounts to more than half of the 11,000 North Korean troops initially deployed to the Kursk region, the British Ministry of Defence said on X. “Significant DPRK casualty rates have almost certainly been sustained primarily through large, highly attritional dismounted assaults,” the statement said, referring to the North's formal name. Bloomberg was unable to independently verify the figures. Neither Russia nor Ukraine provides official figures for the number of combat casualties.

Mayor shot dead in office

Four armed men on Sunday stormed a mayor's office in the south, killing her and another member of her staff, police said. The men arrived on motorcycles at the town hall in San Mateo Pinas, in the state of Oaxaca, police said. After threatening officers guarding the facility, they stormed into mayor Lilia Garcia's office and shot her and another official, Eli Garcia, dead. Two municipal police officers were also wounded in the attack, authorities said. “There can be no impunity for this act,” Oaxaca Governor Salomon Jara wrote on social media. The state prosecutor's office said it was investigating the attack, while military and federal agents were deployed in the area.

Egret's 38-hour flight tracked

A species of heron has been tracked flying for almost two days non-stop between Australia and Papua New Guinea during its northern migration, scientists said. Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation researchers used GPS to follow eight plumed egrets and 10 great egrets over several months after the birds left the Macquarie Marshes in New South Wales. Great egrets were found to disperse in all directions, while the plumed egrets all migrated north, and one was tracked flying almost 2,400km over several months before settling near the town of Kalo. It took that bird 38 hours to fly more than 700km across the Coral Sea, findings published in the journal Pacific Conservation Biology yesterday said. It was the first time scientists had recorded the plumed egrets' migration. Another Australian bird, the bar-tailed godwit, holds the world record for flying more than 13,500km nonstop in 11 days during its migration from Alaska to Tasmania.

Swedish double Olympic pole vault champion Armand “Mondo” Duplantis on Sunday increased his own world record again, clearing 6.28m to the delight of a home crowd at the Stockholm Diamond League meeting.

With victory in the event already guaranteed, Duplantis broke the world record for the 12th time as he sailed over the bar at the first attempt to improve on his 6.27m effort at Clermont-Ferrand, France, in February.

The 25-year-old ripped off his shirt in celebration and raced down the track in front of jubilant spectators at the Olympic Stadium built for the 1912 Games.

“It's a magical feeling, it's hard to explain,” said Duplantis, who had not before broken the record in Sweden. “I wanted this so bad. I wanted to do this in front of everybody here in Stockholm. It felt like really something special in the crowd today and I knew that everybody really wanted to see it, too.”

“It'll be one of the greatest memories for me, I think, in my career,” he said.

Duplantis notched up his 37th victory in 41 Diamond League outings, finishing well ahead of Australia's Kurtis Marschall, who managed a best of 5.90m.

The US-born Duplantis was in a class of his own in another punishing display of vaulting of the highest order.

“I kept saying it was the only thing I was missing in the accolades, to break a record in Sweden,” he said. “I've checked off pretty much everything now.”

Duplantis is the heavy favorite for a third successive world championship gold in Tokyo later this year. He is also a three-time indoor world champion.

He first broke the world record in 2020 when he surpassed the 6.16m mark set by Frenchman Renaud Lavillenie.

Duplantis intends to push the bar even higher after his Stockholm exploits.

“I'm going to jump higher. There's not much between me and 6.30, technically. It's just a few centimeters. I'm just a perfect day away from it,” he said.

Olympic champion Julien Alfred won the women's 100m in 10.75 seconds, the second-fastest time of the year. It was only her second race of the season following her victory in Oslo on Thursday.

Britain's Dina Asher-Smith took second (10.93) ahead of Ivory Coast's Marie-Josee Ta Lou-Smith (11.00).

Two-time Olympic bronze medalist Femke Bol won the women's 400m hurdles in a season's best time of 52.11 seconds. She finished ahead of American Dalilah Muhammad (52.91) and Panama's Gianna Woodruff (53.99).

“I am not in my best shape yet, so to take the victory is especially good,” Bol said. “A race is never the same as training and it is only my third race of the season ... but I am starting to feel the hurdles better every race and getting into race shape. It is such a high level at the moment in the hurdles, so I am very excited going forward towards the world championships.”



                                                                                Brazil has four teams, more than any other country, in the expanded Club World Cup that kicked off yesterday in the US, but for SE Palmeiras, the competition holds a special meaning: winning it would provide some redemption.
Under coach Abel Ferreira since 2020, Palmeiras lifted two Copa Libertadores titles, plus Brazilian league, cup and state championships. Even before Ferreira, it boasted another South American crown and 11 league titles.
The only major trophy missing is a world champions' title.
Other Brazilian clubs like Fluminense FC and Botafogo FR, also in the tournament, have never won it either, but the problem for Palmeiras                                    



                                                                                Manchester City on Monday completed the signing of left-back Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolverhampton Wanderers for a reported ￡31 million (US$41.8 million). 
The 24-year-old Algeria international has signed a five-year contract and will be available for the FIFA Club World Cup, which begins later this week. 
Ait-Nouri is expected to be just one of a trio of new City faces for that tournament with deals close to completion for AC Milan midfielder Tijjani Reijnders and Olympique Lyonnais playmaker Rayan Cherki. 
After missing out on a major trophy in the recently completed season for the first time since 2016-2017, City are hoping                                    



                                                                                Lionel Messi drew vast crowds and showed flashes of his brilliance when his Inter Miami side were held to a goalless draw by African giants Al-Ahly as the revamped FIFA Club World Cup got off to a festive start on Saturday.
Fans showed up en masse for the Group A clash at the Hard Rock Stadium, home to the NFL's Miami Dolphins, but Messi could not fully deliver, his best chance coming through a last-second attempt that was deflected onto the crossbar.
Inter Miami next face FC Porto on Thursday in Atlanta, while Al-Ahly, who benefited from raucous, massive support, are to

The Ichijodani Asakura Family Site in Fukui is a well-preserved ruin of a city destroyed in battle during the 16th century.

Temples, homes of merchants and important locations for the ruling Asakura household have been mapped out across the valley.

Houses around where the residences of high-ranking samurai were located have been recreated, giving visitors a clearer idea of how the town looked.

The valley is an active archeological site, and excavations are still being made to investigate what life in this medieval town was like.

Moscow will insist that Ukraine dismantle and destroy all Western-supplied weapons as part of any ceasefire deal, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said in an interview with the state-run newspaper Izvestia published June 16. 

""All these surpluses must be destroyed. All international algorithms are known. They must be reduced, disposed of, and guaranteed,"" Grushko said, without offering specifics.

The remarks reflect Moscow's growing list of maximalist demands presented in its so-called ""peace memorandum"" during recent negotiations with Ukraine in Istanbul on June 2. 

The document calls for Ukraine to recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea and four partially occupied regions — Kherson, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Luhansk — and demands full Ukrainian troop withdrawal and demobilization. 

Grushko argued that Western weapons aid threatens not only Russia but also Europe, warning that arms could end up on black markets. 

""It's crazy how reckless some politicians are, still flooding the market with weapons,"" he said.

There is no credible evidence that Kyiv has diverted Western weapons or fueled arms trafficking — a narrative promoted by Russian propaganda to undermine support for Kyiv.

Independent oversight by partner states and institutions has consistently found that Ukraine uses Western weapons to defend itself against Russia's full-scale invasion.

Moscow's proposals would further prevent Ukraine from joining NATO or military alliances, prohibit its armed forces' redeployment, and stop all Western military aid and intelligence sharing.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has rejected Moscow's demands, saying the Russian delegation admitted in Istanbul that their ""memorandum"" is an ultimatum Ukraine cannot accept. 

""They even told our delegation: we know that our memorandum is an ultimatum, and you will not accept it,"" he said in a June 10 interview with Hungarian outlet Valasz Online.

In contrast, Ukraine's proposal focused on humanitarian measures, including a prisoner exchange, the return of abducted children, and securing the right to join the EU and NATO. 

Kyiv has also called for using frozen Russian assets to pay for reconstruction and linking any sanctions relief to a verified ceasefire. 

Despite two rounds of talks in May and June, no political breakthrough has been reached. Moscow continues to reject calls for an unconditional ceasefire, while Ukraine presses for an end to hostilities. 

U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly shown frustration over Russia's refusal to compromise, yet he has refrained from imposing new sanctions.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed Russian claims of significant battlefield gains, calling them part of a disinformation campaign during an interview with Bild published on June 12.

Zelensky rejected claims of Russian advance as ""a Russian narrative,"" insisting that Ukraine's forces have been holding off a renewed offensive for nearly three weeks.

""The Russians are not so successful, to say the least,"" Zelensky said.

His remarks come amid a surge in Russian military operations across Ukraine's eastern and northern regions, including Russian claims of territorial gains in Dnipropetrovsk and Sumy oblasts — assertions Kyiv denies.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the Russian state media on June 9 that the offensive in Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk Oblast aims to establish a so-called ""buffer zone"" on Ukrainian territory. 

The statement followed Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier announcement that Moscow intends to create security corridors along Ukraine's borders with Russia's Kursk, Bryansk, and Belgorod regions.

Ukrainian officials denied any Russian advances into Dnipropetrovsk. 

""As of the morning of June 9, all Russian information, including Peskov's statements, about an offensive in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast does not correspond to reality,"" said Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation.

Ukraine's Southern Operational Command described the situation as ""tense"" but said no breakthroughs had occurred. 

Despite the absence of confirmed ground incursions, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast has faced frequent missile and drone attacks. In April, the region initiated mandatory evacuations from four front-line villages as a precautionary measure.

Separately, open-source monitoring group DeepState showed some advances near the Russian border in Sumy Oblast. On June 8, DeepState confirmed that Russian troops had occupied the village of Loknia in Ukraine's Sumy Oblast.

Located about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of Sumy, the village lies close to the Russian border in an increasingly volatile region. The Ukrainian General Staff has not commented on the development.

According to an article by Ukrainska Pravda, Russian forces began advancing into northern Sumy Oblast in late February or early March, taking advantage of the withdrawal of Ukraine's most combat-capable units. These were reportedly replaced by newly formed, under-resourced brigades with minimal combat experience and limited equipment.

Since March, Russia has reportedly taken control of about 200 square kilometers (80 square miles) in northern Sumy Oblast, including roughly a dozen small villages. The advances have triggered civilian evacuations. As of May 31, regional authorities ordered the evacuation of 213 settlements.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

President Volodymyr Zelensky on June 15 condemned Russia's latest mass attack against Ukraine, calling the strikes on energy infrastructure ""a spit in the face of everything the international community is trying to do to stop this war.""

Earlier in the day, Russia targeted the city of Kremenchuk in Poltava Oblast with a combined missile and drone attack, damaging energy and agricultural facilities. The strike involved nearly 200 drones and missiles, including both cruise and ballistic missiles. The attack came shortly after a phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. 

In his nightly address, Zelensky said the attack on Kremenchuk was ""deliberately and treacherously planned to target our civilian infrastructure"" and that Russia intended to damage energy facilities. 

""This is Russia's spit in the face of everything the international community is trying to do to stop this war,"" Zelensky said in his nightly address. 

""It happened right after Putin's conversation with Trump. After the Americans asked us not to strike Russian energy facilities. At the same time as Putin tries to portray himself as a mediator for the Middle East ... The level of cynicism is staggering.""

Following his call with Putin, Trump claimed he would be ""open"" to the Russian president acting as a mediator in the rapidly escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Zelensky rejected the idea of Putin — who has waged war against Ukraine for over 10 years and has taken no steps towards a lasting ceasefire — playing the role of peacemaker.

Putin ""is war itself,"" Zelensky said, urging the international community not to fall for ""Russian manipulation and lies."" 

Zelensky also warned that Russia may be planning additional attacks on Ukraine's energy sector, including nuclear power infrastructure. According to the president, Ukrainian intelligence agencies have obtained evidence of Russia's threat and shared the information with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Trump administration. 

""Russia is planning further attacks on our energy sector — attacks that may be less visible to the world right now because all eyes are on the situation in the Middle East,"" he said. 

Throughout the full-scale war, Russia has attempted to disrupt Ukraine's power grid through targeted attacks on energy infrastructure. After rejecting a U.S. proposal for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire in March, Moscow instead agreed to a month-long ceasefire on energy attacks. 

Russia subsequently violated the partial ceasefire, which ended in in April. The Kremlin continues to refuse calls for an unconditional truce.

Iran called on U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday to force Israel to cease fire as the only way to end the four-day-old aerial war, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country was on the “path to victory.”

Israeli forces stepped up their bombardment of Iranian cities, while Iran proved capable of piercing Israeli air defences with one of its most successful volleys yet of retaliatory missile strikes.

“If President Trump is genuine about diplomacy and interested in stopping this war, next steps are consequential,” Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on X.

“Israel must halt its aggression, and absent a total cessation of military aggression against us, our responses will continue. It takes one phone call from Washington to muzzle someone like Netanyahu. That may pave the way for a return to diplomacy.”

Iran fired a new wave of missile attacks on Israel early Monday, killing at least eight people, while Israel said it had gained 'aerial superiority' over Iran's capital.

The Associated Press

Sources told Reuters that Tehran had asked Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Oman to press Trump to use his influence on Israel to agree to an immediate ceasefire. In return, Iran would show flexibility in nuclear negotiations, said the two Iranian and three regional sources.

Netanyahu told Israeli troops at an air base that Israel was on its way to achieving its two main aims: wiping out Iran's nuclear program and destroying its missiles.

“We are on the path to victory,” he said. “We are telling the citizens of Tehran: ‘Evacuate' – and we are taking action.”

An Iranian state television reporter had to stop a live broadcast Monday when an explosion occurred an hour after Israel issued a warning to evacuate the area of Tehran where the TV studios are located.

The reporter for the Islamic Republic of Iran News Network said the studio was filling with dust after “the sound of aggression against the homeland, the sound of aggression against truth and righteousness.”

Anchor Sahar Emami rushed off-camera as the screen behind her cut out, and people were heard saying “Allahu akbar,” the Arabic phrase for God is great.

The broadcast quickly switched to pre-recorded programs. Soon, Emami came back live from another studio and was seen speaking with another anchor. She said that “bodies of reporters” were at the site of the initial broadcast, and images showed smoke and flames in the sky.

Israel's defense minister took credit for the attack.

“The Iranian regime's propaganda and incitement broadcasting authority was attacked by the IDF after a widespread evacuation of the area's residents,” Israel Katz said in a statement. “We will strike the Iranian dictator everywhere.”

An hour earlier, the Israeli military had issued an evacuation warning affecting up to 330,000 people in a part of central Tehran that includes the country's state TV and police headquarters, as well as three large hospitals. The IDF has issued similar evacuation warnings for civilians in parts of Gaza and Lebanon ahead of strikes.

Israel launched its air war on Friday with a surprise attack that killed nearly the entire top echelon of Iran's military commanders and its leading nuclear scientists. It has said it now has control of Iranian airspace and intends to escalate its campaign in coming days.

Tehran's retaliation is the first time in decades of shadow war and proxy conflict that missiles fired from Iran have pierced Israeli defences in significant numbers and killed Israelis in their homes.

A timeline of the Israel-Iran conflict and tensions between the two countries

Iran says more than 224 Iranians have been killed, most of them civilians. Media published images of wounded children, women, and the elderly from cities across the country. State TV broadcast scenes of collapsed presidential buildings, burned-out cars, and shattered streets in Tehran. Many residents were trying to flee the capital, describing queues for petrol and bank machines that were out of cash.

“I am desperate. My two children are scared and cannot sleep at night because of the sound of air defence and attacks, explosions. But we have nowhere to go. We hid under our dining table,” Gholamreza Mohammadi, 48, a civil servant, told Reuters by phone from Tehran.

In Israel, 24 people have been killed so far in Iran's missile attacks, all of them civilians. Round the clock television images showed rescuers working in ruins of flattened homes.

“It's terrifying because it's so unknown,” said Guydo Tetelbaum, 31, a chef in Tel Aviv who was in his apartment when the alerts came in shortly after 4 a.m. (9 p.m. ET). He had tried to reach a shelter but his door was blown in.

“This could be the beginning of a long time like this. Or it could get worse, or hopefully better, but it's the unknown that's the scariest.”

Trump has consistently said that the Israeli assault could end quickly if Iran agrees to U.S. demands that it accept strict curbs to its nuclear program.

Talks between the United States and Iran, hosted by Oman, had been scheduled for Sunday but were scrapped, with Tehran saying it could not negotiate while under attack. On Monday, Iranian lawmakers floated the idea of quitting the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, a move bound to be seen as a setback for any negotiations.

Before dawn on Monday, Iranian missiles struck Tel Aviv and Haifa, killing at least eight people and destroying homes. Israeli authorities said a total of seven missiles fired overnight had landed in Israel. At least 100 people were wounded. Iran's Revolutionary Guards said the latest attack employed a new method that caused Israel's multi-layered defence systems to target each other so missiles could get through.

“The arrogant dictator of Tehran has become a cowardly murderer who targets the civilian home front in Israel to deter the IDF,” Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said.

“The residents of Tehran will pay the price, and soon.”

Global oil prices had shot up on Friday at the prospect of conflict disrupting supplies from the Gulf. Prices eased somewhat on Monday, suggesting traders think exports could be spared despite Israeli attacks that hit domestic Iranian oil and gas targets.

Still, the sudden killing of so many Iranian military commanders and the apparent loss of control of airspace could prove to the biggest test of the stability of Iran's system of clerical rule since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

Iran's network of regional allies who could once have been expected to rain rockets on Israel – Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon – have been decimated by Israeli forces since the start of the Gaza war.

Netanyahu has said that, while toppling the Iranian government is not Israel's primary aim, it believes that could be the outcome.

Iran's currency has lost at least 10 per cent of its value against the U.S. dollar since the start of Israel's attack.

CCTV footage captured the moment a missile struck in Israel's Petah Tikva killing at least three people and injuring dozens on Monday, according to police. Reuters was able to confirm the location of the video as Petah Tikva from the buildings, the fences and the road layout, which matched street view imagery of the area.

Vance Boelter was arrested Sunday evening and charged with two counts of murder and two of attempted murder. He is accused of posing as a police officer and fatally shooting former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark.

The Associated Press

The man accused of killing a Minnesota lawmaker and wounding another went to the homes of two other lawmakers to carry out more carnage on the night of the shootings, a federal prosecutor said.

But one of the other lawmakers was not home and the suspect left the other house after police arrived, acting U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson said at a press conference Monday.

The suspect, Vance Boelter, surrendered to police Sunday after they found him in the woods near his home following a massive manhunt that began early Saturday near Minneapolis. He is accused of posing as a police officer and fatally shooting former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in their home early Saturday in the northern Minneapolis suburbs. 

Authorities say he also shot Senator John Hoffman, a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette. They were injured at their residence about 15 kilometres away.

The 57-year-old Boelter was charged with federal murder, stalking offences. He already faces state charges, including murder and attempted murder.

“Boelter planned his attack carefully” by researching his intended victims and their families and conducting surveillance of their homes and taking notes, Thompson said. Though the targets were Democrats and elected officials, Thompson said it was too soon to speculate on any sort of political ideology that could explain his motives.

Thompson said it was too early to say if the Justice Department would seek the death penalty but noted that that was among the options available to the government based on the charges. The counts charged in the criminal complaint could be amended by prosecutors as they pursue a grand jury indictment as a prerequisite for bringing the case to trial.

Authorities declined to name the two other elected officials whom Boelter allegedly stalked but who escaped harm. But it was clear the shootings were politically motivated, they said.

“This was a targeted attack against individuals who answered the call to public service,” said Alvin Winston, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Minneapolis field office. The resulting search, he said, was the largest manhunt in the history of the state.

Boelter's wife consented to a search of her phone by law enforcement, according to an FBI affidavit that cites from a text from Boelter to a family group chat: “Dad went to war last night ... I don't wanna say more because I don't wanna implicate anybody.”

Minnesota shooting suspect was deeply religious and conservative, friends say

Earlier, the search for Boelter was the “largest manhunt in the state's history,” Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said. It began when Brooklyn Park officers went to check on Hortman's home and saw her husband gunned down before the shooter fled.

Authorities on Sunday located a vehicle Boelter was using abandoned in rural Sibley County, where he lived, and a police officer reported that he believed he saw Boelter running into the woods, Bruley said. Police set up a large perimeter and called in 20 different tactical teams, divvying up the area and searching for him.

During the search, police said they confirmed someone was in the woods and searched for hours, using a helicopter and officers on foot, until they found Boelter. He gave himself up to police, crawling out to officers in the woods before he was handcuffed and taken into custody in a field, authorities said.

Boelter gave up after being surrounded by police on the ground and in the air, said Drew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.

Jail records show Boelter was booked into the Hennepin County Jail early Monday and included two mug shots of Boelter wearing an orange prison shirt.

Drew Evans, superintendent of the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said the violence likely would've continued had Brooklyn Park offices not checked on Hortman's home, causing Boelter to flee.

The Hoffmans were attacked first at their home in Champlin early Saturday. A criminal complaint unsealed after Boelter's arrest indicated their adult daughter called 911 to say a masked person had come to the door and shot her parents.

After police in nearby Brooklyn Park learned that a lawmaker had been shot, they sent patrol officers to check on the Hortmans' home.

Brooklyn Park police officers arrived just in time to see Boelter shoot Mark Hortman through the open door of the home and exchanged gunfire with Boelter, who fled into the home before escaping, the complaint said. Melissa Hortman was found dead inside, according to the document.

Authorities said Boelter posed as a police officer, even allegedly altering a vehicle to make it look like a police car.

A Minnesota lawmaker said that Hortman's dog had to be euthanized after being shot in the attack.

“Her children had to put down him after learning their parents had been murdered, ” Representative Erin Koegel posted on the social-media platform X. “Gilbert wasn't going to survive. Melissa loved that dog. She trained him as a service dog. He flunked out of school and she was so happy he failed so he could stay!”

Authorities did not give a motive for the shootings as they announced Boelter's arrest.

A list of about 70 names was found in writings recovered from the fake police vehicle that was left at the crime scene, said two law enforcement officials who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of the ongoing investigation. The writings and list of names included prominent state and federal lawmakers and community leaders, along with abortion rights advocates and information about health care facilities, according to the officials.

A Minnesota official told AP lawmakers who had been outspoken in favour of abortion rights were on the list. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was continuing.

Boelter is a former political appointee who served on the same state work force development board as Hoffman, records show, though it was not clear if or how well they knew each other.

Just hours after the shootings, Boelter texted friends to apologize for his actions, though he didn't say what he had done.

“I'm going to be gone for a while. May be dead shortly, so I just want to let you know I love you guys both and I wish it hadn't gone this way,” he wrote in messages viewed by AP.

A dangerous new nuclear arms race is emerging at the same time as arms control is severely weakened, according to the latest SIPRI assessment. AI and space technologies are also radically redefining nuclear capabilities.

There are nine nuclear-armed states in the world and nearly all of them continued with intensive nuclear modernization programs in 2024, upgrading existing weapons and adding newer versions.

That is one of the key findings of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's (SIPRI) Yearbook 2025, an annual assessment of the state of armaments, disarmament and international security.

In the mid-1980s, nuclear warheads, bombs and shells worldwide numbered around 64,000. Today, the figure stands at an estimated 12,241. That trend now looks set to be reversed, according to the latest assessment.

""The most worrying single thing that we see in the nuclear arsenals at the moment is that the long-term reduction in the numbers of nuclear warheads is coming to an end,"" SIPRI Director Dan Smith told DW.

Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the end of the Cold War, the dismantling of retired warheads — warheads removed from the nuclear stockpile — has outpaced the deployment of new ones.

While it is common practice for nuclear-armed states to modernize and upgrade their nuclear capabilities, Smith says there has been an intensification of this process since late in former US President Barack Obama's final term, with more investment in new generations of missiles and carriers.

""Already for several years before then, the security horizon worldwide had been darkening and the nuclear-armed states were already starting to introduce these processes of what we would call this 'intense' process of modernization, so not just a little bit of tinkering, but some real steep changes,"" Smith said. 

SIPRI researchers conclude that of the world's estimated 12,241 nuclear warheads in January 2025, about 9,614 were in military stockpiles: either placed on missiles or located on bases with operational forces, or in central storage that could potentially be deployed. 

An estimated 3,912 of those warheads were deployed with missiles and aircraft, with around 2,100 of those kept in a state of high operational alert on ballistic missiles. Nearly all of those belonged to Russia or the US, but China may also now keep some warheads on missiles, according to the assessment.

Among the world's nuclear-armed states — the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel — Russia and the US possess 90% of all nuclear weapons.

SIPRI analysts now warn that more and more states are considering developing or hosting nuclear weapons, with revitalized national debates about nuclear status and strategy. 

This includes new nuclear sharing arrangements: Russia claims to have deployed nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory, while several European NATO member states have signaled willingness to host US nuclear weapons.

In 2007, Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered a speech at the Munich Security Conference in which he railed against the US-dominated world order, NATO's eastward expansion and disarmament. 

But just two years later in 2009, Obama announced the goal of total nuclear disarmament in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic. ""The existence of thousands of nuclear weapons is the most dangerous legacy of the Cold War,"" he said. 

He went on to say that the US would ""take concrete steps towards a world without nuclear weapons"" and negotiate a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) with Russia. That treaty was signed, and came into force in 2011.

But in the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the Biden administration published its 2022 Nuclear Posture Review which identified the modernization of the US nuclear arsenal as a top priority.

In February 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a bill halting Russia's participation in the New START treaty.

""The tide of insecurity has been building slowly since 2007-08, through 2014, onto this moment when the waves start crashing down in February 2022,"" Smith said. ""I think that is when maybe many ordinary citizens woke up to this deterioration which was more than a decade old by that time.""

The bottom line is: the world's nuclear arsenals are being enlarged and upgraded. SIPRI estimates that China now has at least 600 nuclear warheads and that its nuclear arsenal is growing faster than any other country's. 

India is also believed to have slightly expanded its nuclear arsenal in 2024, while Pakistan continued to develop new delivery systems and accumulate fissile material — a key component of nuclear weapons. 

Israel, which on June 13 launched strikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, killing military leaders and nuclear scientists, maintains a policy of deliberate ambiguity over its own nuclear capabilities. However, it is believed to be in the process of modernizing its own nuclear arsenal, as well as upgrading a plutonium production reactor site in the Negev desert.

In his introduction to the SIPRI Yearbook 2025, Smith warns of the prospect of a new nuclear arms race that carries ""much more risk and uncertainty"" than during the Cold War era — largely due to the rise of artificial intelligence and new technologies in the fields of cyber capabilities and space assets.  

""The coming nuclear arms race is going to be as much about AI, cyberspace and outer space as it is about missiles in bunkers or on submarines or bombs on aircrafts. It's going to be as much about the software as about the hardware,"" Smith said. 

This complicates the question of how to control and monitor nuclear weapons and stockpiles when the competition between nuclear-armed states used to be more or less about numbers. 

There are long-term discussions about AI in relation to what are commonly called ""killer robots"" (Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems), and the use of automated and semi-automated drones since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine — but not so much in relation to nuclear weapons.

Artificial intelligence allows for a large amount of information to be processed extremely quickly and in theory this should help decision makers to react more quickly. However, if something goes wrong within the software or a system totally reliant on LLMs, machine learning and AI, a small technical glitch could potentially lead to a nuclear strike.

""I think there has to be a red line that probably all political leaders and military leaders will also agree with, that the decision on nuclear launch cannot be made by artificial intelligence,"" Smith said, pointing to the example of Soviet Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Petrov.

In 1983, Petrov was on duty at the Soviet nuclear early-warning system command center 62 miles south of Moscow when the system reported the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile from the US, with four more behind it.

Luckily, Petrov suspected the warning was a false alarm and waited instead of relaying the information immediately up the chain of command — a decision which likely prevented a retaliatory nuclear strike, and in the worst-case scenario, full-scale nuclear war. 

""I suppose the big question is that in a world of artificial intelligence, who plays the part of Lieutenant Colonel Petrov?"" Smith asked.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

The UN disaster relief agency said it was having to dial back aid plans as the humanitarian sector faced ""the deepest funding cuts ever."" It comes after the Trump administration said it would reduce funding to the UN.

The United Nations (UN) Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Monday it was forced to drastically scale back aid plans due to ""brutal funding cuts.""

OCHA is seeking $29 billion (€25.7 billion) in funding in a drastic revision of their budgetary priorities.

In December the UN had said it needed $44 billion to help in over 70 countries, providing assistance to ""180 million people, including refugees"" under the Global Humanitarian Overview 2025 (GHO). 

The OCHA said that as the year's halfway mark approached, only $5.6 billion — less than 13% — had been received.

""We have been forced into a triage of human survival,"" said Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief, Tom Fletcher.

In a statement OCHA said it was presenting ""the global 'hyper-prioritized' appeal aiming to help 114 million people facing life-threatening needs across the world.""

Under the new guidelines, OCHA aid will be directed so that it can ""reach the people and places facing the most urgent needs.""

Support will be directed ""on the planning already done for the 2025... This will ensure that limited resources are directed where they can do the most good — as quickly as possible,"" the OCHA said.

Fletcher said that ""brutal funding cuts leave us with brutal choices.""

""All we ask is 1% of what you chose to spend last year on war. But this isn't just an appeal for money — it's a call for global responsibility, for human solidarity, for a commitment to end the suffering.""

The United States is the largest contributor to UN funding, but in February the Trump administration announced that it was cutting funding to various UN agencies, including those responsible for administering aid and peacekeeping.

Other donor countries have also cut back contributions amid an atmosphere of global economic uncertainty.

Iran's state broadcaster was reportedly attacked after Israel had previously issued an evacuation warning for residents in northern Tehran, where the broadcaster is located. More on DW. 

Below is a roundup of the latest developments on the Israel-Iran conflict and the wider crisis in the Middle East on Monday, June 16, 2025:

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said Monday that Germany, France and the United Kingdom are keen to resume nuclear talks with Iran.

The three countries, known as the ""E3,"" have held four meetings with Iranian delegations in recent months on Iran's nuclear program. The United States also held parallel negotiations.

Iran insists that its nuclear program is for civilian purposes. However, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says Iran is enriching uranium far beyond what is needed for civilian use.

On June 12, the IAEA adopted a resolution condemning Iran's ""non-compliance"" with its nuclear obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Iran faces the possibility of sanctions.

""We will once again make our clear position explicit there that we can only achieve a contractual settlement and avoid further military conflicts if Iran is fully prepared to refrain from using nuclear technology for military purposes,"" Wadephul said during a stopover in Cyprus after a multi-day visit to the Middle East.

After Israel's attack on Iran on Friday, which included nuclear sites, Tehran canceled a planned continuation of talks.

US President Donald Trump addressed the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran on the sidelines of the G7 summit.

Trump said Iran wants to talk about deescalation and should negotiate with Israel ""before it's too late."" 

""I'd say Iran is not winning this war, and they should talk, and they should talk immediately,""  Trump told reporters at the start of a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.

Iran's state broadcaster in Tehran was hit by an Israeli strike Monday evening.  

Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a statement after the strike that ""the propaganda and incitement broadcasting authority of the Iranian regime was attacked"" by Israeli forces.""

A video clip from the IRIB broadcaster showed a live broadcast interrupted by loud explosions. The broadcast resumed after a short pause. 

There was no immediate information provided about casualties or damage. 

Earlier Monday, Katz had issued a cryptic statement that Iran's state television and radio were ""about to disappear."" 

He made the statement after an evacuation warning was issued for a district in northern Tehran where the broadcaster is based.

""We don't have access to a shelter. There are no shelters in the whole city. I don't think there are any places people can go to in an emergency,"" one Tehran resident said.

Mehdi Chamran, spokesperson for Tehran's City Council, suggested that residents should also consider sheltering in underground parking garages. Iranian officials say schools and mosques are being used as makeshift shelters.

Read the full story here. 

Israel's military urged residents of a district in northern Tehran to evacuate ""immediately"" on Monday evening, saying it intended to carry out airstrikes. 

""In the coming hours, the (Israeli military) will operate in the area, as it has in recent days throughout Tehran, to strike military infrastructure of the Iranian regime,"" the Israel Defense Forces said in a post on X in Persian.

The post showed a part of Tehran's District 3 on a map.  The area is known as an upmarket part of Tehran home to at least four hospitals and medical centers, a major police building and state broadcaster IRIB.

Shortly thereafter, Iran's Revolutionary Guards said residents of Tel Aviv should evacuate, Iranian state media reported. 

At least 20 Palestinians were killed in shootings at food distribution centers in southern Gaza, the Health Ministry reported on Monday.

According to the Health Ministry, the people killed were trying to reach the US- and Israel-supported Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).

Gaza's civil defense agency reports that dozens of Palestinians have been killed while trying to reach aid distribution points operated by GHF. The United Nations does not work with the foundation, which it considers ineffective and aimed at catering to Israeli military objectives.

There have been near-daily reports of shootings as Palestinians move through Israeli-controlled areas toward GHF food aid centers in Gaza.

There was no immediate comment from Israel on Monday's incident. In previous incidents, the Israeli military has said it has fired warning shots at people approaching their positions.

Israel restricts media access to the Gaza strip, meaning that news agencies are unable to independently verify death tolls.

The UN's OCHA humanitarian agency has warned that Gaza's entire population of 2 million is at risk of famine. Israel is under international pressure to allow more aid to reach Gazans.

Since Israel resumed strikes on Gaza in March, more than 5,000 people have been reported killed. Israel also cut off aid entering Gaza for two months, saying supplies were aiding Hamas militants who continue to control the enclave.

More than 55,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the October 7 Hamas terror attacks that preceded the war with Israel.

Transport Minister Miri Regev said Israel planned to gradually secure the return of the about 100,000 citizens who are stuck abroad following the closure of the country's airspace.

Regev said leaving Israel would not be possible for nationals who live within the country for the time being.

Only tourists, diplomats and participants of various exchange programs will be allowed to depart to their home countries.

Iran has accused Israel of targeting a hospital, labeling it a ""war crime.""

""Farabi Hospital in the city of Kermanshah in western Iran was targeted by the Israeli regime's aggressive attacks,"" an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said.

Footage shared by Iranian media showed damage to the intensive care unit and blood-stained beds.

According to previous Iranian media reports, a workshop near the hospital was the target of the Israeli attack.

An Israeli army spokesman said the reports are under investigation.

The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN's nuclear watchdog, said there was ""no indication"" of a physical attack on an underground section of the Natanz uranium enrichment site in Iran.

IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said ""no additional damage"" had been recorded at the Natanz plant since Friday, while radioactivity levels outside it ""remained unchanged and at normal levels, indicating no external radiological impact.""

Israel targeted the Natanz facility with airstrikes, which resulted in its above-ground part being destroyed.

The Israeli army says it has gained control of the airspace over Iran's capital, Tehran.

""We can now say that we have achieved full air superiority in the skies over Tehran,"" military spokesperson Effie Defrin told a press conference.

Defrin said more than 50 fighter jets and precision missiles had struck over 120 launch pads of the ballistic missiles that had been fired in Israel's direction since Friday. He also said Israel has destroyed a third of Iran's launch pads.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz somewhat backtracked on his previous statement on Monday after he said Tehran ""will burn.""

In a post on his X account, Katz said that the Israeli military ""does not have any intention of physically hurting"" the people of Tehran.

""The residents of Tehran will have to pay the dictatorship's price and evacuate their homes in areas in which there will be a need to attack the regime's targets and security infrastructure"" in Iran's capital city, Katz said.

Poland is set to evacuate its citizens from Israel due to the conflict between Israel and Iran.

The country's Deputy Foreign Minister, Henryka Moscicka-Dendys, told reporters that the plan should take place within the next ""few dozen hours,"" with some 200 Polish nationals in Israel as tourists being evacuated through Amman.

This comes as the Czech Republic has already begun evacuating its citizens, with a convoy of Czech nationals leaving Tel Aviv for the Israeli border with an unnamed country for security reasons.

The three people who had previously been unaccounted for after an Iranian missile hit a building in the Israeli city of Haifa were pronounced dead by Israeli authorities. 

Reports in Israel say that contact with the three had been lost shortly after the missile's impact, with the fires preventing rescue services from reaching them in time.

This brings the casualty tally from the overnight Iranian missile attack in Israel to eight, with a total of 24 people killed since Friday.

The United States ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, said the US embassy's Tel Aviv branch had suffered ""minor damage"" as a result of an Iranian missile hitting Tel Aviv.

In a post on his X account, Huckabee said no US personnel were injured, also adding that the embassy and consulate in Israel will remain closed.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz has threatened Iran following the overnight Iranian missile attacks on Israel, which claimed the lives of five people.

In a post on his X account, Katz labeled the Iranian regime as a ""braggy dictator"" and a ""cowardly murderer,"" blaming Iran for deliberately targeting Israeli civilians.

""The residents of Tehran will pay the price, and soon,"" Katz said.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

			Fewer plenary sessions and more one-on-one meetings as world leaders adapt to return of unpredictable US president

The Canadian organisers of the G7 summit are taking no chances with Donald Trump this week, ditching the usual joint communiqué, padding the event with extra guests and reducing the amount of time when the world leaders sit around the same table.

It is the latest example of how global institutions are adapting to the return of an unpredictable and combative figure.

A diplomat in Washington DC, who has seen the schedule, said it included fewer plenary sessions of the full group and more one-on-one meetings

“There's a lot more of that than at other summits,” he said, “which would make sense if you are worried about one person causing trouble.”

The last time Mr Trump attended a G7 summit in Canada he stormed off early, ripping up a joint communiqué and leaving a trail of withering tweets behind him.

His blanket use of trade tariffs has already set nerves on edge, according to Matthew P Goodman, who was deputy to the US G7 Sherpa during the Obama administration, one of the figures doing the heavy lifting on negotiations.

“Those two issues hang over this upcoming summit, and are going to make it very challenging for the host, Mark Carney, to manage this,” he said.

Canadian diplomats were buoyed by their new prime minister's performance at the White House recently, when he avoided the sort or tongue lashing delivered to some other world leaders.

But organisers are leaving nothing to chance.

World leaders arrived on Sunday, flying into the international airport in Calgary before being taken by helicopter to the picturesque setting of Kananaskis, deep in the Canadian Rockies.

Organisers have padded the number of attendees by inviting leaders from India, Brazil, Ukraine, Australia and Saudi Arabia (although Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Salman reportedly will not be attending).

Cyril Ramaphosa, the South African president, is coming. He knows better than most how Mr Trump can undo the best laid plans after being ambushed last month in the Oval Office and accused of allowing a “white genocide” to unfold.

Mark Rutte, Nato secretary general, and António Guterres, the UN secretary general, are expected to attend.

There will also be a session on fentanyl smuggling, a cause particularly close to Mr Trump's heart.

The result is more breakaway bilateral meetings and fewer chances for Mr Trump to clog up the agenda.

Mr Goodman said: “Any host of these forums, if they're smart, will minimise the time around the table. You need a certain amount of that, but you want to allow for a lot of time on the margins for bilateral conversations and meetings”

In 2018, Justin Trudeau, Canada's prime minister at the time, presided over a G7 summit where Mr Trump abruptly pulled the US out of a previously agreed communiqué, before blasting his host as “dishonest and weak”.

He flew out of Canada early, apparently upset at the way Mr Trudeau had talked about Canadian tariffs on US exports.

It meant weeks of careful negotiations on easing trade tensions between the US and the European Union went up in smoke.

This time Mr Carney is preparing to issue a chairman's statement, according to The Toronto Star, avoiding the need for all the parties to agree on a joint position on awkward issues such as Ukraine or Israel's strikes on Iran.

“Our hope is that Mr Trump will join us in getting tougher on Russia and push through new sanctions,” said a senior diplomat from a G7 nation. “But he could equally say, no, let's give them another two weeks and then there is no chance for agreement.”

That makes it almost impossible to make progress on a joint text ahead of the summit, he added.

“The problem is that no one knows what's on Trump's mind,” he said. “Negotiating in the absence of that is not easy.”

The G7 summit is not the only high-stakes diplomacy this month. Nato leaders will assemble in The Hague next week, where defence spending will be top of the agenda.

Summit organisers there are preparing a one-page communiqué, The Telegraph revealed on Friday, designed to suit Mr Trump's attention span.

It will be almost entirely focused on one of the president's pet issues and the historic decision to more than double spending on defence by leaders to meet new capability targets for deterring a Russian invasion.

Mr Trump stormed out of his last Nato summit in the UK in 2019, abandoning plans for a press conference, after Mr Trudeau was caught on video apparently mocking the American president.

He was talking to Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, and Emmanuel Macron, the French president, discussing how Mr Trump liked to use photo opportunities to talk to the press.

			Federal agency urges medical directors to adopt principles of UK inquiry on treating gender dysphoria

The US government is pressuring states to halt funding for puberty blockers for children and follow the UK's Cass Review.

The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which provides health coverage to more than 160 million Americans, urged directors to adopt the findings of the report, which concluded children who think they are transgender should not be rushed into treatment they may regret.

In a letter sent to medical directors, seen by The Telegraph, the agency said that Britain has “diverged” from the United States and that the National Health Service's new approach is more effective.

Under Donald Trump, the US has quickly moved to ban all “destructive and life-altering procedures” associated with transitioning children.

Some 27 states have enacted laws that ban or restrict gender‑affirming care for minors. But puberty blockers are still available in many others.

“Several developed countries have recently diverged from the US in the way they treat gender dysphoria in children,” the letter reads. “The United Kingdom, Sweden, and Finland have recently issued restrictions on medical interventions for children, including the use of puberty blockers and hormone treatments.

“In particular, the Cass Review, an independent review of the evidence in the United Kingdom, noted that despite the considerable research in the field of gender dysphoria in children, ‘systematic evidence reviews demonstrated the poor quality of the published studies, meaning there is not a reliable evidence base upon which to make clinical decisions, or for children and their families to make informed choices.'”

Led by Dr Hilary Cass, the review was prompted by concerns about the high rate of young people being referred to the Tavistock gender clinic in London, which referred children as young as 10 for treatment with puberty blockers.

The final review, released in April 2024, concluded that too many children were being pushed towards medication with not enough mental health care.

Dr Cass recommended that the most important treatment for the majority of children should be talking therapies instead of irreversible medical treatments such as puberty blockers.

The letter went on to imply Britain is more effective in upholding the US government's commitment to “do no harm to America's children”.

“In recent years, medical interventions for gender dysphoria in children have proliferated,” the letter added.

“These interventions include surgical procedures that attempt to transform an individual's physical appearance to align with an identity that differs from his or her sex or that attempt, for purposes of treating gender dysphoria, to alter or remove an individual's sexual organs to minimise or destroy their natural biological functions.”

The letter also said medical interventions for gender dysphoria in children have “proliferated” in America and the Cass Review, which is rumoured to be backed by Mr Trump, could be used by states to reduce cases.

The move is a rare example of British policy influencing American direction under Mr Trump, who moved to ban puberty blockers almost immediately upon arriving in the White House. His administration has largely been critical of Britain's policies, repeatedly raising concerns about free speech.

In May, The Telegraph revealed the president had sent a delegation to meet British anti-abortion activists who say their freedom of expression has been threatened. A five-person team from the US State Department spent several days in the country and interviewed campaigners.

Trans activists have long fought to retain puberty blockers as a treatment option for children with gender dysphoria. Democratic attorneys general in Washington, Oregon and Minnesota sued the Trump administration over its plans to pull funding from institutions that provide gender-affirming care.

The US president has signed a number of executive orders targeting transgender people, claiming that it is a radical ideology driven to “deny the biological reality of sex”.

In January, he signed an order that aimed to restrict gender-affirming treatments for all young people below the age of 19 by asking federal agencies to stop endorsing interventions such as puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery for minors.

In July 2024, The Integrity Project at Yale Law School released a white paper which said the Cass Review had “serious flaws”.

It suggested that the review “levies unsupported assertions about gender identity, gender dysphoria, standard practices, and safety of gender-affirming medical treatments”.

The white paper concluded that the review “is not an authoritative guideline or standard of care, nor is it an accurate restatement of the available medical evidence on the treatment of gender dysphoria”.

The intense heat is compounded as swarms of flies and mosquitoes infest the tents due to an absence of sewage services.

Before the war began, summer in Gaza was a season of joy. Families thrived on creating small moments of happiness, even amid daily electricity cuts and the suffocating siege. Many loved to flock to the beach or spend time at the water chalets, hoping to find some refreshing relief from the scorching sun.

They would sit beneath wide umbrellas, spread blankets across the golden beach sand, and share ice cream along with slices of mango and watermelon, all while watching their children swim and splash in the sea. These simple gatherings brought beauty to the season and made it something to look forward to each year.

However, the latest Israeli war on Gaza has turned even these modest pleasures into distant memories. It has erased any sense of joy from summer, transforming it into another season of suffering — marked by starvation, displacement, thirst, and daily killings.

Thousands of Gazans are now living in tents after losing their homes or being forcibly displaced following the expansion of Israeli military operations on April 3, 2025. Many describe summer in these tents as “hell,” as they lack even the simplest means to cope with the intense heat amid a complete electricity blackout.

Most of the tents are made of nylon, offering no protection from the blazing sun. Instead, they trap heat and turn into unbearable ovens. Areej Alkataib, 40, shared that the intense heat has turned her tent into a suffocating grave. “I try to spray water over the nylon from time to time to reduce the heat, but all my efforts are in vain. I always seek refuge outside despite the harsh conditions, as I cannot endure the heat inside,” she told me.

The intense heat inside the tents is only part of the crisis, as swarms of flies and mosquitoes infest these tents as a result of the complete absence of sewage services and the decomposition of accumulated waste, making daily life unbearable. Alkataib described how the insects constantly bother her and bite her children, often keeping them from sleeping. She added that the flies spoil both the food and water. “It's hard to store anything — I always find insects in the food, no matter how tightly I try to cover it,” she said.

The overcrowded nature of the camps, deprived of even the most basic necessities of life, has intensified the suffering of Gazans during the summer. Most tents are set up with no space between them, leaving people, especially women, with no sense of privacy or personal freedom.

Alkataib shared that she has to keep her hijab on most of the time, which makes her feel hot and uncomfortable — especially when she lights a fire to cook for the children. “The smoke mixed with ash fills the air, and the scorching sun presses down on me,” she said. “Sometimes I feel like I can't breathe. The heat is overwhelming, and there's no place to cool down or even catch a breeze.”

Adding to this suffering is the lack of clean water — especially after the Israeli occupation cut off the supply and destroyed the infrastructure used to pump water from wells. Many people are forced to walk long distances and wait for hours under the scorching sun to access water for drinking and daily use. The water they collect often comes from unreliable sources and is stored in unsanitary containers, which leads to the spread of various illnesses, including diarrhea and hepatitis.

The severe water shortage has drastically limited people's ability to bathe, stay cool, or stay hydrated amid the relentless heat, forcing them to ration every drop carefully. Meanwhile, hygiene supplies — including soap and shampoo — have become increasingly scarce and prohibitively expensive due to the Israeli blockade. A single bar of soap can cost up to $5, while a bottle of shampoo may reach $20. These high prices are particularly frustrating as most of these products are locally made with low-quality ingredients that often cause skin irritations, especially among children.

“The intense heat leaves us drenched in sweat, but with the severe water shortage, we're only able to bathe once a week — sometimes using seawater,” Alkataib said. “The poor-quality soap we have doesn't clean or deodorize the body properly. As a result, my children and I have developed skin allergies and inflammations.”

Amid the struggle for water and the intense heat, people in Gaza long for anything cold that might ease their suffering and offer a moment of relief. Treats like ice cream, juice, fruits, or even a glass of iced water have become luxuries we can no longer afford — especially when we can't even find enough water to quench our thirst or basic food to soothe our hungry stomachs.

 The sight of people — including women and children — standing in long lines under the blazing sun, clutching their bowls as they wait for a small portion of food from the few remaining charity kitchens in Gaza, is heart-breaking. Some are pushed and kicked as they struggle to stay on their feet amid the chaos, which, for a moment, resembles a desperate battle for survival.

People in Gaza are exhausted from living this humiliating life that has stripped us of dignity and turned each season into a new chapter of relentless suffering that we cannot endure or cope with. What we ask for is not too much — only the right to live in peace, to feel safe, to provide for our children, and to experience life's simplest joys. These are basic human needs that have been stolen from us. This cruelty must end.

The government is using “transparent delay tactics” to continue detaining Khalil, his legal team said.

A federal judge has refused to order pro-Palestine activist Mahmoud Khalil's release after a last-minute response from Trump administration officials arguing for his continued imprisonment based on “false and pretextual allegations,” the activists' legal team has said.

U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz in New Jersey sided with the government's argument that it can continue holding Khalil based on a charge that Khalil committed fraud when he applied for his green card. The same judge, however, in an order last week had acknowledged that it would be a stretch for the government to apply this charge to his detainment.

Khalil and his legal team had been hoping that the activist would be released on Friday after Farbiarz had said that the government couldn't hold him on their primary charge.

Last week, Farbiarz ruled that the government cannot hold Khalil based on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's claims that Khalil's continued presence in the U.S. threatens U.S. foreign policy interests. Farbiarz gave the government until Friday to appeal, seemingly nudging the government to make the argument that it was detaining Khalil based on his green card application. 

The government failed to appeal on time, and Khalil's legal team submitted a letter asking for his immediate release. The judge then gave the government several hours to respond to that letter, when the government said that their interpretation of the ruling was that Farbiarz had, in fact, only narrowly ruled that Khalil couldn't be held on foreign policy grounds.

Farbiarz said that interpretation is correct, and Khalil continues to be imprisoned, missing his first Father's Day with his wife and newborn baby.

Khalil's lawyers have slammed the decision, saying that his detention is “arbitrary” and that the green card application allegations are “false and pretextual,” meaning that they were effectively put forth to justify Khalil's detainment separately from the government's primary charges against him. 

Indeed, when the administration was initially pressed for their reasoning for seeking Khalil's detention and deportation in April, the administration only provided a two-page memo from Rubio citing his beliefs — and admitting that Khalil's participation in Columbia University student protests were “otherwise lawful.”

“Mahmoud Khalil was detained in retaliation for his advocacy for Palestinian rights. The government is now using cruel, transparent delay tactics to keep him away from his wife and newborn son ahead of their first Father's Day as a family,” said Amy Greer, one of Khalil's lawyers, in a statement. 

“Instead of celebrating together, he is languishing in ICE detention as punishment for his advocacy on behalf of his fellow Palestinians. It is unjust, it is shocking, and it is disgraceful,” Greer said.

The ACLU, which is part of the team representing Khalil, said the ruling makes it clear that the Trump administration is “doing everything in their power to punish Mahmoud for his advocacy for Palestinian rights.” 

The ACLU shared a letter that Khalil wrote to his son, Deen, ahead of Mother's Day, when the baby was two weeks old. The letter shows the pain that Khalil has experienced by being separated from his family and missing the birth of his son, the group said, after Farbiarz had concluded in his initial ruling last week that Khalil would suffer irreparable harm by continuing to be detained.

“Deen, it was not a gap in the law that made me a political prisoner in Louisiana. It was my firm belief that our people deserve to be free, that their lives are worth more than the televised massacre we are witnessing in Gaza, and that the displacement that began in 1948 and culminated in the current genocide must finally end,” Khalil wrote. 

“Deen, my love for you is deeper than anything I have ever known,” Khalil went on. “Loving you is not separate from the struggle for liberation. It is liberation itself.”

 Ali Vaez

On June 13, Israel initiated a series of airstrikes and covert operations against Iranian nuclear sites and military officials. Dubbed Operation Rising Lion, this sophisticated and multilayered campaign followed days of speculation about an impending assault. So far, the attacks have damaged Iran's Natanz and Isfahan nuclear facilities and killed a number of Iranian scientists. They have also claimed the lives of scores of civilians and injured dozens more, razed apartment buildings, and blown up parts of the country's energy infrastructure. Israelis, meanwhile, have found themselves rushing to shelters as their own cities come under attack.

Right now, there is no indication that the fighting will stop. Both Iran and Israel have signaled that they are willing to keep striking each other. Israel's defense minister even promised that “Tehran will burn” if the attacks don't end. The United States, meanwhile, has done little to stop the bloodshed. Instead, U.S. President Donald Trump has sent mixed signals about whether he wants the fighting to cease. His administration has positioned military assets in the area, and according to multiple news reports, U.S. forces are helping Israel shoot down Iranian drones and missiles.

Despite his equivocations, however, Trump has said he still wants to reach a nuclear deal with Iran, and Tehran has left the door open to talks—provided that Israel lets up. The U.S. administration, then, may still have space to forge an agreement.

If Trump wants to avoid a U.S. war with Iran, he should seize it. So far, Israel has inflicted significant but not total damage on Iran's nuclear program. Even if the fighting drags on, it is unlikely to succeed at wiping out all of it. Elements of Iran's nuclear program are deeply buried underground, including at the Fordow enrichment site, and the country's leadership may now have more of an incentive than ever to build the ultimate deterrent. That means if the fighting stops without a deal, Tehran could well make a run for a nuclear weapon that only heavy bunker-busting American bombs can seriously delay, at least in the near term. Even then, to truly assure that the threat has been curtailed, the United States would need either a presence on the ground or sustained rounds of military strikes carried out with exhaustive knowledge of Iran's nuclear operations.

A diplomatic settlement represents the best and most sustainable way for Trump to avoid both a nuclear Iran and a protracted military entanglement. In fact, it may be the only way to avert an unacceptable outcome.

Since returning to office in January 2025, Trump had suggested that he wanted to reach an agreement with Iran on its nuclear program. Israel has made clear its preference for a military solution, however, unless Iran completely capitulates over the program. Israel also made clear that it believed that now was the time to act. Tehran's defensive capabilities did not recover after a series of pinpoint strikes that Israel carried out last October. Iran's proxies, including Hezbollah, are still on their knees after months of Israeli attacks. The Israeli government thus saw a golden opportunity to debilitate its nemesis.

Israel's current campaign against Iran is far broader than its previous ones. Approximately 200 Israeli aircraft targeted around 100 sites, including nuclear facilities and military bases, in the initial wave of strikes last week. Covert operations by the Mossad targeted Iranian leaders, resulting in the deaths of key figures in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and prominent nuclear scientists. As the exchanges between the two countries have grown more severe, and Iran has retaliated with drones and missiles, both sides have broadened their targets.

Given the breadth of Israel's assault, Iranian leaders likely concluded that Israel wants to wipe out not just their nuclear program but also their regime itself. Although Iran lacks the capabilities of its enemy—its intelligence is no match for Israel's, and its airpower is nonexistent—Tehran felt it had no choice but to retaliate as forcefully as possible. So far, at least in the opening days, this has largely been confined to a bilateral conflict. But Iran may opt to externalize its costs—hitting U.S. bases in the region, striking energy infrastructure in the Gulf, and targeting shipping lanes in the Strait of Hormuz, for example—which would plunge the region into turmoil. By doing so, Iranian officials might hope they can get Washington to lean on Israel to stop.



But if the war expands, Iran and the United States might find themselves fighting directly, especially if American assets and interests come under fire. In repeated statements, U.S. officials have warned Tehran against such attacks, lest American forces, in the words of Trump, “come down on you at levels never seen before.” Should Iranian attacks or attacks by Iran's nonstate partners lead to American casualties, the pressure on the U.S. president to act decisively and enter the war would increase dramatically.

Even if the United States avoids fighting in this conflict, without a deal, it risks getting pulled into a future one. Israeli military operations over the past year have logged successes against Hezbollah and against Iran itself, degrading many of its enemies' air defenses. Still, most estimates suggest that Israel could set Iran's nuclear program back by only a few months, or a year at best. It would take intense American military might to destroy much of Tehran's capacity to build a nuclear weapon. And depending on how Iran has structured its program, stopping a bomb may require no less than a toppling of the Islamic Republic. That is why Israeli officials are more explicitly sounding the call for regime change. Yet they have paid little heed to what would actually replace the current system. In the absence of a viable, united, and organized alternative inside or outside Iran, the fall of the Islamic Republic might send the country into a period of civil strife—or lead to a military dictatorship determined to obtain nuclear deterrence.

For an American president who has sought to position himself as a peacemaker rather than a belligerent, the present situation ought to be ringing loud alarm bells. Many of Trump's constituents oppose renewed U.S. military involvement in the Middle East. A massive war would also cause oil prices to spike, further burdening American consumers struggling with inflation. In fact, oil prices are already rising. Trump will thus benefit if the fighting stops, and suffer if it expands.

Right now, Trump seems to hope that the combination of growing economic and military harm to Iran will force the government into agreeing to dismantle its nuclear program. But an all-or-nothing offer from the United States is unlikely to resonate with a regime that has rejected such terms for more than two decades—including in five rounds of negotiations with Trump's administration. The only thing Iranian leaders view as more perilous for their self-preservation than the suffering wreaked by Israeli bombs is surrendering to American terms. Instead, the current onslaught will probably prompt Iran to keep responding with aggression until it can have at least a semblance of an acceptable off-ramp.

To avoid the worst-case scenarios, Trump will therefore need to take a different approach. He must first persuade Iran that he is not just a front for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by pressing Israel to stop fighting. To do so, he could threaten to suspend weapons aid to Israel. This is the most crucial source of leverage that Washington has; it would be extremely difficult for Israel to carry out military campaigns without it. Previous U.S. presidents, including Joe Biden, have been reluctant to use it. (Biden refused to wield such threats to pressure Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza.) But now, American lives and Trump's legacy may be at stake. The president might diverge from his predecessor if he decides that U.S. interests require containing rather than fueling the deepening crisis.

Trump will also need to cajole Iran. Outgunned by Israel and, at least for now, with degraded nuclear leverage, Tehran is probably open to returning to the table to save its neck. More important, it needs to save face.The White House should warn Tehran that further escalation could result in American casualties and suck the United States into the conflict. Yet it should also offer Iran a reasonable nuclear deal that includes significant and sustainable sanctions relief. Trump could, for example, promise to roll back nuclear-related U.S. sanctions and end the primary U.S. trade embargo if Iran wraps its uranium enrichment program into a multinational consortium with Saudi Arabia for that purpose—as Tehran expressed an openness to doing before Israel's attacks. Such a consortium would provide fuel for nuclear reactors across the region while depriving Iran of the fissile material it could use for a weapon.

There is precedent for this kind of American pressure. In 1982, U.S. President Ronald Reagan twisted Israel's arm to end its bombing of Beirut. In 1988, he intervened in the Iran-Iraq War, playing an essential role in persuading Tehran to accept a cease-fire. Such a course will not be easy for Trump. It would require the president to commit to difficult diplomacy while staring down fierce opposition in Washington from politicians and interest groups who see Israel's campaign as an overdue comeuppance for one of the United States' most bitter adversaries.

But if Trump is committed to a nuclear-free Iran, his best bet is to get the Iranians and Israelis to stop the war and bring Tehran back to the negotiating table. Without a deal, Iran's frightened government seems more likely than not to sprint for nuclear weapons as conditions allow. Then Trump would have to either accept a nuclear Iran or join another Israeli assault on the country, risking precisely the kind of catastrophic Middle East entanglement he promised to avoid.

 Elizabeth N. Saunders

Only a few months into U.S. President Donald Trump's second term, the United States looks dramatically and perhaps irreversibly different at home and on the world stage. Trump's rampage through the federal government has gutted U.S. state capacity. His undermining of basic constitutional rights at home and his hostility to immigration have made the United States inhospitable to visitors who enrich the country and contribute to its productivity and innovation. And his disregard for norms and laws has weakened American credibility and made the United States an unreliable international partner—and, even among some allies, a menace to be feared.

The damage done by Trump will extend well beyond his second term. The best way to make sense of this toll is to look first not at Trump's policies but at what empowered him to make them. Trump governs today in the wake of the near-complete dismantling of checks and balances on the executive branch, at least in the foreign policy and national security realm. Since the 9/11 attacks, Congress has granted the presidency more and more power over foreign affairs and declined to take any of it back, and the Supreme Court has been reluctant to provide any meaningful restraints. Trump inherited an ever-expanding national security apparatus that operates with little oversight. His attacks on institutions during his first term sought to broaden the president's remit even further, and in the years since, Congress and the Supreme Court have blocked efforts to check the presidency. The result is that Trump can now largely do whatever he wants when it comes to anything even glancingly related to foreign policy or national security: shipping noncitizens to prison camps in El Salvador, imposing sweeping tariffs on countries around the world, gutting congressionally mandated foreign aid commitments, bullying allies, courting autocrats, accepting lavish gifts from monarchies, deploying the military on the streets of American cities, and even marshaling the armed forces in a celebratory parade on his birthday.

Political scientists who study autocracies recognize this for what it is: a dictator's foreign policy. Washington has never been a paragon of virtue in its dealings abroad, but the extraordinary nature of Trump's second term makes clear that presidents before him were indeed more constrained in their foreign policy. Unrestrained, the president is functionally equivalent to a dictator in the realm of national security—one who can translate any impulse into policy on a whim.

Although Trump did not put into motion the process that has unfettered the presidency in this way, he is now its greatest beneficiary. Congress and the Supreme Court allowed the executive to grow immensely powerful in previous administrations, but certain guardrails still held. Congress' failure to hold Trump accountable for the January 6 insurrection and the Supreme Court's decision to grant presidents sweeping immunity in 2024 destroyed the remaining constraints. The American presidency has long been imperial. But not until Trump's second term has a president truly tried to act as an emperor.

The full scope of the destruction the second Trump administration has wreaked on the machinery of U.S. foreign policy and national security is hard to capture. But it is worth cataloging three broad categories of damage that add up to one conclusion: Trump has decimated U.S. diplomacy.

Trump has laid waste to U.S. state capacity. Through the frenetic activity of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, Trump has gutted the federal workforce. The president and DOGE have encouraged firings and layoffs, the bullying of remaining employees, and, in the case of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the dismantling of entire agencies. Some of these actions were unlawful, but by the time the courts could intervene, many were irreversible. The political scientist Daniel Drezner has called the result “the shallow state.” These actions have severely hollowed out the U.S. foreign policy and national security apparatus without making a dent in the federal budget, suggesting that the Trump administration had no clear rationale for these moves besides a disdain for expertise, a quest for retribution, and a desire to remove obstacles to corruption.

After the frustrations of his first term, when many in his inner circle restrained his worst impulses, Trump put unqualified loyalists in top positions—including Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense and Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence—and strong-armed them through the Senate. Some observers breathed a brief sigh of relief when Trump announced Senator Marco Rubio, previously known for his traditionally conservative foreign policy views, as his nominee for secretary of state. But Rubio quickly emerged as a crucial Trump enforcer, abetting DOGE's rapid dismantling of USAID.



Trump has also eroded trust in and goodwill toward the United States—and he has done so on live television. The most egregious examples came when he used Oval Office press availabilities to bully the visiting leaders of friendly countries—first, Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's wartime president, and later, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.

Another blow to U.S. diplomacy—also televised—came on April 2, when Trump dropped a tariff bomb on the global economy. Multiple courts have since declared many of his tariffs illegal, suggesting that perhaps there are some remaining checks on presidential foreign policy. But Trump has other routes through which he can pursue tariffs and circumvent the courts. More important, the damage to American credibility has already been done. Trump has rattled existing agreements and long-standing trading relationships, along with more recent trading partnerships that took decades to develop. Given the subsequent gyrations in the administration's tariff policy—which, as of this writing, has still left large tariff hikes on most countries—world leaders may very well be reluctant to enter into serious trade negotiations with the United States.

Trump also weakened foreign policy institutions in his first term: taking a hostile stance toward the State Department, which suffered significant workforce attrition; consistently undermining the intelligence agencies; and politicizing the military. But even though the instruments of U.S. power—diplomatic, military, and otherwise—endured some damage back then, they remained functional. In some cases, the Biden administration was able to reinvigorate them, as it did with U.S. intelligence during the run-up to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

But there will be no easy way back from Trump's second-term assault. It is not only that the loss of personnel is far greater in scale and scope, with the excising of expertise in areas that largely escaped the first Trump administration, including in the scientific agencies crucial for American innovation. It is also that this time, the administration is carrying out an ideological vision, as detailed in the right-wing agenda known as Project 2025, to make federal workers suffer so much that they will not want to do their jobs anymore. Rebuilding the expertise and experience of the federal bureaucracy will be the work of a generation, not an administration. When, inevitably, crises come, the United States may no longer have the tools, proficiency, and overall capacity to address them.

What the first months of Trump's return to office have really exposed is the accountability vacuum left by the near-complete destruction of checks and balances inside and outside the executive branch. In his second term, Trump has shown just how much power the presidency can still accrue and what happens when a leader with no interest in respecting the limits of this power takes the reins.

This crisis was decades in the making. As the political scientist James Goldgeier and I have written in Foreign Affairs, checks and balances on the president's role in foreign policy were already badly eroding before Trump won the 2016 election. Two developments stand out as the most relevant for the country's current predicament: the expansion of presidential power after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 and the lack of elite accountability for the twin failures of the Iraq war and the 2008 financial crisis. When Congress granted the president greater leeway for counterterrorism, it came with a self-reinforcing logic that ensured this power would be difficult to claw back. Fearing that it could be seen as getting in the way of fighting terrorism, Congress chose not to repeal these powers or exercise strong oversight of the government's prosecution of the “war on terror.” After President George W. Bush used these powers to invade Iraq in 2003, Congress remained reluctant to constrain him in wartime, even when the war was clearly failing. In the economic realm, the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program, a response to the financial crisis and the severe economic downturn that followed, contributed to the erosion of restraint. Signed into law by Bush and continued during the Obama administration, the program was necessary to avert an even greater economic disaster. But the bailout of banks that were “too big to fail” fed the perception that the president could make sweeping decisions affecting the entire economy even as the people responsible for the crash continued to profit from its aftermath.

The failure on the part of Congress, in particular, to even attempt to rein in the executive after these crises is puzzling. Reforms often follow major debacles: for example, near the end of the Vietnam War, Congress enacted, over President Richard Nixon's veto, the War Powers Resolution, which limited how long the president could deploy troops without congressional authorization. Presidents since Nixon have circumvented the resolution by simply not recognizing it or by asserting their power as commander in chief. Nonetheless, the resolution raised the political cost of deploying troops and put the legislative branch on record as wanting to be consulted in future military deployments.



It could be that the financial crisis consumed the political energy that would otherwise have gone toward a real reckoning with the consequences of the war on terror. In the absence of this reckoning, Americans are still living in the domestic political order fashioned after 9/11, with a highly militarized presidential apparatus that can act with near impunity as long as the president invokes “national security.” Congress has largely sidelined itself on national security matters and has not even been able to repeal the authorizations to use military force in Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2002).

Presidents since 9/11, including Trump, have therefore been able to push the limits of their power, stretching the 2001 and 2002 authorizations to use force beyond recognition. For example, Obama undertook a vast program of drone strikes and bombed Yemen and Syria. In his first term, Trump continued what now seem like routine abuses of the authorizations, for instance when he repeatedly bombed Syria. Some of his first-term actions, while highly risky, were different in degree but not in kind, as when he ordered the strike that killed the Iranian military leader Qasem Soleimani and tempted a far more serious escalation of conflict with Iran. Others truly pushed the limits of presidential power, such as his use of the military in domestic settings, including during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests in Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C.

But during Trump's first term, some guardrails—notably in the form of his advisers and members of his cabinet, many of whom had the respect of Congress—tempered Trump's most egregious instincts. Now, those guardrails have vanished. The other branches of government are no longer even attempting to constrain his foreign policy. Congress itself dealt the first of two blows to executive restraint in January 2021, when the Senate failed to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial for fomenting the January 6 insurrection. Too few Republicans were willing to cast a vote against Trump. Criticism and defections from within the president's own party have always been essential to holding presidents accountable: during Watergate, congressional Republicans ultimately abandoned Nixon, who resigned knowing they would not support him. With Trump's 2021 acquittal, Republican legislators in Congress made it clear that they were effectively taking themselves out of the business of checking Trump.

Then, in July 2024, the Supreme Court, never inclined to check presidential power in foreign affairs and especially deferential on national security matters, gave Trump a literal get-out-of-jail-free card in ruling that the president enjoyed substantial immunity from prosecution for virtually any action related to his official duties. The ruling not only stopped the federal prosecutions of Trump—for his role in the “Stop the Steal” movement and his actions related to January 6, as well as his alleged mishandling of classified documents—but also made it highly unlikely that Trump will ever be held accountable for violating federal law and the Constitution, which he has arguably done repeatedly in the first few months of his second term.

International relations scholars used to divide the world into democracies and everyone else. The category of nondemocracies included Iraq under President Saddam Hussein and China in the 1990s and 2000s, when its leaders rotated regularly. The last decade of scholarship has made clear, however, the very real differences among authoritarian regimes and the implications for their foreign policy and national security choices. The political scientist Jessica Weeks, for example, has shown that in some autocracies, leaders face real constraints from elites, whether in a political “machine” such as the Politburo in China or in a military junta in which officers can oust the leader because their own political survival does not depend on one person. Other autocracies are truly “personalist” dictatorships in which nothing stops the leader from making erratic decisions, including starting ill-advised wars. These distinctions also reveal shifts in the same autocracy over time. In China, for instance, Chinese leader Xi Jinping has centralized power to such an extent that the regular rotation of leaders no longer occurs.

As the political scientists Steven Levitsky and Lucan Way have argued in Foreign Affairs, the United States is sliding into competitive authoritarianism—a system in which elections, however unfair, still take place and dissent, however throttled, still exists. Today, U.S. courts are still exerting some checks on the president, especially in the domestic realm. The fate of those challenges, however, remains uncertain, since many cases will ultimately land at the Supreme Court, whose composition favors Trump.

In matters of foreign policy and national security, the presidency now has the characteristics of a personalist dictatorship. The courts' traditional deference to the president in foreign affairs is unlikely to change. The second Trump administration, well aware of this deference, is using foreign policy as a pretext for its legally dubious actions. For example, Rubio's enthusiastic attempts to detain and deport foreign students involved in 2023 campus protests rely on a 1952 law that allows for the removal of noncitizens if the secretary of state deems their “presence or activities . . . would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.” In 1990, Congress strictly limited the use of the law to very specific circumstances, and in 1996, U.S. District Judge Maryanne Trump Barry—the president's late sister—struck down the law (the opinion was later overturned on a technicality). In the current cases, courts have rebuked the administration, and several of the students have been released pending further proceedings. But their fates remain uncertain, and Rubio has moved on to broader visa revocation efforts, including against Chinese students.

The administration is complying in only the most minimal way with court orders and in many cases trampling on basic due process so fast that courts cannot stop great harm to individuals and institutions. The fact that administration officials have repeatedly used foreign policy to justify their overreach shows they well understand the freedom of action they have in this sphere. A real national security emergency, such as a terrorist attack, would allow the president to even further extend executive power into the domestic arena. Trump's cutting of the last threads of presidential accountability leaves it up to the next president to decide whether to respect the law and uphold the Constitution.

This disappearance of limitations on the president bodes ill for U.S. foreign policy and the world. Scholarship on personalism paints a dark picture. Without constraints, even from elites in the leader's inner circle, personalist dictators are prone to military misadventures, erratic decisions, and self-defeating policies.



Start with international aggression. Many scholars have found that personalist dictators tend to be more militarily aggressive. They also tend to want more from the world, taking “revisionist” positions that enhance their own domestic and international standing. Trump mused about buying Greenland during his first term; in his second, he has openly discussed using military force against Denmark, a NATO ally, to acquire it.

The politicization of the military, a process that also predates Trump but that he has supercharged, is also a serious concern. Personalist dictators fear the military and prioritize minimizing threats to their rule over battlefield performance, as the political scientist Caitlin Talmadge has shown in her book The Dictator's Army. Although the United States military is still far from that point, Trump is abusing his position as commander in chief. For example, in response to protests this month against his immigration policies, Trump has deployed the National Guard and the Marines to Los Angeles, over the objections of local civilian authorities.

The erosion of checks and balances at home has enormous implications for the world. The United States has, for better and for worse, dominated global order as an imperfect democracy for 80 years. As the political scientist John Ikenberry has written, the post-1945 order took shape because the United States, the overwhelmingly dominant power, accepted limitations on its power by binding itself to new international institutions. The country's democratic institutions allowed the United States to credibly enter into and stay in these arrangements. The United States wrote the rules of that order—which were, of course, highly beneficial to the United States—at a time when the president still looked to Congress for approval of a long-term vision for U.S. foreign policy and national security. President Harry Truman worked to secure that approval through grinding political processes, giving up some of his own domestic priorities, such as his Fair Deal economic and social program, to ensure bipartisan commitment to the postwar competition with the Soviet Union.

The second Trump administration has done far more than withdraw from international agreements and organizations. The very nature of the new U.S. government—unaccountable, unlawful, opaque, corrupt, arbitrary, and erratic—makes it a poor partner for cooperation. It is difficult to imagine Washington returning to any kind of pre-Trump normal. Trump has not simply reduced the United States' international commitments. He has hollowed out the country's ability to play a significant and trusted role in the world. These effects will be extremely difficult to reverse because, unlike after Trump's first term, there will be few experienced professionals to rebuild the institutions and relationships that make foreign policy work on a day-to-day basis.

Foreign governments, including those of allies, will not be complacent once Trump leaves office. A United States that can change policy daily, treat those who serve its government with cruelty, and take reckless actions that compromise its basic systems and leave shared secrets and assets vulnerable is not one to be trusted. Moreover, if American institutions, especially Congress, are not functional—if they cannot pass important laws to commit to and fund foreign policy institutions and priorities, ensure that legislative spending power is appropriately carried out by the executive, and serve as a check on presidential power—then U.S. foreign policy is fully at the mercy of the whims of each newly elected president.

If American citizens, politicians, and those that staff national institutions hope to achieve a real reckoning with this wreckage after Trump leaves office, they will have to do two things. First, they must take on the difficult but essential task of confronting past breaches of laws and of norms. Officials in this administration, including members of the cabinet, must answer for their actions: through courts if they committed crimes and through hearings that assess their actions and allow elected officials and the public to judge if they violated their oaths. But it will be crucial to draw a line between those who engaged in unlawful, unethical, or unconstitutional conduct and those who merely served the Trump administration's regular policy goals. Without drawing this line, future politicians would risk criminalizing policy differences and make debate over difficult policy problems impossible.

Second, they must revive and replenish the institutions and mechanisms of accountability. Presidents must want to guarantee checks on their power—leaders must think about how they would feel if a president from another party could operate without constraint. Congress can and must play a role in checking the executive. But in an era of extreme polarization, lost expertise, and legislative cowardice, Congress will likely continue to shirk its responsibility to curb the excesses of presidential power.

That is why the legislature must develop some automatic forms of oversight and accountability and thus render moot the political choice of whether Congress should work to constrain the executive. For example, Congress could expand its use of the long-standing mechanism of congressional reporting requirements. Most of these are written reports that Congress requires of the executive branch, but Congress could institutionalize high-level hearings that force top national security officials to appear regularly before the legislature. Members of Congress could also invite the president to give more than one annual address to Congress or to answer questions directly. For the legislature's power to reach the White House once again, Congress must revive the political expectation that it will ask policy questions—and that the president must answer them or face political costs.

The consequences of the second Trump administration for future American foreign policy—under either party—are already grave. If there is no serious reckoning that attempts to rebuild presidential accountability for foreign policy, then Americans should expect not only more military parades but also more military misadventures, unpredictable trade relations, and fitful foreign-policy making in a very uncertain future.

            Like maple syrup and lakeside lounging, an annual influx of Canadians tourists has long been a part of life for the border-hugging New York region known as “North Country.”
    


            “I don't ever remember a summer where I wasn't at the beach, hearing the French language and seeing Quebec license plates,” said Kristy Kennedy, who grew up in the area.
    


            But Kennedy, now vice president of marketing and business development for the North Country Chamber of Commerce, has seen (and heard) far fewer Canadian visitors in recent months, as travel has dipped amid international tensions.
    


            Reservations are down at hotels and campgrounds, she said; local marinas, which depend on Canadian boaters, have watched bookings slow.
    


            “There's definitely a decline,” she said. For the rural area, such losses could mean economic pain. “Our leisure travel market is about 70% Canadians — it's a very large part of what we do.”
    


            Business is down 30% this spring, said Paul Dame, owner of Bluff Point Golf Resort in Plattsburg, New York, in a recent interview with CBC, and pinned the “disheartening” decline on the political situation.
    


            New York business owners aren't alone in their concern about the tourism slowdown. But now, they're in the vanguard of residents along the northern border working to woo Canadians back — and sweetening the message with Canadian-only deals.
    


            On June 1, members of the North Country Chamber of Commerce launched a “Cross-Border Specials” campaign encouraging businesses to welcome Canadians by offering special pricing and perks.
    


            “Our partners were like, ‘Absolutely yes, let's make it affordable for those who still want to come,'” said Kennedy.
    


            The deals range from cheaper stays to free activities: At the boutique hotel Bluebird Lake Placid, Canadian residents get a 30% discount through the end of August, and Canadian players at Bluff Point Golf Resort get a free sleeve of Callaway Canada balls. In Plattsburg, New York, Adirondack ElliptiGO is giving away full-day rentals of their stand-up elliptical bicycles to anyone with a Canadian ID.
    


            “I thought I'd do something to just invite them down,” said Adirondack ElliptiGO owner Donald Moore. He's partnering with the nearby Cabana Beach Bar, as well, with plans to give his Canadian visitors vouchers to use at the lakeside hangout. “They can get some drinks while they sit with their toes in the sand,” Moore said.
    


            In neighboring Vermont, those working in northern communities echoed sentiments heard along the New York border, as well as their commitment to bringing Canadians back.
    


            Abby Long, executive director of the nonprofit Kingdom Trails Association in East Burke, Vermont, said the proportion of Canadians riding its more than 100 miles of mountain bike trails has halved since last spring.
    


            “We heard from Canadian trail users that come year after year, multiple times a year,” she said. “They let us know that they love Kingdom Trails, they were sorry not to be joining, but they would not be coming this summer.”
    


            What's more, she said the drop is trickling down to countless small shops, restaurants and accommodations in the Northeast Kingdom, one of the state's most economically depressed regions.
    


            “All the businesses surrounding our trail network that depend on those visitor numbers are also being impacted,” Long said.
    


            Jay Peak Resort, which is just a few miles south of the international border, has seen similar fallout. The cancellations started after President Trump talked about Canada becoming America's “51st state,” said Steve Wright, the resort's president and general manager.
    


            It's only gotten worse since then. New reservations have sagged.
    


            “I think people are maybe ‘under-seeing' the impacts it's having on border communities and border economies up here, that rely on Canadians for their top and bottom line,” said Wright, who also spoke at a June 11 forum on tariff impacts hosted by US Senators Ben Ray Luján and Catherine Cortez Masto.
    


            “About 50% of our traffic is Canadian, and 60% in the summer,” Wright said. “There will almost certainly be a reduction in workforce if we don't get this turned around.”
    


            Jay Peak Resort has long offered “at-par” pricing for Canadians, allowing them to use Canadian dollars to pay the USD list price for lift tickets and more — a substantial savings as the US dollar remains strong.
    


            Now, some others are following suit. Emma Arian, the executive director of Vermont Brewers Festival, decided to roll out at-par pricing for their two-day craft beer event in July, which brings together some of the state's 77 breweries for tastings on the Burlington, Vermont, waterfront.
    


            “We wanted to make a meaningful gesture that says, ‘We see you, we value you and we want you here,'” said Vermont Brewers Festival executive director Emma Arian. In addition to the Canadian-only discount, Arian also recruited a trio of Quebec breweries — including Dieu du Ciel! and Messorem — to participate in the event, serving craft brews alongside their American counterparts.
    


            “It demonstrates our commitment to welcoming our neighbors from across the border,” she said. “We hope to capture the spirit of collaboration — and gratitude.”
    


            Similar efforts are taking place across the northern US. Last month, Maine Governor Janet Mills unveiled new signs reading “Bienvenue Canadiens,” which are currently being installed along interstates and at ports of entry.
    


            New, bilingual signage is cropping up in the Adirondacks region, too.
    


One hotel group based in Portland, Maine, has a “Canadian special” at its five properties, with discounts ranging from 10% to 15%. The tony hotels of the Kennebunkport Resort Collection have an “O Canada” discount of up to 15%, which comes with a free bottle of bubbly.
    


            In Washington State, a group of tourism businesses launched an “Open Arms for Canada” campaign, in which participating locations — from Seattle's Pacific Science Center to the seaside Semiahmoo Resort that's just shy of the international border — offered a weekend-long 30% discount to Canadian visitors in May.
    


            “It's our way of saying, ‘We're glad you're here, and we're on your side,' the campaign website reads.



            For now, the losses aren't evenly distributed, and northern states are noticing more acute declines than the rest of the US. Car trips to the US by Canadian residents were down 35.2% in April when compared with 2024.
    


            It was the fourth consecutive month of year-on-year contraction, with effects that are touching red and blue states alike.
    


            North Dakota has lost an estimated $13.4 million in spending by Canadian visitors, said a representative for the state's tourism and marketing department.
    


            Hotel bookings across Montana by Canadians were down 73% in January through March, said Discover Kalispell executive director Diane Medler, who noted that visitors from Canada account for 90% of her own city's international guests. Hoteliers have told her cancellations are hurting their bottom lines, particularly in the cooler spring season. One, she said, described a single cancellation by a Canadian tour group that represented a $35,000 hit.
    


            “Canadians help to boost our visitation year-round,” Medler told CNN. “That loss is especially hard during those slower months.”
    


            In an April radio address, Maine governor Mills described widespread cancellations by Canadian visitors calling off plans to visit the state's campgrounds and resorts. She estimated that the state would lose 225,000 Canadian travelers. (Recent reports suggest the numbers could prove far higher.)
    


            In Washington State, year-on-year hotel bookings have dropped 6% in the northwest region, said Michelle McKenzie, the director of marketing for State of Washington Tourism in an email to CNN. That figure pertains to all travelers, not just Canadians.
    


            Tiny Point Roberts, Washington, which has long relied on majority-Canadian tourism, has gone eerily silent, said Wayne Lyle, president of the Point Roberts Chamber of Commerce.
    


            “Gas stations are quieter, grocery stores are quieter, and restaurants are down 50% in business,” Lyle said. “It's been a huge impact.”
    


            If Canadians opt out of US vacations this year, it will affect more than northern states — it will be a drag on the nationwide economy. Visitors from Canada spent more than $20 billion in the US last year, and supported some 140,000 American jobs, estimates the U.S. Travel Association.
    


            Analysts from the travel industry website Skift have noted that even a relatively modest 10% decline in spending would translate to a $2 billion loss.
    


            And initial figures suggest that the damage might be far higher than that. Air travel by Canadian residents to the US was down nearly 20% in April when compared with the same month in 2024, according to Canada's national statistics office.

            President Donald Trump called for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to expand deportation efforts in Democratic cities and “do all in their power” to achieve mass deportations in a social media post Sunday.
    


            “ICE Officers are herewith ordered, by notice of this TRUTH, to do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History,” the president posted on Truth Social as he traveled on Air Force One to Canada for the G7 summit.
    


            The president's post comes as CNN has reported that ICE has been racing to meet White House arrest quotas and on the heels of Trump acknowledging that his immigration policies have impacted farmworkers and those in the hospitality industry.
    


            The White House has enlisted components across the federal government to achieve its goal of 3,000 immigration-related arrests per day. But while the Trump administration has publicly touted its enforcement efforts, officials have privately faced criticism for failing to meet that quota, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions.
    


            Trump also directed ICE in his social media post on Sunday to “expand efforts” in “the Democrat Power Center” while claiming without evidence that his political opponents are using “Illegal Aliens” to “cheat in Elections, and grow the Welfare State.”
    


            “We must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America's largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside,” Trump said.
    


            As long as quotas remain in place, ICE will likely have to ramp up arrests in communities, particularly if guardrails are set up around certain workplaces, according to multiple sources familiar with discussions.
    


            “We will follow the President's direction and continue to work to get the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens off of America's streets,” Homeland Security Department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN.
    


            An anticipated months long immigration enforcement operation has already been underway targeting around two dozen Democratic-led cities, according to a source familiar with the planning.
    


            Agents from various federal agencies, including from US Customs and Border Protection, have been assigned to fan out to those cities as the administration pushes to increase interior arrests, the source said.
    


            “We got to be more efficient. We put more teams out there. We've increased targeting, so we expect those numbers to increase,” White House border czar Tom Homan previously told CNN, referring to migrant arrests.

            The administration's immigration crackdown sparked protests in Los Angeles earlier this month, which prompted the president to mobilize both National Guard troops and Marines to deal with demonstrations over federal raids in the city.
    


            Protests have expanded across the country, culminating in scores of anti-Trump demonstrators taking to the streets in “No Kings” protests nationwide over the weekend.
    


            Since Trump took office, ICE, which had previously been operating with a set of guidelines focused on public safety and national security threats, has had to pivot as the key agency at the core of the president's campaign promise to carry out mass deportations. Recent arrests have taken place during routine immigration checks, and at immigration court and worksites.
    


            Immigration-enforcement operations have created a chilling effect on some industries heavily reliant on immigrant workforces, including farms and hotels, and as ICE races to fulfill Trump's goal to increase deportations. The president appeared to acknowledge Thursday that his immigration policies are straining those sectors.
    


            “Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,” Trump said on Truth Social. “We must protect our Farmers, but get the CRIMINALS OUT OF THE USA. Changes are coming!”

            At Home, a popular home goods retailer with 260 stores across 40 US states, has filed for bankruptcy, citing the backdrop of tariff increases and a slowdown in consumer spending.
    


            The Dallas-based company announced Monday that it had entered an agreement with its lenders that “will eliminate substantially all” of its roughly $2 billion in debt and provide $200 million in fresh funding to keep At Home operating while it navigates the Chapter 11 process.
    


            Brad Weston, At Home's CEO who joined the company last year, said in a statement that the company is “operating against the backdrop of an increasingly dynamic and rapidly evolving trade environment as we navigate the impact of tariffs” and that the changes “will improve our ability to compete in the marketplace in the face of continued volatility and increase the resilience of our business for the long term.”
    


            Businesses across the United States are grappling with uncertainty about tariffs, including on the countries from which At Home sources its products, notably China. At one point, American tariffs on that country were as high as 145% before an agreement last month to temporarily lower that to 30%.
    


            A pullback in discretionary spending in the US in recent years has also spelled trouble for the home goods industry, with The Container Store, Bed Bath & Beyond and Big Lots all filing for bankruptcy.
    


            However, the main problem for At Home is its “extensive debt that the company had on its balance sheet,” according to Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData. “This was not sustainable and its elimination under Chapter 11 will provide a more stable basis on which the company can operate.”
    


            He added that At Home's proposition is “weak” and is “not sufficiently differentiated to compete against rivals like Ikea, Wayfair and others.”
    


            “There is way too little inspiration and not nearly enough excitement to draw people in to the stores, particularly in areas where competition is high,” Saunders wrote in a note.
    


            At Home, which sells a wide variety of items such as furniture, rugs and other home accessories, said it would continue to operate as usual, including fulfilling orders, paying vendors and maintaining its loyalty program during the Chapter 11 process.
    


            However, the privately held company hinted that it might close some locations, saying that a “majority of our stores will remain open.” The Wall Street Journal recently reported that around 20 At Home locations were set to shutter.
    


            Upon exiting Chapter 11, At Home “will move forward with new owners and a meaningfully strengthened balance sheet,” Weston said.

MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin dairy farmer alleged in a federal lawsuit filed Monday that the Trump administration is illegally denying financial assistance to white farmers by continuing programs that favor minorities.

The conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty filed the lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture in federal court in Wisconsin on behalf of a white dairy farmer, Adam Faust.

Faust was among several farmers who successfully sued the Biden administration in 2021 for race discrimination in the USDA's Farmer Loan Forgiveness Plan.

The new lawsuit alleges the government has continued to implement diversity, equity and inclusion programs that were instituted under former President Joe Biden. The Wisconsin Institute wrote to the USDA in April warning of legal action, and six Republican Wisconsin congressmen called on the USDA to investigate and end the programs.

“The USDA should honor the President's promise to the American people to end racial discrimination in the federal government,” Faust said in a written statement. “After being ignored by a federal agency that's meant to support agriculture, I hope my lawsuit brings answers, accountability, and results from USDA.”

Trump administration spokesperson Anna Kelly did not immediately respond to an email Monday seeking comment.




The lawsuit contends that Faust is one of 2 million white male American farmers who are subject to discriminatory race-based policies at the USDA.




The lawsuit names three USDA programs and policies it says put white men at a disadvantage and violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal treatment by discriminating based on race and sex.

Faust participates in one program designed to offset the gap between milk prices and the cost of feed, but the lawsuit alleges he is charged a $100 administrative fee that minority and female farmers do not have to pay.

Faust also participates in a USDA program that guarantees 90% of the value of loans to white farmers, but 95% to women and racial minorities. That puts Faust at a disadvantage, the lawsuit alleges.

Faust has also begun work on a new manure storage system that could qualify for reimbursement under a USDA environmental conservation program, but 75% of his costs are eligible while 90% of the costs of minority farmers qualify, the lawsuit contends.

A federal court judge ruled in a similar 2021 case that granting loan forgiveness only to “socially disadvantaged farmers” amounts to unconstitutional race discrimination. The Biden administration suspended the program and Congress repealed it in 2022.

The Wisconsin Institute has filed dozens of such lawsuits in 25 states attacking DEI programs in government. In its April letter to the USDA, the law firm that has a long history of representing Republicans said it didn't want to sue “but there is no excuse for this continued discrimination.”

Trump has been aggressive in trying to end the government's DEI efforts to fulfill a campaign promise and bring about a profound cultural shift across the U.S. from promoting diversity to an exclusive focus on merit.

Kīlauea Volcano in Hawaii experienced dramatic lava fountaining over the weekend, with eruptions reaching 1,000 feet.

A tourist is lucky to be alive after plunging nearly 30 feet off a cliff and toward an erupting volcano while visiting a popular Hawaiian hot spot last week. 

In an attempt to get a better view of the Kīlauea volcanic eruption, the 30-year-old man from Boston wandered from the park's Byron Ledge Trail, but ""got too close to the sheer cliff edge"" on Wednesday, according to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. 

Luckily, a tree broke the man's fall, saving him from plunging ""another hundred feet or so to the caldera floor, which could have resulted in his death.""

Search and rescue teams that were already in the area to manage traffic began searching for the man at approximately 9 p.m., after receiving reports that an individual had plunged 30 feet below the cliff. 

The man – who was not carrying a flashlight or headlamp – was pulled to safety in a high-angle rescue by officials rappelling down the cliff and only suffered minor facial injuries, according to the park. 

The volcano is considered one of the world's most active and on the day of the accident, was erupting with lava fountains of more than 1,000 feet, according to the National Park Service.

Kīlauea began its latest activity in December 2024, ""with eruptions separated by pauses lasting several days or more,"" Hawaii's National Park Service said. 

The incident comes after the park previously warned visitors to remain vigilant after a small child nearly plummeted into the active volcano just days after it began erupting.

""A toddler wandered off from his family and in a split second, ran straight toward the 400-foot cliff edge,"" the park said in a press release. ""His mother, screaming, managed to grab him in the nick of time just a foot or so away from a fatal fall. Disaster was averted, and the shaken family departed."" 

In addition to spewing hot lava, the volcano can also emit toxic gasses and ""glassy volcanic particulates,"" called tephra, making close encounters with the natural phenomenon highly dangerous.

""The hazards that coincide with an eruption are dangerous, and we have safety measures in place including closed areas, barriers, closure signs, and traffic management,"" Park Superintendent Rhonda Loh previously said in a statement. ""Your safety is our utmost concern, but we rely on everyone to recreate responsibility. National parks showcase nature's splendor but they are not playgrounds."" 

The National Park Service did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

IndyCar drivers Josef Newgarden and Louis Foster were in a dangerous crash on Sunday during the Bommarito Automotive Group 500 at World Wide Technology (WTT) Raceway in Madison, Illinois, just outside of St. Louis.

The incident occurred about midway through the race when Foster lost control of his vehicle in the corner and collided with the wall. He spun around as he came down the track on the frontstretch. Newgarden had nowhere to go and could not avoid Foster.

As Newgarden drove into Foster, he got airborne and flipped over in a terrifying crash. He landed on his roof and slid down the track. IndyCar safety officials immediately jumped over the barrier that separated the track from pit road to check on him.

Foster spoke to FOX Sports about the wreck after he was released from the infield care center.

""I got a bit of a wiggle ... got a bit too high and went into the marbles,"" Foster said. ""I just couldn't stop the car from spinning and, obviously, a pretty scary impact with myself and Josef. I'm glad he is OK.""

Newgarden declined to speak after the incident.

Kyle Kirkwood won the race, picking up his second consecutive win and third of the season. Only he and Alex Palou have won races on the IndyCar circuit this season.

Palou still holds the lead in the IndyCar standings, just 73 points over Pato O'Ward and 75 points ahead of Kirkwood.

Hunter Dobbins spoke with John Smoltz after the Boston Red Sox's win vs. the New York Yankees.

A quick glance at the Boston Red Sox's roster from their 2018 World Series-winning team may make the average baseball fan quizzical when compared to the 2025 squad.

Rafael Devers was their third baseman, Mookie Betts played right field and Xander Bogaerts was the shortstop, not to mention players like Andrew Benintendi, Jackie Bradley Jr. and J.D. Martinez also bolstered the lineup as the team defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games.

On Sunday, one of the last core pieces of the lineup was dealt.

The Red Sox traded Devers to the San Francisco Giants for Jordan Hicks, Jose Bello, James Tibbs III and Kyle Harrison – a deal that stunned the baseball world. Despite his philosophical differences with the Red Sox, Devers was hitting .272 with a .905 OPS and 15 home runs. He was leading the American League in walks with 56 and had played the most games in the majors (73).

Betts, who the Red Sox traded to the Dodgers, offered his thoughts following the team's win over the Giants on Sunday.

""I just thought it was crazy,"" he told The Athletic. ""Nothing really to say, it's just crazy.""

Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw also reacted to the trade as he was told during an ESPN segment about the wild move.

""How about that trade? That's wild,"" he said. ""Buster's really doing it! Not Olney; Buster Posey's really doing it over there. Good for Buster, man. He's going for it. I'd consider (Devers) one of probably the top 10 hitters in the game at worst. He's definitely a game-changer.""

Nearly seven years later, the Red Sox are operating with a completely different roster than the one they had when they lifted the Commissioner's Trophy.

Fox News correspondent Christina Coleman reports on the ‘volatile and dangerous' situation in Los Angeles on ‘The Big Weekend Show.'

Los Angeles Dodgers player Enrique Hernandez claimed in a social media post over the weekend that the community was ""being violated, profiled, abused and ripped apart"" amid an illegal immigration crackdown in the city and in parts of the county.

The two-time World Series champion expressed his feelings about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE's) raids over the last week that led to hundreds of arrests and sparked riots in parts of Los Angeles. Hernandez made no mention of the violence that took place against law enforcement officers.

""I may not be Born & Raised, but this city adopted me as one of their own,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""I am saddened and infuriated by what's happening in our country and our city. Los Angeles and Dodger fans have welcomed me, supported me and shown me nothing but kindness and love. 

""This is my second home. And I cannot stand to see our community being violated, profiled, abused and ripped apart. ALL people deserve to be treated with respect, dignity and human rights.""

The anti-immigration enforcement protests began on June 7 and on June 8 the protests turned violent. Agitators sprayed walls and vehicles with the words ""F--- ICE,"" autonomous vehicles were set on fire, and law enforcement officers were pelted with rocks and other objects in the Paramount neighborhood. Later in the week, stores in downtown Los Angeles were looted.

President Donald Trump immediately deployed the National Guard to the area where the issues began, garnering criticism from Democrats insisting their presence would only escalate tensions.

ICE has organized several high-profile raids across the country as part of the president's campaign promise to deliver mass deportations. Trump promised to prioritize criminal illegal immigrants, but critics allege the administration is separating families and targeting non-criminal workers.

Shane van Gisbergen picked up his first win of the NASCAR Cup Series season as the master of road-course racing drove to Victory Lane in Mexico City.

It was almost a disastrous Sunday for the New Zealand native. As he outpaced Christopher Bell by 16.567 seconds, he opened up about the ""queasy"" feeling that plagued him all day.

""I tried to treat it like when I go to Asia, just drink bottled water and be careful in the shower and brush your teeth with bottled water, but I just went downhill,"" he said. ""Couldn't keep anything in. Everything just went straight through me. I felt really queasy, and my mind was there, but my body just had so much pressure in my stomach. Crazy weekend and everyone dug deep.""

It appeared to be a tough week overall, which started with a mechanical issue on his team's charter flight that paused his initial trip to Mexico. He slept on the floor of his hauler before the race, unsure if he would be able to compete at Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez.

Regardless of the illness, van Gisbergen still managed to lead 60 of the 100 laps. The win gives him hope that he could earn a berth into the NASCAR Playoffs.

""It means everything to us, this is why I'm here,"" van Gisbergen said. ""I am getting better and more competitive. We're really making a lot of progress.""

The next race on the NASCAR Cup Series schedule is Pocono.

BANFF, Canada – President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will face off on Monday during the 2025 Group of Seven leaders summit in Canada, with their second meeting carrying higher stakes than their first.

Months after mocking former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as governor of the 51st U.S. state and relishing in the negotiating pressure caused by his tariffs, Trump and Trudeau's successor will convene on Carney's home turf. 

“Mr. Carney needs to be careful about bending the knee,” Jeremy Ghio, a senior director at Montreal-based public affairs firm TACT and a Canadian political analyst, told the Washington Examiner. “He needs to find this balance between flattering Mr. Trump and not giving him an inch, and especially in terms of Canadian sovereignty.”

Although Canada is in a “better position” with the U.S. than under Trudeau, “nobody is safe” from Trump's “temperament,” according to the former Trudeau government official.

Carney held his own during the first meeting at the White House in May by asking Trump not to call Canada the 51st state while also pleasing Trump enough for the president to call him a “step up for Canada.”

As host of the G7, Carney now has a tougher task of not only making progress on his relationship with Trump on issues such as trade, but also making sure Trump gets along with everyone else, too.

Carney is hoping to avoid the optics of the last G7 summit hosted by Canada. That 2018 Charlevoix meeting is remembered for being the one during which Trump was photographed with his arms crossed across from former German Chancellor Angela Merkel before he decided to unendorse the leaders' communique. Trump's decision was prompted by Trudeau promising during his post-summit press conference to retaliate against the president's tariffs. That communique was the first in G7 history not to be endorsed by all leaders at a summit.

Josh Lipsky, international economics chairman at the Atlantic Council, argued that the “best-case scenario” for Carney “is that there's no real blow ups coming out of the back end.” 

“They don't want this feeling of it's a G6 plus one, and that image that came out of the 2018 G7 summit is in everyone's mind and everyone wants to avoid it,” Lipsky told reporters in a pre-summit briefing. “Carney has been through enough of these ministerials as a central banker to know that you don't want to get too hung up on the fact that there's a communique or not, but that's what I see as a positive outcome: a continuation of the G7, not a breakup of the G7 and what you need from that is at least a productive weekend where everyone has conversations.”

For Caitlin Welsh, who was part of Trump's White House National Security Council and National Economic Council before becoming a director at the CSIS, the 2018 summit has cast a “long shadow” over its 2025 counterpart. That includes the knowledge that the president firmly believes that “no deal is better than a bad deal,” and that consensus at a G7 should “not be taken for granted.”

“If it [Canada] wants a unified outcome of this year's G7 leaders' summit, then it should stick close to traditional G7 values while avoiding controversial topics,” Welsh told reporters during a CSIS pre-meeting briefing.

That means staying away from climate change and gender issues, and “promoting very little that the Trump administration would find reason to oppose,” Welsh suggested.

Canada's economy is also at stake. Canadians are concerned that Trump will continue to weaponize tariffs against them as he did early during his second administration, particularly with auto and lumber industry duties. And that is before the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal, which Trump negotiated during his first administration, will be reviewed next year. 

The G7 summit will be a “high-wire act” for Carney, according to Navin Girishankar, president of the Economic Security and Technology Department at CSIS.

That is because Carney is trying to “sidestep the multi-front trade war and refocus on shared priorities such as supply chains, [artificial intelligence] and quantum, and fighting financial crimes,” Girishankar told the Washington Examiner.

“A recently announced U.S.–China detente and anticipated U.S.-Japan deal provide precedents for the U.S. and Canada to de-escalate their trade tensions — reducing tariffs and counter-tariffs in exchange for purchase and investment agreements, as well as increased defense spending,” he said. “While a detente between North American neighbors will be too tall an order [this] week, bilateral discussions on an off-ramp would send a strong signal to North American supply chain partners, investors, and workers.”

In an interview with the Washington Examiner, Lipsky underscored how Canada has received some tariff relief under Trump's exemptions, especially with USMCA-compliant products, but that the residual steel, aluminum, and auto duties are “still a factor.”

“The most important thing to understand about trade with Canada, and Mexico, and the U.S. is how deeply integrated it is, and most goods like car parts flow across the border 15, 20, 25 times for one car,” Lipsky said. “It's important to think about it as, like, an integrated North American market. And so that's why these tariffs have been so painful and concerning both for the Mexicans and the Canadians.”

But regardless of what is at stake for Canada, Ghio, the Canadian political analyst, contends the stakes are also high for the U.S.

“Entrepreneurs in Canada are looking towards new markets – Europe, France, Asia, even India,” he said. “There's a real appetite in Canada to reduce the interdependence with the United States and to look and do business elsewhere. We were used to seeing business thrive north and south. Now Canadians are looking east and west.”

Canadian Trump supporter Derek Noonan, whom the Washington Examiner met earlier this year at the president's pre-inauguration rally at Capital One Arena, agreed with Ghio that tariffs would be a focal point of the G7 summit.

But Noonan, a Toronto businessman, criticized Canada's news media for undercovering how the government has permitted “China to dump steel into our market for years, hence the tariffs.”

Meanwhile, Noonan, who disagreed with Trump involving himself in Canada's elections, which arguably resulted in Carney and the Canadian Liberal Party's resounding victory, welcomed the prospect of his country becoming the U.S.'s 51st state.

“Canada's only viable future rests with being the 51st state, provided we keep our cultural heritage and traditions, as well as our treaties with First Nations,” the 59-year-old said. “Debt levels, negative growth, and faulting [gross domestic product], coupled with out-of-control corruption, spending, and [Chinese Communist Party] influence, our country risks collapse in the near future. The average Canadian is paying 55 to 64 cents in taxes on every dollar, yet the country still goes deeper and deeper in debt. Yes, 51st [state] please.”

Tensions between the U.S. and Canada reached fever-pitch earlier this year when Trump's approach to Trudeau and tariff policy coincided with the 4 Nations Face-Off, an ice hockey tournament between Canada, Finland, Sweden, and the U.S. during which American and Canadian fans were unsportsmanlike, even hostile, toward one another. 

NATIONWIDE ‘NO KINGS' PROTEST GRAPPLE WITH SECURITY THREATS FOLLOWING DEATH OF MINNESOTA LAWMAKER

But as protesters gather in Canada's Alberta region, ranging from host town Kananaskis to Calgary and Banff, the Heritage Foundation's Nile Gardiner declined to advise Trump to soften his 51st state talk.

“He's not going to change his messaging from what he says in the White House to what he says at a summit,” Gardiner, the director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, told the Washington Examiner. “Trump is a politician who will say the same thing at home as he does abroad.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The suspected shooter of two Minnesota state legislators was arrested on Sunday evening in a wooded area near his home in Green Isle, Minnesota. Vance Boelter is believed to have shot Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman, her husband, state Sen. John Hoffman, and his wife in two separate incidents on Saturday. Hortman and her husband were killed in the attack. 

In a press conference after Boelter's arrest, Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) said political violence can't be “the norm” in the country, specifically mentioning “mean tweets” and “demeaning” people. He called for people and politicians to work together and demonstrate “decency.”

“It cannot be the norm; it cannot be the way that we deal with our political differences,” Walz said. “Now is the time for us to recommit to the core values of this country. And each and every one of us can do it.”

“It's not about hatred, it's not about mean tweets, it's not about demeaning someone, it's leading with grace and compassion and vision and compromise and decency,” Walz added. “That was taken from us in Minnesota with the murder of Speaker Hortman.”

Walz condemned inflammatory rhetoric and suggested it was linked to political violence, but the former vice presidential candidate has a history of making incendiary comments as well. 

During last year's presidential campaign, in October 2024, Walz insinuated that then-candidate Donald Trump's rally in Madison Square Garden in New York City was like a 1939 Nazi rally held at the same venue. 

“Donald Trump's got this big rally going at Madison Square Garden,” Walz said. “There's a direct parallel to a big rally that happened in the mid-1930s at Madison Square Garden.” 

“And don't think that he doesn't know for one second exactly what they're doing there,” he said.

Then, in May 2025, during a speech at the commencement ceremony for the University of Minnesota Law School, Walz referred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents as the “Gestapo.”

“Every single day, the president of the United States finds new ways to trample rights and undermine the rule of law,” Walz said. “And I'm going to start with the flashing red light. Donald Trump's modern-day Gestapo is scooping folks up off the streets.” 

Walz's comments drew criticism from Republicans and Department of Homeland Security employees.

“Governor Walz's comments comparing ICE agents to the Gestapo is sickening,” said Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary, in a statement at the time. “This type of rhetoric and demonization of ICE officers has led to our officers facing a 413% increase in assaults.”

“While politicians like Walz fight to protect criminal illegal aliens, our ICE officers will continue putting their lives and safety on the line to arrest murderers, kidnappers, and pedophiles that were let into our country by the previous administration's open border policies,” she added.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Trump is turning out to be a liability for the Kremlin.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Within weeks of Donald Trump's second inauguration, pundits began saying that his return to office opened new doors for Vladimir Putin, offering Moscow opportunities it hadn't seen in years. The deference the new administration afforded the Kremlin appeared to be rivaled only by its hostility toward its own national-security establishment.

Trump entered negotiations to end the war in Ukraine by presenting Putin with a bouquet of inexplicable concessions. Washington ruled out NATO membership for Ukraine—then proposed that it might recognize the illegally occupied Crimean peninsula as Russian (in a reversal of long-standing U.S. policy), allow Russia to retain most of the territory it had seized since 2022, and lift sanctions. The U.S. even sided against its European allies when they presented a resolution at the United Nations condemning Moscow—and then it drafted a peace proposal that omitted any criticism of Russia.

You'd think Putin would be delighted by all of this. Instead, he's been thrown on his heels. Trump's efforts at rapprochement have left Russia's propaganda apparatus, foreign policy, and economic stability in worse shape than they were before January 20.

Whatever the intent, Washington has robbed the Kremlin of its north star: opposition to the United States. After years of routinely threatening to drown the Eastern Seaboard, Moscow can no longer afford the luxury of calling America its enemy No. 1. Thanks to Trump, the Kremlin now has to portray Washington as a rational negotiating partner—even as American-made missiles continue to rain down on Russian troops. The title of Russia's civilizational enemy has been reassigned to the European Union. The Russian propaganda machine has some flexibility, but being locked in an existential struggle with the Netherlands is far less flattering to the imperial mindset than going up against the world's leading superpower.

And so Russia's information mills seem to be glitching out. In a May 25 Truth Social post, Trump wrote that Putin was absolutely “CRAZY” for bombing Ukrainian cities in the middle of negotiations. “We are really grateful to the Americans and to President Trump personally,” Putin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in response. The last time I scanned Russia's top propaganda sites, I couldn't find a single hostile reference to the United States. On May 20, Konstantin Kosachev, the deputy speaker of the Russian senate, described two emerging camps: a “Russian American” one “discussing prospects for achieving peace,” and a “Ukrainian European” one “exploring options for continuing the war.”

The reversal isn't just a problem for Putin's media proxies. The Russian leader himself has been forced to improvise. For years, Putin claimed that direct talks with Ukraine were impossible because President Volodymyr Zelensky's government was illegitimate and, more important, Ukraine wasn't a real country—merely a proxy for the American imperial project. He framed the war as a conflict that only Russia and the U.S. could resolve, in a Yalta-style deal between great powers—preferably in occupied Yalta itself. Along came Trump, who repeatedly sidelined Ukraine and the EU to speak with Putin one-on-one. Putin looked set to get what he wanted. But then that changed, as all things Trump tend to do: By May, Putin wasn't carving up Europe with Trump—he was competing with Zelensky to convince the White House that the other side was out of control.

Trump's point man for Russia is the billionaire real-estate developer Steve Witkoff, whose bewilderingly affectionate approach to Putin continues to flummox the Western media. His meetings with the Russian dictator last for hours. He forgoes American translators (relying instead on Russian intelligence assets), sits alone with top Kremlin negotiators, and emerges voicing Moscow's talking points without even being able to name the Ukrainian regions Russia claims as its own. Even seasoned diplomats have to resist being crushed by Russia's imperial grandeur when they are received like state dignitaries inside the Kremlin complex. Someone who devoted his life to building condos barely stands a chance. Still, the Kremlin surely knows that Witkoff has no authority over what America can offer Russia. Only Trump does. For now, the man trying to rebuild the Russian empire is forced to negotiate with the king of Manhattan real estate.

And negotiate he must, because Trump has made forging a settlement between Russia and Ukraine a defining foreign-policy objective. The goal is an elusive one: Washington has so far failed to secure even a 30-day cease-fire. On May 1, the administration threatened to withdraw from the peace talks. Many in the West expected that this would translate into a win for the Kremlin: Trump, they assumed, would abandon Ukraine and strike a separate deal with Moscow. But Russia has reason to be wary that a thwarted Trump administration might not prove so amenable. The U.S. president apparently wants a diplomatic victory, and if he feels that he's been pushed aside, he may have less reason to end arms shipments to Ukraine—especially now that Kyiv is purchasing munitions—and more reason to blame Moscow for sabotaging the peace process.

For the Kremlin, standing between Trump and the Nobel Peace Prize is risky, but agreeing to a cease-fire while Russia is making steady, if incremental, gains on the battlefield is a step too far. So it opted for a third path: Putin held a rare late-night press conference inviting Ukraine to bilateral negotiations, dodging the cease-fire while handing Trump a symbolic win that he could sell as a breakthrough. For the Russian dictator, whose foreign and domestic policy is shaped by Brioni-clad men playing by prison-yard rules, the need to appease the U.S. president in this way is a distinctly uncomfortable—and demeaning—shift from the predictable antagonism of the Joe Biden years.

Trump frequently holds out the prospect of lifting sanctions or striking lucrative deals as incentives for Moscow to end the war. Russia was even spared from Trump's sweeping tariffs. But what the U.S. can offer Russia is ultimately underwhelming. The sanctions that hurt Russia the most—an oil-export ban, the freezing of two-thirds of its foreign reserves, and its exclusion from the SWIFT bank-to-bank payment network—all came from the EU. Russian exports to the United States were at their peak in 2011—before the annexation of Crimea, the full-scale war in Ukraine, and the U.S. energy boom—and amounted to just $34.6 billion worth of goods. That figure offers little hope for meaningful bilateral trade, especially now.

Read: Putin's bread and circus had bread

What does matter to Russia is oil sales. And in the months before the renewed conflict between Israel and Iran, oil prices dropped by 20 percent, largely because of the Trump administration's global tariff war. This forced Moscow to revise its federal budget for 2025–26; triple this year's expected budget deficit, from 0.5 to 1.7 percent of GDP; and, as a result, tap its fiscal reserves for $5.51 billion, or about one-tenth of its liquid assets, to balance the budget. It also cost Russia $39 billion in anticipated hydrocarbon revenue—more than the proposed deals with the U.S. could make up for. In other words, without imposing a single new sanction, Trump has significantly intensified fiscal pressure on the Kremlin simply by dint of his erratic economic policies.

Washington's public stance on Russia has certainly changed. One popularly circulated YouTube clip shows Secretary of State Marco Rubio refusing to call Putin a war criminal during a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on May 21. But as someone who once worked with the Kremlin (I produced a talk show for Russian state media in the late 2000s), I can assure you: Putin would much rather be labeled a war criminal with oil at $70 a barrel than a rational leader looking to end the war with oil at $56.

During the first three years of Russia's all-out war in Ukraine, the United States and the EU presented a united front against Russia that proved, perhaps paradoxically, manageable for the Kremlin, in terms of both propaganda and strategic positioning. Trump has shattered that coherence, and now the Kremlin finds itself in an uncomfortable position, despite its triumphalist rhetoric and maximalist demands: It's scrambling to keep pace with an American president who has no idea where he's going.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

﻿The wild reason why bird advocates are releasing these reviled insects from the sky.

It sounds like something out of a nightmare: a giant drone flying through the sky and dropping containers full of live, buzzing mosquitoes, one of the world's most hated insects.

But in Hawaii, this scenario is very much real. A remotely operated aircraft, about 8 feet long, is flying over remote forests in Maui and releasing cup-shaped capsules full of mosquitoes. 

As scary as it might sound, the project is a clever solution to a problem that has long plagued the Hawaiian islands. 

Hawaii faces an extinction crisis: It has lost hundreds of animals in the last two centuries, including dozens of land snails and birds, largely due to the spread of non-native species like stray cats and feral pigs. Many native animals found nowhere else on Earth are now gone for good. And several of the creatures that remain are heading in the same direction. Scientists on the islands are quite literally racing to save what wildlife remains.

For the state's avian species — its iconic forest birds, significant, too, to Indigenous Hawaiian culture — the main force of extinction is malaria, a mosquito-borne disease. Mosquitoes, a nonnative pest, were introduced accidentally in the early 1800s by a whaling ship. The blood-suckers proliferated across the islands and later began spreading avian malaria, a blood-borne pathogen they transmit through their bites. 

The disease, which can be fatal, utterly devastated the state's forest birds, and especially a group of species in the finch family known as honeycreepers. There were once more than 50 species of these colorful songbirds across Hawaii, and today all but 17 are extinct. As I've observed firsthand, the forests here have grown silent. 

The few honeycreeper species that persist today have been able to evade malaria largely because they live in higher elevations that are too cold for mosquitoes. But now, climate change is warming the islands, allowing the insects to march uphill into the remaining avian strongholds. Some experts describe this as an “extinction conveyor belt.”

Saving these birds is quite literally a race against the clock. That's where the drone comes in. 

For more than a year now, a group of environmental organizations have been dropping biodegradable containers of mosquitoes into honeycreeper habitats on Maui and Kauai from helicopters. Now they're starting to do it with giant drones. The containers fall to the ground without a top, and when they land the insects escape into the forest. 

Critically, these are not your typical mosquitoes. They're all males, which don't bite, that have been reared in a lab. More importantly, they contain a strain of bacteria called wolbachia that interferes with reproduction: When those males mate with females in the area, their eggs fail to hatch. (That's thanks to a bit of biology magic, referred to as the incompatible insect technique, or IIT.) 

The idea is to continually release these special males into honeycreeper habitat where malaria is spreading as a way to erode the population of biting mosquitoes — and thus suppress the spread of disease. The approach has little ecological downside, said Chris Farmer, Hawaii program director at American Bird Conservancy, a conservation group that's leading the drone effort. Mosquitoes are not native, so local ecosystems and species don't rely on them. 

“What this does is it erects an invisible barrier so that these mosquitoes can't get up to the forests where these birds remain,” Farmer told Vox. 

Since late 2023, a coalition of organizations known as Birds, Not Mosquitoes has unleashed more than 40 million male mosquitoes across Maui and Kauai. Nearly all of those were in containers tossed out of helicopters, which allow scientists to deliver the insects to remote forest regions where the birds remain. 

The group is now testing drones as an alternative. While the helicopters can carry more mosquitoes than drones in one flight — around 250,000, compared to about 23,000 — drones are safer because they're unmanned. They're also easier to fly on demand, says Adam Knox, the drone pilot and project manager for aerial deployment of mosquitoes at American Bird Conservancy. 

Dropping mosquitoes out of drones and choppers may sound unreal, but it's the best idea out there to help Hawaii's honeycreepers, said Marm Kilpatrick, an avian malaria expert at the University of California Santa Cruz. Kilpatrick is not affiliated with the mosquito-release project. “The reason that it's worth doing is that so far, we haven't discovered anything else that can possibly do this better,” Kilpatrick told Vox.

Scientists don't yet know if unleashing reproductively challenged mosquitoes is working and causing the resident mosquito population to crash. It's too soon to tell and the research is still underway, according to Christa Seidl, the mosquito research and control coordinator at Maui Forest Bird Recovery Project, a group leading avian conservation on the island. 

But the same approach has worked elsewhere — to stem mosquitoes that spread diseases among humans. Global health advocates have released mosquitoes with wolbachia strains that disrupt reproduction in other parts of the world and seen a massive decline in the incidence of, for example, dengue fever. 

“It sounds weird to say, but we're standing on the shoulders of human disease,” Farmer said. “The IIT we're using for conservation was first developed for human health.”

Ultimately, the goal is not total elimination of mosquitoes that carry avian malaria in Hawaii. That's likely impossible, Kilpatrick said, unless scientists could release millions or even billions of lab-grown insects all at once. 

For the time being, the plan is to regularly — and indefinitely — release the mosquitoes into forests with some of the most endangered birds, such as the kiwikiu, ‘ākohekohe, and ʻakekeʻe. Barring any regulatory or technical problems, drone deployments will soon be a regular part of that effort. 

“This is the last chance to save most of our remaining songbirds,” Farmer said. “When we've succeeded, the birds will come back.”

﻿Teenagers today are maligned for being anti-romance. What's really going on?

Ren, 18, describes herself as “a big romantic.” Like so many teen girls that came before her, she loves love: Ren is obsessed with rom-coms, develops crushes quickly, and dissects texts from boys with her friends. But, like many of her friends, she hasn't dated anyone; as a rising sophomore in college in New York, Ren has yet to experience her first kiss. 

She wants genuine connection and intimacy. But Ren doesn't find the current slate of options appealing: neither the cycle of what kids term love-bombing — excessive attention and compliments early in a relationship — and then ghosting that seems to comprise romance in her circles, nor an anonymous hookup at a frat party. “I want my first kiss to be with someone that I like, rather than someone random,” she says. “I feel like there'll be someone who meets my energy someday.” (Vox is using a pseudonym for all the teenage sources in this story, so they can discuss their romantic lives freely.)

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

Ren's experience is increasingly common among teenagers coming of age today. You may have come across some alarming (and alarmist) headlines about Gen Z's aversion — and even hostility — to sex and romance: They've been branded “puriteens” who have regressive attitudes about sex; they're more interested in their phones than dating; they can't even stomach sex scenes in the movies. 

Indeed, rates of sexual activity among teenagers have dropped in the last three decades: In 1991, about 54 percent of high school students in a government survey said they'd had sex; in 2021, it was 30 percent. But Gen Z may be getting unfairly maligned. Teenage romance has actually been on the decline for far longer, decreasing generation by generation for 75 years: According to a 2023 survey from the American Enterprise Institute, 56 percent of Gen Z adults report that they had a boyfriend or girlfriend as a teenager, compared to 69 percent of millennials, 76 percent of Generation X-ers, and 78 percent of baby boomers. 

What's certain is that while romantic connection has lessened, yearning for it certainly hasn't. 

“This generation is characterized by less in all of these areas: less dating, less sex, less togetherness,” says Lisa A. Phillips, who teaches a course on relationships at SUNY New Paltz and wrote a book on teen relationships, First Love: Guiding Teens through Relationships and Heartbreak. There are many possible causes, including the loneliness epidemic, overreliance on technology, fears of sexual assault, unrealistic expectations of relationships from social media, a rise in teen anxiety and depression, the ubiquity of porn, the gender disparity on college campuses, and a decrease in leisure time for teenagers. But what's certain is that while romantic connection has lessened, yearning for it certainly hasn't. 

“The desire to connect is still very prominent, but the rules are different and confusing, and there's a lot of reluctance and wariness,” Phillips says. The limited data on this group bears this out: A Hinge survey of Gen Z daters published in 2024 found that 90 percent of them hope to find love. In other words, it's not that young people are too anxious and online to want in-person love and physical intimacy. It's that they don't quite know how to get it. 

In eras past, when teenagers didn't spend an average of about eight hours a day behind a screen, the rites of passage of a typical romance may have looked something like this: you have a crush on someone from English class or home room; you flirt in the hallway and ask your friends to get intel from their friends. Someone works up the nerve to ask the other out, so you go on a few real-life dates and seek each other out one-on-one in bigger social settings, like at parties. That progresses into a full-blown relationship (which most likely ends in heartbreak after a few weeks or months). 

Emily, 16, who lives in New Jersey, always imagined that those milestones would be a part of her high school experience. She was “not necessarily expecting a whole love story, but like High School Musical,” where you ask each other to dances, she says. “But that didn't exactly happen.”

She was “not necessarily expecting a whole love story, but like High School Musical,” where you ask each other to dances, she says.

Unlike in the movies she grew up watching, she finds that crushes don't develop in the cafeteria or school hallways. Instead, it all happens online, mostly on Snapchat. “The majority of my week, that's how I'm interacting with people,” says Emily, who'll start her senior year of high school in the fall. 

Instead of a furtive note passed across class, if someone has a crush on you, they'll send you the ultimate romantic gesture: a photo of their full face. “Not just of their ceiling or a half face,” says Emily. If you like them, too, then you'll start sending texts back and forth on Snapchat. 

This is “the talking stage,” a new — and extremely confusing — kind of milestone. It's one version of a situationship, a type of relationship without clear boundaries, rules, or commitment. This gray area — when you both like each other, talk occasionally but don't move toward exclusivity or more intimacy — has come to dominate Gen Z's dating woes. “Normally, it doesn't escalate from there, because most people don't like to have labels or a real relationship,” Emily says. “It's crazy because you can be in ‘talking stage,' and you see them at school and just pass by each other. Social media is where it all happens.” Sometimes, two people in the talking stage will meet up in person, but that doesn't last long. 

Emily's friends mostly hang out in big group gatherings, which are also arranged via Snapchat. “That could be at someone's house, or at Chipotle, or at a school football game,” she says. “But you wouldn't split off to hang out with someone one-on-one.”

Pau, 18, a rising sophomore in college, also describes the few relationships she's experienced and witnessed among friends as nebulous and far more verbal than physical. She and her crush from a summer program in high school, for instance, would largely work on papers and take early morning walks together. “[People] are less affectionate publicly, so it's more difficult to spot who's in a relationship,” she says. “Then you find out by Instagram post.”

In the fall of her junior year, Emily had her most significant relationship so far. She and her crush started Snapchatting back and forth, and to her surprise, they actually talked in person, too. Sometimes they sat together at lunch; when their friend groups would hang out, he'd give her a ride. “In my head, I was like, maybe this is real, he actually wants something real,” she says. Then, after a few weeks, he abruptly stopped responding to her messages. “I tried to talk to him about it, like, ‘We don't have to have anything, but I want to make sure I didn't hurt your feelings or something.' He just laughed it off,” says Emily. 

When you never exit the “talking stage,” it can lead to an unsettling whiplash effect.

This is how situationships tend to end: an ambiguous tapering off instead of a clear breakup. 

Connecting with someone emotionally rather than physically can be a good way to start a relationship, of course. But when you never exit the “talking stage,” it can lead to an unsettling whiplash effect. You get emotionally close, without the accountability inherent in an in-person commitment. You can easily confess feelings for someone online, and just as easily shut down and go silent, too.

Emily isn't happy with Snapchat situationships. She wants a boyfriend or a girlfriend, someone to do “the corny stuff” with, like decorating gingerbread houses at Christmas and wearing matching pajamas. “I think [we] should go back to literally talking face-to-face, that's so much more fun, honestly,” she says. “But I don't know if people would be on board with that, because I think a lot of people enjoy being behind the screen.”

There's plenty of concern about how the pandemic shaped the development of children who experienced it. A 2025 Gallup poll found that 22 percent of parents thought it had lasting negative effects on their children's social skills, a slightly higher percentage than were concerned about effects on mental health or academic prowess. The worry about social skills was particularly acute for those whose kids were in middle school during the pandemic. 

Teenagers, of course, have come of age online for the last 20 years, ever since the AOL Instant Messenger days of yore, and there's always been anxiety about how that technology would shape their social development. But never has the contrast between teens' online and offline lives been so dramatic as for those who experienced adolescence during the pandemic. Just as they entered a period crucial for developing independence and peer connection, they were cut off from most in-person interaction. 

Emily, for instance, did school largely virtually from sixth to eighth grade. She and her friends learned what was normal and safe during an exceptional time. At the same time, screen time for teenagers increased precipitously: In 2022, nearly half of teens surveyed said they were online almost constantly, compared to 24 percent in 2014, according to Pew Research studies. “A lot of those fundamental years of growing and learning about sexuality and being with other people was online,” Emily says. “We started that process being behind a screen, and now that we don't need to be, we're choosing to, because it's more comfortable. Now it's hard to let that go.”

Yet she hasn't pursued taking a step back from social media or questioned whether there's another way. When I ask whether her friends are happy with a largely online social life, she's not sure. “I've never really thought about talking to them about it,” says Emily. “But I'd be curious.”

“Being online is actually really safe, compared to doing something in real life.” 

Curtis, now 17, was in seventh grade when the pandemic started. He, too, noticed how the isolation made his generation more emotionally risk-averse. “Ever since the pandemic, teenagers have been more afraid to actually show how they felt,” he says. “For years, most of us were trapped in our rooms all day, stuck on a computer, so the only way to express ourselves was through an anime profile picture on TikTok or comments on Instagram posts, [so our] idea of expressing emotions and feelings has been kind of limited.” 

Restricting romance to the online sphere is a way of exerting control and protecting yourself, says Curtis, who lives in Kentucky. “Being online is actually really safe, compared to doing something in real life.” 

That guardedness is especially true for boys, who often both have less experience articulating their emotions and face greater social risk from doing so. 

Daniel A. Cox, director and founder of the Survey Institute on American Life and author of Uncoupled, a forthcoming book about the growing gender divide between young adults, believes that young men in particular struggle when it comes to romance. They have no manual for how to be truly intimate. “For boys and young men, friendships are much more activity-based and competitive, which doesn't allow them space to share feelings of vulnerability and insecurity.”

As for Curtis, the emotional risk of putting himself out there feels especially acute as a queer teen. He's had one serious crush, which started when he and a classmate started chatting more sophomore year. 

Two years later, Curtis still thinks about him. When he sees a video of two queer teenagers on social media, he imagines him and his crush in their place.

Their romance followed all the same, enigmatic beats: They started sending each other songs, then memes, then baby photos; soon, they were messaging every day and FaceTiming late at night. They'd find each other at lunch and look forward to seeing each other in the hallways. The crush, who Curtis describes as a “popular kid,” would physically hang onto Curtis in front of his athlete friends and described Curtis as his best friend. This went on for a whole school year. Curtis said his friends said, ‘“It's obvious he's putting in effort to show that he cares about you.'”

Then they just…stopped texting. Two years later, Curtis still thinks about him. When he sees a video of two queer teenagers on social media, he imagines him and his crush in their place.

Curtis thinks about messaging his long-time crush, to share his feelings and get closure. But he'd never do it in person. “In real life, I'd probably be shaking, and my heart would be beating really hard. … I'd feel so crazy and emotional,” he says. “But if I tell him online, I could block him, or go to school the next day and ignore [him].”

Curtis is hopeful about finding a different kind of relationship once he starts college, but his first real experience with romance has made him undeniably wary. That's a sentiment that Phillips often hears in her conversations with teenagers. Moreover, a study conducted in 2023 by the dating app Hinge found that 56 percent of Gen Z respondents didn't pursue relationships because they were worried about rejection. “If I tried once and it didn't happen, why should I try again?” says Curtis. “If I put in as much effort as I could at 14…it didn't work out, why should I try to do it again at 17?”

When you talk to Gen Z teenagers, it's clear that they long for romance and intimacy, even if they feel that they have no playbook for it. 

“The news portrays us as engaging in it less, but people still want romantic relationships,” says Pau. She'd like to experience romance, but mostly feels like she hasn't been able to think about it very much.

“Especially with the current political climate, the economic climate, and even just recovering from Covid — it's kind of difficult to think of being in a relationship,” says Pau. “There's so much going on with my family and immigration status, it's very difficult to just breathe.” She's already experienced so much vulnerability that she's hesitant to seek out more through romantic relationships.

In a way, the situationships that reign among young people today feel more like the pseudo-relationships that could play out in middle school, as young people try on what a relationship could feel like and test the boundaries of what it means to date before they really experience it. “The pandemic stunted our growth a little; we lost two years of our life,” says Ren, who grew up in California.

She still wants a boyfriend: a primary person, someone who has her back, someone to explore physical intimacy with. In the meantime, she's made a close group of friends, with whom she shares emotional intimacy. 

As long as young people are having deeply meaningful connections through friendships, Phillips allows that it may not be so bad not to experience romance or sexual intimacy. It's not a big deal if you don't date or hook up in high school; that doesn't predict worse outcomes socially or otherwise. What does worry Phillips is if teenagers aren't finding closeness in platonic relationships, either. “If this is the narrative: I can't do these things because they're risky and connection is painful, [then] I'm more worried about that than whether a sixteen-year-old decides to have a boyfriend or a girlfriend,” she says. 

For Ren, her friendships are deeply meaningful — and they help her make sense of why romance hasn't happened for her yet, as she approaches her second year in college. “I thought a high school relationship was normal until I got here, and I realized that being in relationships or kissing or having sex isn't as normal anymore,” she says. “It makes me feel better — it's the culture now.”

Fossil fuel sites can emit a powerful greenhouse gas long after they shut down.

Odorless and colorless, methane is a gas that is easy to miss — but it's one of the most important contributors to global warming. It can trap up to 84 times as much heat as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, though it breaks down much faster. Measured over 100 years, its warming effect is about 30 times that of an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide. 

That means that over the course of decades, it takes smaller amounts of methane than carbon dioxide to heat up the planet to the same level. Nearly a third of the increase in global average temperatures since the Industrial Revolution is due to methane, and about two-thirds of those methane emissions comes from human activity like energy production and cattle farming. It's one of the biggest and fastest ways that human beings are warming the Earth. 

But the flip side of that math is that cutting methane emissions is one of the most effective ways to limit climate change. 

In 2021, more than 100 countries including the United States committed to reducing their methane pollution by at least 30 percent below 2020 levels by 2030. But some of the largest methane emitters like Russia and China still haven't signed on, and according to a new report from the International Energy Agency, global methane emissions from energy production are still rising. 

Yet the tracking of exactly how much methane is reaching the atmosphere isn't as precise as it is for carbon dioxide. “Little or no measurement-based data is used to report methane emissions in most parts of the world,” according to the IEA. “This is a major issue because measured emissions tend to be higher than reported emissions.” It's also hard to trace methane to specific sources — whether from natural sources like swamps, or from human activities like fossil fuel extraction, farming, or deforestation. 

Researchers are gaining a better understanding of where methane is coming from, surveilling potential sources from the ground, from the sky, and from space. It turns out a lot of methane is coming from underappreciated sources, including coal mines and small oil and gas production facilities. 

The report also notes that while there are plenty of low-cost tools available to halt much of this methane from reaching the atmosphere, they're largely going unused. 

The United States, the world's third largest methane-emitting country, has seen its methane emissions slowly decline over the past 30 years. However, the Trump administration is pushing for more fossil fuel development while rolling back some of the best bang-for-buck programs for mitigating climate change, which will likely lead to even more methane reaching the atmosphere if left unchecked. 

Methane is the dominant component of natural gas, which provides more than a third of US energy. It's also found in oil formations. During the drilling process, it can escape wells and pipelines, but it can also leak as it's transported and at the power plants and furnaces where it's consumed. 

The oil and gas industry says that methane is a salable product, so they have a built-in incentive to track it, capture it, and limit its leaks. But oil developers often flare methane, meaning burn it off, because it's not cost-effective to contain it. That burned methane forms carbon dioxide, so the overall climate impact is lower than just letting the methane go free. 

And because methane is invisible and odorless, it can be difficult and expensive to monitor it and prevent it from getting out. As a result, researchers and environmental activists say the industry is likely releasing far more than official government estimates show. 

Methane also seeps out from coal mines — more methane, actually, than is released during the production of natural gas, which after all is mostly methane. Ember, a clean energy think tank, put together this great visual interactive showing how this happens. 

The short version is that methane is embedded in coal deposits and as miners dig to expose coal seams, the gas escapes, and continues to do so long after a coal mine reaches the end of its operating life. Since coal miners are focused on extracting coal, they don't often keep track of how much methane they're letting out, nor do regulators pay much attention.

According to Ember, methane emissions from coal mines could be 60 percent higher than official tallies. Abandoned coal mines are especially noxious, emitting more than abandoned oil and gas wells. Added up, methane emitted from coal mines around the world each year has the same warming effect on the climate as the total annual carbon dioxide emissions of India.

Alarmed by the gaps in the data, some nonprofits have taken it upon themselves to try to get a better picture of methane emissions at a global scale using ground-based sensors, aerial monitors, and even satellites. In 2024, the Environmental Defense Fund launched MethaneSAT, which carries instruments that can measure methane output from small, discrete sources over a wide area. 

Ritesh Gautam, the lead scientist for MethaneSAT, explained that the project revealed some major overlooked methane emitters. Since launching, MethaneSAT has found that in the US, the bulk of methane emissions doesn't just come from a few big oil and gas drilling sites, but from many small wells that emit less than 100 kilograms per hour.

“Marginal wells only produce 6-7 percent of [oil and gas] in the US but they disproportionately account for almost 50 percent of the US oil and gas production-related emissions,” Gautam said. “These facilities only produce less than 15 barrels of oil equivalent per day, but then there are more than half a million of these just scattered around the US.”

The good news is that many of the tools for containing methane from the energy industry are already available. “Around 70 percent of methane emissions from the fossil fuel sector could be avoided with existing technologies, often at a low cost,” according to the IEA methane report. 

For the oil and gas industry, that could mean something as simple as using better fittings in pipelines to limit leaks and installing methane capture systems. And since methane is a fuel, the sales of the saved methane can offset the cost of upgrading hardware. Letting it go into the atmosphere is a waste of money and a contributor to warming. 

Capturing or destroying methane from coal mines isn't so straightforward. Common techniques to separate methane from other gases require heating air, which is not exactly the safest thing to do around a coal mine — it can increase the risk of fire or explosion. But safer alternatives have been developed. “There are catalytic and other approaches available today that don't require such high temperatures,” said Robert Jackson, a professor of earth system science at Stanford University, in an email. 

However, these methods to limit methane from fossil fuels are vastly underused. Only about 5 percent of active oil and gas production facilities around the world deploy systems to zero out their methane pollution. In the US, there are also millions of oil and gas wells and hundreds of thousands of abandoned coal mines whose operators have long since vanished, leaving no one accountable for their continued methane emissions. 

“If there isn't a regulatory mandate to treat the methane, or a price on it, many companies continue to do nothing,” Jackson said. And while recovering methane is ultimately profitable over time, the margins aren't often big enough to make the upfront investment of better pipes, monitoring equipment, or scrubbers worthwhile for them. “They want to make 10–15 percent on their money (at least), not save a few percent,” he added.

And rather than getting stronger, regulations on methane are poised to get weaker. The Trump administration has approved more than $119 million to help communities reclaim abandoned coal mines. However, the White House has also halted funding for plugging abandoned oil and gas wells and is limiting environmental reviews for new fossil fuel projects. Congressional Republicans are also working to undo a fee on methane emissions that was part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. With weaker incentives to track and limit methane, it's likely emissions will continue to rise in the United States. That will push the world further off course from climate goals and contribute to a hotter planet.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","'I've never seen that before': My chaotic robotaxi ride through London with Wayve's CEO","https://www.businessinsider.com/i-took-chaotic-robotaxi-ride-through-london-impressive-one-question-2025-6","Mon, 16 Jun 2025 10:23:00 GMT","

Self-driving taxis are now a common sight on the streets of San Francisco and Shanghai — but in London, the city's famous black cabs still rule the roost.

That may not be the case for much longer. Earlier in June, Uber announced it would begin trialling driverless taxis in the UK's capital, in partnership with Microsoft and Nvidia-backed self-driving startup Wayve.

As the two companies prepare to launch their robotaxi service, I took a test drive through the busy streets of central London in one of the self-driving Ford Mach-Es Wayve has been testing in the city.

The robotaxi dealt with everything London's chaotic driving environment could throw at it, with Wayve CEO Alex Kendall, who joined for the ride, saying it was one of the more eventful trips he'd taken.

After a quick look around Wayve's Kings Cross base, we hopped in a Ford Mach-E equipped with the company's ""AI driver"" self-driving system.

Wayve's upcoming robotaxi service with Uber will be fully driverless, but for now, the company is testing with safety drivers who take over if the robotaxi runs into problems.

I sat in the front seat, alongside a big red button that disengages the self-driving system (the safety driver on my ride said he'd never had to use it).

The driver drove us out of the gates of Wayve's HQ and then, with a sharp buzzing noise, he removed his hands from the wheel, and the robotaxi took over.

London's streets are famously complex, so much so that taxi drivers are required to learn thousands of them off by heart in a 150-year-old exam known as ""The Knowledge.""

The city's hodgepodge of Roman and Victorian roads are a mess of cycle lanes and pedestrian crossings, with complex road layouts that often serve more as a rough guide than a rulebook for the millions of drivers passing through the city each day.

For Wayve, that complexity is the point. The company says its AI driver — which runs on an end-to-end AI model, an approach also adopted by Tesla — is capable of generalizing and reacting to the physical world in the same way a human would, unlike rivals like Waymo, which rely on high-definition maps and sensors.

Kendall said that this allows Wayve's software to drive anywhere, even places it hasn't seen before, and deal with the kind of unexpected encounters that are an everyday occurrence on the streets of a major city like London.

""I can't wait to see another autonomy company come into London because I think it's extremely challenging,"" said Kendall.

""The advantage of starting in London is that we've been forced to develop a system that can operate on complex roads and deal with all of these unexpected scenarios,"" he added.

In the first few minutes of our drive, we encountered multiple jaywalkers, including several who darted out across the street without warning in front of the robotaxi. We also had to inch through narrow gaps between rows of parked cars.

Perhaps understandably, Wayve's robotaxi was more cautious than your average Uber driver. On one occasion, the robotaxi came to a jerky stop at an amber light when it may have had enough time to go through.

Sometimes, that caution was too much for London's impatient commuters. One maneuver that saw the car slowly navigate a tight gap between a set of roadworks and a row of traffic drew an irate honk from the car behind, which was clearly keen for us to hurry up.

Wayve has been testing its autonomous vehicles on the streets of London for years, but they still run into the odd surprise. Around halfway into our drive, we came across a roadblock as a team of workers trimmed an overhanging tree.

In the seat behind me, Kendall broke off from answering my question and leaned forward to see how the car would deal with the falling branches and the worker directing traffic — but the robotaxi barely paused, successfully reading hand signals to stop and proceed and accelerating past the quizzical stares of the maintenance crew.

""I've never seen that before,"" said Kendall as the robotaxi exited the roadblock, also dodging a tractor reversing along the road.

Our route skirted the edge of Soho, London's central nightlife district, and went past the entrance to the British Museum, a narrow street packed with tourists, taxi drivers, and roadworks.

Perhaps the most impressive moment of the drive came on this road, one of London's busiest. The robotaxi came to a stop at a crosswalk in near constant use as a huge crowd of pedestrians streamed toward the Museum.

Working out the safe moment to move forward would be daunting even for a human driver, but the car spotted an opening and moved through the zebra crossing quickly, avoiding traffic building up behind us.

""Lots of autonomy systems, I think, would be stuck here for hours,"" said Kendall, explaining that moments like this required the robotaxi's AI software to track and predict the activity of dozens of pedestrians.

As the drive went on, the activity around us occasionally passed into the bizarre. While coming to a stop at a red light, we narrowly avoided being hit by a small piece of metal that fell off the truck in front as it accelerated away.

A pedestrian crossing at the red light kindly picked up the debris and moved it to the side of the road, but it's hard to imagine anyone thinking to simulate a situation so surreal.

For Kendall, incidents like this are proof that robotaxis need to get on as many roads as possible.

After opening offices in Canada, the US, and Japan over the last year, Wayve has now tested its vehicles in 90 cities in the past 90 days, from alpine roads in Switzerland and dirt tracks in rural Italy to bustling cities like Tokyo and Vancouver.

Kendall said for some of those places, Wayve had little to no training data, demonstrating the ability of its software to apply what it has learnt to completely new cities and driving environments.

""If robotaxis are just going to be in affluent areas like the Bay Area, then we've failed as an industry. We've got to make sure this technology is rolled out globally,"" Kendall said.

The launch of a driverless ride-hailing service with Uber in London, which will be the first time Wayve has taken the safety driver out of its vehicles, is a big step toward that vision.

Both companies declined to say when the driverless pilots would begin or which automaker would supply the vehicles for the robotaxi fleet, but Kendall described it as a huge moment for the young British startup and the broader industry.

""It's exciting, it's my life's work. Over 99% of road accidents are due to human error, and this technology can eliminate those,"" he said.

My ride in Wayve's robotaxi ended with the car smoothly negotiating a double roundabout, a fairly common feature on UK roads that is rare in the US. The safety driver took back control to pull into the company's headquarters, the first time he'd touched the wheel since we'd left an hour ago.

After 60 minutes of driving around the centre of one of the world's biggest and most chaotic cities without a hitch, I was impressed, if not completely sold.

While self-driving cars are now a reality, the history of the industry is littered with broken promises, high-profile failures, and impressive tech demos that have failed to pan out.

Saber Fallah, professor of safe AI and autonomy at the University of Surrey, told BI that while Wayve's AI-focused approach to self-driving was ""bold and innovative,"" he was skeptical about how soon the company would be able to build a robotaxi network in a city as complex as London.

""Unlike cities like Phoenix, where many Level 4 trials have taken place, London presents an extremely dynamic and unpredictable environment,"" said Fallah, adding that the vehicles would need to understand informal social cues and context between drivers and reason about their intent.

Fallah said that one issue with Wayve's approach is that the ""black box"" nature of end-to-end AI systems might make it difficult to understand why robotaxis based on this tech make decisions, potentially undermining public trust.

Despite calling the planned robotaxi pilot an ""exciting step"" for self-driving cars in the UK, Fallah warned that Uber and Wayve would have to navigate challenging liability and regulatory issues while building public confidence in the frontier technology.

""Achieving consistent, safe operation without fallback drivers in central London will be an enormous hurdle,"" he added.

Whether Uber and Wayve can run rides like the one I experienced in London a hundred times a day, in rain, sun, fog, and hail, will be the ultimate test.

Until then, Londoners will have to stick to the city's black cabs and iconic red buses to get around.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Get ready for ads on WhatsApp","https://www.businessinsider.com/whatsapp-updates-will-start-showing-ads-2025-6","Mon, 16 Jun 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

More than a decade after Meta spent $19 billion to buy WhatsApp, the world's most popular messaging app is finally starting to look like a business.

Starting Monday, Meta will begin showing ads inside WhatsApp — not in your private chats, but in the app's Updates tab, a feed that half of WhatsApp's 3 billion month users go to each day to view ephemeral ""Status” posts (WhatsApp's version of Instagram Stories), and follow one-way ""Channels"" from creators, sports teams, and businesses. The company is also rolling out paid subscriptions for Channels, letting users pay a fee to access exclusive updates from their favorite creators or organizations.

It's the most significant monetization push in WhatsApp's history and a defining moment for an app that has, until now, largely avoided the ads and commerce tools that power the rest of Meta's empire.

Despite being the world's most popular messaging app, WhatsApp has historically generated a fraction of the revenue that Facebook and Instagram do. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly framed messaging as the company's next big business opportunity, calling it “the next major pillar of our business” after Facebook and Instagram.

“We've been very deliberate about building this Updates tab, which is an optional space within WhatsApp,” Nikila Srinivasan, Meta's head of product for business messaging, told Business Insider in an interview. “We've really been thinking about how we can give people a space to go discover things that they're interested in.”

Meta has long pledged not to put ads inside private WhatsApp chats. In a November 2023 interview, WhatsApp head Will Cathcart said the company “won't put ads in your inbox."" With 1.5 billion users visiting the Updates tab daily, Meta has found a way to make money from the app without breaking that promise.

Ads in Status will allow users to start conversations with businesses directly. Beyond ads, Meta is adding two major money-making tools to WhatsApp: the ability for businesses to pay to promote their Channels in the app and for Channel creators to charge users for exclusive content.

Srinivasan says Meta won't take a cut of that transaction. “At least not for this year, we're not,” she said.

Promoted channels will allow creators and businesses to increase their visibility within WhatsApp's directory of Channels.

""This ability to be discovered in WhatsApp is something that's been a longtime request that we've had from businesses,"" Srinivasan said. ""For a lot of small businesses that run their entire business on WhatsApp, this is a great way to get discovered by people who wouldn't have found them otherwise.""

Meta says it built the new features with privacy at their core. Ads will only appear in the Updates tab, away from private chats, and will be targeted using minimal information like a user's city, language, and activity, such as what Channels they follow or how they interact with ads. The company said that personal messages, calls, and groups remain end-to-end encrypted and cannot be accessed for advertising purposes.

""We've talked for a while now about how we want to build a business that doesn't interrupt your inbox,"" Srinivasan said. ""Given the traction that we saw on the Updates tab, it felt like a good time for us to expand this to a broader ecosystem of businesses and also deliver on what people are going to that tab to do.""

Meta is taking pains to reassure users now, as some might resent advertising in an app where they have their most private conversations. In 2021, an update to WhatsApp's terms of service — meant to clarify how businesses could talk to users — triggered a wave of user backlash and misinformation. The incident showed just how fragile user trust can be, especially in a product built on the promise of privacy.

“This is not in your inbox,” Srinivasan said. “This is only in Updates. You have to go to that tab to actually encounter these experiences.”

WhatsApp already generates revenue from click-to-message ads, which appear on Facebook and Instagram and let users instantly open conversations with businesses on WhatsApp.

For Meta, this is the next step in turning WhatsApp into something bigger than a chat app.

Zuckerberg has long pointed to Asia, where super apps like WeChat let users do everything from shopping to booking flights, as a model. Over the past few years, WhatsApp has slowly added pieces of that vision: shopping catalogs, payments, and customer service tools, among other features. Ads and creator subscriptions are the next step in that journey.

""This is not a pivot,” Srinivasan said. ""It's an evolution.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","This SpaceX alum-founded startup raised $10 million in 36 hours","https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-alum-founded-andrenam-raises-seed-10-million-36-hours-2025-6","Mon, 16 Jun 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Underwater microphones — called hydrophones — spot enemy submarines and have been around for over a century. AndrenaM, a startup using artificial intelligence to analyze sonar data and deliver real-time insights, is seeking to give this legacy defense tool a high-tech upgrade.

""Our vision is to secure the oceans,"" Matej Cernosek, the startup's cofounder and CEO, told Business Insider in an interview. ""We're doing that by building a distributed sensing network — a sonar mesh.""

AndrenaM's $10 million seed round closed in 36 hours. Typically, this process takes early-stage startups weeks, even months. Its rapid fundraise signals just how eager investors are about the new wave of defense tech.

First Round Capital led the fundraise, with participation from Also Capital, Long Journey, Homebrew, and the Colorado School of Mines Venture Fund, among others.

In 2024, Cernosek, a former SpaceX engineer, started the Hawthorne, California-based company with Alex Chu, who is AndrenaM's chief technology officer. The founders met during their first week of college at the Colorado School of Mines, where they studied mechanical engineering. Chu previously worked at a robotics company and as a software engineer at Qualia, a real estate platform.

Despite decades of sonar use, much of the data processing is still manual and analog. ""It's been people in these shacks that have headphones on, looking at a fuzzy screen and analyzing data coming to them in mass,"" Cernosek said.

AndrenaM's eight-person team, which includes former engineers from SpaceX and the defense tech giants Palantir, Anduril, and Saronic, is developing machine-learning-powered software designed to process underwater acoustic data and piece together what's happening in real time.

So far, the startup has been buying hydrophones off the shelf and pairing them with its software, but the team wants to build its own buoys equipped with its tech, which would lower costs and help the team gather more training data for its algorithms.

""We really want to vertically integrate the solution,"" Cernosek said. ""A lot of our competitors are just integrators — they take all these parts from everywhere, patch them together with Band-Aids. It works, but it ends up being a bespoke system that's superexpensive.""

After seeing AndrenaM's pitch deck, Meka Asonye, a partner at First Round Capital, hopped in a plane and flew it (he's a pilot) from San Francisco to Hawthorne to meet the team that same weekend. ""Naturally, we're a startup — we were working,"" Cernosek said, so they took the Saturday meeting. They had another call with First Round that Monday and got a term sheet that night.

""Oftentimes these early-stage companies are drawing things on a napkin, and they're years and years away from being ready,"" Asonye told BI. ""The AndrenaM team is actually deploying stuff off the coast of California, and the technology already works.""

Asonye was also drawn to the company's potential commercial use cases, like port security. Defense tech investors and the Pentagon are increasingly interested in startups that can serve both public and private sector customers.

AndrenaM plans to use the seed funding to double its head count to 16 employees, focusing on hiring software engineers. The company also bought a boat with the funding to start assembling the hardware it hopes to build, Cernosek said.

""If you want to be the forward-deployed engineer here and go on the boat with us and deploy these systems and train them, this is your opportunity,"" Cernosek said. ""You can sit in a cubicle, but do you really want to?""

Much of Cernosek's drive to build a national security startup comes from his personal background. His family immigrated to the US from the Czech Republic during communist rule, an experience that shaped his worldview.

""We live in the best country in the world, and this country has done very well for my family — my parents came here with $60 in their pocket,"" he said. ""I want to build a generational company that will have a massive impact for the United States.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Why YouTube is trying to replace your favorite TV shows","https://www.businessinsider.com/youtube-tv-creators-hollywood-scripted-formats-2025-6","Mon, 16 Jun 2025 12:27:00 GMT","

A new golf comedy called ""Shanked,"" which follows the hijinks at a country club where employees clash with pampered members, made its debut this month. The first episode runs about 20 minutes and resembles a low-budget comedy you might have once seen on Comedy Central.

But it's not on cable. It's on YouTube.

Welcome to 2025, when the big question in Hollywood isn't whether YouTube can work in the living room, but rather, how much of the entertainment landscape can it conquer.

""Shanked"" isn't the only scripted show on YouTube, with top creators like Dhar Mann and Alan Chikin Chow making TV-like series for the platform.

Meanwhile, streamers like Netflix and Amazon's Prime Video are also updating their strategies, both by taking cues from cable TV — with ads and costly live sports — and seeing how they can mine social media for creator talent.

For the creators of ""Shanked,"" YouTube was a no-brainer. Ryan Horrigan of production company London Alley said he saw a lack of low-budget comedies on TV at the same time YouTube was increasingly favoring 20-minute episodic series. Why not a comedy, he thought.

James Lynch, a comedian who co-created and stars in the show, said he felt the lines between entertainment platforms were increasingly blurring.

""We love shows like 'Severance,' but every time I go to a friend's house, there's always something on YouTube,"" he said.

Google-owned YouTube has nurtured a creator economy that Goldman Sachs estimated would grow to about $480 billion by 2027. Many in the entertainment and advertising world dismissed YouTube as a repository for amateur videos and movie trailers until it became the No. 1 viewed platform on TVs, per Nielsen, ahead of the ""real TV"" companies Netflix, Disney, and Prime Video.

As YouTube and TV begin to converge, it looks like the Hollywood system as we know it will never be the same. But how the ecosystem will look when the dust settles is much more difficult to parse.

Lately, YouTube has been rolling out tools and features to encourage creators to make shows for the living room. It's also doing more to match advertisers to creators to support the kinds of shows you're used to seeing on TV.

At Brandcast, YouTube's big annual presentation to the advertising community, it underlined the point by showing off top creators like IShowSpeed and Michelle Khare, who are making episodic series. And it's making a big push to win an Emmy to prove it can support quality TV.

Viewership is one thing, but advertising, the lifeblood of entertainment, is another. Many major brands still want to be associated with buzzy scripted shows and movies that drive the mainstream conversation, like ""The White Lotus,"" and most creators aren't close to that yet. Only a handful, like MrBeast and Dude Perfect, are making Hollywood-style productions. AI tools could reduce that friction, though, by cutting time and costs from video production.

""Creator content is dominating TV watch time — not just on phones, but on the biggest screens in the house, replacing what used to be traditional television. Yet brands are still spending like it's 2015, chasing impressions over impact,"" said Nick Cicero, founder of Mondo Metrics, a media measurement company.

Advertisers are closing the gap, though.

Ad holding company giant WPP recently estimated that creators would earn $185 billion between direct brand deals and platform revenue share, surpassing ad spending on TV companies like Disney and Paramount.

Top ad spender Unilever also said it would move to spend 50% of its advertising on social media platforms, up from about 30%, and work with 20 times more influencers.

YouTube's growth could be a problem for Hollywood, which is built on direct ownership of IP and entertainment that moves the culture but costs a ton.

Studios and streamers aren't spending like they were when everyone was trying to catch Netflix, but they still need new stuff to keep viewers coming back and capture younger audiences. Creator-led shows offer one way forward.

But can they pull it off? There are promising signs.

Amazon is the most prominent example of a company betting huge on a creator. It spent more than $100 million to make MrBeast's ""Beast Games,"" which became its most-watched unscripted show, and just renewed it for two more seasons.

Netflix has done deals with The Sidemen, kids' educator Ms. Rachel, and more. Warner Bros. Discovery's HBO Max has a new reality show starring Jake Paul and his brother, Logan, ""Paul American."" And Disney's Hulu has a hit in ""The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives.""

Entertainment companies have gotten more sophisticated about how they work with creators. They're tapping them for their ideas rather than simply looking for a piece of their audience, in contrast with some past flopped creator experiments. Netflix is looking at YouTubers as producers as well as on-screen talent, an unscripted agent told Business Insider. NBCUniversal's Peacock just announced a slate of shows developed by creators via an accelerator program. Tubi has an initiative called Stubios to nurture up-and-coming filmmakers.

Media and entertainment companies are also looking at other forms of low-cost content, like soapy mini-dramas and video podcasts.

There are challenges, however.

Creators like YouTube because there's no gatekeeper. It gives them a lot of data, lets them own their content, and gives them a relatively generous 55% cut of the ad revenue.

Creator talent reps told BI some of their clients had walked away from potential Netflix deals because the streamer wouldn't budge from the Hollywood playbook, in which it owns ancillary rights to things like e-commerce revenue.

Scott Purdy, a media consultant at KPMG, said entertainment companies would likely start to look at YouTube and other social platforms as potential places to actually launch shows, starting with low-budget fare.

""For most companies, most options are on the table,"" he said.

Meanwhile, producers like Horrigan are blue-skying other creator-led formats to put on YouTube.

""Talent is still going to want to play in both sandboxes, but we're moving up the stack,"" he said. ""What's next — is horror going to be a thing on YouTube, teen romance? I think that's going to be a thing as well.""

Central banks have been selling Treasuries since March, suggesting that they are diversifying away from dollar assets, according to Bank of America Corp.

Treasuries held by global central banks and other official entities in custody at the New York Federal Reserve fell $17 billion in the week through June 11 on average, extending their declines since late March to $48 billion. In addition, foreign holdings in the Fed's reverse repurchase agreement facility have dropped roughly $15 billion since late March.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

An investigation into the complexity of the global telecom system shows weaknesses in the transmission of secret codes sent via SMS.

Every day, millions of people sign in to their email, banking app or social media accounts with both their password and a one-time login code they receive by text message. The codes often arrive with a warning: “Do not share this with anyone.” The recipients of those warnings, though, have no way of knowing who saw it before it got to them.

When companies generate messages with one of these so-called two-factor authentication codes, they almost never send them directly. Instead they outsource the job, passing the codes through a thicket of intermediaries before they arrive at their destinations. Because of inherent weaknesses in SMS—the decades-old technology standard used for text messages—it's possible for entities that handle such messages to see their content. But the complexity of the system means neither the sender nor the recipient can be sure exactly who's handled them along the way.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Producers and traders trying to book ships to load crude oil and fuel from the Persian Gulf have been met with few offers, said shipbrokers and charterers, who asked not to be identified as they're not authorized to speak publicly. Meanwhile, some owners with tankers that had been provisionally chartered as of Friday, pending confirmation of the booking, chose not to extend the agreements into the weekend, one of them said.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

In this article

The Trump Organization on Monday unveiled a mobile phone plan and a $499 smartphone that is set to launch in September.

The new service, Trump Mobile, will offer a $47.45-per-month plan that includes unlimited talk, text and data, as well as roadside assistance and a ""Telehealth and Pharmacy Benefit,"" according to its website.

The company, owned by President Donald Trump, also announced it will sell a ""T1"" smartphone, which appears to feature a gold-colored metal case etched with an American flag.

The new venture is the latest example of Trump's business empire capitalizing on its association with the sitting president.

Both the name of the wireless service — ""The 47 Plan"" — and its monthly price are references to Trump, who was the 45th U.S. president during his first term in office and is now serving as the 47th.

A screenshot on the website of the upcoming phone, meanwhile, displays Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

Like a suite of other products that Trump and his businesses have rolled out during his political career — including watches, sneakers and Bibles — the company's new foray into telecommunications mainly comprises a licensing agreement.

""Trump Mobile, its products and services are not designed, developed, manufactured, distributed or sold by The Trump Organization or any of their respective affiliates or principals,"" the bottom of the website reads.

Critics have raised ethics concerns about the flurry of licensing deals and other branded-merchandise agreements surrounding Trump. But the president and his family continue to pursue lucrative opportunities to expand their portfolio with relatively little downside, financially or politically. 

On Friday, the president reported that he had made more than $8 million in 2024 from various licensing agreements.

The 47 Plan appears to be more expensive than similar plans from established carriers. For instance, Visible, Verizon's budget-friendly offering, sells an unlimited talk, text, data and hotspot plan for $25 per month, while Mint Mobile's 12-month unlimited plan costs $30 monthly.

The Trump Mobile site boasts that its plan offers the ""same coverage as the 3 nationwide phone service carriers"" and that it supports a U.S.-based customer service call center.

A representative who answered the Trump Mobile customer service line Monday morning declined to tell CNBC where the call center was based, citing security reasons.

Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T, the top three U.S. wireless carriers, did not immediately respond to NBC News' requests for comment on the Trump Organization's new phone plan.

The Trump Mobile website says its T1 phone runs on Android 15 and features a 6.8-inch AMOLED screen with a 16-megapixel selfie camera. Its other specs include 12 gigabytes of RAM and 256 gigabytes of internal storage, as well as a 50-megapixel main camera.

Global investors may be underpricing the impact of a conflict between Israel and Iran, market watchers warned on Monday, as stocks rallied despite escalating warfare in the Middle East.

The two regional powers continued trading fire on Monday, marking the fourth consecutive day of fighting since Israel launched airstrikes against Iran last week.

Despite the continued fighting — with hundreds reported dead — global stock markets sustained a positive momentum on Monday, seemingly shrugging off broader concerns about the conflict.

Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, warned on Monday that there was a risk markets were underpricing ""the risk of a major conflagration in the Middle East,"" particularly when it comes to the energy market.

European shares opened broadly higher on Monday, with Asia-Pacific stocks and U.S. stock futures also trading in the green. Even Middle Eastern indexes saw gains on Monday, with the Tel Aviv 35 index last seen trading 1% higher after falling 1.5% last week.

""This is partly because there are so many moving parts and geopolitical considerations, and partly because the potential outcomes are so unthinkable,"" Mould said. ""In a worst case, oil and share prices would be the least of our worries.""

In a Monday morning note, David Roche, a strategist at Quantum Strategy, warned that the conflict between Israel and Iran ""will last longer than the Israeli lightning-strikes that the market is used to.""

Torbjorn Soltvedtp, principal Middle East analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, agreed, saying an escalation remained of ""huge concern.""

""What we have now is very different, and what we're seeing is effectively a war and an open-ended one,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""

""And of course, that is something that has huge implications, not just for the region, but also for energy markets and how they interpret what is happening. You know, minute by minute and day by day.""

Energy markets have moved the most on news of the attacks, as the Israel-Iran conflict stoked supply concerns.



While Friday marked the biggest single-day gain for crude since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, however, global benchmark Brent crude futures — last seen at $73.75 a barrel — were still far below the prices seen in the aftermath of Moscow's incursion into Ukrainian territory.

""A lull is the most likely outcome before later escalation when Iran rejects US Trump's overtures,"" Roche said. ""The market is likely to mistake the lull for lasting peace. I would use the lull to buy into energy assets as a safe haven.""

Some market watchers are taking a somewhat less pessimistic view, however.

In a note on Monday, Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid noted that while both Iran and Israel had traded retaliatory blows, they had so far avoided ""the most extreme escalatory steps.""

""As geopolitical shocks are becoming more frequent it seems it's now at least a yearly occurrence that we refer to our equity strategists' work on the impact of such shocks and how long it takes for the market to recover from them,"" he said.



""The typical pattern is for the S&P 500 to pull back about -6% in 3 weeks after the shock but then rally all the way back in another 3,"" Reid said. ""[Our strategists] believe this incident will likely be milder than this unless we get notable escalation as they highlight that equity positioning is already underweight … and a -6% selloff would need it to fall all the way to the bottom of its usual range.""

Philippe Gijsels, chief strategy officer at BNP Paribas Fortis, told CNBC on Monday that he feels the market is correct in not pricing a huge escalation, such as the U.S. being drawn into the fray, or a blockade of the Strait of Hormuz.

The Strait of Hormuz, nestled between Iran and Oman, is a vital oil transit route through which millions of barrels of oil are transported every day.

""Still, the market reaction has been very modest, so there is room for disappointment if things were to escalate,"" Gijsels conceded on Monday.

In this article

It took 11 years since Facebook acquired it for $19 billion, but Meta is finally bringing ads to WhatsApp, marking a major change for an app whose founders shunned advertising.

Meta announced Monday that businesses will now be able to run so-called status ads on WhatsApp that prompt users to interact with the advertisers via the app's messaging features. The ads will only be shown to users within WhatsApp's ""Updates"" tab to separate the promotions from people's personal conversations. Additionally, Meta will begin monetizing WhatsApp's Channels feature through search ads and subscriptions. 

The debut of ads on the messaging app represents a significant step in Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's plans to make WhatsApp ""the next chapter"" in his company's history, as he told CNBC's Jim Cramer in 2022. The move to monetize WhatsApp also comes amid Meta's high-profile antitrust case with the Federal Trade Commission over the company's blockbuster acquisitions of the messaging app and Instagram.

Already, Meta allows advertisers to run so-called click-to-message ads on Facebook and Instagram that steer users to WhatsApp where they can directly engage with businesses. Messaging between brands and consumers ""should be the next pillar of our business,"" Zuckerberg told analysts in April, adding that WhatsApp now has over 3 billion monthly users, including ""more than 100 million people in the U.S. and growing quickly there.""

Now, companies can run those kinds of ads within WhatsApp itself. The new status ads appear in a user's Updates tab within that tab's ""Status"" feature that can be used to share pictures, videos and text that vanish after 24 hours, akin to Instagram Stories. 

Since Meta bought WhatsApp in 2014, the popular messaging app has continued to grow worldwide. But unlike Facebook, Instagram and most recently Threads, WhatsApp has never allowed advertising.

WhatsApp's co-founders, Jan Koum and Brian Acton, were public in their scorn for the advertising industry, and the duo left Facebook after reportedly clashing with executives who were eager to inject the app with advertising and other practices they shunned.

The social media company does not reveal WhatsApp's specific sales, but analysts have previously estimated the app's revenue to be between $500 million and $1 billion from charging businesses for tools and services so they can message customers on the app.

Meta will ""use very basic information"" to recommend which ads to show WhatsApp users, Nikila Srinivasan, Meta's head of product for business messaging, said Friday. This includes a person's country, city, device, language and data like who they follow or how they interact with ads. 

The company debuted WhatsApp's Updates tab in June 2023 along with an accompanying Channels feature that allows people and organizations to send broadcast messages and updates to their followers as opposed to personal conversations. Meta will also monetize the Channels feature, the company said Monday.

Organizations and people who are Channel administrators will now be able to spend money to boost the visibility of their respective Channels when a person searches for them via a directory, similar to ads on Apple's and Google's app stores.

Additionally, channel administrators will be able to charge users monthly subscription fees to access exclusive updates and content, Meta said Monday. The company will not immediately make money from those monthly subscription fees, but it plans to eventually take a 10% cut of those subscriptions, a spokesperson said.

Meta hopes that by limiting its new ads to WhatsApp's Updates tab it will disrupt users as little as possible, Srinivasan said. Users' status updates as well as personal messages and calls on WhatsApp will remain encrypted, she said.

""We really believe that the Updates tab is the right place for these new features,"" Srinivasan said.

Ongoing trade instability and turmoil in Ukraine and the Middle East are set to dominate talks, as leaders of the world's largest advanced economic powers gather in Canada for this year's Group of Seven summit.

With uncertainty over those major issues largely arising from the White House's economic and foreign policy, allies are likely to ask whether U.S. President Donald Trump stands with them, or against them on major geopolitical points.

The G7 comprises the U.S., U.K., Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan, as well as representatives from the European Union and other guest participants. The leaders of Australia, Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, Ukraine, South Africa and South Korea have also been invited to this year's gathering.

These summits aim to facilitate a consensus on the biggest global economic and geopolitical challenges and to coordinate actions to tackle them.

The problem for the group this year comes from within, however, with Trump's array of trade tariffs and a potential global trade war looming as live threats — barring for the U.K., which signed a trade deal with Washington in May.

The summit takes place while Trump's 90-day pause on ""reciprocal"" tariffs is still in effect, with Japan and the EU looking to strike a deal before the July 9 deadline, when higher trade duties — currently lowered to 10% by Trump in the interim to allow deals to be negotiated — could return with a vengeance.

Canada was hit with a 25% tariff on autos and 50% duty on steel and aluminum imports, while goods not covered by the USMCA trade pact, which includes Mexico, are also subject to duties. Canada retaliated with its own 25% tariff on U.S. imports, although it has suspended some of those in order to protect domestic industries.

Bilateral meetings between Trump and leaders looking for a trade deal are expected to take place at the G7 summit over the next few days, but the odds of any big bang deals being struck are uncertain. Trump appeared confident that there could be progress on agreements, however.

Asked if he planned to announce any trade pacts at the summit as he left the White House on Sunday, Trump said: ""We have our trade deals. All we have to do is send a letter, 'This is what you're going to have to pay.' But I think we'll have a few, few new trade deals,"" in comments reported by The Associated Press.

Host Canada certainly looks to be avoiding any obvious signs of disunity, having abandoned the usual communique that's issued at the end of G7 summits on how the group plans to work together to tackle joint challenges.

This could seek to avoid a repeat of the acrimonious conclusion to the previous summit in Canada back in 2018 when Trump, during his first term in office, retracted the U.S.' support for the joint statement. The summit in France in 2019 was the last gathering Trump attended.

""The G7 was formed fifty years ago so the world's advanced-economy democracies could align on shared economic and geopolitical challenges. But what happens when the cause of instability is coming from inside the G7? That's the question confronting the leaders as they assemble this week in Kananaskis,"" John Lipsky, chair of international economics at the Atlantic Council, said in a research note ahead of the summit. 

""Trump will try to coordinate the [G7] group against China's economic coercion. But the rest of the leaders may turn back to Trump and say that this kind of coordination, which is at the heart of why the G7 works, would be easier if he weren't imposing tariffs on his allies,"" he added.

There is also the thorny issue of support for Ukraine — or Russia's rehabilitation, with Trump on the fence about further sanctions on Moscow — as well as the escalating crisis in the Middle East, where recent attacks between Israel and Iran have left hundreds dead and raised concerns about the global economy.

Israel's staunch ally, the U.S., stepped in to help shoot down Iranian missiles, while other global leaders have called to de-escalate tensions.

This backdrop of tariffs and conflict could well give rise to fireworks at the June summit in Canada, given Trump's often contrarian and mercurial nature, analysts say.

""The last time Trump attended a G7 leaders' summit in Canada, in 2018, he treated it like a reality TV show,"" analysts at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in analysis ahead of the meeting.

""With Trump's tariff war in full swing and targeting the other countries in attendance, this meeting could be even more contentious than his last visit,"" they noted. To avert another disastrous end to the G7 summit, the CSIS said global leaders needed to acknowledge and act upon Trump's concerns ""about U.S. global leadership.""

""In previous meetings, G7 members have made clear their interest in addressing technological advancements, public health, major wars, and other issues beyond the group's traditional mandate. With many international institutions today paralyzed by geopolitical rivalries, the world needs concerted action now more than ever,"" they noted.

Both Iran and Israel issued new evacuation orders Monday as the two regional powers continued firing missiles at each other for a fourth straight day.

Monday evening local time, the Israel Defense Forces warned residents in parts of northern Tehran that the Israeli army will attack Iran's military infrastructure there in the coming hours.

Meanwhile, Iranian state media reported that the country's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps announced it will launch its own attacks against Israel's military infrastructure in the Bnei Brak area of eastern Tel Aviv, according to NBC News.

""Your presence in this area puts your life at serious risk,"" the Guard said, in a statement that NBC reported.

Israel's defense minister warned earlier Monday that Tehran will ""pay the price"" for its fresh missile onslaught.

A live broadcast of the Islamic Republican of Iran News Network was interrupted Monday evening when the studio appeared to be struck by a missile. Video of the moment shows a news anchor abruptly stop speaking and leave her desk as debris and smoke billow into the frame.

Fire exchanges have continued since Israel's Friday attack against Iran, with Iranian media reporting Tehran's latest strikes hit Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Haifa, home to a major oil refinery. CNBC has reached out to operator Bazan for comment on the state of operations at the Haifa plant, amid reports of damage to Israel's energy infrastructure.

Iran's Guard said overnight it deployed ""innovative methods"" that ""disrupted the enemy's multi-layered defense systems, to the point that the Zionist air defense systems engaged in targeting each other,"" according to a statement obtained by NBC News.

Israel has widely depended on its highly efficient Iron Dome missile defense system to fend off attacks throughout regional conflicts — but even it can be overwhelmed if a large number of projectiles are fired.

On Monday, the Israel Defense Forces claimed they had ""achieved full aerial superiority over Tehran's skies"" after previously saying they had deployed 50 fighter jets and aircraft in a coordinated strike mission. CNBC could not independently verify the report.

Iran has long struggled with an ageing aircraft fleet and has previously turned to Russia for fighter jet purchases.

The fresh hostilities are front-of-mind for investors, who have been weighing the odds of further escalation in the conflict and spillover into the broader oil-rich Middle East, amid concerns over crude supplies and the key shipping lane through the Strait of Hormuz connecting the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.

Oil prices retained the gains of recent days and at 1:11 p.m. London time, Ice Brent futures with August delivery were trading at $73.46 per barrel, down 1.04% from the previous trading session. The Nymex WTI contract with July expiry was at $72.14 per barrel, 1.15% lower.

Elsewhere, however, markets showed initial signs of shrugging off the latest hostilities early on Monday.

Spot prices for gold, a key safe-haven asset, fell nearly 1% to about $3,419 per ounce by 12:20 p.m. ET on Monday after nearly notching a two-year-high earlier in the session.

Tel Aviv share indices rose around the same time, with the blue-chip TA-35 up 1.82% and the wider TA-125 up 2.64% .

European and U.S. stock markets also opened higher.

Luis Costa, global head of EM sovereign credit at Citigroup Global Markets, signaled the muted reaction could be, in part, attributed to hopes of a brisk resolution to the conflict.

""So markets are obviously, you know, bearing in mind all potential scenarios. There are obviously potentially very bad scenarios in this story,"" he told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Monday. ""But there is still a way out in terms of, you know, a faster resolution and bringing Iran to the table, or a short continuation here, of a very surgical and intense strike by the Israeli army.""

As of Monday morning, Israel's national emergency service Magen David Adom reported four dead and 87 injured following rocket strikes at four sites in ""central Israel,"" reporting collapsed buildings, fire and people trapped under debris.

Accusing Tehran of targeting civilians in Israel to prevent the IDF from ""continuing the attack that is collapsing its capabilities,"" Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz, a close longtime ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said in a Google-translated social media update that ""the residents of Tehran will pay the price, and soon.""

He clarified in a later Google-translated update that ""the residents of Tehran will be forced to pay the price of dictatorship and evacuate their homes from areas where it will be necessary to attack regime targets and security infrastructure in Tehran.""

The IDF on Sunday said it had in turn ""completed a wide-scale wave of strikes on numerous weapon production sites belonging to the Quds Force, the IRGC and the Iranian military, in Tehran.""

CNBC could not independently verify developments on the ground.

The U.S.' response is now in focus, given its close support and arms provision to Israel, the unexpected cancellation of Washington's latest nuclear deal talks with Iran, and President Donald Trump's historically hard-hitting stance against Tehran during his first term.

Trump, who has been pushing Iran for a deal over its nuclear program, has weighed in on the conflict, opposing an Israeli proposal to kill Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, according to NBC News.

Discussions about the conflict are expected to take place during the ongoing meeting of the G7, encapsulating Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., along with the European Union.

The stands of at least two major Israeli defense firms were blocked off to attendees at the Paris Air Show on Monday, in a move Israel said was ordered by the French government following a dispute over the displays.

Boards were placed around the pavilions of firms including Elbit Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), which were showcasing examples of military hardware. The booths of Rafael and Uvision were also shuttered, according to Reuters. CNBC has not independently verified this report.

""Last night, just one day before the Paris Air Show opened in Le Bourget Airport, exhibition organizers acting on behalf of the French government ordered the removal of offensive weapons systems from Israeli defense industry pavilions — breaking with standard practice at defense exhibitions worldwide,"" Israel's Defense Ministry said in a statement.

The ministry said it had told the air show organizers that it rejected the demand, and that the conference staff responded by erecting black walls overnight, blocking the pavilions for the start of the event Monday.

""This outrageous and unprecedented decision reeks of policy-driven and commercial considerations... The French are hiding behind supposedly political considerations to exclude Israeli offensive weapons from an international exhibition - weapons that compete with French industries,"" it said.

CNBC has contacted the Paris Air Show organizers and the French government for comment.

Israeli defense firms have been promoting new products set to unveil at the Paris event — one of the biggest in the aviation world — such as Elbit's PAWS-2 (HR) infrared missile warning system.

Defense is a major focus in Paris this year amid geopolitical tensions and pledges for higher European security spending, along with relatively subdued demand by commercial airlines to place major new orders given existing backlogs.

Other defense firms present at the show include the U.S.'s Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, European missile manufacturer MBDA and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, while hundreds of military delegations are set to attend.

""Last night, after our booth was set up and ready for the show, we were asked to remove some of our systems from the booth,"" IAI's President and CEO Boaz Levy said in a statement.

""We tried to negotiate with them, but it seems these orders came from the highest levels in Paris,"" Levy said, adding the company had received authorization to participate in the show and complied with organizers' requests. The IAI team was blocked from entering the booth, he noted.

Levy said he was ""shocked"" by the decision and alleged discrimination.

The move comes amid escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, with deadly air strikes between the countries continuing for a fourth day on Monday. Israel launched a series of strikes Friday targeting locations it said were related to Iran's nuclear program, killing several senior military officials.

France's government and President Emmanuel Macron have meanwhile increased their criticism of Israel over its ongoing military operation in Gaza in recent months, with a joint statement from the United Kingdom, France and Canada in May calling the level of human suffering there ""intolerable.""

Shares of French fashion house Kering popped as much as 10% on Monday on reports that it has appointed industry outsider Luca de Meo as group CEO.

It comes as the owner of beleaguered brands Gucci and Saint Laurent embarks on the latest phase of its turnaround effort.

Auto veteran de Meo's departure as CEO of Renault was confirmed Sunday, with the French carmaker saying in a statement that he was stepping down ""to take on new challenges outside the automotive sector."" He will remain in post until July 15.

De Meo's move to Kering was first reported by French newspaper Le Figaro on Sunday. Kering declined to comment on the reports when contacted by CNBC.

Kering shares were trading up 10.4% by 1:15 p.m. London time as investors and analysts cheered the reports. Renault shares, meanwhile, shed 7%.

""Brand management and marketing are [de Meo's] forte, which dovetails with what the luxury industry does,"" Bernstein analysts wrote in a note Monday.

De Meo is seen as having a strong track record, having worked in the auto sector for over 30 years, including at Toyota, Fiat and Volkswagen. The Italian is largely credited with Renault's turnaround during his five years at the helm, with shares up over 90% over the period.

The challenges facing the luxury sector nevertheless loom large, with Kering among the biggest laggards as shoppers have fallen out of love with its star Gucci label. Kering shares have shed over 60% in the last two years, sparked by a series of profit warnings and designer changes at Gucci.

Kering's current CEO and chairman François-Henri Pinault, a member of the family that controls the group, has held the top jobs for two decades but is actively working on his succession, according to Reuters, citing sources. Pinault reportedly intends to split the roles of chair and CEO, according to the sources. It was unclear whether he will remain chair.

Thomas Chauvet, senior equity analyst at Citi, commended de Meo's turnaround of Renault, including his embrace of technological innovation and the brand's elevation. However, he noted that the challenges of the prospective new role would be significant.

""Execution of luxury brand turnarounds has become more complex, lengthy, costly, and far less public-market-friendly, reflecting consumer preference for top brands rather than those in transition and significant P&L disruption from greater investment commitment,"" he wrote in a note.

""There is still a considerable amount of work ahead at Gucci and Saint Laurent ... to rejuvenate both brands and generate a steady stream of revenue and cash flow for the group, which, if achieved, could result in significant multiple re-rating,"" he added.

In April, Kering posted a worse-than-expected 14% year-on-year decline in first quarter sales and pointed to macroeconomic headwinds ahead. Sales at Gucci, which make up nearly half of group revenues, led losses, falling 25% on a comparable basis.

Gucci in particular has suffered several consecutive quarters of weak sales, as its designs have fallen out of favor with shoppers, while its high exposure to the Chinese consumer has seen it hard hit by a recent downturn in the once lucrative Asian market.

In a bid to revive the ailing brand's fortunes, Kering in March appointed Demna Gvasalia as Gucci's new artistic director, joining internally from smaller label Balenciaga. However, a series of controversies associated with his earlier designs have so far prompted a cautious response from investors. His designs are expected to take effect from the Spring/Summer 2026 collections onward.

European leaders are looking to Southeast Asia with renewed interest amid Washington's aggressive tariff agenda, but experts warn that the state of regional trade ties makes it challenging to disrupt the U.S. or China's hold.

Southeast Asia is in a predicament: its ally China is ramping up its advances in the South China Sea, with state-of-the-art Chinese bomber planes. spotted in the disputed Paracel Islands in the region late last month as tensions flare with the Philippines. Meanwhile, its other ally, the U.S., hangs the threat of tariffs over the world, with uncertainty mounting as a 90-day reprieve is set to expire in July.

Europe is now seizing the opportunity to surface as an alternative ally to emerging Asian nations, with French President Emmanuel Macron calling for stronger ties between the blocs at the 2025 Shangri-La Dialogue that wrapped up earlier this month.

Southeast Asia brings Europe the opportunity to access another market for its defense sector, according to Bob Herrera-Lim, managing director at Teneo. Ifri's Pajon adds that the region could also provide Europe a diversified supply chain to hedge against economic reliance on the U.S. or China and significant raw material reserves essential for the EU's green and digital transition.

Europe is ambitious in its hopes for emerging Asia, but analysts nevertheless doubt it can overtake the U.S. or China's influence in the region.

""Europe, on its own, can offer Southeast Asia a valuable option to hedge against the risks of overdependence on either China or the United States,"" Céline Pajon, head of Japan and Indo-Pacific Research at Ifri's Center for Asian Studies, told CNBC by email.

While ties span more than half a century, Southeast Asian and European relations have been mired in various challenges that Teneo's Herrera-Lim attributes to factors such as geographic distance and diverging views over politics or the environment.

In his keynote speech at the 2025 Shangri-La Dialogue, Macron called for stronger ties between Europe and the Indo-Pacific's ""new special relationship."" He stressed that both blocs are facing the ""potential erosion of long-time alliances"" and the threat of countries vying for control or resorting to force, drawing direct parallels between China's advances in the South-China Sea and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 

Yet similar experiences alone might not be enough to sway emerging Asia away from the U.S. or China, according to Herrera-Lim.

""Form follows function in Southeast Asia,"" he told CNBC in a call, ""Relationships are built on economic ties in Southeast Asia, more than anything else.""

While the EU has trade ties with Singapore and Vietnam, talks for other bilateral deals or an EU-ASEAN wide free trade agreements (FTA) have been stalled for years, and Ifri's Pajon said that the bloc ""still has progress to make"" in increasing its presence and investment in the region.

Meanwhile, Beijing remains the Southeast Asia's largest trading partner since 2009, with total goods in trade reaching $982.3 billion in 2024. The U.S. follows behind in second place, with an estimated $476.8 billion goods in trade last year. The EU trails behind in third place, with roughly 258.7 billion euros ($299.7 billion) of goods in trade over the same period.

Without any meaningful reform or the promise of increased trade in the future, Herrera-Lim said that it will be difficult for Europe to compete against the bloc's established trading partners. 

""If in the next week or next month, China says, 'We're doing reforms so that domestic markets are opened up in China for Southeast Asian goods,' [then] Southeast Asian countries would line up to get access to the Chinese market. Independent of their politics around many of these issues,"" he said.

While Europe might not be able to replace the U.S. or China in emerging Asia, it can nevertheless offer transparent, reliable partnerships that aren't about zero-sum competition, Lizza Bomassi Research Analyst at the European Union Institute for Security Studies (EUISS), told CNBC by email.

""Europe's value proposition lies in being a reliable partner in critical areas like energy security, green infrastructure, and digital governance,"" she said, ""These are areas where Southeast Asian countries want to diversify and build resilience, especially given concerns about overdependence.""

Ifri's Pajon said that strengthening ties with Europe would allow Southeast Asia to diversify its strategic partnerships and enhance their capacity to resist hegemonic pressures.

""The presence of more partners, including Europe, raises the diplomatic and reputational costs for China to escalate [territorial disputes in the region], particularly given Beijing's emphasis on a 'peaceful rise',"" Bomassi said. 

""In this context, the EU-ASEAN partnership isn't about hard military deterrence, but it serves as a crucial symbolic defence mechanism. It reinforces that Southeast Asia isn't isolated and has multiple partners, making the region more resilient to coercion,"" she added.

U.S. Treasury yields were relatively unchanged Monday as global markets continue to react to deadly air strikes being exchanged between Israel and Iran.

The 2-year Treasury yield rose less than 1 basis point to 3.96%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury was less than 1 basis point higher at 4.43%.

One basis point equals 0.01%. Bond yields and prices move inversely.

The moves follow Treasury yields climbing sharply on Friday after Israel launched strikes on Iran, targeting locations it said were linked to its nuclear program. Initial market moves saw oil prices spike, the U.S. dollar and gold rally, and stock markets decline.

Tensions showed little sign of abating over the weekend and into Monday, as casualties mounted on both sides and scheduled talks on Iran's nuclear program were canceled.

Investors later grew optimistic Monday that the conflict wouldn't intensify after The Wall Street Journal reported that Iran has been signaling through Arab intermediaries that it would be open to resuming negotiations.

Crude oil prices were volatile after Israeli unmanned aerial vehicles struck the South Pars gas field in southern Iran on Saturday. After trading above $77 per barrel overnight, U.S. West Texas Intermediate was down more than 1% to $72.04 a barrel. Global benchmark Brent was also down more than 1% at $73.25 a barrel.

The prior rise in oil rates had stoked fears of a resurgence in U.S. inflation. Investors were already on edge over the prospect of price rises in light of White House tariff policy, though the May consumer price index reading came in cooler than expected.

The Federal Reserve will hold its latest policy meeting this week. The market is expecting a 100% chance of a rate hold, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

Taiwan has added China's Huawei and SMIC to its trade blacklist in a move that further aligns it with U.S. trade policy and comes amid growing tensions with Beijing. 

The two leading Chinese chip firms have been put on Taiwan's ""Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List,"" along with many of their international subsidiaries.

Taiwan's current regulations require licenses from regulators before domestic firms can ship products to parties named on the entity list. 

In a statement on its website, Taiwan's International Trade Administration said that Huawei and SMIC were among the 601 new foreign entities, blacklisted due to their involvement in arms proliferation activities and other national security concerns.

Huawei and SMIC are also on a U.S. trade blacklist and have been impacted by Washington's sweeping controls on advanced chips. Companies such as contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co already follow U.S. export restrictions. 

However, the addition of Huawei and SMIC to the Taiwan blacklist is likely aimed at the reinforcement of this policy and a tightening of existing loopholes, Ray Wang, an independent semiconductor and tech analyst, told CNBC. 

He added that the new domestic export controls could also raise the punishment for any potential breaches in the future. 

TSMC had been embroiled in controversy in October last year when semiconductor research firm TechInsights found a TSMC-made chip in a Huawei AI training card. 

Following the discovery, the U.S. Commerce Department ordered TSMC to halt Chinese clients' access to chips used for AI services, according to a report from Reuters. TSMC could also reportedly face a $1 billion as penalty to settle a U.S. investigation into the matter.

Huawei has been working to create viable alternatives to Nvidia's general processing units used for AI. But, experts say the company's advancement has been limited by export controls and a lack of scale and capabilities in the domestic chip ecosystem. 

Still, Huawei is believed to have acquired several million GPU dies from TSMC for its AI chips by using previous loopholes before they were discovered, according to Paul Triolo, partner and senior vice president for China at advisory firm DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group. 

A die refers to a small piece of silicon material that serves as the foundation for building processors and contains the intricate circuitry and components necessary to perform computations. 

According to Brady Wang, associated director at Counterpoint Research, while the latest export restrictions on SMIC and Huawei are expected to have minimal direct impact on TSMC's business, the move from the Taiwanese government carries ""significant symbolic weight.""

""It underscores the Taiwanese government's intention to align more closely with international efforts — particularly those led by the U.S. — to curb the transfer of advanced technologies,"" he told CNBC.

""Other Taiwanese firms, especially smaller IC design houses or component suppliers that may have maintained indirect ties to Chinese companies such as Huawei or SMIC, could face tighter scrutiny and increased compliance obligations going forward,"" he added.

The Taiwanese government's crackdown on exports to SMIC and Huawei also comes amid tense geopolitical tensions with Mainland China, which regards the democratically governed island as its own territory to be reunited by force, if necessary.

In April, the U.S. reaffirmed its commitment to support the existing status quo as China conducted large-scale military exercises off the coast of the island.

In statements reported by state media on Sunday, China's top political adviser Wang Huning echoed Beijing's position, calling for the promotion of national reunification with Taiwan and for resolute opposition to Taiwan independence.

The CEOs of two major energy companies are monitoring the developments between Iran and Israel — but they aren't about to make firm predictions on oil prices.

Both countries traded strikes over the weekend, after Israel targeted nuclear and military facilities in Iran on Friday, killing some of its top nuclear scientists and military commanders.

Speaking at the Energy Asia conference in Kuala Lumpur on Monday, Lorenzo Simonelli, president and CEO of energy technology company Baker Hughes, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" that ""my experience has been, never try and predict what the price of oil is going to be, because there's one sure thing: You're going to be wrong.""

Simonelli said the last 96 hours ""have been very fluid,"" and expressed hope that there would be a de-escalation in tensions in the region.

""As we go forward, we'll obviously monitor the situation like everybody else is. It is moving very quickly, and we're going to anticipate the aspect of what's next,"" he added, saying that the company will take a wait-and-see approach for its projects.

At the same conference, Meg O'Neill, CEO of Australian oil and gas giant Woodside Energy, likewise told CNBC that the company is monitoring the impact of the conflict on markets around the world.

She highlighted that forward prices were already experiencing ""very significant"" effects in light of the events of the past four days.

If supplies through the Strait of Hormuz are affected, ""that would have even more significant effects on prices, as customers around the world would be scrambling to meet their own energy needs,"" she added.

As of Sunday, the Strait remained open, according to an advisory from the Joint Maritime Information Center. It said, ""There remains a media narrative on a potential blockade of the [Strait of Hormuz]. JMIC has no confirmed information pointing towards a blockade or closure, but will follow the situation closely.""

Iran was reportedly considering closing the Strait of Hormuz in response to the attacks.

O'Neill said that oil and gas prices are closely linked to geopolitics, citing as examples events that date back to World War II and the oil crisis in the 1970s.

Nevertheless, she would not make a firm prediction on the price of oil, saying, ""there's many things we can forecast. The price of oil in five years is not something I would try to put a bet on.""

The Strait of Hormuz is a vital waterway between Iran and the United Arab Emirates. About 20% of the world's oil passes through it.

It is the only sea route from the Persian Gulf to the open ocean, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration has described it as the ""world's most important oil transit chokepoint.""

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is considering significantly expanding its travel restrictions by potentially banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the United States, according to an internal State Department cable seen by Reuters.

Earlier this month, the Republican president signed a proclamation that banned the entry of citizens from 12 countries, saying the move was needed to protect the United States against ""foreign terrorists"" and other national security threats.

The directive was part of an immigration crackdown Trump launched this year at the start of his second term, which has included the deportation to El Salvador of hundreds of Venezuelans suspected of being gang members, as well as efforts to deny enrollments of some foreign students from U.S. universities and deport others.

In an internal diplomatic cable signed by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the State Department outlined a dozen concerns about the countries in question and sought corrective action.

""The Department has identified 36 countries of concern that might be recommended for full or partial suspension of entry if they do not meet established benchmarks and requirements within 60 days,"" the cable sent out over the weekend said.

The cable was first reported by the Washington Post.

Among the concerns the State Department raised was the lack of a competent or cooperative government by some of the countries mentioned to produce reliable identity documents, the cable said. Another was ""questionable security"" of that country's passport.

Some countries, the cable said, were not cooperative in facilitating the removal of its nationals from the United States who were ordered to be removed. Some countries were overstaying the U.S. visas their citizens were being granted.

Other reasons for concern were the nationals of the country were involved in acts of terrorism in the United States, or antisemitic and anti-American activity.

The cable noted that not all of these concerns pertained to every country listed.

""We are constantly reevaluating policies to ensure the safety of Americans and that foreign nationals follow our laws,"" a senior State Department official said, declining to comment on specific internal deliberations and communications.

""The Department of State is committed to protecting our nation and its citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through our visa process,"" the official said.

The countries that could face a full or a partial ban if they do not address these concerns within the next 60 days are: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cote D'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Dominica, Ethiopia, Egypt, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Malawi, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, South Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Tonga, Tuvalu, Uganda, Vanuatu, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

That would be a significant expansion of the ban that came into effect earlier this month. The countries affected were Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.

The entry of people from seven other countries - Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela - has also been partially restricted.

During his first in office, Trump announced a ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations, a policy that went through several iterations before it was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018.

Israel's airstrikes on Iran Friday sent reverberations through financial markets.

Oil prices jumped on fears that supply from Iran, the world's ninth-largest oil producer in 2023, would be disrupted.

Prices of gold, the stalwart shelter in times of crises, rose. Investors flock to the precious metal amid uncertainty because it serves as a stable store of value that is mostly resistant against exogenous shocks, such as inflation or geopolitical conflicts.

And the dollar strengthened, as it is wont to do when the world looks ugly. Recall the dollar smile: The greenback will appreciate when things are really good because investors want in on U.S. risk assets, or when they are really bad because investors want in on the perceived safety of U.S. government bonds.

The fact that the dollar increased in value against other currencies traditionally perceived as safe havens, such as the Swiss franc and Japanese yen, emphasizes the primacy of king dollar, despite rumblings of de-dollarization and concerns over U.S. government debt.

Stocks, the financial risk asset epitomized, fell across markets globally.

Despite the markets giving multiple indications we are entering a period of ugliness — or, at least, volatility — U.S. stocks still appear resilient, and the surge in oil prices only brings us back to where they were about three months ago as prices have been low since, CNBC's Michael Santoli wrote.

The markets have, indeed, mostly shrugged off Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, both of which are still brewing. But with the conflict between Israel and Iran still in its early days, it might pay to be extra cautious in the coming weeks.

Israel strikes IranOn Sunday, Israel launched a series of airstrikes across Iran. That marks the third day of violence between the two nations. Armed conflict broke out when Israel struck Iran's nuclear facilities early Friday local time. In retaliation, Iran launched more than 100 drones toward Israeli territory. Those events are likely just the beginning in a rapid cycle of escalation, according to regional analysts.

Stocks retreat globallyU.S. futures rose Sunday night local time. On Friday, fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East sent stocks lower. The S&P 500 lost 1.13%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.79% and the Nasdaq Composite retreated 1.3%. Europe's Stoxx 600 index dropped 0.89%. Travel and airline stocks on both sides of the Atlantic fell as the outlook for international travel grew cloudy and airlines suspended their Tel Aviv flights.

Safe haven assets in demandInvestors piled into safe-haven assets after Israel's attack on Iran. After weeks of declining, the dollar index, a measurement of the strength of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies, rallied 0.3% on Friday and was up 0.1% as of 7:30 a.m. Singapore time Monday. Spot gold rose 0.38% and gold futures for August delivery were up 0.41% Monday, adding to Friday's gains of 1.4% and 1.5% respectively.

Prices of oil jumpOil prices surged as investors feared a disruption to oil supply from Iran, which produced 3.305 million barrels per day in April, according to OPEC's Monthly Oil Market Report of May. As of Monday morning Singapore time, U.S. crude oil rose 2.22% to $74.62 a barrel, adding to its 7.26% jump on Friday. The global benchmark Brent climbed 2.22% to $75.88 a barrel, following Friday's 7.02% surge.

[PRO] U.S. stocks still look resilientEven though stocks fell on the eruption of conflict between Israel and Iran, the market appeared resilient, wrote CNBC's Michael Santoli. This week, while hostilities between the two Middle East countries will continue weighing on investors' minds, they should not lose sight of the Federal Reserve's rate-setting meeting, which concludes Wednesday.

Boeing Dreamliner crash, military escalations darken mood at Paris Air Show

Kelly Ortberg's first Paris Air Show as Boeing CEO was set to be relatively upbeat.

Under his leadership that began in August, the company has made strides in ramping up production of its bestselling 737 Max jets, increasing cash-generating deliveries of new planes, and indicating that it's turning a corner from a series of manufacturing and safety crises and years of lost ground to rival Airbus. Shares are up more than 13% this year, outpacing the S&P 500.

But after an Air India flight crashed on Thursday, marking the first fatal air disaster of a Boeing Dreamliner, Ortberg canceled plans to go to the massive air show that begins Sunday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Bitcoin buying firms must weigh quitting as risks emerge: VanEck","https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-buying-firms-weigh-stopping-risks-emerge-vaneck","Mon, 16 Jun 2025 06:11:49 GMT","

 Bitcoin-buying public companies should be ready to cancel more buys if the value of their holdings eclipses their market cap, says VanEck crypto researcher Matthew Sigel. 

Public companies buying up Bitcoin should consider sunsetting the tactic altogether if their stock prices drastically drop, according to a VanEck executive who warns that a major Bitcoin-scooping firm is close to being caught out. 

“As some of these companies raise capital through large at-the-market (ATM) programs to buy BTC, a risk is emerging: If the stock trades at or near NAV [net asset value], continued equity issuance can dilute rather than create value,” VanEck's head of digital assets research, Matthew Sigel, said in an X post on Monday.

He added that no public company has traded below the net asset value of its Bitcoin (BTC) for a sustained period, but that Semler Scientific, Inc. (SMLR) “is now approaching parity.”

Semler is a medical technology firm that first bought Bitcoin in May 2024 and has grown its holdings to the 13th largest among public firms, with 3,808 BTC worth $404.6 million.

Bitcoin has continued to hit new highs this year, but Semler's share price has fallen by over 45% this year as of the end of trading on Friday to the same level from when the company first started buying Bitcoin, pulling its market cap down to around $434.7 million.

Semler's multiple of NAV (mNAV), which takes its market capitalization and divides it by its Bitcoin stack, has dropped below 1x to around 0.821x, according to data from Coinkite.

Semler, as is typical among other Bitcoin-buying firms, has undertaken multiple rounds of shares and debt issuance to raise money to buy more Bitcoin, with the company and investors betting the cryptocurrency will lift Semler's stock.

However, as gains may not always be the case, Sigel warned Bitcoin buying firms to “adopt safeguards now, while premiums still exist.”

He advised that companies investing heavily in Bitcoin should pause their at-the-market offerings if their stock trades below a net asset value of 0.95x for at least 10 days.

Those firms should also “prioritize buybacks when BTC appreciates, but the equity fails to reflect that value.”

Finally, Sigel said companies should “launch a strategic review if NAV discount persists.”

“That might include a merger, spinoff, or sunset of the BTC strategy.”

Sigel said that Bitcoin buying companies should align compensation for their executives with the growth of net asset value per share, “not with the size of the Bitcoin position or total share count.”

He again urged company leaders to “act with discipline now, while they still have the benefit of optionality.”

“Once you are trading at NAV, shareholder dilution is no longer strategic. It is extractive,” Sigel said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Early Bitcoin adopter says BTC could have another 100X cycle","https://cointelegraph.com/news/early-bitcoin-adopter-says-btc-could-have-another-100x-cycle","Mon, 16 Jun 2025 16:56:31 GMT","

 Over the next 10 to 20 years, Bitcoin price could increase by another 100X. At least that's what one early BTC investor believes. 

Key takeaways: 

Brad Mills forecasts a 100X Bitcoin rally driven by institutional adoption, halving-induced scarcity, and retail-focused technology developments.

The US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, initiated with 200,000 BTC, marks a policy shift toward long-term government-held Bitcoin monetary policy.

Bitcoin (BTC) maximalist Brad Mills predicts that the market is at the dawn of a “SaylorCycle,” a decade-long growth for BTC driven by Michael Saylor's influence and Strategy's 592,100 treasury haul, which is expected to continue. 

Mills argued that Bitcoin's transition from an “illegitimate asset” to a “must-own asset” could see corporations and nations hoarding it as a treasury and strategic reserve, referring to El Salvador's 6,209 BTC holdings and Saylor's vision of a $200 trillion economy as evidence of bullish momentum.

Mills based this outlook on Bitcoin's 21 million supply cap and halving-induced scarcity, reducing supply by 50% every four years, alongside growing demand. Square, a business arm of Block, Inc., will roll out Lightning Network-powered payments by 2026, cutting merchant fees by 50%, boosting transactional use. Chaumian eCash mints, like CashuBTC, enable scalable, privacy-focused retail savings via tokenized sats. Mills expected these two companies to drive Bitcoin exposure, “enabling small retail savers to accumulate sats.”

The investor forecasts a 100X rise to $10 million over 10-20 years, with bear market drops softening to 50% and bull runs peaking at 200% annually, contrasting BTC's historical 80-90% corrections.

However, Blockstream CEO Adam Back countered with a “parabolic breakout” possibility, suggesting that BTC is currently in a transition period before it breaks away from traditional price cycles. Back suggested that Bitcoin could experience a steeper upward surge, driven by growing adoption and reduced market volatility, rather than following the usual pattern of diminishing returns. 

This idea challenges conventional models like the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) and power-law predictions, hinting that the market might enter a phase where Bitcoin's value could skyrocket, especially as more institutions and corporations embrace it as a treasury asset.

Recent speculation by veteran trader Peter Brandt of a 75% Bitcoin crash, echoing its 2022 drop, faces skepticism from analysts like Pav Hundal, who argued that BTC is currently bolstered by institutional adoption, which differs from 2021. This supports Mills' view of reduced volatility. 

The US government's steps toward establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve mark a potential shift in Bitcoin's market dynamics. Senator Cynthia Lummis's Bitcoin Reserve Act, backed by President Trump's March 2025 executive order, initiated a reserve of 200,000 BTC, seized from past criminal cases. 

While this move doesn't immediately impact supply (as the BTC was already under custody), it signals a policy pivot: the US intends to hold, not sell, its Bitcoin assets. The order also authorizes budget-neutral methods for expanding the reserve, including asset swaps or sovereign mining, suggesting a long-term commitment without relying on taxpayer funds.

Veteran investor Chris Dunn believes such developments could reduce the influence of Bitcoin's internal price drivers, like the halving cycle, shifting attention to external macroeconomic forces. If more nations adopt similar reserves, Bitcoin could evolve into a global strategic asset, alongside gold and US Treasurys. This aligns with Brad Mills' thesis of a “Saylor Cycle” driven by institutional and national adoption.

However, the 100X forecast for Bitcoin hinges on speculative variables such as regulatory clarity and sustained institutional investor demand.

 Crypto analytics firm Santiment found that Ether whales boosted their ETH holdings by 3.72% while retail investors have been banking profits. 

Major Ethereum holders have been scooping up Ether (ETH) over the past month as the cryptocurrency chopped sideways, while retail investors have been cashing out.

Ethereum wallets holding between 1,000 ETH (whales) and 100,000 ETH (sharks) have added a net total of 1.49 million ETH (worth $3.79 billion) over the last 30 days, increasing their collective holdings by 3.72%, Santiment said in a X post on June 13. “Over the past month alone, these key whale and shark wallets have rapidly added more coins as retail traders have taken profit,” Santiment said.

The group now holds 41.61 million ETH — nearly 27% of the Ether's current supply, the firm said, citing June 12 data.

Ethereum Name Service saw the biggest rise in whale transaction activity the second week of July at 313.5%, while Ethereum lending protocol came in next at 203.8%, Santiment said in a separate X post.

The Ethereum Layer 2-based Virtual Protocol, along with USDC (USDC) transfers on layer 2 networks Arbitrum and Optimism, also recorded triple-digit growth.

Despite the whale buying and adoption, Ether is still only up 1.8% and 3.8% over the last 14 and 30 days, CoinGecko data shows. Ether is trading at $2,575, down nearly 48% from its all-time high.

Increasing institutional confidence in ETH has also been seen in the spot ETF market, with US-based Ether products going on a 19-day inflow streak before snapping on Friday. 

The spot ETH ETF recorded net outflows of $2.1 million on the day, ending the longest inflow streak since the products launched in July 2024, according to Farside data.

The 19-day streak saw a combined $1.37 billion flow into the spot Ether ETFs, mostly into the BlackRock-issued iShares Ethereum Trust ETF.

Meanwhile, shares in sports betting platform SharpLink Gaming plummeted 73% in after-hours trading last Thursday after filing to register a large volume of shares for potential resale — a move that seemingly didn't sit well with investors who bought in on the firm's Ether treasury plan.

However, Sharplink Gaming chairman Joseph Lubin, who is also CEO of blockchain software firm Consensys, said market watchers misinterpreted the filing.

Sharplink announced plans to sell up to $1 billion in common shares on May 30, with most of the proceeds intended to purchase ETH.

Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) are showing signs of stabilization around key support levels after a recent correction last week. BTC attempts to regain strength after closing below its critical support level, while ETH and XRP hover near technical thresholds that could determine the direction of their next moves. 

Bitcoin price closed below its daily support level of $106,406 on Thursday and rebounded after retesting its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $102,893 the following day. BTC stabilized around the $105,000 level during the weekend. At the time of writing on Monday, it continues to consolidate, trading at around $105,788.

If BTC fails to close above the $106,406 resistance level and declines, it could extend the decline to retest its key, psychologically important level at $100,000.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is hovering around its neutral level of 50, indicating indecisiveness among traders. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator on the daily chart displayed a bearish crossover, signaling a sell and indicating a downward trend.

However, if BTC recovers, it could extend the recovery to retest its daily level of $106,406.

Ethereum price failed to find support around the upper consolidation level of $2,724 on Thursday and declined by 8.69% until Saturday. However, ETH hovered above its lower consolidation boundary of $2,461 the next day. At the time of writing on Monday, it continues to hover above this level.

If ETH faces a correction and closed below its 50-day EMA at $2,429, it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $2,000.

On the other hand, if ETH finds support around its lower consolidation boundary at $2,461, it could extend the recovery to retest its upper consolidation boundary at $2,724.

XRP price closed below its 50-day EMA level at $2.24 on Thursday and declined nearly 6% until Saturday. However, it recovered slightly by 1.22% the next day. At the time of writing on Monday, it is nearing its 50-day EMA at $2.24.

If XRP faces a rejection from its 50-day EMA, it could extend the decline to retest its next daily support level at $1.96.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 45, below its neutral level and points downward, indicating strong bearish momentum. Moreover, the MACD indicator on the daily chart displayed a bearish crossover, signaling a sell and indicating a downward trend.

Conversely, if XRP recovers, it could extend to retest its 50-day EMA at $2.25.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. 

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

NYSE Arca awaits SEC approval for Trump Media's groundbreaking Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the company behind the Truth Social platform, has filed to launch a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) that would track Bitcoin and Ethereum.

The filing, submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 16, marks a bold move in the firm's shift toward digital finance.

According to the filing:

“The Trust is a passive investment vehicle that does not seek to generate returns beyond tracking the prices of bitcoin and ether and, to the extent the Trust engages in Staking (as defined herein), rewards earned from its staked ether.”

The proposed ETF will allocate 75% of its portfolio to Bitcoin and 25% to Ethereum.

TMTG has partnered with crypto exchange Crypto.com to handle custody, trading execution, staking, and liquidity support.

Yorkville America Digital is expected to sponsor the ETF. If the SEC approves the corresponding Form 19b-4, the fund will be listed on NYSE Arca.

Despite the announcement, TMTG shares showed little movement. According to Google Finance data, the stock was down about 2% to under $20, its lowest price since April.

This move represents a significant step in TMTG's efforts to pivot from a social media-centric platform to a broader fintech player.

The firm has recently pursued this transition by partnering with Crypto.com and Yorkville America to develop a lineup of TMTG-branded ETFs blending digital and traditional assets.

One of the flagship offerings will be this Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, a product that builds on an earlier filing by NYSE Arca to list the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF.

In addition to its ETF ambitions, TMTG recently secured regulatory clearance for a $2.3 billion Bitcoin Treasury deal, signaling plans to bolster its crypto reserves.

These developments signal TMTG's growing commitment to digital assets. By partnering with key industry players and entering the ETF market, the company aims to capitalize on rising crypto adoption and offer regulated exposure to major digital assets.

As Dogecoin and Shiba Inu capture the spotlight, a new set of digital currencies is quietly gaining traction. These emerging altcoins show promise for remarkable growth and could be the next big thing in the cryptocurrency arena. This article delves into five such tokens that might shape the future of digital wealth creation.



The XYZVerse ($XYZ) project, which merges the worlds of sports and crypto, has attracted significant investor interest. Unlike typical memecoins, XYZVerse positions itself as a long-term initiative with a clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, further solidifying its appeal.

During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.003333, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.005. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges.

The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization.

So far, more than $14 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $15 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors.

In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors aren't just spectators—they're rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It's a game where the most passionate players win big.

With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary.

Airdrops, Rewards, and More – Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits

Imagine a world where you can trace your favorite fashion item or dinner ingredients back to their origins with ease. VeChain is making this a reality. Founded in 2015 by Sunny Lu, former CIO at Louis Vuitton China, VeChain uses blockchain technology to assign unique IDs and sensors to physical products. This means every step of a product's journey—from creation to delivery—is recorded and transparent. Industries like luxury fashion, food and beverage, and automotive are benefiting from this system by verifying authenticity and managing recalls more efficiently.

VeChain's native token, VET, ranks among the top 40 cryptocurrencies by market cap, highlighting its growing adoption. In 2018, VeChain launched its own blockchain, VeChainThor, and introduced a dual-token system with VET and VeThor Token (VTHO). This setup helps in value transfer and covers transaction fees, making the system more efficient. With partnerships involving big names like Walmart China, BMW, and PricewaterhouseCoopers, VeChain is demonstrating real-world utility. Its unique proof-of-authority consensus mechanism enhances transaction validation. As businesses increasingly look for secure and transparent solutions, VeChain stands out as a promising option in the current market landscape.

Ondo Finance combines traditional finance and blockchain technology. By turning stable, income-generating real-world assets into digital tokens, Ondo makes high-quality financial products accessible to more people. It has two main parts: one creates these tokenized products, and the other builds technology to support them. This helps their offerings work better and reach more users.

In a market where trust and security are big concerns, Ondo stands out. They partner with reputable firms like BlackRock and use Coinbase for asset custody. They value transparency and follow regulations. Their product USDY offers stablecoin accessibility with added yield, backed by US Treasuries and bank deposits. For non-US investors seeking regulated and transparent products, USDY is attractive. Compared to other coins, Ondo's focus on real-world assets and compliance makes it appealing in a market looking for stability. Their approach could set a new trend in blending traditional finance with crypto.

Maker (MKR) is more than just another cryptocurrency. It's the heart of MakerDAO and the Maker Protocol on the Ethereum blockchain. These platforms let users create and manage DAI, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. MKR tokens give holders a say in how DAI is run. While MKR holders don't earn dividends, they can vote on key decisions, shaping the future of the system.

In today's market, MKR stands out because it offers real utility and community control. As one of the first projects in decentralized finance (DeFi), it has a proven track record. Its success is tied to DAI's growth. With more people seeking stable investments in crypto, DAI's use could rise, boosting MKR's value. Compared to other coins that promise big gains but lack substance, MKR provides a solid foundation. Its role in DeFi makes it an attractive option now.

In the quirky world of cryptocurrency, FARTCOIN is making a loud entrance. Built on the Solana blockchain, it's a memecoin that mixes internet humor with digital money. Users can earn tokens by sharing fart-themed memes, jokes, or short posts. Every transaction comes with a playful twist—the “Gas Fee” feature triggers a digital fart sound. This turns ordinary transfers into funny moments, nodding to both blockchain terms and meme culture.

But there's more than just laughs. The “Terminal of Truth” is an AI-powered tool that helps create new content and boosts community fun. By blending user-made jokes with artificial intelligence, FARTCOIN turns viral humor into a shared movement. In a market where memecoins often fizzle out, FARTCOIN stands out with its unique approach. Its mix of humor, technology, and community spirit could make it a hit. While the crypto market is always changing, coins that engage users in new ways have a chance to shine. FARTCOIN just might be the breath of fresh air the crypto world needs.

VET, ONDO, MKR, and FART are promising altcoins, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out by uniting sports fans and aiming for massive growth within its community-driven ecosystem.

Following a parabolic rise towards the end of May, Ethereum treasury company SharpLink's SBET stock was decimated last week, falling by 76% in after-hours trading on June 12.

Despite the concerning price action, other corporations are ramping up their crypto risk profiles and acquiring altcoins such as FET, HYPE, and XRP to gain a foothold in the crypto market.

SBET tanked after hours on Thursday, falling from $32.52 to as low as $9, after Steven Zheng, a researcher at The Block, posted on X that “basically every participant in SBET's private placement filed to dump all their shares less than a month after they announced the ETH Treasury Strategy move.”

However, the company's chairman and the founder of Consensys, Joseph Lubin, was quick to publicly address the situation.

“Some are misinterpreting SBET's S-3 filing: It registers shares for potential resale by prior investors…This is standard post-PIPE procedure in tradfi, not an indication of actual sales. To clarify, neither Consensys nor I have sold any shares,” Lubin said.

Consensys' lawyer Matt Corva posted, “ It's a basic registration statement. Of course, all the shares get registered.”

Despite the clarification, SBET failed to recover from the bloodbath and closed at $9.2 on Friday. While this is still 145% higher than it was when SharpLink announced its plans to aggressively acquire ETH, the stock is down 89% from its peak of $82 on May 29.

Despite SBET's volatility, other crypto companies are pushing forward with their crypto treasury plans, and getting far riskier with their asset selection than entities such as Strategy or SharpLink.

On June 12, Tony Guoga, the chairman of SolStrategies and Chairman of Tony G Co-Investments Holdings, announced that his company has purchased 10,387 HYPE for a total of $438,000. While that is a miniscule amount compared to the crypto holdings of entities such as SharpLink, GameStop, and Strategy, the announcement sent the TONY stock flying from $0.56 per share to $5 per share in a single day.

This news came just one day after Fetch AI revealed that fitness equipment company Interactive Strength - ticker TRNR - raised $500 million to buy FET, which trades at just a $1.7 billion market capitalization and is down 58% over the last year.

TRNR's stock did not fare as well as TONY, and is down 26% since its announcement on June 11.

While HYPE and FET may be on the more speculative side, another company is moving forward with its XRP strategic treasury, after VivoPower and Webus International announced plans to buy an aggregated $400 million of XRP in May.

This time it's Trident Digital Holdings, a Singapore-based e-commerce company that is buying up to $500 million worth of XRP for its treasury, pushing the potential XRP inflows up to almost $1 billion by the second half of 2025.

BySandy Carter,

 Contributor. 

CEO of Singularity Chile, Barbara Silva

Braulio Gamp

Over the past few weeks, I traveled through Argentina, Chile, and Brazil, experiencing firsthand the energy and transformation sweeping Latin America. I saw blockchain in real-world action, AI reshaping traditional sectors, and a desire for meaningful change.

One of the biggest highlights?

Singularity Chile 2025. This wasn't just a conference. It was a call to action. Latin America is no longer looking to the future—it's building it.

I was honored to be invited to keynote there by Barbara Silva, the CEO of Singularity Chile.

Here are 10 powerful insights that emerged from the experience—lessons for innovators, leaders, and changemakers everywhere.

We tend to romanticize disruption, but real disruption is messy. It demands guts, clarity, and to be misunderstood.

In Chile, I met one of my favorite disruptors: Chris Bannister, CEO of WOM. Chris didn't just enter the telecom space—he shattered expectations. WOM has revolutionized mobile access in Chile by standing up to giants, cutting fees, and building trust through honesty and inclusion.

In visiting their Headquarters and in chatting with the disruptor himself, Chris told me that “Getting involved with Singularity opened up our eyes to the full potential of AI and how we can positively transform WOM and more importantly Chile through the use of AI.

The WOMers at the WOM Headquarters 

Sandy Carter

Takeaway: The companies leading Latin America's transformation are those whose leaders are willing to break the rules to rewrite the game—and inspire others to follow.

Chile isn't just rich in lithium and copper—it's rich in potential. Chile remains the world's top copper producer and the second-largest lithium supplier, accounting for nearly 24% of global output in both.

These resources are critical for the global green energy transition. But Chile's real differentiator is how it's leveraging them through tech: AI optimizing mining operations, blockchain ensuring transparent traceability, and upskilling local talent.

We discussed how Chile's unique mix of physical assets and digital ambition could make it a global model for sustainable innovation.

Aaron Viccaro, President, Singularity University

Braulio Gamp

In chatting with Aaron Viccaro, President, Singularity University, “The Singularity Summit in Santiago marked a turning point for Latin America. Chile, with its deep scientific talent and bold commitment to innovation, is uniquely positioned to lead the region into a future shaped by exponential technologies. What we saw last week was not just excitement- it was the beginning of a conversation between innovators, policymakers, and investors who all believe Latin America can go from adapting to disruption to driving it. The world should be watching what's happening here.”

Takeaway: Resources aren't enough—it's how you digitize and democratize access to them that defines whether you lead or follow.

In a world of rising cyber threats and AI-generated attacks, cybersecurity is no longer an IT checklist—it's a core pillar of organizational trust. And in Latin America, where digital adoption is booming, the stakes are even higher.

At Singularity Chile, I heard about startups working on decentralized identity solutions, governments testing blockchain to reduce fraud, and companies prioritizing zero-trust architectures.

One of the keynote speakers was Jaya Baloo. She has earned a reputation as one of the world's top cybersecurity leaders, having served as Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at KPN Telecom and Avast—where she navigated high-profile breaches—and recognized among the top 100 global CISOs and top 100 security influencers.

Takeaway: If cybersecurity isn't already on your board's agenda, your customers, partners, and investors will put it there for you—through trust erosion or attrition.

Forget buzzwords. AI is already accelerating revenue, reducing waste, and driving personalized customer experiences.

In Chile, I chatted with companies like NotCo. At the heart of NotCo's innovation is ""Giuseppe,"" their proprietary AI platform. Giuseppe analyzes the molecular structure of animal products and identifies plant-based combinations that mimic their taste, texture, and aroma.

One of NotCo's most intriguing projects is the creation of ""NotTurtle"" soup. Using Giuseppe, the team developed a plant-based version of traditional turtle soup, a delicacy that contributes to the endangerment of turtle species. Giuseppe analyzed 300,000 plants and evaluated 260 quintillion combinations to find a blend of five plant proteins that closely resemble turtle meat. .

The real difference? Those succeeding aren't just adding AI—they're rebuilding business models around it.

Takeaway: AI isn't a plug-in—it's a force multiplier. Those who integrate it boldly will set the pace in the next decade.

AI will change the nature of work, but it won't replace the uniquely human strengths of empathy, creativity, and critical thinking. Schools and universities in Chile are beginning to embed exponential thinking and ethical AI discussions into their curriculums—but more must be done.

We need hybrid skillsets: engineers who understand ethics, marketers who understand AI, and policymakers who understand technology's trade-offs. In my book, AI First, Human Always, humans are at the heart of true AI enabled innovation.

🧠 Takeaway: The next Latin American renaissance won't be fueled by tech alone—it will come from human-AI partnerships, built through education reform.

We've gotten used to AI behind screens, but what about when it walks among us? At Singularity Chile, robots like RIA wowed audiences, sparking discussions around ethics, regulation, and opportunity.

RIA, developed by Machani Group, features 32 degrees of freedom in its face and head, enabling over 100 unique expressions and remarkably human-like emotional responses through advanced AI-driven speech, vision, and voice synthesis Showcased at Singularity Summit Chile 2025, RIA has already made waves.

Imagine RIA in customer service roles at airports, in elder care facilities, or even as AI teachers. For Chilean innovators, this is a chance to design how physical AI interacts with culture, language, and society from the ground up.

Takeaway: Don't just think of AI as software. The future includes physical embodiments of intelligence—and they need human-centered design from Day One.

Many see Latin America as an emerging player in crypto. This region embraces financial innovation because it must—traditional systems have failed many.

Josh Kriger, Co-Founder of Edge of Company and Co-Host of Edge of Show, led a panel on the power of blockchain and emerging technology like AI.

⁠He told me that “participating in Singularity Chile was a powerful reminder of how blockchain is becoming the backbone of digital transformation across Latin America. From cross-industry adoption to the exponential pace of innovation and the integration of blockchain with AI and cybersecurity, it's clear that Chile is helping set the pace for the region's future.”

Chilean regulators are beginning to explore frameworks that balance innovation and consumer protection, a model that could inspire others globally.

Takeaway: Latin America is turning financial adversity into blockchain leadership—a blueprint for resilient innovation.

A key theme from Singularity Chile: exponential growth must be locally anchored. Copy-pasting Silicon Valley playbooks doesn't work.

What does? Co-creating solutions with communities, understanding hyperlocal data, and respecting cultural nuance.

The CEO of Singularity Chile, Barbara Silva, commented that “The future is not just about embracing exponential technologies, but about developing an ethical and strategic vision for applying them. From artificial intelligence to cybersecurity, this Summit challenges us to lead with purpose, transform industries, and educate for a world where humanity and technology thrive together.”

The world is looking to Latin America for fresh thinking.

Takeaway: Growth without context is chaos. Build fast—but build local.

Perhaps the most powerful takeaway was this: the future isn't siloed. AI, blockchain, robotics, and cybersecurity aren't separate revolutions—they're one intertwined wave. The companies and governments that thrive will be those that can integrate these forces strategically.

Chilean firms are beginning to design next-gen platforms that reflect this convergence.

Takeaway: Don't build single-tech strategies. The leaders of tomorrow will orchestrate convergence to solve complex regional challenges.

After keynoting at the Her Global Impact event with inspiring female entrepreneurs, it became clear: women are becoming a driving force behind Chile's tech transformation.

Nearly 35% of new business founders in Chile are women—outpacing many global peers—and while just 11% of science – and tech‑based startups are led by women.

Her Global Impact in Chile

Randyth Duque 

I met with Cataline Orellana Riverso, H.E.R. DAO Chile Core leadership member and she told me that female founders and developers are committed to closing the gap.

The result? A quiet revolution—women-led ventures are growing faster, innovating harder, and shaping the future of tech and trust in Chile.

Takeaway: The future of Latin American innovation is female and rising. By supporting women-led tech, Chile isn't just leveling the playing field—it's unlocking its secret weapon for inclusive, exponential growth.

Singularity Chile reminded me that innovation isn't just about technology—it's about trust, talent, and timing. Latin America has all three.

And perhaps most importantly, it has a deep belief in the potential of people. It doesn't need to follow the past paths of tech giants—it can blaze its own.

As we step into an AI-first, blockchain-backed, human-centered future, let's keep learning from places like Chile—where innovation meets courage, and exponential change meets local heart.

The firm's LightLocker node is a server that uses Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), a mathematical technique allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data without compromising the encryption.

The last year has seen a couple of firms raising money and exploring applications of FHE within the cryptocurrency space. Optalysys says its server hardware is purpose-built for blockchain encryption, and offers a cheaper alternative to costly and inefficient GPU-based systems, using 40% less energy.

Based in Leeds, England, Optalysys was founded in 2013 by Dr. Nick New (CEO) and Robert Todd (CTO). The firm raised a 21 million pound ($28 million) Series A in July 2023.

“For blockchain technologies to be adopted at scale, infrastructure that supports confidential computing is essential,” said CEO New in a statement. 

“Traditional hardware solutions for encrypted blockchain are costly and inefficient. General-use chips are also not designed for the specific requirements of encrypted transaction processing,” New added.

The lean green Pepe machine with a flair for crypto trading that would put Jordan Belfort's calls to shame is proving exactly why they call him Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE).



 



 



Since launching in February, the $WEPE token has surged 233% in June alone – powered by the rise of its Alpha Chat community, a private trading hub that's delivered serious gains for its members.

Fueling the rally further is growing hype around the upcoming WEPE NFT collection – a key that unlocks rewards, access, and future perks across the ecosystem. It's all part of the mission: empowering the retail crowd to outmaneuver the whales who've dominated crypto for too long.

Because when retail bands together, no whale can rig the tide. And if you're done watching them eat, it's time to eat with the WEPE Army – the side that keeps choosing rich.

 

Of course, Wall Street Pepe wouldn't be strutting down the digital temple of capitalism, phone in hand and smug in a suit, if he couldn't back it up with trades that would've put Stratton Oakmont to shame in its heyday.

Since launching its Alpha Chat on March 17, the group has grown to over 1,200 active members – each gaining access to exclusive trading signals, market insights, and educational content.



https://twitter.com/WEPEToken/status/1901657472345006382

But even before the presale ended, $WEPE had already earned a reputation for serious trading alpha. The team behind Wall Street Pepe aren't just meme curators – they're seasoned crypto traders, and it shows.

Alpha Chat members have posted massive wins, with many reporting 500% to 1,000% returns from signals. One standout member even turned their initial stack into 20x through just three trades. Cumulative wins across the group are up over 1,500%, with the biggest single trade yielding 700%.

Some of the most talked-about calls include a 178% return on DogWifHat (WIF) on April 1, followed by a 290% gain on MogCoin (MOG) on April 9. From April 11 to 28, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) delivered another 220% boost. 

The team also called AI16Z on April 28, which delivered 55%, while May's plays like PopCat (POPCAT) and MooDeng (MOODENG) brought in 100% and 700%, respectively.

While Alpha Chat delivers the trades, the upcoming WEPE NFT collection is building the culture – the culture built on flipping charts and flipping off whales in the same breath.

Through its ongoing campaign on QuestN – Web3's go-to platform for social engagement and quest-based rewards – Wall Street Pepe is onboarding its next squadron of loyal supporters. 

Over 150,000 participants have already joined, completing quests to earn raffle tickets, mint spots, and exclusive perks tied to the NFT launch.



https://app.questn.com/Wepe

And this isn't just for clicks and clout. The campaign has driven over 10 million impressions and 7.5 million profile views, turning heads across Web3.

The upcoming NFT drop will feature 5,000 generative Wall Street Pepe art pieces – each unlocking token-gated rewards, alpha group access, and exclusive community features. Alpha Chat members get guaranteed whitelist and one free mint, while the public mint is expected to go live at just $3–$5.

In short: Wall Street Pepe's NFTs offer access – the kind that turns retail traders into rainmakers.

If you want to be a rainmaker yourself and beat the whales at their own game, join the WEPE Army by scooping up your $WEPE tokens on the Wall Street Pepe website – then secure exclusive access to its upcoming NFT drop by joining the live campaign.

Just head to app.questn.com, connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet), make a profile, and link your socials. From there, hit the WEPE campaign page and start completing daily quests.

Every action earns you points – and the most active users will unlock guaranteed whitelist spots for the WEPE NFT collection. Holding $WEPE boosts your score and puts you ahead of the pack.



https://twitter.com/WEPEToken/status/1920862031453782373

The campaign is already handing out daily prizes and exclusive mints. But more than that, it's building an army – not of whales, but of everyday traders claiming their seat at the table.

You want in? Move now. Because on Wall Street Pepe's turf, retail runs the floor.

FRANKLIN, NJ / ACCESS Newswire / June 16, 2025 / Silver Scott Mines, Inc. (OTC PINK:SILS), a diversified digital technology company focused on healthcare, blockchain, and real-world asset tokenization, proudly announces that its healthcare division, Silver Scott Health, Inc., has launched the Health Trust NFT , a groundbreaking blockchain-based solution designed to empower patients with full control over their medical and genetic data. This innovative platform directly addresses growing privacy concerns sparked by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' reported $600 million bid to acquire 23andMe's genetic data assets, highlighting the risks of corporate exploitation of sensitive personal information without explicit patient consent.

The Health Trust NFT leverages Silver Scott Health's proprietary TrustNFT.io blockchain technology to create a secure, decentralized ecosystem where patients own and manage access to their medical records, including genetic data, through non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Unlike traditional systems where institutions control and monetize patient data, the Health Trust NFT ensures that individuals decide who accesses their information, when, and for what purpose-putting privacy and consent back in the hands of patients.

""Regeneron's bid for 23andMe's data underscores a critical issue: the unauthorized use of personal genetic information for corporate gain,"" said Stuart Fine, CEO of Silver Scott Mines, Inc. ""With the Health Trust NFT, Silver Scott Health is redefining the healthcare landscape by giving patients unprecedented control over their data. This is not just a technological leap; it's a movement toward ethical, patient-centered healthcare.""

Key Features of the Health Trust NFT:

Patient-Controlled Access : Patients use their Health Trust NFT to grant or revoke access to their medical and genetic data instantly, ensuring no institution or corporation can use it without explicit permission.

HIPAA-Compliant Security : Built on a private blockchain with advanced encryption, the platform ensures compliance with HIPAA regulations while providing tamper-resistant data storage.

Permissioned Data Sharing : Patients can selectively share specific data with healthcare providers, researchers, or other parties, fostering transparency and trust.

Immutable Consent Records : Blockchain technology logs all consent transactions, creating an auditable trail to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.

Scalable Preventive Health : By empowering patients, the platform supports broader preventive health initiatives, reducing reliance on institutional data monopolies.

The launch comes at a pivotal moment, as public scrutiny intensifies over 23andMe's data privacy practices following a 2023 data breach and subsequent bankruptcy proceedings. Silver Scott Health's Health Trust NFT offers a timely alternative, aligning with growing demands for ethical data governance in healthcare. The platform is currently in beta, with early access available at TrustNFT.io.

""Silver Scott Health is committed to transforming healthcare into a system that prioritizes patient autonomy and trust,"" said a spokesperson for the division. ""The Health Trust NFT ensures that no corporation can profit from personal data without the individual's consent, setting a new standard for privacy in the digital age.""

On June 16, 2025, the UK Information Commissioner's Office (the “ICO”) published its draft guidance on Internet of Things (“IOT”) products and services (the “Guidance”).  Through the Guidance, the ICO aims to provide clarity to manufacturers and developers of smart products, such as smart speakers and Wi-Fi fridges, to ensure they create products that comply with data protection law. The Guidance covers key areas such as:

The ICO's intention behind the Guidance is to empower organizations to consider responsible use of information and compliance with data protection laws. However, the ICO has warned manufacturers and developers that it is “closely monitoring compliance” and will be “ready to act” where it believes “corners are being cut or personal information is being collected recklessly.”

The ICO has asked for manufacturers, developers and the wider tech industry to share their views on the draft Guidance, which will be open for consultation until September 7, 2025.","{'href': 'https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com', 'title': 'Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","ICO strategy focuses on impact of AI and biometrics","https://www.publictechnology.net/2025/06/16/public-order-justice-and-rights/ico-strategy-focuses-on-impact-of-ai-and-biometrics/","Mon, 16 Jun 2025 11:49:07 GMT","

The UK Information Commissioner's Office plans to step up its scrutiny of artificial intelligence and biometric technologies amid growing concerns over human rights and data protection.

Facial recognition technology (FRT) and automated decision-making (ADM) systems are among the tools set to face harsher supervision by the ICO, to ensure they remain fair and transparent. 

A new AI and biometrics strategy for the watchdog – launched at an event celebrating its 40th anniversary – comes in response to research showing significant public mistrust of the AI-powered technologies, and growing concerns of what happens when these go wrong. An ICO survey on the public's attitude towards biometric tech showed more than half were concerned that the use of FRT by police would infringe on their right to privacy with some describing it as “slippery slope” towards greater government control.

The ICO will also focus on ensuring the recruitment industry uses ADM systems fairly as well as conduct audits and produce guidance on the use of FRT by police forces.

A part of the strategy the ICO will develop a statutory code of practice to ensure organisations create AI tools that safeguard privacy, and work with developers to ensure people's data is used lawfully when training generative AI models.

It will also scrutinise emerging AI trends, focusing on how to ensure systems which are increasingly capable of acting autonomously – also known as agentic AI – remain accountable.

Commissioner John Edwards said: “The same data protection principles apply now as they always have – trust matters and it can only be built by organisations using people's personal information responsibly. Public trust is not threatened by new technologies themselves, but by reckless applications of these technologies outside of the necessary guardrails. We are here, as we were 40 years ago, to make compliance easier and ensure those guardrails are in place.”  

Reacting to the new strategy, Lord Clement-Jones CBE, co-chair of the all-party-parliamentary group on AI, said: “The AI revolution must be founded on trust. Privacy, transparency, and accountability are not impediments to innovation; they constitute its foundation. AI is advancing rapidly, transitioning from generative models to autonomous systems. However, increased speed introduces complexity. Complexity entails risk. We must guarantee that innovation does not compromise public trust, individual rights, or democratic principles.”

Bitcoin ($BTC) has always been the gold standard for decentralization, security, and immutability – but it's also been painfully slow and limited when it comes to building.





 

 

That's about to change. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has officially passed $1 million in its ICO in just five days, marking the rise of the first true Layer-2 built for Bitcoin – powered by Solana's Virtual Machine (SVM). It's not a sidechain. It's not a compromise. It's a full-blown execution layer for Bitcoin.

As of Monday 16 June the unique Bitcoin scaling project has raised $1.3 million.

With Bitcoin Hyper, the world's most secure chain finally gets what it's been missing: fast, cheap transactions, smart contracts, meme coins, dApps, and DeFi – all running on Bitcoin.

It's like giving Bitcoin the Flash's speed suit – without sacrificing its core. Right now, early backers can grab $HYPER for just $0.011825 during the presale. But that price climbs in eight hours as the next funding stage kicks in.

Bitcoin Hyper is a modular Layer-2 chain powered by Solana's execution layer – but anchored to Bitcoin's base layer for security.

This hybrid design brings the best of both worlds: Solana's blistering speed of over 2,000 transactions per second (tps), compared to Bitcoin's 7 tps, and Bitcoin's unmatched decentralization and trust.

With Bitcoin Hyper, users get:

●        Lightning-fast BTC transfers with near-zero fees

●        Native support for dApps, DeFi, and meme coins

●        A seamless experience backed by ZK-proofs, light clients, and the SVM engine



https://twitter.com/BTC_Hyper2/status/1930666493617832417

Here's how it works:

Once live, Bitcoin becomes more than just a store of value or payment layer. It becomes programmable, scalable, and ready for the next generation of Web3.

The $HYPER token isn't just a gas token or placeholder – it's the lifeblood of Bitcoin Hyper's economy. Every transfer, dApp interaction, and smart contract execution runs on it. But beyond powering the network, $HYPER creates a direct line between early investors and the ecosystem's long-term value.

Just like ETH fuels Ethereum and SOL underpins Solana, $HYPER is designed to capture value as usage scales. The more activity the network sees – from DeFi and meme coins to NFT marketplaces and cross-chain bridges – the more demand $HYPER will face. 

And if past Layer‑2s are any indicator, demand can snowball fast. Arbitrum ($ARB) now boasts over 1.13 million active wallets, 1.89 billion transactions, and a TVL of around $13.7 billion – leading L2 market share at about 32%.



https://defillama.com/chain/arbitrum?chainTokenPrice=false&chainTokenMcap=false&chainRevenue=false&appFees=false

Meanwhile, Base, Coinbase's Ethereum Layer‑2, has surged to nearly $2,5  billion in TVL, more than any other L2 today, with over 1 million daily active addresses and 10+ million daily transactions.

These aren't random numbers – they're proof that when true utility, speed, and scale align, networks grow rapidly in both usage and locked capital.

Bitcoin Hyper is structured to follow the same trajectory. And $HYPER can also be rewarding for long-term believers. Staking unlocks yield from network activity, while token-gated access means only holders will be able to fully tap into upcoming DeFi protocols, premium tools, and high-yield products. 



https://bitcoinhyper.com/en/staking

Developers aren't left out either – builders who use $HYPER in their deployed contracts can qualify for grants, ecosystem incentives, and fee rebates, encouraging organic growth from day one.

This isn't speculation on future adoption – it's a direct stake in a live, working Layer-2 built on top of the most valuable blockchain in the world. And with a fixed supply, growing demand, and critical utility across every layer of the protocol, $HYPER gives investors a chance to front-run the monetization curve of Bitcoin's next frontier.

It's not just that Bitcoin Hyper hit $1M in under a week. A single whale-level purchase on Tuesday transferred around $55,000 worth of $HYPER in one go. 



https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb478791a4d30a180b4e9c21032f9db8a7924e093e5f47e94e386941db8fd6e22

When you see that level of activity – not just retail but a concentrated buy at this scale – that's smart money paying attention. 

Whales typically have access to deeper due diligence and early insights, so their moves often act as a leading indicator for larger market trends.

That kind of buy doesn't just pump momentum – it signals conviction behind the scenes. Early entry isn't merely timing a trend – it's joining what could be Bitcoin's next major infrastructure shift, long before it hits prime time.

The Bitcoin Hyper presale is live – and right now, at $0.011825 per $HYPER, it's available at nearly 9% below its intended listing price of $0.012975. That means early backers are getting in at a discount before it hits exchanges.

With a total supply of 21 billion tokens – a nod to Bitcoin's own fixed cap – $HYPER is designed for both utility and long-term scalability across the ecosystem. There are no private sales or insider allocations – every token in the presale is transparently available to the public.

Head to the Bitcoin Hyper presale website. You can buy using ETH, USDT, BNB, or credit card.

For the smoothest purchase and post-sale experience, use Best Wallet. $HYPER is already featured in the mobile app's Upcoming Tokens section, and Best Wallet offers seamless token management and curated early access to other pre-listing gems.

[ccpw id=""39382""]

Date: 

Written By: 





Edoardo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy and a vocal supporter of XRP, boldly claims that owning at least 1,000 XRP could be life-changing.

He supports this view with geopolitical and financial developments, arguing that XRP will play a significant role in the future of global finance.

Farina's thesis centers on a key upcoming milestone: the official launch of the European Central Bank's (ECB) digital euro, slated for October 2025. He emphasizes that Christine Lagarde, ECB President, has made it clear that all European institutions will be involved in rolling out the digital euro as “the currency of the future.”

With central banks across Europe preparing for the Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) era, Farina believes XRP could play an instrumental role. He claims the TIPS system (Target Instant Payment Settlement), used across Europe, shows ties to the XRP Ledger. However, this remains unconfirmed.

Farina argues that the XRP Ledger isn't just theoretically capable; the Central Bank of France may have already tested it for digital payments. Furthermore, Palau's digital currency, which uses the euro and is built on XRPL, may serve as a testbed for broader use in the Eurozone.

Furthermore, Farina points to Ripple's potential acquisition of Circle, the issuer of USDC, one of the few stablecoins compliant with Europe's new MiCA regulations. This move, Farina argues, could position Ripple to dominate the regulated stablecoin market and cement its infrastructure within the EU's financial system.

To further illustrate XRP's potential price reaction, Farina draws a parallel to Stellar (XLM). He noted XLM surged over 200% following the announcement that Ukraine would build its CBDC on the Stellar network. He speculates that XRP could experience a similar, if not greater, rally if the digital euro is confirmed to run on the XRP Ledger.

While NDAs may delay public announcements, Farina warns that once the news breaks, “the train will leave the station fast.”

Based on these speculative scenarios, Farina insists that holding 1,000 XRP is essential for those serious about their financial positioning. At today's price of around $2.18, accumulating 1,000 XRP would cost approximately $2,180.

In Farina's view, this could be a strategic decision for investors who believe in the asset's long-term role in global finance. He frames this as a “non-negotiable” goal for those aiming to future-proof their portfolios.

The view is that XRP could reach anywhere from $100 to $1,000 in the coming years, potentially putting those who hold 1,000 tokens on the path to realizing their millionaire dreams. However, this remains highly speculative, as it could take several decades for XRP to reach those lofty heights.

Yet, Farina warns that once institutions start FOMOing in, retail investors may find themselves priced out.

“Ignoring XRP or not holding at least 1,000 would be the definition of insanity,” he concludes.

I was told there would be a diamond-encrusted steak.

One hot May morning in Las Vegas, I was wandering through the art gallery section of the cavernous convention hall at The Venetian Resort's hotel and casino—where 35,000 crypto enthusiasts were gathered for the seventh annual Bitcoin conference—in search of Rare, by artist Maxfield Mellenbruch.

He had supposedly transformed a hunk of meat into “an exquisite combination of platinum and 216 carats of diamonds and rubies,” according to the description on the conference website. “Much like Bitcoin itself, Rare challenges conventional ideas of value, art, and asset.” The piece, which had been appraised for $2.2 million and would be auctioned off during the conference, was nowhere to be found among the portraits of Pepe the Frog and Bitcoin-themed Warhol soup can knock-offs.

Instead, the exhibit that seemed to be commanding the most attention was considerably less dazzling: A dingy gray sweatsuit, a plain white T-shirt neatly folded on top of a mesh bag, and a pair of beat-up sneakers, each framed and mounted on a gallery wall. I assumed these must be some kind of high-concept installation—until I read the text that accompanied them. Not just random laundry, these objéts were Ross Ulbricht's uniform when he had served 11 years of a life sentence in various prisons for creating the Silk Road, a crypto-fueled drug market on the internet.

For many at the conference, Ulbricht was not a criminal but a visionary victim, indeed almost a Christ-like figure. An early champion of cryptocurrency, he had been maligned, persecuted, and now, thanks to a pardon from President Trump, he had risen triumphant. 

And so had the price of Bitcoin. Less than a week before the conference began, it hit an all-time high of just under $112,000, up from about $70,000 a year earlier. Repeatedly, speakers at the conference told the story of crypto's fall from grace and its astonishing comeback. In his opening address, Grant McCarty, co-president of the Bitcoin Policy Institute, reminisced about the first conference after one of the largest crypto trading platforms, FTX, was revealed in 2022 to be a fraud and the price of Bitcoin had tanked to less than $20,000. “Politicians at the time were calling for federal bans,” he said. “Nightly news insisted that only criminals and bad people were using this technology.” Crypto's future looked bleak—but McCarty would not be deterred, so he decided to form the Bitcoin Policy Institute. “We started out as a handful of true believers with basically a Google Doc, a prayer, and an absolute conviction that Bitcoin is good for the world,” he said, earnestly enunciating every syllable.

Two years later, their prayers seem to have been answered. Bitcoin's market cap is now estimated at about $2.1 trillion, the seventh largest asset on Earth, and Bitcoiners at the conference were jubilant. Wearing tracksuits, blazers, and mini-skirts in bright orange, the official color of Bitcoin, their T-shirts said “Our Founding Fathers Wanted Bitcoin” and “Bitcoin Saves.” They played a life-size version of the game Guess Who?, where the people on the cards were crypto celebs. At the marketplace section of the expo hall, they bought (in Bitcoin, of course) a kids' card game called The Inflation Monster, meant to teach the evils of fiat—crypto enthusiasts' word for traditional money. They bought underwear and bras emblazoned with the Bitcoin logo and baby onesies with phrases like “Hodl me tight,” a reference to a misspelling of the word “hold” that became a meme about the importance of not selling your Bitcoin. They bought psychedelic artwork that depicted banking regulators as ghoulish figures presiding over a Monopoly board.

And they bought MAGA gear: “Trump 2028” hats, a framed AI-generated portrait of President Trump holding a Bitcoin, a bag of coffee called Bitcoin Blend featuring a picture of, yes, the 47th president of the United States. But Trump hasn't always been a Bitcoin hero. He dismissed it during his first term—in a 2019 tweet, he called digital currencies “not money” and “based on thin air.” But in the last few years, he has changed his mind, likely prompted by his sons, who have extensive Bitcoin business interests. The real Trump lovefest, I learned, began at the previous year's conference, where Trump had stopped on the campaign trail to assure this crowd that he intended to become “the crypto president.” He became the first presidential candidate from a major party to accept crypto donations; at the 2024 Bitcoin conference, he promised to make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet.” Shortly before he was inaugurated, he launched his own digital currency, the $TRUMP meme coin, which has earned him an estimated $1 billion. (First Lady Melania Trump wasn't so lucky—her meme coin, launched shortly after her husband's, has plummeted in value.) Just a few days into his second term, Trump signed an executive order vowing to explore establishing an American strategic Bitcoin reserve. 

Three Bitcoin bills, aimed at establishing a regulatory structure that would legitimize the currency, are currently making their way through Congress; another, the BITCOIN Act, would create the strategic reserve that Trump had promised.

Bitcoin's redemption story imbued the conference with an energy that I can only describe as quasi-religious. The mood bore a striking resemblance to what I experienced at the prayer rallies and church services I have attended while reporting on Christian nationalism. With the unquestioning intensity of their crypto faith informing every conversation, conference attendees behaved like proselytizers. But instead of Christianity, this was a new American religion, complete with deities (the mysterious Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto), prophets (Trump), and even nearly martyred saints with relics (Ulbricht and his sweat suit).

As with all true believers, the danger of extremism is ever-present. During the conference, I began to see hints that this devotion to digital currency had become an all-consuming obsession— for attendees and the politicians and industry leaders on stage.

The more that others embraced Bitcoin, “the more likely you are to succeed. The more likely they are to succeed. The more likely Bitcoin is to succeed, the more likely the human race is to succeed!”

In his keynote, Michael Saylor, whose cloud-computing company, Strategy, owns nearly 600,000 Bitcoins—approximately worth $60 billion—urged the crowd to “become an evangelist for economic freedom.” Saylor, who has advocated for Bitcoin to be exempt from capital gains tax, said that the more that others embraced Bitcoin, “the more likely you are to succeed. The more likely they are to succeed. The more likely Bitcoin is to succeed, the more likely the human race is to succeed!”

This is when most stories on cryptocurrency attempt to explain it in layman's terms. It's a big spreadsheet! It's a robot bank! It's digital Pokémon cards!

The good news is that if you don't completely get it, you don't have to for this story. All you need to know is this: When crypto fans talk about how Bitcoin (or any other crypto, of which there are many) is going to help you cast off the yoke of extractive big banks, or stick it to woke lenders, or help the underclass build generational wealth, they might earnestly believe those things. But there is a much more basic reason that they want everyone to buy Bitcoin, and it has to do with the basic economic principle of supply and demand. There is a fixed amount of this currency—21 million to be exact—and the more people who have decided that Bitcoin is desirable, the more it's worth. If you buy Bitcoin, the value of their Bitcoin goes up. Their investment is predicated on making you buy Bitcoin. In this way, it's a little like multi-level marketing, like Avon or Amway. Given those terms, the evangelizing begins to make a lot more sense.

Nearly all the panels reinforced this message. Consider “Marketing Bitcoin to the Masses,” which took place the first afternoon and featured Brian E. De Mint,  author of the 2022 book Bitcoin Evangelism: Planting Seeds for the Decentralized Revolution, sharing his strategy for “orange-pilling,” or convincing the uninitiated of Bitcoin's greatness. He pointed to the early Christians who “spread the religion to people who didn't believe in a God, and then they spread the religion to the pagan people who believed in a higher power, but perhaps another God.” Extending the metaphor, he described those who were skeptical of all crypto as “atheists,” and those who had accepted crypto but not Bitcoin as pagans.

The list of Bitcoin's alleged powers is long and weird. The author of a parenting book called I Am Not Your Bruh told me he believed that buying Bitcoin made people better at child-rearing. “When you embrace Bitcoin,” he said, “you can think beyond just yourself and your lifetime—it makes you more inspired to be intentional with your parenting.” In my quest to see the diamond-encrusted steak, I talked to a curator who claimed Bitcoin had liberated artists from rapacious galleries. At one panel, it was revealed that Bitcoin could stop human trafficking; at another, I learned that it could reduce Americans' reliance on pharma companies and improve our diet. “There's no point in having long-term regenerative health if you don't have long-term regenerative wealth,” said an Australian chef influencer, cryptically. Paolo Ardoino, the Italian billionaire CEO of the crypto company Tether explained, “I know that people think about Bitcoin as the digital gold, but I prefer to think in Bitcoin terms. It's almost like [gold] is the natural Bitcoin.”

“Gold is imperfect,” he said. “Bitcoin is perfect.”

It's one thing when your libertarian uncle prattles on about the virtues of Bitcoin at Thanksgiving. And believe me, I met your libertarian uncle at this conference, many, many times over. (One of them referred to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is no fan of the currency, as “Lie-awatha.”) But it's a wholly different experience to hear elected officials and members of America's first family make those same pitches.

The first day of the conference featured a “Code and Country” program, a celebration of the blossoming relationship between the government and Bitcoin. But in the midst of the euphoria, the conference seemed ambivalent about setting the mood for the day: serious and dignified, or bedazzled orange YOLO? In the biggest room, on the Nakamoto Stage, between speakers, a string quartet clad in concert black solemnly performed a cover of Miley Cyrus' “Party in the USA,” then the British miniskirt-clad emcee tried to pump up the crowd about the price of Bitcoin. “Do we think we're gonna hit another all-time high in the next few days?” she bellowed. “A little bit more energy! Do we think we can? Yes, of course we are!” (They didn't.)

About halfway through the first morning of the conference, Sen. Jim Justice (R-W. Va.) took the stage. Next to him, panting, on a folding chair, was Babydog, a celebrity in her own right. Babydog is his five-year-old English bulldog whose star turn began as a mascot for Justice's Covid vaccination campaign in 2021 when he was governor of West Virginia. The senator began speaking about Toby and Edith, a fictional couple useful in speeches as a generic stand-in for solid, middle-class Americans. For Bitcoin to truly succeed in America, he said, there needed to be a way for Toby and Edith to use it at Walmart, thereby “saving all kinds of money” and “contributing to all kinds of goodness.” But Toby and Edith wouldn't do that until they really understood Bitcoin. “When Toby and Edith get it,” he continued, “then everything starts happening at light speed for all of us, all the legislation, everything, in every way!” The crowd murmured approvingly.

I suspect that Toby and Edith's reluctance to jump on the crypto bandwagon had less to do with their not understanding it and more to do with the many well-publicized scams that have besmirched the industry. A non-exhaustive list of the most egregious: the 2014 OneCoin Ponzi scheme, which defrauded investors of over $4 billion with a fake cryptocurrency; BitConnect, which promised absurd returns via a “trading bot” and collapsed in 2018; a Chinese scam called PlusToken stole more than $2 billion from users. In 2022, the conflagration of the crypto exchange FTX revealed massive fraud and mismanagement by founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who had promised to put billions of his own crypto wealth toward charitable causes but ended up spending investors' money, bankrupting the company, and being sentenced to 25 years in prison.

So it's hardly surprising that Congress felt the need to get involved and write up several new crypto bills. Sponsored by both Democrats and Republicans, they aim to fix the scams through clearer regulation. The Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act, sponsored by senators including Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) would make crypto subject to regulation by the  Commodity Futures Trading Commission; the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act would establish new oversight bodies, rein in advertising, and require companies to write contracts in plain language; Sen. Elissa Slotkin's (D-Mich.) Cryptocurrency Accountability Act would require more transparency in lawmakers' crypto holdings.  It's unclear how effective these laws would be. The biggest problem is that they lack provisions that would require customer insurance and real-time audits—meaning consumers aren't robustly protected and it could take months or even years for regulators to catch on to fraud.

Later, I caught up with Justice as he and Babydog were heading out of the conference hall. I asked him if he was worried that the new bills didn't offer enough consumer protection. “Everybody's scared to death and afraid of the dark, and we need to quit being that way,” he said. “Because really and truly, the way the crypto world works, there is such a paper trail, it is unbelievable. So for people to be able to cheat, it's very difficult to do. I am all in because I think it's a real opportunity for America!”

 “Everybody's scared to death and afraid of the dark, and we need to quit being that way…I am all in because I think it's a real opportunity for America!”

Keith Ammon, a Republican state representative in New Hampshire who holds Bitcoin, also told me he thought crypto was good for America. I asked him to help me understand why. “Why is the internet good for America?” he retorted. “Like, it's a dumb question that you're asking me. It's like asking, ‘What are we going to do with the Internet?'” He used the same analogy to explain his opinion on regulations for consumer protection. “When the internet was a thing, Congress didn't put in a bunch of rules around the internet before it even got started,” he said. “They had, like, 10 years of hands-off. And this is what this industry needs.”

The conference attendees I spoke to also seemed to favor loose regulations. Brian Johnson had traveled nearly 1,800 miles from Huntsville, Alabama, to Las Vegas and was wearing a shirt from last year's conference that said “FREE ROSS VOTE TRUMP.” He said he thought the free market could take care of bad actors by making their companies fail. What about the people who lose money because of scams like FTX? I asked. “It sucks,” he said, shrugging. “You have to just do due diligence and invest and understand the risks.” Tyler Williams, who was from Orange County, California, and was wearing an American flag-themed shorts set, told me he didn't believe that consumer protections worked, anyway. “If you have actually had a true economic collapse of money, I would be truly concerned if those FDIC protections would ever even be there,” he said.

Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyoming) agreed. During her speech later that day, she praised “the people who will be undaunted by our government's reluctance to let us think freely and embrace the freedom that technology is going to add” to all of our lives. Lummis has spoken publicly about the fact that she owns Bitcoin but in 2021, she failed to disclose a Bitcoin purchase of as much as $100,000 within the designated reporting timeframe of 45 days, thus breaking a law meant to prevent members of Congress from using their inside knowledge of pending legislation to influence their investments. (Lummis attributed the delay to a clerical error; her office resolved the situation with the Ethics committee.) “You can see it,” she said, her voice breaking. “You can just see what this country can do!”  

One of the themes that emerged in my reporting on Christian nationalism was persecution—specifically the idea that Christians were being oppressed and hunted the world over because of their faith in Jesus Christ. Persecution is a powerful narrative because it gives the persecuted group a sense of unity and purpose. Frederick Clarkson, a researcher who has long studied the Christian right at the pro-democracy think tank Political Research Associates, told me that in many charismatic communities, the idea of persecution binds a group together that might not otherwise have much in common. “Once you've established that people are in a community together and that there's some formidable opponent that's out to get us, and we're all together,” he said, “an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us.”

At the Bitcoin conference, that sense of underdog righteousness was on full display. On the second day of the conference, President Trump's sons, Don Jr. and Eric, spoke on a panel. Its official title was “Bitcoin as a Public Asset: The Rise of New Bitcoin Models,” but the Trump brothers appeared to be more interested in crafting a tale of parallel redemptions, how both their family and the crypto community had triumphed over adversity. Had the Biden administration succeeded in passing anti-crypto legislation, they might not be sitting there today, said another panelist. “We could be in orange for Bitcoin, but it would be an orange jumpsuit!” quipped Don Jr. Audience members hooted appreciatively.

In another panel, Don Jr. told the head of the right-wing social media platform Rumble about how his family had been ostracized by the finance community. “The second we got in the political spectrum, the guy that I could have called two weeks prior in New York and gotten a loan for a building in about five minutes, all of a sudden, that guy wouldn't even take my calls,” he groused. “We're getting de-banked, we're getting de-insured, we're getting de-everythinged.”

“I always say, ‘the enemy of your enemy is often your friend,' and that's what happened between the Trump family and the crypto community.”

It was that treatment, he said, that prompted him to explore the world of cryptocurrency. For the Trump family, the stakes are personal. In addition to Trump's meme coin, the Trump family owns 60 percent of World Liberty Financial, a digital assets firm that has brought in at least $550 million in crypto sales. Eric serves as chief strategy officer of American Bitcoin, a mining operation. Earlier this year, his family business, the Trump Organization, sued Capital One bank, claiming that the company had closed their accounts as a punishment for Trump's involvement in the insurrection of January 6, 2021. More likely, it was the fact that in 2022, the Trump Organization committed financial crimes, convicted in 2022 on 17 counts of tax fraud, conspiracy, and falsifying business records. 

“I always say, ‘the enemy of your enemy is often your friend,' and that's what happened between the Trump family and the crypto community,” said Eric. “And I'm not sure without you we would have won the same way [without you]. I think we would have won, but I'm not sure if we would have won in the same decisive manner.” The crowd erupted in applause.

The themes were the same in the highly anticipated keynote address from Vice President JD Vance. By the time I arrived at the press area, the snaking queue to hear the speech filled two floors of the Venetian's cavernous conference wing. Someone handed me an orange flier about the “prisoners of war” who were still serving time for crypto-related crimes. Its title read, presumably in a nod to the Old Testament story of Moses, “LET OUR PEOPLE GO!”

Vance began by cheering the end of “four years of mistreatment and outright hostility led by Democrat regulators,” adding, triumphantly, “As you know, there's new sheriff in town!” He was there at the conference to announce “loud and clear with President Trump, crypto finally has a champion and an ally.” 

Vance, who owns between $250,000 and $500,000 worth of Bitcoin, according to financial disclosures he filed last year, described Bitcoin as a democratizing force. “I believe that America is a place where anyone should be able to make a fortune, no matter where you grew up, what degree you may or may not have,” he said. “In recent years, I'm hard pressed to think of a better place to do so than right here in the digital assets industry.”

Things were less democratic here at the conference where, if you wanted to see what your theoretical American crypto fortune could someday buy, you would have been out of luck. Later that day, I headed back to the gallery area in search of the steak. I flagged down the curator, who told me it was on display in the VIP area, accessible only to holders of $9,499 “Whale Pass.” The conference organizers were trying to figure out how to display it for a few hours for the hoi polloi in the main conference area, but marshaling the necessary security was proving difficult. I had to catch my flight before I ever got to glimpse the diamond-encrusted steak.

Many of the Christian nationalists I've met described their effort to spread their religion using metaphors of war: a battle between good and evil, a “spiritual war” against a satanic “enemy.” In the weeks leading up to the Capital insurrection, several prominent pastors used these images in speeches they made about how they believed the 2020 election had been stolen from Trump. Clarkson, the religion researcher, has observed that some evangelical Christian leaders use imagery of fighting “to get people psychologically primed,” he told me. “They're going to be the heroes in the end times army.”

In his speech, Vance joked, “The Secret Service is a little bit nervous, because I told them these Bitcoin guys really like guns,” he said. “But they really like the president, vice President of the United States, too, so I think we're doing okay.” 

But would they always really like him? There are members of the crypto community who believe that only a revolution will truly liberate the masses from the chains of the current financial system. In an eponymous session, panelists debated whether Bitcoiners had become “sycophants of the state;” another described “Bitcoin as a Digital 1776,” with the currency itself as a form of revolution. The moderator, who goes by the name GMoney and is the host of the Bitcoin-focused podcast Rugpull Radio (40,000 listeners per episode on Rumble), said he thought neither party had any business bogging down crypto with cumbersome federal legislation. “Fuck this dick-sucking of the Republican party that's going on, like this is absurd,” he growled. “We are a powerful political contingency at this point in time. Why the fuck are we on our knees in front of the Republican Party when we should be asking for the opposite?” He had more choice words for the idea of a federal Bitcoin reserve. “You want to put the same fucking retards that destroyed the economic system in charge of a large portion of Bitcoin?” he said. “Like, that's fucking dumb.”

Toward the end of his speech, Vance told the crowd that as advocates for crypto, they were fighting for the people. “I see crypto as a hedge against one of the most dangerous trends in the digital era,” he said, “elites who, rather than innovate themselves, prefer to simply take over and co-opt cutting-edge technologies to assert their control over other people.” It was a bold statement for a Yale Law grad and Silicon Valley alum who now held the second-highest office in the nation. Did he not worry, I wondered, that the revolution crowd might someday decide he was a member of the elite that needed to be hedged against?

When I got home, I discovered that the steak had been auctioned off for a little more than a quarter of its $2.2 million appraisal. I also watched Ulbricht's speech, which I missed because I left early. Ulbricht, whose title was listed as “freedom fighter,” recalled a time he had successfully removed seven wasps' nests from a porch. The wasps' power, he explained, was in their decentralization, just like Bitcoin, which was distributed instead of residing in a single bank. “We're not there yet—there is still more freedom to be won,” he said. “I'm talking about freedom beyond what anyone anywhere has ever had. It's going to be incredible, and it's going to be worth fighting for.”

The European Central Bank (ECB) is boosting its efforts to introduce the digital euro, a central bank digital currency (CBDC) designed to improve Europe's financial sovereignty.

For users who are concerned about centralized risks, anonymous crypto wallets will be indispensable as adoption of digital currencies grows. Such solutions, like Best Wallet, offer a freedom-first alternative that puts you in control of your privacy and digital assets.

The digital euro is being developed with an ambitious goal in mind: to boost Europe's independence from foreign payment giants (Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal).

As geopolitical tensions continue to rise, the ECB aims to secure Europe's control over its financial systems. The EU no longer wants to be reliant on US-based companies to process transactions – and for legitimate reasons.



Europe is fighting back with the digital euro, as part of its ploy to safeguard its economic future and minimize dependency on external forces. Still the CBDC isn't without its challenges: privacy concerns, security risks, and system integration woes.

This is why Best Wallet and other similar emerging solutions have become increasingly popular.

In the face of privacy and centralization concerns, Best Wallet provides a decentralized solution that allows you to manage your digital assets securely and independently.

Best Wallet is a decentralized, non-custodial crypto wallet. It offers a compelling alternative to centralized systems (like the forthcoming digital euro), as it gives you complete control over your digital assets.

The app already offers direct support for top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ($BTC) and Ethereum ($ETH), as well as pegged coins like Tether ($USDT), making it a good option for users interested in the biggest crypto assets today.

It will soon be expanding its support to over 1,000 cryptocurrencies and 60 blockchain networks, allowing you to seamlessly manage, buy, and swap a wide range of digital assets securely – all in one place.

The app's proprietary cryptocurrency, $BEST, also brings many in-app perks. By holding the token, you secure lower transaction fees and governance rights within the Best Wallet ecosystem.

Having a say in the project's future trajectory is a major boon, as you can vote on key developments, such as which new cryptocurrencies, blockchains, or features should be added.

It's a powerful way to ensure that the system aligns with the needs of community members regarding privacy, accessibility, and cryptocurrency trading options. And Best Wallet already has lots to look forward to in its pipeline, development-wise.

Beyond making crypto onboarding a breeze for new, privacy-centered crypto users, Best Wallet also features a token launchpad for altcoin aficionados.

Here, you can explore the best crypto presales directly within the mobile app and invest in tokens at their lowest-ever prices before they attract mainstream demand. The $BEST token is currently in pre-market and also available on the launchpad.

As the digital euro moves closer to reality, it's clear that Europe is taking proactive measures to reshape its financial landscape amid heightened geopolitical instability.

Thankfully, Best Wallet offers a decentralized solution that puts you in control of your digital assets – free from government oversight and centralization risks.

To get the most out of Best Wallet, you can buy $BEST on presale for just $0.025185. Partly driven by new app developments, the token could hit $0.072 this year, making now a prime time to buy for potential 185%+ returns.

This article isn't financial advice. Do your research before investing in $BEST or other crypto assets. Crypto is highly volatile, and prices can fluctuate rapidly based on market sentiment.

 The crypto community is missing the opportunity to reimagine rather than transpose rulemaking for financial services. More technologists must join the regulatory conversation. 

Opinion by: Daniel Taylor, head of policy at Zumo

Peer inside the average crypto regulatory consultation meeting, and you will quickly notice a distinctive pattern: throngs of TradFi lawyers and ex-financial services personnel responding to documents written by financial services regulators, laying down the law of how crypto asset activities will be carried out in the future. 

It speaks to the almost parallel worlds we have seen in crypto. On the one hand, there are the integrators, the assimilators and the “mainstream adopters.” On the other hand, the technological cutting edge is almost wholly removed.

Crypto technologists might think this has nothing to do with them — that regulation and compliance are not areas that deserve any of their attention. 

Taking this stance is a direct threat to today's crypto users.

In May 2025, Coinbase suffered a data breach exposing personal customer data gathered by regulatory obligation during the Know Your Customer (KYC) process. It has set aside between $180 million and $400 million to reimburse customers defrauded during subsequent social engineering attacks.

The crypto world responded to state what will be evident to many in the crypto sector: that the technology solutions exist to make such mass data collection redundant. 

This is achievable through the widespread use of decentralized digital identities and zero-knowledge cryptography to prove claims without exposing sensitive data. If businesses don't possess customer data, they can't compromise it.

This is not a question of minor annoyance — relevant only to centralized exchanges and the neo-crypto intermediaries that dominate today's crypto user landscape.

Whether we like it or not, exchanges remain core on- and off-ramps to the rest of the (non-custodial) crypto ecosystem. KYC is not the only data-heavy requirement to which crypto exchanges are exposed.

Other UK requirements, both current (Travel Rule) and future (Cryptoasset Reporting Framework), point toward a future where users' transaction data and real-world identities and addresses are neatly labeled and packaged under the historically inept, if not downright exploitative, auspices of corporate and public authority data guardianship.

With the rise of physical “wrench attacks” on known crypto asset holders in France and elsewhere, this should be ringing all our alarm bells and inspiring us with a sense of collective urgency. Recent: Violent crypto robberies on the rise: Six attacks that targeted investors

Failing to build in privacy-enhancing technologies within crypto intermediaries and within applications at large is a crypto (not to mention societal) disaster in the making. And not questioning how crypto-native technologies could be applied to achieve equivalent outcomes is increasingly inexcusable. 

Changing the picture requires representing that opinion in the regulatory conversations that matter and providing technology solutions that bridge the obvious need. Crypto consumers deserve digital solutions that provide more individual security and more individual privacy as default.

The good news is the crypto industry has a track record in introducing techno-regulatory innovations. Proof-of-reserve systems have become a commonplace way to make claims about platforms and backing assets. Privacy pool concepts explore maintaining onchain privacy while adhering to compliance expectations. And solutions are emerging to bring critical legal functions entirely onchain. We need more technology advocates and techno-lawyers who can marry technological innovation with the needs of the regulatory environment.

And if we don't? We shouldn't hold any illusions that, on the present trajectory, current regulations being finalized are based almost entirely on legacy systems and rulemaking and surely aren't taking any such factors into account.

If the sector wants the future to be different, we must ensure that the policy conversation is not held solely in a room of incumbents, TradFi lawyers and suits but rather takes wider perspectives into account.

Crypto regulatory frameworks are in danger of being legislated by those with the old world as their default scope of reference and with no imagination to see beyond it. We must act fast to represent more tech-based and crypto-native views in regulatory engagement. Otherwise, we risk finding ourselves saddled with rules that fail to innovate and tailor to the unique properties and potential of the crypto asset sector.

That means no more burying heads in the sand on regulatory realities and standing up to shape the regulatory future. That means more technologists must join the regulatory conversation to champion privacy-enhancing technologies and crypto-native solutions.

Tron, the blockchain founded by billionaire Justin Sun, is looking to go public in the U.S., the Financial Times reported on Monday.

Tron will go public via a reverse merger with Nasdaq-listed SRM Entertainment, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. The deal is being managed by Dominari Securities, an investment firm with ties to the Trump family, the report added.

The new firm will buy and hold Tron's TRX TRX$0.28290, similar to Michael Saylor-led bitcoin BTC$107,709.17 holding firm Strategy (MSTR). Eric Trump, son of U.S. President Donald Trump, will take a role in the new firm called Tron Inc. Tron will add $210 million worth of tokens into the new firm.

TRX jumped nearly 4% to 28 cents after the FT report was published. Shares of SRM Entertainment jumped nearly 250% to $5.1 in pre-market trading.

The move comes as a slew of crypto firms have gone public in the U.S., including stablecoin giant Circle, whose shares have jumped more than three-fold from its IPO price of $31.

Sun is a close affiliate of the Trump family and attended the Presidential dinner hosted for the top holders of the TRUMP memecoin. He also owns $75 million worth of tokens from World Liberty Financial, the DeFi vehicle backed by the Trump family.

After Trump took office, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) paused a civil fraud case against the crypto billionaire.

Sun spoke to CoinDesk after the Presidential dinner, backing Trump and his pro-crypto agenda.

""All the haters need to really pay attention,"" Sun told CoinDesk, describing Trump's support for crypto as one of the President's best decisions.""There are positive things happening in the industry."" 

Tron did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.

Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT) has filed to list a  Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange traded fund (ETF) on Monday.

The ETF will hold bitcoin BTC$107,709.17 and ether ETH$2,645.51 directly with 75% of capital being allocated to bitcoin and the remaining 25% to ether, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Singapore-based exchange Crypto.com will act as the ETF's custodian as well as taking and liquidity provider. Trump Media and Technology Group signaled its intent of issuing an ETF earlier this month as it made a standalone registration for a spot bitcoin ETF.

The inclusion of ether is in-keeping with the Trump family's crypto activity; World Liberty Financial, the DeFi project backed by the family, holds 96% of it assets on the Ethereum blockchain, Arkham data shows.

If approved the fund would join a long list of crypto ETFs including those managed by BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton. Bitcoin ETFs alone have $131 billion in assets under management.

This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

A key indicator suggests that bitcoin's BTC$107,709.17 price could soon become more volatile, possibly leading to the next leg higher in the cryptocurrency.

This indicator is based on the gap between the bollinger bands, which are volatility bands placed two standard deviations above and below the 20-week simple moving average of the cryptocurrency's price.

When the gap widens, it indicates that the market is more active and volatile – a phenomenon historically observed ahead of significant upward moves in BTC. When the gap narrows, it indicates less activity.

The gap, also known as the bollinger band spread, could soon widen in a positive sign for the bulls, as the MACD histogram linked to the same gap has turned positive.

Using the spread between the bollinger bands as input in the MACD histogram generates bullish or bearish volatility signals, identifying periods of turbulence and calm. Traders typically use the indicator to detect trend reversals in prices.

The upper pane displays bitcoin's weekly open, high, low, and close (per UTC) in candlestick format. The middle pane displays the spread, or the gap between the bollinger bands, with the MACD linked to the spread in the lower pane.

The MACD has now flipped positive, indicating a renewed widening of the spread or volatility boom ahead. By default, volatility is price-agnostic, meaning an impending activity could be bullish or bearish.

That said, a closer look at the above chart reveals that previous positive crossovers of the MACD (marked by vertical lines) presaged major bull runs, including the late 2020 and late 2024 price rallies.

Let's see if history repeats itself.

 The Central American country has continued its daily Bitcoin investments despite a non-accumulation deal struck with the IMF in December 2024. 

El Salvador, the world's first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, has continued buying the cryptocurrency despite a $1.4 billion loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that included provisions discouraging further accumulation.

The government's treasury wallet currently holds 6,209 Bitcoin (BTC), having added 240 BTC since Dec. 19, 2024, after the IMF deal was announced, according to data from El Salvador's Bitcoin Office.

In December, El Salvador struck a deal with the IMF for a $1.4 billion loan, which required the government to drop Bitcoin's status as a legal tender and stop its public BTC accumulation.

Still, the country has continued buying one BTC per day, a strategy introduced by President Nayib Bukele in 2022.

When asked about the purchases, Rodrigo Valdes, director of the IMF's Western Hemisphere Department, said the country remains technically compliant. “El Salvador continues to comply with their commitment of non-accumulation of Bitcoin by the overall fiscal sector,” Valdes said in an April 26 news briefing.  

Others point to the IMF deal's “flexible” interpretation as the key to El Salvador's continued acquisitions.

“The IMF's ‘flexible interpretation' suggests purchases may involve non-public sector entities or reclassified assets, maintaining technical compliance,” Anndy Lian, author and intergovernmental blockchain adviser, told Cointelegraph, adding that this “alternative approach allows El Salvador to retain its Bitcoin-friendly image while securing critical IMF funding.”

While El Salvador's Bitcoin accumulation appears unaffected, cryptocurrency remittance payments to the country fell sharply in 2025.

Cryptocurrency transfers to Salvadoran wallets fell by 44.5% during the first quarter of the year from the same period last year, according to data from the Central Reserve Bank shared by Diario, a local media news outlet.

Crypto remittance payments fell to $16 million in the first quarter of 2025, representing 0.52% of total remittances received in the country, a $12.8 million decline from the $28.3 million received in the first quarter of 2024, when crypto payments accounted for 1.08% of total remittances.

 Strategy's latest Bitcoin purchases were made following Strategy's STRD, its third Bitcoin-backed preferred stock, launching on the Nasdaq on Wednesday. 

Michael Saylor's Strategy, the world's largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, disclosed its latest BTC purchases made last week amid escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. 

Strategy acquired 10,100 Bitcoin (BTC) for $1 billion during the week ending Sunday, the company officially announced on Monday.

The purchases were made at an average price of $104,080 per coin, with Bitcoin dropping from $110,000 on June 9 to an intraweek low of $103,639 on Thursday, following the news that Israel had struck Iranian nuclear facilities.

The latest haul was Strategy's second Bitcoin acquisition in June, bringing its total holdings to 592,100 BTC, acquired for about $41.8 billion at an average price of $70,666 per coin.

The announcement comes shortly after Strategy's third Bitcoin-backed preferred stock, STRD, began trading on the Nasdaq on Wednesday.

With STRD, Strategy plans to raise $250 million through an initial public offering of a new class of perpetual preferred stock to buy more Bitcoin.

As part of the STRD raise, Strategy will issue 2.5 million shares of its 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock at $100 per share.

With its latest acquisition, Strategy has significantly increased its Bitcoin yield, a measure counting the percentage increase in the value of its Bitcoin holdings over a specific period of time.

According to Strategy's data, the latest purchases increased its year-to-date BTC yield to 19.1%, up 2% from the previous 1,045 BTC buy announced June 9. Its quarter-to-date BTC yield is now 7.4%.

The latest BTC yield surge brings Strategy closer to its targeted YTD yield goal of 25% by the end of 2025. The company previously targeted a smaller yield of 15% but increased it on May 1.

Apart from hinting about Strategy's big purchase on social media, Saylor has been active in encouraging major Bitcoin strategy companies on X, including Japanese firm Metaplanet, which seeks to hold 100,000 BTC by 2026.

Saylor took to X on Monday to congratulate Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich, Bitcoin strategy director Dylan LeClair and the community on Metaplanet's Bitcoin stack reaching 10,000 BTC.

Elsewhere, global crypto analysts have continued posting warnings to global firms adopting Bitcoin strategies like Saylor's company.

On Monday, VanEck's head of digital assets research, Matthew Sigel, took to X to highlight the risks to public companies buying Bitcoin involving the scale of their BTC stack versus their market capitalization.

“If the stock trades at or near NAV [net asset value], continued equity issuance can dilute rather than create value,” Sigel wrote.

Previously, Standard Chartered also warned about the risks of increasing corporate Bitcoin adoption in the context of asset volatility.

 With a fresh week of inflows recorded, crypto ETPs have reached a new record of year-to-date inflows of $13.2 billion. 

Cryptocurrency investment products continued their multi-week inflow streak as Bitcoin traded close to new highs and Ether briefly surged past $2,800 for the first time since February.

Global crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) recorded $1.9 billion of inflows in the trading week ended Friday, moving a nine-week streak of inflows to $12.9 billion, CoinShares reported on Monday.

With the new inflows, crypto ETPs set a historic record of year-to-date (YTD) inflows of $13.2 billion, wrote CoinShares' head of research, James Butterfill.

Total assets under management (AUM) in crypto ETPs edged up to $179 billion from last week's $175.9 billion.

After two weeks of minor outflows, Bitcoin (BTC) investment products recovered to see significant gains, topping the chart last week with $1.3 billion of inflows. Short-Bitcoin products also recorded modest inflows of $3.7 million, though their AUM remained low at $96 million.

Ether (ETH) ETPs ranked second in inflows, maintaining their positive trend with a further $583 million in inflows last week. According to CoinShares' Butterfill, the inflows marked ETH product's largest gains since February, including their strongest single-day inflows.

Following a three-week run of outflows, XRP (XRP) investment products saw $11.8 million in inflows last week, while Sui (SUI) products saw a further $3.5 million in inflows.

BlackRock's iShares exchange-traded funds (ETFs) led the gains among issuers last week with $1.5 billion of inflows, pushing YTD inflows past $14.2 billion.

All US-issued crypto ETFs followed with minor weekly inflows of up to $95 million, while the European fund, CoinShares XBT Provider, posted minor outflows of $17 million.

Although crypto funds have seen a nine-week run of inflows, almost all the issuers are still seeing YTD outflows, with Grayscale leading the losses with more than $1.6 billion of outflows.

US issuer ProShares is the only issuer not seeing YTD outflows, with inflows totaling $437 million YTD.

Butterfill said digital assets remained resilient last week despite geopolitical concerns, including the escalation of the Israel-Iran conflict, which added pressure to risk-on assets.

The escalation also led to renewed interest in gold, with spot gold spiking to $3,448 for the first time since early May, according to TradingView data.

After trading near new highs at $110,000 last Monday, Bitcoin tumbled to $103,000 soon after Israel launched a combined offensive to strike Iran's nuclear program on Thursday. BTC quickly recovered to $106,000 by the end of the trading week, according to CoinGecko.

Elsewhere, Ether continued to see building momentum despite prices briefly dropping from $2,869 last Wednesday to as low as $2,473 on Thursday.

According to CoinShares' Butterfill, Ether ETPs have seen eight consecutive weeks of inflows totalling $1.9 billion, while its $256 million of inflows on Wednesday were the largest since early December 2024.

Both Bitcoin and Ether have started a new week with notable recovery, trading at $107,171 and $2,628 by publishing time, according to CoinGecko.

 SlowMist's chief information security officer said it's important not to “gamble your entire fortune on a wallet that's a few hundred bucks cheaper.” 

A crypto user has reportedly lost nearly $7 million in crypto after buying a discounted cold wallet through the Chinese version of TikTok, Douyin, which turned out to be compromised. 

Blockchain security firm SlowMist said in a X post on Saturday that the “private key was compromised at creation” and the user's funds were “drained within hours” from the compromised cold wallet. 

Nabbing a bargain cold wallet might seem like a good way to save money, but SlowMist said cold wallets advertised as “factory sealed” or “discounted” have often been tampered with, and the reduced price is a way to lure in victims.

Douyin has an e-commerce feature, the Douyin Shop, which allows third-party sellers to offer various products. 

An X user under the handle Hella, a former team member working under Jihan Wu, the co-founder of Bitcoin mining equipment manufacturer Bitmain, said the victim was a close friend who rang late at night in a phone call that “gave me chills.” 

Hella said the wallet was “a carefully designed hot trap,” and the stolen crypto was “washed away through Huiwang within a few hours,” according to a Google translation of the Saturday post to X.  

Huiwang, also known as the Huione Group, is a Cambodian conglomerate that operates a network of illicit businesses, which includes payment service platform Huione Pay PLC, the crypto exchange Huione Crypto and darknet marketplace Haowang Guarantee.

“When buying a cold wallet, you must choose a reliable channel. Most of the ones on the internet are fake,” Hella said. 

SlowMist managed to track the stolen funds down, but Hella said there was “little hope of recovering” them from the thieves. 

SlowMist's chief information security officer, under the X handle 23pds, said in a post translated by Google this case is an important reminder not to “gamble your entire fortune on a wallet that's a few hundred bucks cheaper,” because ultimately, it's not “saving money, it's throwing your life away.”

23pds added that these types of scams can be more difficult to prevent because the devices are shipped by third parties, and the people shipping or packing the devices are often not aware that it's part of a scammer's plot.

RFK, Jr., Fires CDC Vaccine Panel, Oceans Are Acidifying, and Pangolins Face Newly Understood Threat

Major changes hit a key CDC vaccine advisory panel, ocean acidification crosses a critical threshold, and new research reveals an unexpected threat to pangolins.

This episode was made possible by the support of Yakult and produced independently by Scientific American's board of editors.

Rachel Feltman: Happy Monday, listeners! For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. You're listening to the weekly science news roundup. Let's dive right in.

First, I've got a quick dispatch from Lauren Young, associate editor for health and medicine at Scientific American. Last week Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, announced the dismissal of all the public health experts on the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The ACIP is an independent committee that counsels the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccines. Here's Lauren now to tell us more about the situation.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

Lauren Young: So a little rundown of what ACIP does: the committee's recommendations help guide doctors, health practitioners and the general public on whether or not various groups of people should get access to vaccines and when. So for instance, they help shape immunization schedules for adults, kids, pregnant people and those with preexisting health conditions that may make them more vulnerable to severe illness.

So the ACIP meets about three times a year, and the meetings are open to the public and typically broadcasted and recorded online; you can go back and watch old meetings. The ACIP members review all sorts of different types of data: evidence from government scientists, studies from vaccine manufacturers, independent studies, etcetera.

In Kennedy's announcement of the dismissals in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, he framed the firings as a “bold step in restoring public trust” in the committee and said that a total rehaul of ACIP is needed. HHS also made a statement that the next meeting on June 25–27 is still on the books. And that upcoming meeting is a big one: votes for the upcoming fall COVID vaccines as well as guidance for flu and RSV vaccines are all on the table.

I spoke with Brown University epidemiologist Jennifer Nuzzo, and she says that without ACIP's nonpartisan expert guidance, access to vaccines can easily become interrupted. She also points out that the HHS secretary makes final approvals of new members, giving a potential opportunity for Kennedy, who has a history being an anti-vaccine advocate, to potentially stack the committee with new members who may support anti-vaccine views. And this can have larger consequences on access to all vaccines in the United States.

So if the ACIP doesn't recommend a vaccine, health insurers don't have to cover the costs, and that can mean a pretty hefty bill for a shot. That's a concern scientists are wrestling with right now with the anticipated reductions in access for the next COVID shots. But Nuzzo is worried that COVID shots may only be the beginning. We're gonna have to wait and see what potentially happens at the next ACIP meeting for more information.

Feltman: On Wednesday afternoon Kennedy announced eight people he'd chosen to replace the 17 dismissed advisory panel members. His picks are already raising red flags among public health experts, with the list including several individuals who have expressed skepticism or spread misinformation about vaccine safety and efficacy.

Now for some environmental news. You've heard of climate change, but what about its “evil twin”? That's what some experts have dubbed ocean acidification, according to the Guardian. Until now ocean acidification was one of the few Earth system processes thought to still be within its “planetary boundary”—the safe operating limits for keeping the planet stable. But a study published last Monday in Global Change Biology suggests this isn't the case.

Ocean acidification refers to the dropping pH of ocean waters. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the acidity of surface waters has increased by about 30 percent in the more than 200 years since the start of the industrial revolution. That's because when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels go up, global warming isn't the only consequence; the ocean absorbs a lot of the atmosphere's carbon dioxide, and CO2 sets off a series of chemical reactions that leads to a lower pH. The first organisms to fall victim to ocean acidification are typically ones with skeletons and hard shells because a lower pH makes it more difficult for animals to build and maintain those structures. But fish and other organisms can suffer, too.

The new study combined existing ice core data with computer models to get a better picture of how the ocean's pH is changing. The researchers found that by 2020, more than 40 percent of the global ocean surface had passed the planetary boundary threshold. The authors say lowering carbon dioxide emissions is the only way to fix the problem, but conservation efforts could help affected organisms and regions in the meantime.

We'll wrap up with a couple of animal stories. I'll get the less fun one out of the way first. If you've never seen a pangolin, I highly recommend doing a quick image search for one. They're the only mammals fully covered in scales, and I've always thought they look like sentient pine cones. Unfortunately, pangolin scales are highly sought after for use in traditional medicine, and these adorable critters are considered to be the most highly trafficked mammal on the planet. What's worse is that they react to danger by curling up into little scaly balls—that's where the pine cone resemblance gets really uncanny—which is a great way to ward off a hungry predator but also a great way to make them easy pickings for a human hunter.

A study published last Friday in Nature Ecology & Evolution confirms another inconvenient truth about pangolins: apparently they're delicious.

It's not actually news that lots of people eat the eight pangolin species found in Africa and Asia. But researchers wanted to figure out how much the demand for meat contributed to the animal's decline versus the scale trade. The researchers surveyed 809 hunters and meat vendors in Nigeria—which has become a major hub for pangolin trafficking, thanks to the creature's dwindling populations in Asia—about how and why they acquire pangolins. It turns out that 97 percent of pangolins are captured not by dedicated pangolin hunters but by people in the right place at the right time and largely to be eaten. More often than not, the scales are actually discarded. Another survey the researchers ran—this one focused on hunters, meat vendors, and household members of each—also ranked pangolin meat higher than any other wild game or domesticated animal in terms of taste.

This matters for a couple of reasons. First, the researchers point out, their data suggests that our estimates of pangolin exploitation, which largely rely on the number of scales found on the trafficking market, are probably way too low. This also suggests that conservation efforts are putting their resources in the wrong place. The authors note that implementing programs to improve food security for local people, combined with efforts to educate hunters about the importance of pangolin conservation, could have a bigger impact than aggressive policing of scale traffickers. The results also provide a broader reminder that conservationists need to make an effort to understand the motivations of the people who are hunting or otherwise exploiting endangered animals.

Lastly, we have a story about Triassic reptiles walking 500 miles and then walking 500 more—and doing that 10 times.

In a study published last Wednesday in Nature Ecology and Evolution, scientists report that more than 200 million years ago, archosauromorphs—reptiles from the evolutionary branch upon which dinosaurs and crocodiles would later emerge—may have migrated across vast distances that were previously thought to be inhospitable to life.

Scientists already knew that these reptiles survived a brutal mass extinction, which opened the door for dinosaurs to evolve. It was previously assumed that archosauromorphs were stuck living in a few specific spots because of extreme heat throughout the tropics. But by modeling the reptiles' evolutionary trees to cover gaps in the fossil record, researchers found evidence that the creatures managed to cross 10,000 miles of hellish terrain to spread across the globe. I guess it really is true that life finds a way.

That's all for this week's news roundup. We'll be back on Wednesday with some surprising new microbiome science.

Mathematicians Come Up with ‘Mind-Blowing' Method for Defining Prime Numbers

Using a notion called integer partitions, mathematicians have discovered a new way to detect prime numbers while also connecting two areas of math in an unexpected way

By Rachel Crowell edited by Clara Moskowitz

ROBERT BROOK/Science Source

For centuries, prime numbers have captured the imaginations of mathematicians, who continue to search for new patterns that help identify them and the way they're distributed among other numbers. Primes are whole numbers that are greater than 1 and are divisible by only 1 and themselves. The three smallest prime numbers are 2, 3 and 5. It's easy to find out if small numbers are prime—one simply needs to check what numbers can factor them. When mathematicians consider large numbers, however, the task of discerning which ones are prime quickly mushrooms in difficulty. Although it might be practical to check if, say, the numbers 10 or 1,000 have more than two factors, that strategy is unfavorable or even untenable for checking if gigantic numbers are prime or composite. For instance, the largest known prime number, which is 2¹³⁶²⁷⁹⁸⁴¹ − 1, is 41,024,320 digits long. At first, that number may seem mind-bogglingly large. Given that there are infinitely many positive integers of all different sizes, however, this number is minuscule compared with even larger primes.

Furthermore, mathematicians want to do more than just tediously attempt to factor numbers one by one to determine if any given integer is prime. “We're interested in the prime numbers because there are infinitely many of them, but it's very difficult to identify any patterns in them,” says Ken Ono, a mathematician at the University of Virginia. Still, one main goal is to determine how prime numbers are distributed within larger sets of numbers.

Recently, Ono and two of his colleagues—William Craig, a mathematician at the U.S. Naval Academy, and Jan-Willem van Ittersum, a mathematician at the University of Cologne in Germany—identified a whole new approach for finding prime numbers. “We have described infinitely many new kinds of criteria for exactly determining the set of prime numbers, all of which are very different from ‘If you can't factor it, it must be prime,'” Ono says. He and his colleagues' paper, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, was runner-up for a physical science prize that recognizes scientific excellence and originality. In some sense, the finding offers an infinite number of new definitions for what it means for numbers to be prime, Ono notes.

At the heart of the team's strategy is a notion called integer partitions. “The theory of partitions is very old,” Ono says. It dates back to the 18th-century Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, and it has continued to be expanded and refined by mathematicians over time. “Partitions, at first glance, seem to be the stuff of child's play,” Ono says. “How many ways can you add up numbers to get other numbers?” For instance, the number 5 has seven partitions: 4 + 1, 3 + 2, 3 + 1 + 1, 2 + 2 + 1, 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 and 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1.

Yet the concept turns out to be powerful as a hidden key that unlocks new ways of detecting primes. “It is remarkable that such a classical combinatorial object—the partition function—can be used to detect primes in this novel way,” says Kathrin Bringmann, a mathematician at the University of Cologne. (Bringmann has worked with Ono and Craig before, and she's currently van Ittersum's postdoctoral adviser, but she wasn't involved with this research.) Ono notes that the idea for this approach originated in a question posed by one of his former students, Robert Schneider, who's now a mathematician at Michigan Technological University.

Ono, Craig and van Ittersum proved that prime numbers are the solutions of an infinite number of a particular type of polynomial equation in partition functions. Named Diophantine equations after third-century mathematician Diophantus of Alexandria (and studied long before him), these expressions can have integer solutions or rational ones (meaning they can be written as a fraction). In other words, the finding shows that “integer partitions detect the primes in infinitely many natural ways,” the researchers wrote in their PNAS paper.

George Andrews, a mathematician at Pennsylvania State University, who edited the PNAS paper but wasn't involved with the research, describes the finding as “something that's brand new” and “not something that was anticipated,” making it difficult to predict “where it will lead.”

The discovery goes beyond probing the distribution of prime numbers. “We're actually nailing all the prime numbers on the nose,” Ono says. In this method, you can plug an integer that is 2 or larger into particular equations, and if they are true, then the integer is prime. One such equation is (3n3 − 13n2 + 18n − 8)M1(n) + (12n2 − 120n + 212)M2(n) − 960M3(n) = 0, where M1(n), M2(n) and M3(n) are well-studied partition functions. “More generally,” for a particular type of partition function, “we prove that there are infinitely many such prime detecting equations with constant coefficients,” the researchers wrote in their PNAS paper. Put more simply, “it's almost like our work gives you infinitely many new definitions for prime,” Ono says. “That's kind of mind-blowing.”

The team's findings could lead to many new discoveries, Bringmann notes. “Beyond its intrinsic mathematical interest, this work may inspire further investigations into the surprising algebraic or analytic properties hidden in combinatorial functions,” she says. In combinatorics—the mathematics of counting—combinatorial functions are used to describe the number of ways that items in sets can be chosen or arranged. “More broadly, it shows the richness of connections in mathematics,” she adds. “These kinds of results often stimulate fresh thinking across subfields.”

Bringmann suggests some potential ways that mathematicians could build on the research. For instance, they could explore what other types of mathematical structures could be found using partition functions or look for ways that the main result could be expanded to study different types of numbers. “Are there generalizations of the main result to other sequences, such as composite numbers or values of arithmetic functions?” she asks.

“Ken Ono is, in my opinion, one of the most exciting mathematicians around today,” Andrews says. ""This isn't the first time that he has seen into a classic problem and brought really new things to light.”

There remains a glut of open questions about prime numbers, many of which are long-standing. Two examples are the twin prime conjecture and Goldbach's conjecture. The twin prime conjecture states that there are infinitely many twin primes—prime numbers that are separated by a value of two. The numbers 5 and 7 are twin primes, as are 11 and 13. Goldbach's conjecture states that “every even number bigger than 2 is a sum of two primes in at least one way,” Ono says. But no one has proven this conjecture to be true.

“Problems like that have befuddled mathematicians and number theorists for generations, almost throughout the entire history of number theory,” Ono says. Although his team's recent finding doesn't solve those problems, he says, it's a profound example of how mathematicians are pushing boundaries to better understand the mysterious nature of prime numbers.

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

A brand-new, cutting-edge telescope called the Vera C. Rubin Observatory is about to release its first images to the world, and the public can watch in real time.

On June 23 the observatory will unveil a first look at ultrahigh-definition images and videos of the cosmos taken from a mountaintop in Chile. And you can participate by joining a public livestream (in English and Spanish) or one of the in-person watch parties at planetariums, universities and museums around the globe. These watch parties will include a stream of the live unveiling event, as well as three-dimensional virtual tours of the observatory and its surroundings on the peak of Cerro Pachón, a mountain in the Chilean Andes.

Space enthusiasts who can get to a watch party at a planetarium will be rewarded with immersive full-dome images of the horizon-to-horizon Southern Hemisphere night sky. U.S. planetariums throwing watch parties include the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, the CCNY Planetarium at the City College of New York, the Fogg Planetarium at the Challenger Learning Center of Tallahassee in Florida, the Eastern Michigan University Planetarium in Ypsilanti, the Fiske Planetarium in Boulder, Colo., and the Ritter Planetarium at the University of Toledo in Ohio, among others. A full list can be found at the Rubin Observatory Watch Party website.

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory takes a full image of the southern sky every three nights using the 8.4-meter Simonyi Survey telescope, whose array of mirrors includes the largest convex mirror ever made. The view from the telescope is photographed with the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) camera, which is the largest digital camera ever made—about the size of a car. The sky images can be stitched together to show changes in the cosmos, such as the movements of comets through the solar system.

During the public events, you'll also get to watch one of the observatory's high-resolution time-lapse “movies” of the visible sky. It will be sky watching in high definition: the observatory is designed to show very detailed views of the universe in crisp detail over wide areas, so viewers will get a glimpse of distant galaxies, galaxy clusters and stars. One goal is to map the Milky Way and look for streams of stars that are the remnants of galaxies that were torn apart by their neighbors eons ago. These remnants can help scientists understand how the Milky Way formed. Another goal is to catalog the solar system's asteroids and comets, as well as farther-flung transient phenomena such as supernovae. Finally astronomers want to use the Rubin Observatory to understand dark matter, which has mass but doesn't release or reflect light. So while you won't get a glimpse of this pervasive matter, astronomers can study it through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the galaxies and galaxy clusters that the LSST camera will photograph night after night.

Anyone can sign up to host a watch party at the Rubin Observatory website. Hosts will receive access to a virtual 3D model of the observatory and a virtual tour of Cerro Pachón. They'll also have access to a planetarium-dome-sized feed of the livestream, as well as other planetarium content. Home viewers will be able to see the livestream and images at rubinobservatory.org.

Your Brain Is Glowing, and Scientists Can't Figure Out Why

Researchers have measured the brain's faint glow for the first time, hinting at a potential role of “biophotons” in cognition

By Conor Feehly edited by Allison Parshall

Life, for the most part, is bathed in light. The sun immerses the planet in energy that supports the vast majority of ecosystems that call Earth home.

But life also generates its own light—and not just the bioluminescence of glowworms and lamp-headed anglerfish or the radiation produced by heat. In a phenomenon scientists refer to as ultraweak photon emissions (UPEs), living tissues emit a continuous stream of low-intensity light, or biophotons. Scientists think that this light comes from the biomolecular reactions that generate energy, which create photons as by-products. The more energy a tissue burns, the more light it gives off—which means, of our body's tissues, our brain should glow brightest of all.

In a new study published in the journal iScience, researchers detected biophotons emitted by the human brain from outside the skull for the first time. What's more, emissions of biophotons from the brain changed when participants switched between different cognitive tasks—though the relationship between brain activity and biophoton emissions was far from straightforward. The study authors think this may be hinting at a deeper role these particles of light might be playing in the brain.

On some level, all matter emits photons. That's because everything has a temperature above absolute zero and radiates photons as heat, often with longer wavelengths (infrared light) than can be seen with our eyes. UPEs are orders of magnitude more intense than this thermal radiation, with wavelengths in the visible or near-visible light range of the electromagnetic spectrum. As living cells generate energy through metabolism, they create oxygen molecules with excited electrons as by-products. When these worked-up electrons return to a lower energy state, they emit photons through a process called radiative decay.

Researchers studying biological tissues, including neurons in petri dishes, can detect this as a weak but continuous stream of light—from a few photons to several hundred photons per square centimeter each second. “Scaling this up to humans, we wanted to know if those photons might be involved in some information processing or propagation [in the brain],” says senior author Nirosha Murugan, a biophysicist at Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario.

Scientists have been proposing that biophotons play a role in cellular communication for at least a century. In 1923 Alexander Gurwitsch conducted experiments where he showed that photon-blocking barriers placed between onion roots could prevent the plant from growing. In the past few decades, a handful of studies have added weight to the possible role biophotons play in cellular communication, which influences an organism's growth and development.

With this work in mind, Murugan and her team wanted to see if they could detect hints of this phenomenon at the level of the human brain. First, they needed to see if they could measure UPEs emitted by a working brain from outside the skull. In a blacked out room, 20 participants wore head caps studded with electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes to measure the brain's electrical activity. Photon-amplifying tubes to detect UPEs were positioned around their head. The photon detectors were clustered over two brain regions: the occipital lobes in the back of the brain, which are responsible for visual processing, and temporal lobes on each side of the brain, which are responsible for auditory processing. To distinguish brain UPEs from background levels of photons in the room, the team also set up separate UPE detectors facing away from the participants.

“The very first finding is that photons are coming out of the head—full stop. It's independent, it's not spurious, it's not random,” Murugan says.

Next, she wanted to see if the intensity of these emissions would change depending on what sort of cognitive task people were performing. Because the brain is such a metabolically expensive organ, she reasoned that UPE intensity should increase when people were engaged in tasks that required more energy, such as visual processing. This is roughly what happens to neurons in a dish—more neural activity means more UPE emissions.

But while biophotons coming from participants' heads could be easily distinguished from background levels of photons in the room, increased EEG activity in a given brain region didn't result in higher levels of biophotons being captured by the closest detector. Clearly, something changes when you move from a few cells on a petri dish to a living brain. “Maybe [UPEs] are not getting picked up by our detector because they could be getting used or absorbed or scattered within the brain,” Murugan suggests. The researchers did find, however, that changes in the UPE signals came only when participants changed cognitive tasks, such as opening or closing their eyes, suggesting some link between brain processing and the biophotons it emits.

This leaves researchers with more questions than answers about what these UPEs are doing in the brain. “I think this is a very intriguing and potentially groundbreaking approach [for measuring brain activity, though] there are still many uncertainties that need to be explored,” says Michael Gramlich, a biophysicist at Auburn University, who was not involved in the new study. “The essential question to address,” he says, is whether “UPEs are an active mechanism to alter cognitive processes or if UPEs simply reinforce more traditional mechanisms of cognition.”

Daniel Remondini, a biophysicist at the University of Bologna in Italy, points to another open question: “How far can these photons travel inside biological matter?"" The answer could shed some light on the lack of clear relationship between brain activity and photon detections in different regions, he says.

To answer these new questions, Murugan and her team want to use more precise sensor arrays to find where in the brain these photons are coming from. Scientists at the University of Rochester are also developing nanoscale probes to determine whether nerve fibers can transmit biophotons.

Even if our brain's steady glow doesn't play a role in how it works, the technique of measuring biophotons alongside electrical signals—what Murugan and her colleagues call photoencephalography—could still one day be a useful way to noninvasively measure brain states. “I suspect the technique will become widely adopted in the coming decades even if the theory that UPEs support cognition proves not to be true,” Gramlich says.

“This sarcophagus offers an unusual perspective of the idea of death—not as an end, but as the beginning of a new path.”

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Dionysus is the twice-born Greek god of wine, the son of Zeus and a mortal woman named Semele. Similarly, Heracles (more commonly known by his Latin name, Hercules) was also sired by Zeus with a human mother. Recently, archaeologists found a sarcophagus depicting the two mythic figures fighting an epic battle—except it wasn't a fist fight or a clash of swords. It was a drinking competition. A team from the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) unearthed the coffin outside the city of Caesarea. 

According to a translated press release from the IAA, the excavations were “like a scene out of a movie.” As archeologists brushed away the sand, a marble object began to appear, and the team was shocked by the intricate gods, animals, and trees carved into the stone. By the final hour of excavations, researchers uncovered an entire intact side of the sarcophagus that depicted Hercules lounging on his lion skin, chalice in hand. 

After the excavation, a team from the IAA's conservation team worked to restore the different images. After hours of cleaning and reassembling the broken sarcophagus, a scene depicting Dionysus surrounded by a party of mythological characters—including Maenads (female followers of Dionysus), satyrs, the gods Hermes and Pan, lions, and tigers—was revealed. 

This isn't the first time this motif has appeared in Roman art, according to IAA archeologist Nohar Shahar. He explained in the press release that Dionysus often appears on second and third century B.C. sarcophagi, though the “wine competition” imagery primarily occurs in mosaics. In fact, this is the first time a sarcophagus with the wine competition scene was found in the region, making it particularly interesting to researchers. 

“In this case, it seems that the figures are not only celebrating—they are in fact accompanying the dead on his last journey, when drinking and dancing are transformed into a symbol of liberation and transition to life in the next world,” Shahar explained. “This sarcophagus offers an unusual perspective of the idea of death—not as an end, but as the beginning of a new path.”

History lesson aside, there's one glaring question that can't be ignored: who won this “battle of the beers,” Hercules or Dionysus? According to Shahar, the answer is quite obvious. 

“Hercules' condition, depicted on the sarcophagus as someone who is no longer able to stand, points to the obvious answer: Dionysus,” he said in the release.

The tomb was also found outside the walls of Caesarea, suggesting that the city wasn't just prosperous inside the gates, but also in the surrounding area. Eli Escusido, Director of the IAA, highlighted the cultural richness the excavation brings to the region.  

“This is a thought-provoking discovery reflecting how life and faith were perceived in the Roman world,” he said in the press release. “The sarcophagus is undergoing a meticulous conservation process, which upon completion will enable it to be presented to the general public as part of our commitment to making the country's past heritage accessible.”

Dr Rebecca Boulton, from the University of Stirling, has shown, for the first time, that Lysiphlebus fabarum - a tiny species of wasp - can reproduce with or without a mate. This discovery challenges the previous assumption that asexual females could not mate and produce offspring sexually.

Significantly, the wasps lay their eggs inside small sap-sucking insects called aphids before consuming their host from the inside out -- meaning that they are natural pest controllers.

Lysiphlebus fabarum is known to have both sexual and asexual populations but, until now, it was not known whether asexual females could reproduce sexually with males. The discovery opens up new possibilities for improving biological pest control.

Many species of parasitoid wasps are mass-reared and released as a natural alternative to pesticides because they lay their eggs on or in other species, many of which are pests, before the developing wasp larvae consumes their host, killing it in the process.

Asexual reproduction makes it easy to produce large numbers of wasps, but these need to be suitably adapted to local pests and environments to be effective. Currently, Lysiphlebus fabarum is not used commercially despite being found worldwide and naturally targeting aphids.

Developing an understanding of how the species reproduce could help boost genetic diversity in commercially reared lines, making future biocontrol agents more resilient and better adapted.

Dr Boulton, a lecturer in Biological and Environmental Sciences at the University's Faculty of Natural Sciences, led the study. She said: ""In an evolutionary sense, facultative sex seems like a perfect strategy - asexual reproduction is highly efficient, and takes away the costs of finding a mate as well as the risks of failing to find one.

""But sex is really important for evolution. When females reproduce asexually they don't mix their genes up with any others which limits the potential for evolution to happen.

""If the environment changes, asexual species may be unable to adapt in the same way that sexuals can.

""Facultative sex brings the efficiency of asexual reproduction with the evolutionary benefits of sex and so has been touted as the best of both worlds.

""The results of my study show that there might be hidden costs to facultative sex though as it reduces female wasps' reproductive success, and this might limit how frequently it occurs in nature.

""The wasps that I studied are an important natural enemy of aphids, they aren't currently commercially reared, but they are found globally.

""My findings could be used to develop new biocontrol agents that can be used to control aphids throughout the world, harnessing their natural reproductive behavior to ensure that they are adapted to the hosts and environments that are specific to different regions.""

Dr Boulton reared the wasps in a Controlled Environment Facility (CEF) at the University and had initially planned to put asexual and sexual wasps together, in direct competition, to see which parasitized the most aphids.

However, in the early stages of these experiments she realized the female asexual wasps were behaving unexpectedly and were mating with males from the sexual population.

This led to a change in strategy, as she started to record this behavior in more detail, before carrying out wasp paternity testing to see whether the asexual females were just mating or actually fertilizing eggs.

Once it confirmed that the asexual wasps were engaging in facultative sex, Dr Boulton carried out an experiment where asexual females either mated or didn't, before examining how successful these females, and their daughters, were at parasitizing aphids.

The study involved putting around 300 wasps, each around 1mm long, in their own petri dish with a colony of sap-sucking aphids and counting how many were parasitized.

Lysiphlebus fabarum wasps only live a few days but spend two weeks developing as larvae on their hosts.

The entire experiment, which was carried out across two generations of wasps, took six weeks to run.

On completion Dr Boulton extracted DNA from the wasps and sent it to be paternity tested. When the results were returned it was clear that the asexual wasps which mated were, in most cases, reproducing sexually as their offspring had bits of DNA that were only found in the fathers.

The study, Is facultative sex the best of both worlds in the parasitoid wasp Lysiphlebus fabarum? is published in the Royal Society of Open Science.

It was funded through a BBSRC Discovery fellowship.

Professor Anne Ferguson-Smith, Executive Chair of BBSRC, said: ""This is an exciting example of how BBSRC's Discovery Fellowships are helping talented early career researchers explore fundamental questions in bioscience with real-world relevance.

""Dr Boulton's work, which measures the costs of sex in this predominantly asexual parasitoid wasp, opens up promising avenues for more sustainable pest control. Supporting curiosity-driven research like this not only strengthens the UK's research base, but helps drive innovation that benefits the environment, food systems and society at large.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","The invisible killer: PM 1 pollution uncovered across America","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250616040230.htm","Mon, 16 Jun 2025 14:29:03 GMT","

Air pollution causes health problems and is attributable to some 50,000 annual deaths in the United States, but not all air pollutants pack the same punch.

Scientists have tracked the scope of ""PM 2.5"" pollution over decades. PM 2.5 is a size of ""particulate matter"" that is less than 2.5 microns in diameter. But less information was available about its even tinier cousin, described as ""submicron"" or ""PM 1"" particulate matter, which is less than 1 micron in diameter. Why does that matter? Because the ""little guys"" might be the source of worse health effects.

With a study now published in The Lancet Planetary Health, researchers at Washington University in St. Louis have quantified the amount of PM 1 over the United States from the past 25 years.

""This measurement serves as a starting point to understand which pollutants regulators could target to make the most effective health impact,"" said Randall Martin, the Raymond R. Tucker Distinguished Professor of energy, environmental and chemical engineering in the McKelvey School of Engineering. ""This effort builds upon WashU's strengths in satellite remote sensing and modeling atmospheric aerosols that were leveraged in this study,"" he added.

Chi Li, research assistant professor in Martin's atmospheric composition analysis group, is the first author of the work. Li said these estimates will enable further investigation into both the health and environmental effects of submicron particles.

Li said the very small particles quantified in this study generally come from direct air emissions, such as the black carbon particles released by diesel engines or the smoke from wildfires. Sometimes PM 1 can also form through secondary processes when sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides are spit out through fuel combustion and burning coal.

It makes intuitive sense that smaller particles of air pollution could do more damage to the human body because they are able to slip past the body's innate defenses. These submicron particles are at least 6 times smaller than blood cells.

Air particles are not always one single thing, but mixtures of other materials stacked together.

The larger sizes of particles are critically more dominated by components that are not easily modifiable like mineral dust, noted Li.

The researchers were able to calculate their submicron estimates based on the known ratios of what makes up PM 2.5 particles, which include seven main components such as sulfate, nitrate and mineral dust.

""Putting the seven species together, we can calculate the total PM 1 concentration over the country,"" Li said.

This research sets the stage for further analysis of where, how and why certain types of particles congregate, and how they can affect the environment and human body.

""When EPA first promulgated a fine PM air quality standard in 1997, there was considerable discussion about regulating PM 1 or PM2.5,"" said Jay Turner, the James McKelvey Professor of Engineering Education and co-author on the study. ""For numerous reasons, including but not limited to the lack of health impacts studies for PM 1 compared to studies for PM 2.5, the latter was chosen. This study provides a comprehensive, nationwide dataset to examine PM1 impacts on health.""

A next step will involve working with epidemiologists to assess the association of PM 1 with health outcomes.

The new dataset revealed another notable fact: pollution regulation does help. Across the contiguous U.S., average PM 1 levels in the air people breathe dropped sharply from 1998 to 2022, thanks to decades of environmental regulations like the Clean Air Act. However, this progress has slowed since 2010, mainly because of rising wildfire activity. Future pollution controls will need to address emerging, non-fossil fuel sources, study authors said.

Other countries like China have a head start tracking nationwide PM 1, but now the U.S. can quickly catch up.

""This dataset offers unprecedented information for the United States about an important pollutant for which few other measurements exist,"" Martin said.

Mycorrhizal fungi help regulate Earth's climate and ecosystems by forming underground networks that provide plants with essential nutrients, while drawing carbon deep into soils. Scientists and conservationists have been racing to find ways to protect these underground fungi, but they keep finding dark taxa - species that are known only by their DNA sequences that can't be linked to named or described species.

It is estimated that only 155,000 of the roughly 2-3 million fungal species on the planet have been formally described. Now, a review published in Current Biology on June 9 shows that as much as 83% of ectomycorrhizal species are so-called dark taxa. The study helps identify underground hotspots of unknown mycorrhizal species occurring in tropical forests in southeast Asia and Central and South America, tropical forests and shrublands in central Africa, Sayan montane conifer forests above Mongolia, and more. This discovery has serious implications for conservation.

Names are important in the natural sciences. Traditionally, once a species is described, it is given a binomial - a name made of two Latin words that describe the species and genus. These names are used to categorize fungi, plants, and animals, and are critical identifiers for conservation and research. Most mycorrhizal fungi in the wild are found using environmental DNA (eDNA) -- genetic material that organisms shed into their surroundings. Scientists extract fungal eDNA from soil and root samples, sequence that DNA, and then run those sequences through a bioinformatics pipeline that matches a sequence with a described species. For dark taxa there are no matches - just strings of As, Gs, Cs, and Ts.

""We are a long way out from getting all fungal DNA sequences linked to named species,"" says lead author Laura van Galen, a microbial ecologist working with the Society for the Protection of Underground Networks (SPUN) and ETH University, Switzerland. ""Environmental DNA has enormous potential as a research tool to detect fungal species, but we can't include unnamed species in conservation initiatives. How can you protect something that hasn't yet been named?""

Ectomycorrhizal fungi are one of the largest groups of mycorrhizal fungi and form symbiotic partnerships with about 25% of global vegetation. Ectomycorrhizal fungi facilitate the drawdown of over 9 billion tons of CO2 annually (over 25% of yearly fossil fuel emissions) and help Earth's forests function by regulating nutrient cycles, enhancing stress tolerance, and even breaking down pollutants.

The researchers' work has uncovered that dark taxa of ectomycorrhizal fungi are not spread evenly across the Earth. ""There are hotspots of high dark taxa around the globe, but particularly they are concentrated in tropical regions in Southeast Asia and parts of South America and Africa,"" says van Galen. ""Most of the research on ectomycorrhizal fungi has been focused in the North, but mid-latitude and southern-hemisphere regions show signs of being home to many unknown species. This means there is a mismatch in resources and funding. We need to bridge this gap and facilitate more tropical researchers and those from southern-hemisphere regions to focus on identifying these super-important fungi.""

The researchers have suggestions of how we can start bringing these fungi out of the shadows. ""One way to reduce the dark taxa problem is to collect, study and sequence mushrooms and other fungi,"" says co-author Camille Truong, a mycorrhizal ecologist at SPUN and research scientist at the Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria in Australia. ""Conversely, there are mushrooms that have been sitting for decades in collections of botanical gardens. These should be urgently sequenced so that we can, hopefully, start matching them up with some of these dark taxa.""

Many of the unidentified fungal species are associated with plants that are themselves endangered. ""We're at risk here,"" says van Galen. ""If we lose these host plants, we might also be losing really important fungal communities that we don't know anything about yet.""

The technology is available - what's missing is attention. ""We really need to pay so much more attention to fungi in the soil so that we can understand the species and protect them and conserve them before we lose them,"" says van Galen. The team hopes that conservation organizations will use the information to protect hotspots of underground biodiversity, even if these species remain nameless.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists discover llama antibodies that shut down COVID — and its future variants","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250616040218.htm","Mon, 16 Jun 2025 11:04:32 GMT","

Scientists have discovered a unique class of small antibodies that are strongly protective against a wide range of SARS coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1 and numerous early and recent SARS-CoV-2 variants. The unique antibodies target an essential highly conserved site at the base of the virus's spike protein, effectively clamping it shut and preventing the virus from infecting cells. The findings, published in Nature Communications, offer a promising route to developing broad-spectrum antiviral treatments that could remain effective against future viral variants.

SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19, continues to be a potential threat as it evolves into newer variants that are resistant to currently approved antibody therapies. Resistance largely emerges because antibodies typically target virus regions, such as the receptor binding domain of the spike protein, that also frequently mutate, enabling escape from antibody recognition.

To address this, a research team led by Prof. Xavier Saelens and Dr. Bert Schepens at the VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology explored a different strategy by focusing on one of the more stable subunits of the spike protein. The so-called S2 subunit is critical for the virus's ability to fuse with host cells, a process essential for infection, and it is more conserved across different coronaviruses.

A molecular clamp on the virus

The team turned to llamas (more specifically a llama called Winter). Llamas generate so-called single-domain antibodies, also known as VHHs or nanobodies, that are much smaller than the antibodies generated by most animals, including humans. The researchers identified several llama antibodies that strongly neutralize a broad panel of SARS coronaviruses.

What makes these antibodies particularly promising is their unique mode of action: they act like a molecular clamp. They latch onto the poorly exposed, highly conserved region (a coiled coil of 3 alpha helices) at the base of the virus's spike protein. In doing so, they lock the spike protein in its original shape, physically preventing it from unfolding into the form the virus needs to infect cells.

The antibodies showed strong protection against infection in lab animals, even at low doses. And when researchers attempted to force the virus to evolve resistance, the virus struggled, producing only rare escape variants that were much less infectious. This points to a powerful, hard-to-evade treatment option.

""This region is so crucial to the virus that it can't easily mutate without weakening the virus itself,"" explains Schepens, senior author of the study. ""That gives us a rare advantage: a target that's both essential and stable across variants.""

Better treatments

This discovery marks a significant advancement in the quest for durable and broadly effective antiviral therapies, offering hope for treatments that can keep pace with viral evolution.

""The combination of high potency, broad activity against numerous viral variants, and a high barrier to resistance is incredibly promising,"" adds Saelens. ""This work provides a strong foundation for developing next-generation antibodies that could be vital in combating not only current but also future coronavirus threats.""

This research was made possible with financial support from, among others, the Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO), EOS, EU Horizon 2021, and Exevir.

A University of Queensland-led project has developed a tool to standardize genetic testing of koala populations, providing a significant boost to conservation and recovery efforts.

Dr Lyndal Hulse from UQ's School of the Environment said the standardized koala genetic marker panel provides a consistent method for researchers nationwide to capture and share koala genetic variation, enabling improved collaboration and data integration across studies.

""Koalas in the wild are under increasing pressure from habitat loss, disease and vehicle strikes, forcing them to live in increasingly smaller and more isolated pockets with limited access to breeding mates outside their group,"" Dr Hulse said.

""Population inbreeding can mean detrimental effects on their health.

""A standardized panel for directly comparing genetic markers enables researchers, conservationists and government agencies to better understand the genetic diversity of koala populations, allowing for greater collaboration to ensure their survival.""

Saurabh Shrivastava, Senior Account Manager at project partner the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF Ltd), said the new screening tool was a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array that used next-generation sequencing technologies.

""The Koala SNP-array can accommodate good quality DNA, so is suitable for broad-scale monitoring of wild koala populations,"" Mr Shrivastava said.

""Importantly, it is available to all researchers and managers.""

Dr Hulse said ideally the tool could help guide targeted koala relocations across regions.

""There are very strict rules about relocating koalas, but this could be key to improving and increasing the genetics of populations under threat,"" she said.

""These iconic Australian marsupials are listed as endangered in Queensland, New South Wales and the ACT - and in 50 years we may only be able to see koalas in captivity.

""Understanding the genetic diversity of different populations of koalas is crucial if we're going to save them from extinction.""

The project included researchers from the Australasian Wildlife Genomics Group at the University of New South Wales.

AGRF Ltd is a not-for-profit organization advancing Australian genomics through nationwide access to expert support and cutting-edge technology across a broad range of industries including biomedical, health, agriculture and environmental sectors.

When the brain is under pressure, certain neural signals begin to move in sync - much like a well-rehearsed orchestra. A new study from Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU) is the first to show how flexibly this neural synchrony adjusts to different situations and that this dynamic coordination is closely linked to cognitive abilities. ""Specific signals in the midfrontal brain region are better synchronized in people with higher cognitive ability - especially during demanding phases of reasoning,"" explained Professor Anna-Lena Schubert from JGU's Institute of Psychology, lead author of the study recently published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General.

The researchers focused on the midfrontal area of the brain and the measurable coordination of the so-called theta waves. These brainwaves oscillate between four and eight hertz and belong to the group of slower neural frequencies. ""They tend to appear when the brain is particularly challenged such as during focused thinking or when we need to consciously control our behavior,"" said Schubert, who heads the Analysis and Modeling of Complex Data Lab at JGU.

Being able to focus even next to a buzzing phone

The 148 participants in the study, aged between 18 and 60, first completed tests assessing memory and intelligence before their brain activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). This method measures tiny electrical signals in the brain using electrodes placed on the scalp and is a well-established technique for gaining precise insights into cognitive processes. During EEG recording, participants completed three mentally demanding tasks designed to assess cognitive control.

The researchers were interested in the participants' ability to flexibly shift between changing rules, which is an essential aspect of intelligent information processing. For example, participants had to press a button to decide whether a number was even or odd, and moments later whether it was greater or less than five. Each switch of rules required rapid adjustment of mental strategies - a process that allowed researchers to closely observe how the brain's networks coordinate in real time.

As a result, individuals with higher cognitive abilities showed especially strong synchronization of theta waves during crucial moments, particularly when making decisions. Their brains were better at sustaining purposeful thought when it mattered most. ""People with stronger midfrontal theta connectivity are often better at maintaining focus and tuning out distractions, be it that your phone buzzes while you're working or that you intend to read a book in a busy train station,"" explained Schubert.

A flexible rhythm in the brain

Professor Anna-Lena Schubert was particularly surprised by how closely this brain rhythm coordination was tied to cognitive abilities. ""We did not expect the relationship to be this clear,"" she said. What mattered most was not continuous synchronization, but the brain's ability to adapt its timing flexibly and contextually - like an orchestra that follows a skilled conductor. The midfrontal region often sets the tone in this coordination but works in concert with other areas across the brain. This midfrontal theta connectivity appears to be particularly relevant during the execution of decisions, however not during the preparatory mental adjustment to new task rules.

Previous EEG studies on cognitive ability mostly examined activity in isolated brain regions. In contrast, this study took a network-level approach, examining how different areas interact across multiple tasks to identify stable, overarching patterns. The findings show that individual differences in cognitive ability are linked to the brain's dynamic network behavior.

""Potential applications such as brain-based training tools or diagnostics are still a long way off,"" emphasized Schubert. ""But our study offers important groundwork for understanding how intelligence functions at a neural level."" A follow-up study, now seeking participants aged 40 and older from the Rhine-Main region, will explore which biological and cognitive factors further support this kind of efficient brain coordination and the role of additional cognitive abilities, such as processing speed and working memory.

Researchers have developed mice with organs containing human cells, using a convenient and surprising approach — injecting the cells directly into the amniotic fluid of pregnant mice. The method resulted in baby mice with a sprinkling of human cells in their intestines, liver and brain. But researchers say that, for the technique to be useful, more work needs to be done to increase the proportion of human cells that grow in the organs.

Human–animal chimaeras are an exciting yet challenging area of research. Human cells are coaxed to grow in animal embryos, allowing researchers to study human tissue development. But the long-term goal of the work is to grow human organs that can be harvested for transplantation.

The latest technique, presented at the International Society for Stem Cell Research meeting in Hong Kong on 12 June, could be “game changing” for the field, says Hideki Masaki, a stem-cell scientist at the Institute of Science Tokyo, who attended the session. The data have not yet been peer reviewed.

To create chimaeras, researchers typically introduce human stem cells into embryos of another species, often pigs or mice, growing in a dish. But one of the challenges with this technique is that not many human cells survive, and those that do, do not endure for long. And the injected cells are pluripotent, meaning that they could theoretically develop into any cell type in the body — a process that researchers have to find ways of controlling.

Xiling Shen, a biomedical engineer at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, wanted to look for ways of improving these techniques to ensure that more human cells survive the procedure, and that they target specific organs. He and Qiang Huang, a developmental biologist at the Terasaki Institute for Biomedical Innovation in Los Angeles, California, and their colleagues thought that the human cells might be more resilient if they were allowed to mature into 3D human-tissue models, known as organoids, before injection.

The team used reprogrammed stem cells to grow human organoids of the gut, liver and brain in a dish. Shen says the researchers then injected the organoids into the amniotic fluid of female mice carrying early-stage embryos. “We didn't even break the embryonic wall” to introduce the cells to the embryos, says Shen. The female mice carried the embryos to term.

“It's a crazy experiment; I didn't expect anything,” says Shen.

Within days of being injected into the mouse amniotic fluid, the human cells begin to infiltrate the growing embryos and multiply, but only in the organ they belonged to: gut organoids in the intestines; liver organoids in the liver; and cerebral organoids in the cortex region of the brain. One month after the mouse pups were born, the researchers found that roughly 10% of them contained human cells in their intestines — making up about 1% of intestinal cells. “You get sections of the intestine that originate from injected human organoids,” says Shen. The proportion of human cells was lower in the liver and brain. Overall, success rates were low, says Shen, who is seeking ways to boost them.

The human cells seemed to be functioning. For example, the human liver cells produced human albumin, a common liver protein. And the cells were still present two months after birth, says Shen. “These cells are pretty stable.”

Metrics details

Spatial biology provides high-content diagnostic information by mapping the molecular composition of tissues. However, traditional spatial biology approaches typically require non-living samples, limiting temporal analysis. Here, to address this limitation, we present a workflow using porous silicon nanoneedles to repeatedly collect biomolecules from live brain tissues and map lipid distribution through desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging. This method preserves the integrity of the original tissue while replicating its spatial molecular profile on the nanoneedle substrate, accurately reflecting lipid distribution and tissue morphology. Machine learning analysis of 23 human glioma biopsies demonstrated that nanoneedle sampling enables the precise classification of disease states. Furthermore, a spatiotemporal analysis of mouse gliomas treated with temozolomide revealed time- and treatment-dependent variations in lipid composition. Our approach enables non-destructive spatiotemporal lipidomics, advancing molecular diagnostics for precision medicine.

Spatial biology provides an omics-level understanding of complex molecular landscapes, offering insight into development, regeneration and disease progression1,2,3. In particular, spatial lipidomics gives insight into metabolism and its perturbations during physiological and pathological processes4,5. However, spatial biology typically relies on destructive processes in non-living tissues, limiting its applicability for the study of unique samples or to track the spatiotemporal dynamics of living systems.

To address these limitations, vertical nanoprobes, such as nanoneedles, offer a transformative approach to extend spatial biology into the temporal domain by enabling repeated, non-perturbing sampling from the same live specimen. Nanoprobes can access intracellular compartments to collect biomolecules with minimal disruption to cell function6,7, enabling repeated or continuous sampling8,9,10,11. Among them, porous silicon nanoneedles are particularly adept to achieve this vision. They interface with tissue without toxicity12 and map biomarkers across tissue with cellular resolution, capturing heterogeneity13. Furthermore, mass spectrometry (MS) imaging on porous silicon provides tissue maps with high sensitivity and low interference14,15.

Gliomas are an ideal model to test spatiotemporal lipidomics in live tissues4,5. Gliomas reprogram lipid metabolism to enhance cell membrane integrity and support abnormal cell proliferation16, exploiting aberrant lipid profiles to sustain their growth. Their heterogeneous lipid dysregulation carries relevant information for clinical intervention17,18, emphasizing the importance of spatiotemporal lipidomics profiles.

Here, we present an integrated workflow for spatiotemporal lipidomics applied to the study of gliomas (Fig. 1). Using nanoneedles, we repeatedly generated non-destructive imprints of brain tissue, called molecular replicas. Desorption electrospray ionization MS imaging (DESI-MSI) analysis of the replicas generated lipidomic maps that accurately captured key brain morphological features, closely matching the species abundance and spatial distribution observed in the original tissue. Molecular replicas matched tissue sections in their performance for grading human glioma (HG) samples on the basis of lipidomic maps. Moreover, longitudinal spatial lipidomic profiling of glioma-bearing brain tissue slices revealed lipid- and sample-specific temporal changes in response to chemotherapy. This approach establishes a minimally perturbative method for spatiotemporal lipidomics of live tissues, with transformative potential for studying tissue dynamics and therapeutic responses.

The process begins with the collection of mouse brains and HG biopsies (1). Nanoneedle imprinting of these specimens (2) generates molecular replicas (3) that are analysed using DESI-MSI (4). Repeated sampling of molecular replicas from the same specimen over time enables study of the evolution of its metabolic profile (5). Specimens can also be processed to produce tissue sections proximal to the molecular replica (6) to obtain molecular (7) and morphological references (8). The analysis of the DESI-MSI datasets (9) provides information on the intensity distribution of key lipids to map the tissue composition (10) as well as the ability to identify tissue regions such as white matter, grey matter and different types of lesions (11) and to determine tissue similarity and grade from HG biopsies (12). The longitudinal analysis provides insights into a tissue's response to treatment (13). Created with BioRender.com.

We assessed the suitability of nanoneedles for DESI-MSI lipidomics, using nanoneedle arrays with 2 μm pitch, 4.00 μm height, 50 nm tip diameter, 600 nm base diameter, 77.2 m2 g−1 surface area, 50% porosity and 7.9 nm average pore diameter, on 8 × 8 mm silicon substrates (Supplementary Fig. 1). The analysis of porcine brain lipid extract revealed that nanoneedles and flat surfaces offer comparable sensitivity for the most representative lipids, consistent with established DESI limits of detection (LODs)19 (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Table 1). Nanoneedle substrates typically displayed slightly higher LODs than flat silicon, suggesting that nanotextured surfaces can dampen the desorption–ionization process. However, the relative peak intensity correlated well between nanoneedles and flat substrates, indicating that the analysis on nanoneedles accurately recapitulated the lipid composition of the mixture (Extended Data Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2). Optimization of DESI-MSI analytical parameters20 for nanoneedles significantly increased the number of detectable features by a factor of 2.47, from 408 ± 83 to 1,007 ± 141 (Extended Data Fig. 1d–f).

We then established the ability of nanoneedles to generate a molecular replica by imprinting frozen mouse brain (Fig. 2a,b). Computational modelling indicated that, during imprinting, a few micrometres of tissue transiently thaw, allowing collection of biomolecules (Supplementary Fig. 3). The resulting replica formed a uniform molecular adsorbate on the nanoneedles, whereas using a flat substrate yielded poor adsorbate uniformity, presenting areas without coverage and areas of adsorbate accumulation (Fig. 2c). The nanoneedle replica fully reproduced the original tissue and macroscopically retained its morphology, whereas the flat replica reproduced only less than half of the tissue, lacking clear morphology (Fig. 2d,e).

We then evaluated the composition of the molecular adsorbate on replicas generated from nanoneedles as-etched, O2-plasma oxidized and (3-aminopropyl)-triethoxysilane (APTES) functionalized, assessing the role of surface polarity and charge on biomolecular collection efficiency21,22. Oxidation and APTES respectively generated negative and positive charges, providing more polar surfaces than the as-etched porous silicon. For all the functionalizations considered, the amount of collected RNA, proteins and lipids compared favourably with those that could be extracted from the reference tissue (Fig. 2f). RNA collection ranged between 210 ng and 350 ng, while protein collection ranged between 2.5 μg and 4.3 μg. Lipid collection was more efficient on APTES and oxidized nanoneedles compared with as-etched ones, ranging between 200 μg and 600 μg. These data indicated that plasma oxidized nanoneedles were suitable for spatial lipidomics, because their lipid collection efficiency of 410 ± 95 μg was well within the range in which a large number of features were detectable (Fig. 2f) and compared favourably with a 10-μm tissue section (210 ± 23 μg), known to be imageable by DESI-MSI. The use of oxidized nanoneedles also mitigated potential concerns regarding interference from the desorption of polymerized APTES.

We also compared the quality of the replica generated using porous silicon nanoneedles (pSi nN) with those obtained using solid silicon nanoneedles (solid nN), porous silicon nanoneedles over a continuous porous silicon layer (pSi nN + layer) and a continuous porous silicon layer (pSi layer)23,24,25 (Supplementary Fig. 4). pSi nN displayed the largest number of features and the least variability, followed by the solid nN, while the pSi nN + layer and pSi layer yielded less features with higher variability (Fig. 2g–i). The pSi nN also outperformed the other substrates in their spectral correlation to the original tissue, closely matched by solid nN (Fig. 2j), and most closely reproduced the surface area of the original tissue (Fig. 2g,k).

The imprinting was reproducible, with three replicas from the same surface preserving morphological features and showing strong correlation with the reference section and with each other across the whole range from low- to high-abundance lipids (Fig. 2l–n and Supplementary Fig. 5).

These data indicated that a molecular replica generated using porous silicon nanoneedles could accurately and robustly reproduce the lipidomic profile of a tissue. However, the presence of a continuous porous layer reduced the efficiency of the desorption–ionization process, favouring the use of substrates with nanoneedles only. In addition, porous nanoneedles marginally outperformed solid ones, producing replicas that more closely represented the original tissue in terms of area, number of features and correlation.

We compared the quality of lipidomic imaging on molecular replicas with its proximal tissue section5. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) revealed that the top two clusters of both section and replica appeared to align with the areas of grey and white matter within the mouse brain architecture (Fig. 3a). The white matter cluster aligned with brain regions containing highly myelinated fibres, matching the expression pattern of myelin genes such as myelin basic protein in areas such as the corpus callosum. Meanwhile the grey matter cluster corresponded to regions with higher cell body densities and fewer myelinated fibres, such as the cortex4.

The white boxes indicate regions used for lipid abundance analysis across GM, WM and T. i,j, Heatmaps showing the relative abundance of 33 lipid peaks (from analysis in g) along the major axis of the white box in e and h for the section (i) and replica (j). Top and bottom strips above each heatmap show the cluster assignment and relative lipid intensity for corresponding pixels from e and h.

The lipid composition of these two clusters confirmed this morphological classification (Fig. 3b,c). The higher abundance of m/z 888.62 (sulfated hexosylceramide (SHexCer) 42:2;O2) and lower abundance of m/z 834.53 (phosphatidylserine (PS) 40:6) in white matter were consistent with established DESI-MSI brain biomarkers26. Mapping the relative intensity of these two peaks across the sample accurately delineated white and grey matter regions in both the replica and the reference section (Fig. 3d). The congruent distribution of these lipid species across replica and section confirmed the feasibility of generating a lipidomic profile map from a nanoneedle replica of the mouse brain. Minor discrepancies in brain morphology were attributed to the inherent anatomical differences between adjacent tissue sections.

We then used the molecular replica to characterize a cancerous lesion within a mouse glioma5. The top three HCA clusters classified white matter, grey matter and tumour regions with comparable effectiveness in section and replica (Fig. 3e). When analysing a dataset including all spectra across tissue and replica, HCA similarly discriminated tumour, white matter and grey matter, highlighting the correspondence of the lipid profile on replica and section. Principal component analysis of intercluster variance further confirmed that both the replica and the section displayed similar characteristic features, enabling accurate mapping of tumour margins and transitions between tissue types (Supplementary Fig. 6).

Comparative analysis of the average mass spectra for each cluster allowed the lipid compositions of white matter, grey matter and tumour to be distinguished and the most relevant differentially abundant species to be identified (Fig. 3f,g and Supplementary Fig. 7). Again, clusters associated with white matter in both the section and replica exhibited a prominent peak at m/z 888.62 (SHexCer 42:2;O2), while the grey matter clusters showed a prominent peak at m/z 834.53 (PS 40:6). The tumour cluster showed an increase in the abundance of m/z 736.65 (ceramide (Cer) 46:1;O4), m/z 682.59 (Cer 42:0;O4) and m/z 716.52 (phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) 34:1). The intensity map for these characteristic species effectively discriminated tumour, white matter and grey matter in the replica as well as in the section (Fig. 3h), demonstrating the replica's ability to accurately reproduce the lipidomic map of the original tissue, even in the presence of a cancerous lesion. The analysis of two additional, distinct brain samples confirmed the reproducibility of our approach (Supplementary Fig. 8).

We assessed the spatial distribution of the 33 most representative species in the section and replica by evaluating their abundance along the major axis (length) of the white box (Fig. 3h and Supplementary Fig. 9). The heatmaps from both section and replica revealed a clear and congruent pattern in lipid abundance across tumour, grey matter and white matter (Fig. 3i,j and Supplementary Fig. 9). The tumour–grey matter transition occurred at 3.1 mm from the left edge. The tumour was rich in lipids at m/z 736.65 (Cer 46:1;O4), m/z 682.59 (Cer 42:0;O4) and m/z 740.51 (phosphatidylcholine (PC) 30:0), while grey matter showed high levels of m/z 600.51 (Cer 36:1;O2) and m/z 834.53 (PS 40:6). At 4 mm, a 0.3 mm white matter layer was enriched in m/z 844.64 (PS O-41:1), m/z 860.64 (PS 41:0) and m/z 888.62 (SHexCer 42:2;O2) followed by grey matter (4.3–4.7 mm) with a lipid profile consistent with the previous grey matter region.

These data indicate that a molecular replica can map the biomolecular architecture of a tumour-bearing tissue. The quality of the replica information enables unsupervised classification of individual pixels with comparable fidelity to the original sample enabling mapping lipid abundance with comparable quality to the tissue.

We then captured the molecular heterogeneity of a HG biopsy. Histopathological analysis identified three distinct regions of healthy brain infiltrated by tumour (I), bulk tumour (T) and necrosis (N) (Fig. 4a). HCA could distinguish these three regions and identify their lipid composition in the replica and the section (Fig. 4b–e). Mapping the distribution of the peak at m/z 600.51 (Cer 36:1;O2) characterized the infiltrated tumour, while m/z 888.62 (SHexCer 42:2;O2) distinguished the bulk tumour and m/z 680.54 (Cer 43:0;O3) preferentially associated with areas of necrosis (Fig. 4f).

To evaluate whether replicas could match the predictive power of original tissues, we collected DESI-MSI maps of molecular replicas (HG-r) and reference sections (HG-s) from 23 HG samples with known prognoses (Supplementary Table 2). Additional sections (HG 11, 12) and replicas (HG 6, 18) were collected for intrapatient and interreplica validations, for a total of 25 sections and 25 replicas.

We observed a high correlation between replicas and their reference tissue section, indicating a preserved molecular profile (Fig. 5a). The correlation with the reference section ranked first with a probability of 0.85, and ranked in the top five with a probability of 0.96, well above the random expectations of 0.04 and 0.2, respectively (Fig. 5b). Replicas from the same section preserved a common molecular signature, showing higher correlation with their reference section than with any other (HG 6, 18) (Fig. 5c).

We next assessed disease grade prediction using sections and replicas comparing four classification models: logistic regression, decision trees, XGBoost27 and LightGBM28. All models performed better than a random model for both sections and replicas (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 10), with disease grade assignments showing a high degree of concordance. Logistic regression demonstrated superior performance (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 10) and thus was considered for further analysis. The classification performance was comparable for sections and replicas with a mean (±s.d.) area under the curve (AUC) for the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of 0.71 ± 0.05 and 0.75 ± 0.02, respectively (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Table 3). Bootstrapping statistical validation confirmed that the observed classification performance was not due to chance (Supplementary Fig. 11). The best-performing models agreed on 25 out of the 27 section–replica pairs, further indicating that the models captured similar discriminative information from the spectral data (Supplementary Table 2). Cross-model prediction analysis applying the models trained on sections to predict the replicas achieved an AUC of 0.79 ± 0.01, while models trained on replicas to predict the sections achieved an AUC of 0.70 ± 0.05, further supporting the similarity in their molecular profiles (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Table 3). Shapley additive explanations (SHAP)29 showed that section and replica shared three of the top five most predictive peaks, while nine out of the top ten displayed the same correlation with lesion grade (Fig. 5f,g). Among the top four replica peaks, two (m/z 790.55 (PE 40:6) and m/z 834.53 (PS 40:6)) correlated with low-grade tumours and two (m/z 885.55 (phosphatidylinositol (PI) 38:4) and m/z 788.55 (PS 36:1)) with high grade. Their intensity maps across representative tumours aligned with expected tumour grades (Fig. 5h). This analysis also captured the spatial heterogeneity of tumours, identifying the lower section of HG 25—histologically infiltrated healthy brain—as low grade, enriched in the m/z values of 790.55 and 834.53, and the edges of HG 23 as high grade, enriched in m/z 788.55 and depleted in low-grade markers. These results established that the molecular replica generated using nanoneedles can replace a tissue section for disease state classification.

The non-destructive molecular collection enabled by nanoneedles offers a unique opportunity to sample living tissue longitudinally, allowing one to track its spatiotemporal lipidomic evolution. We tested this ability by monitoring the response of live glioma-bearing tissue slices to temozolomide (TMZ) treatment. We collected longitudinal molecular replicas on day 0 (D0T1, treated; D0T0, control) and day 5 (D5T1, treated; D5T0, control) while exposing the samples to TMZ or dimethylsulfoxide from day 3 (Fig. 6a).

We first assessed the feasibility of generating molecular replicas from living tissue with minimal perturbation. Nanoneedle imprinting did not impact brain slice viability immediately (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b) or over the 5 days of culture (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d), while the TMZ treatment selectively reduced the viability of cells in the tumour region by day 5 (Extended Data Fig. 2e–g). The day 0 and day 5 replicas captured the entire tissue slice area (Extended Data Fig. 2h).

We used these longitudinal molecular replicas to study the spatiotemporal variations in the lipidomic profile in response to TMZ treatment. The DESI imaging of the molecular replicas at both timepoints showed well-defined brain regions (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 12a,c). Tumour, grey matter and white matter were distinguished by the same lipids identified for the frozen sections (Figs. 3h and 6b). The morphology of these regions aligned well with the expected structure of the tumour-bearing brain and closely matched the brain structure observed in the slices, which evolved over the 5 days in culture. Over time, and regardless of treatment, the size of the grey matter slightly increased and the white matter decreased, consistent with the expected axonal degeneration in cultured brain slices30,31 (Fig. 6c). By contrast, the tumour size slightly increased in untreated samples while decreasing significantly in response to TMZ treatment, supporting the observation that the treatment selectively targeted tumour cells (Fig. 6c and Extended Data Fig. 2g).

We then assessed the temporal evolution of lipid composition by comparing lipid abundance between untreated samples at day 0 (D0T0) and day 5 (D5T0) across the three brains. Among the 629 commonly identified lipids on day 0, 21% increased in abundance over time, while 79% decreased with 31 of them becoming undetectable (Fig. 6d). Among these, 27 lipids showed significant changes, with 8 increasing and 19 decreasing in abundance (Fig. 6e). The white matter and tumour markers did not vary significantly, while the grey matter marker abundance increased over time (Fig. 6f–h and Supplementary Fig. 12b,d). The data indicate an overall decrease in the abundance and diversity of species as a consequence of culturing the brain slices. This analysis captures brain tissue remodelling during culturing and reveals changes in lipid composition and spatial distribution within individual slices, insights made possible through longitudinal sampling enabled by nanoneedles.

We then analysed the effect of treatment specifically within the tumour. Overall, the relative abundance of 42% of lipids increased with treatment, while 58% decreased. Statistical analysis identified 11 significant lipids (Fig. 6i), with 8 decreasing and 3 increasing in abundance with TMZ treatment. The most significant, m/z 692.45 (PS 29:0), selectively disappeared in treated tumours across all samples (Fig. 6j,k). Other lipid species showed distinct, treatment-dependent abundance patterns, highlighting the power of longitudinal molecular replica analysis to detect lipid-specific and specimen-specific treatment responses (Supplementary Fig. 13). Phosphatidylserines (PS29:0, PS 42:8, PS O-41:0, PS 38:4, PS 36:1) and phosphatidylinositol (PI O-39:1) featured prominently among the species decreasing in response to TMZ (Supplementary Table 1). Phosphatidylserine upregulation is a central feature of glioblastoma multiforme32 that is modulated by TMZ treatment33, including through ferroptosis34,35,36. The PI3K–AKT is a ubiquitously upregulated pathway in glioblastoma37, which is leveraged by TMZ38.

These data show that TMZ treatment alters tumour lipid composition and distribution, notably by selectively reducing specific metabolites. Using longitudinal data from molecular replicas, we characterized the response of the tumour and identified target lipids previously linked to glioma and TMZ. This analysis offers valuable insights into metabolic pathways affected by the treatment and potential biomarkers of therapeutic efficacy.

We developed an imprinting workflow using porous silicon nanoneedles to generate reliable, repeatable molecular replicas of living tissue, enabling longitudinal lipid mapping for glioma characterization and classification. Interestingly, introducing a continuous porous layer reduced the quality of molecular replica, possibly due to dampening of the liquid-phase desorption–ionization process due to the absorbent nature of the porous matrix. A systematic investigation of the process would further improve replica quality.

These replicas well preserved the relative composition and spatial distribution of the original samples, allowing accurate mapping of brain regions and their lipid profiles. This approach enabled effective disease grade prediction, matching the performance of direct tissue analysis. Crucially, nanoneedles supported repeated, non-perturbing12,39 longitudinal sampling of glioma-bearing brain slices, revealing lipid-specific and sample-specific changes in tumour lipid profiles in response to chemotherapy.

By preserving lipid spatial distribution and enabling non-destructive, repeated sampling, nanoneedles offer a powerful platform for spatiotemporal, omics-level molecular diagnostics. Their integration into medical devices40, enables the analysis of accessible tissues, including intraoperative sampling during glioma surgery and longitudinal monitoring of mucosal surfaces. Looking ahead, advancing multi-omics integration, increasing spatial and temporal resolution, and accelerating analysis will be key to achieving comprehensive, real-time maps of tissue state evolution.

Nanoneedles were fabricated according to our established protocols12,41. We photopatterned 0.6-μm dots with 2-μm spacing on p-type 0.001–0.02 Ω cm 100-mm Si wafers coated in 160-nm silicon-rich silicon nitride. The pattern was transferred into the silicon nitride layer via CHF3/O2 plasma reactive ion etching (RIE), followed by electroless Ag deposition (20 mM AgNO3 in 10% HF, 2 min) and subsequent metal-assisted chemical etching (H2O2:HF (10%v/v) 1:99, 7.5 min). SF6 plasma RIE shaped nanoneedles. Chips were diced (0.8 × 0.8 cm2) after fabrication.

Porous silicon layers were fabricated according to established protocols40. Electrochemical etching (HF 50%:EtOH = 1:3) in solution with current density of 34 mA cm−2 was applied for 60 s.

All animal experiments were performed under the authority of project licence PBE6EB195, Prof. Al Jamal Khuloud and personal licence I13B24EFC, Miss Nadia Rouatbi granted by the UK Home Office in compliance with the UK Home Office (1989) code of practice and European Union directive 2010/EU/63 for the housing and care of Animals used in Scientific Procedures and the UK Co-coordinating Committee con Cancer Research guidelines (1998). The murine brain and liver tissue used for interfacing strategy definition, molecule collection total quantification and DESI-MSI optimization were collected from wild-type adult CD1 mice, when the culling of the animal, to collect other organs, was already planned. The glioma murine model was established in a C57BL/6J42 background, injecting neural stem cells with concomitant Nf1, Pten, EGFR-vIII mutations (NPE)43. Mice ~6–8 weeks age were injected with 400,000 cells into the right hemisphere. Starting from the bregma, the stereotactic coordinates were as follows: 3 mm anterior, 1 mm lateral and 3 mm deep44. Roughly 2–3 weeks after the implantation of the tumours, animals were humanely euthanized, and the brains were collected. The maximum allowable tumour burden is approximately 1010 photons s−1. All the animals remained below this defined limit. Animals were not selected on the basis of sex, and sex was not recorded during experimentation.

Human tissue samples from patients with radiological evidence of a brain tumour were obtained from consented patients undergoing surgery at the Department of Clinical Neurosciences, NHS Lothian, Edinburgh. Tissue sample collection was approved by a local regional ethics committee (Lothian NRS Bioresource 20/ES/0061). Samples were snap frozen and stored until analysis at −80 °C. Tumour diagnosis was established from histological analysis.

The substrate of interest was placed in contact with the flat surface of a tissue specimen for less than 1 s for fresh frozen samples, or 10 s for live tissues, to allow the transfer of biomolecules to the substrate. After replica generation, the substrate was left to dry in air 1–2 min, then rapidly frozen on dry ice and finally transferred to storage at −80 °C.

Chloroform:methanol (2:1, 200 µl) was used to extract the lipids from replica and section. Seventy microlitres of liquid chromatography (LC)–MS grade water (Fisher Scientific, 10728098) was added, and the sample was vortexed for 10 s, then centrifuged (3 min, 845g, 4 °C). The organic layer was transferred to new tubes and evaporated under N2 flow; then a loading buffer was added: 4.625 mg of ammonium acetate (Sigma-Aldrich, 73594) in 210 μl of isopropanol (Fisher Scientific, 10684355):acetonitrile(Fisher Scientific, A955-1):water (2:1:1). Samples were centrifuged (15,871g, 3 min) to remove residues.

Electrospray ionization MS was perfomed in a Xevo G2-XS (Waters) using sensitivity mode, negative polarity, cone temperature 100 °C, voltage 40 V, CH2OH:H2O 0:1, with 0.1% v/v formic acid. Injection was performed with a flow rate of 5 μl min−1 (MassLynx 4.2). Spectra were acquired with 20,000 full width at half maximum (mass accuracy ≤1 ppm) mass resolution, over the range m/z 50–1,200.

DESI-MSI was performed using a Xevo G2-XS Tof mass spectrometer with DESI ion source (Waters) controlled by MassLynx 4.2 and HD Imaging 1.4 softwares operated in sensitivity mode, negative polarity, cone temperature 150 °C, voltage 50 V, pixel size 50–150 µm and scan rate 100 µm s−1. Spectra were acquired with 20,000 full width at half maximum (mass accuracy ≤1 ppm) mass resolution, over the range m/z 50–1,200.

Tandem MS (MS/MS) was first performed on tissue sections using a standard DESI-MSI set-up with optimized collision energy for fragmentation. When lipid abundance was insufficient for identification by DESI MS/MS, the analysis was performed on brain lipid extracts by LC–MS/MS (Supplementary Information). To identify the MS/MS fragmented ions of target m/z values, spectra were analysed with LipostarMSI (Molecular Horizon)45. All MS/MS spectra were then cross-checked in lipid databases including MassBank (https://massbank.eu/), Lipidmaps (https://lipidmaps.org/), HMDB (https://hmdb.ca/) and SwissLipids (https://www.swisslipids.org/) and the scientific literature (Supplementary Table 1).

We developed a preprocessing pipeline to create a common and meaningful representation of the lipidomic signature across tissue sections and replicas. The pipeline consisted of tumour segmentation and spectra alignement by lockmass using the prominent peak at m/z 885.5498 followed by total ion count (TIC) normalization. For the analysis in Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 1 where unbiased feature detection was essential to compare across conditions and replica substrates, we generated the common representation by quantization of raw spectra followed by correction (see below). For the analysis in Figs. 3–6, we generated the common representation using the peak identification algorithm of HD Imaging (HDI, Waters) to ensure the biological relevance of the detected features.

Normalization and quantization are used to adjust the individual mass spectra in order to remove spectra-to-spectra variability within a given section or replica, generating a common representation with reduced dimensionality that is comparable across all sections and replicas. Each spectrum was normalized using TIC normalization46,47. In this study, we used equal width binning with bin widths of half the m/z resolution. All m/z values and the corresponding intensity values within the bin are represented by the bin centre m/z value and the intensity sum. We assume that the peaks do not slide from one bin to the other during the acquisition, causing errors in peak alignment. This is a reasonable assumption as the bin width is significantly smaller than the mass resolution of the data collected. However, the m/z values corresponding to ions can be identified more accurately by reducing the bin size. Focusing on the lipid range of 600–900 m/z, this process leads to a spectrum representation of size 24,000 dimensions.

Tissue segmentation is the process of separating the tissue spectra from background (non-tissue) spectra. Due to the high dimensionality of mass spectrometric data, we created a single-channel representative image using the accumulation of the selected representative channels m/z values that are associated with grey matter, white matter and tumour, respectively48 (TRIANB—m/z 794.55, 834.53, 886.60; LIVER (STD)—m/z 634.40, 794.55, 886.60; LIVER (OPT)—m/z 794.55, 834.53, 886.60; CHIP TYPE (flat_porous_substrate)—m/z 861.89, 848.89, 862.85; CHIP TYPE (porous_nNs_with_porous_substrate)—m/z 600.51, 768.53, 885.55; CHIP TYPE (porous_nNs)—m/z 794.55, 834.53, 886.60; CHIP TYPE (solid_nNs)—m/z 627.53, 834.53, 886.60; tissue section—m/z 794.55, 834.53, 886.60). Using the average threshold, we segmented the representative image to use as a mask for the separation of tissue and background spectra. For better segmentation and removal of salt and pepper noise, we used median smoothing with a filter size of 3.

Spectra correction according to the background (background correction) is the process of removing background signals that do not represent the actual tumour signal. Given a spectrum in an image, we applied z-score normalization using the mean and standard deviation (s.d.) of background spectra of the image. This ensures that the background signal has a mean of 0 and s.d. of 1.

Classification of tissue sections and replicas into high- and low-grade gliomas was performed using machine learning models from Scikit-learn49 applied to single-spectrum data within m/z 600–900 (lipids). This single-spectrum classification approach was selected to accommodate the limited cohort size and the assumption that each biopsy exhibited a homogeneous grade. Models were trained separately for sections and replicas, utilizing four machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, decision trees, XGBoost27 and LightGBM28.

To ensure robustness and prevent data contamination, we used a leave-one-batch-and-patient-out validation strategy (Supplementary Table 4). Specifically, models were trained on data excluding all spectra from the same patient and imaging session as the test set. This cross-validation approach mitigated potential confounding effects of batch variability and patient-specific biases. Hyperparameter tuning for each model was conducted using the Optuna50 framework, optimizing for the ROC AUC.

To evaluate the variability and stability of model performance, the classification process was repeated across 100 different random seeds. The primary evaluation metric was the ROC AUC, calculated independently for sections and replicas. In addition, cross-prediction analyses were performed, with models trained on sections tested on replicas, and vice versa, to assess the molecular similarity between the two.

For the best-performing algorithm, logistic regression, further analysis and interpretation was done. Permutation testing validated the significance of classification performance, comparing median AUC values against those obtained from randomized labels. Results were complemented by an analysis of feature importance using SHAP29 to identify significant spectral peaks contributing to classification.

The data were analysed using custom scripts, starting from the HDI common lipid representation. Longitudinal changes in untreated samples were assessed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) on a univariate linear regression model, comparing lipid abundance between D0T0 and D5T0. Changes were considered significant if P < 0.01 and \(|{{\mathrm{log}}}_{2}(\frac{{\mathrm{D}}5{\mathrm{T}}0}{{\mathrm{D}}0{\mathrm{T}}0})| > 2\) with each brain treated as an individual sample. To study the effect of treatement on the tumour for each species, we defined the metric \(\Delta T=\Delta {\mathrm{T}}1-\Delta {\mathrm{T}}0\) where \(\Delta {\mathrm{T}}0=\left[{\mathrm{D}}5{\mathrm{T}}0\right]-[{\mathrm{D}}0{\mathrm{T}}0]\) and \(\Delta {\mathrm{T}}1=\left[{\mathrm{D}}5{\mathrm{T}}1\right]-\left[{\mathrm{D}}0{\mathrm{T}}1\right]\) changes in species abundance over time for untreated and treated samples, respectively. Abundances were calculated as the average across all pixels classified as tumour. Each tissue slice was considered a separate sample. A negative \(\Delta T\) indicated a net decrease in species abundance due to treatment, while a positive \(\Delta T\) indicated a net increase. Treatment-related changes were identified by performing ANOVA on a linear regression model with time and treatment as factors. Changes were deemed significant if P < 0.01 and \(\left|z\left(\Delta T\;\right)\right| > 0.5\) where \(z\left(\Delta T\;\right)\) is the z score of \(\Delta T\). Model robustness was tested by including cross-factor interactions and sample pairing, which showed high concordance in identifying significant species.

No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications4,13,51. Data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested. Samples were randomly selected for assignment to the experimental groups to ensure unbiased distribution across conditions. Experimental conditions and stimulus presentation were also organized without any systematic bias to ensure that each sample had an equal chance of being exposed to any given condition. Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments. No animal or data point was excluded from the analysis. Statistical analysis and graphical data visualization was done using GraphPad Prism 9 and 10 (GraphPad). For volcano plots, differences between two groups were calculated by Student's t-test. Peaks with log10(P value) <50 and abs(log2(fold change)) >1 or >0.5 informed the selection of peaks relevant for discrimination of tissues and confirmed by visual inspection.

Metrics details

Proteogenomics is limited by the challenge of modeling the complexities of gene expression. We create moPepGen, a graph-based algorithm that comprehensively generates non-canonical peptides in linear time. moPepGen works with multiple technologies, in multiple species and on all types of genetic and transcriptomic data. In human cancer proteomes, it enumerates previously unobservable noncanonical peptides arising from germline and somatic genomic variants, noncoding open reading frames, RNA fusions and RNA circularization.

A single stretch of DNA can give rise to multiple protein products through genetic variation and through transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational processes, such as RNA editing, alternative splicing and RNA circularization1,2,3,4. The number of potential proteoforms rises combinatorically with the number of possibilities at each level, so despite advances in proteomics technologies5,6, much of the proteome is undetected in high-throughput studies7.

The most common strategies to detect peptide sequences absent from canonical reference databases7,8,9 (that is, non-canonical peptides; Supplementary Note 1), are de novo sequencing and open search. Despite continued algorithmic improvements, these strategies are computationally expensive, have elevated false-negative rates and lead to difficult data interpretation and variant identification issues10,11. As a result, the vast majority of proteogenomic studies use non-canonical peptide databases that have incorporated DNA and RNA alterations7. These databases are often generated using DNA and RNA sequencing of the same sample, and this improves error rates relative to community-based databases (for example, UniProt12, neXtProt13 and the Protein Mutant Database14) by focusing the search space7,15.

This type of sample-specific proteogenomics relies on the ability to predict all potential protein products generated by the complexity of gene expression. Modeling transcription, translation and peptide cleavage to fully enumerate the combinatorial diversity of non-canonical peptides is computationally demanding. To simplify the search-space, existing methods have focused on generating peptides caused by individual variants or variant types16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33, greatly increasing false negative rates and even potentially resulting in false-positive detections if the correct peptide is absent from the database (Extended Data Table 1). To fill this gap, we created a graph-based algorithm for the exhaustive elucidation of protein sequence variations and subsequent in silico non-canonical peptide generation. This method is moPepGen (multi-omics peptide generator; Fig. 1a).

a, moPepGen algorithm schematic. moPepGen is a graph-based algorithm that generates databases of non-canonical peptides that harbor genomic and transcriptomic variants (for example, single-nucleotide variant (SNV), small insertion and deletion (INDEL), RNA editing, alternative splicing, gene fusion and circular RNA (circRNA)) from coding transcripts, as well as from novel open reading frames of noncoding transcripts. C-term, C terminus; N-term, N terminus. b,c, moPepGen achieves linear runtime complexity when fuzz testing with SNVs only (b) and with SNVs and indels (c), based on 1,000 simulated test cases in each panel. d, A variant peptide from SYNPO2 that harbors a small deletion and an SNV. Fragment ion mass spectrum from peptide-spectrum match (PSM) of the non-canonical peptide harboring two variants (top, both) is compared against the canonical peptide theoretical spectra (left, theoretical spectra at the bottom) and against the variant peptide theoretical spectra (right, bottom). Fragment ion matches are colored, with b-ions in blue and y-ions in red. e–g, A somatic SNV D1249N in AHNAK was detected in DNA sequencing of a prostate tumor (CPCG0183) at chr11:62530672 (e), in RNA sequencing (f) and as the non-canonical peptide MDIDAPDVEVQGPNWHLK (g). RNA-Seq, RNA sequencing; WGS, whole-genome sequencing. h,i, Fragment ion mass spectrum from PSM of the canonical peptide MDIDAPDVEVQGPDWHLK (h) and the non-canonical peptide (i). m/z, mass-to-charge ratio.

moPepGen captures peptides that harbor any combination of small variants (for example, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), small insertions and deletions (indels) and RNA editing sites) occurring on canonical coding transcripts, as well as on non-canonical transcript backbones resulting from novel open reading frames (ORFs), transcript fusion, alternative splicing and RNA circularization (Supplementary Fig. 1). It performs variant integration, in silico translation and peptide cleavage in a series of three graphs for every transcript, enabling systematic traversal across every variant combination (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 1a–d). All three reading frames are explicitly modeled for both canonical coding transcripts and non-canonical transcript backbones to efficiently capture frameshift variants and facilitate three-frame ORF search (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Alternative splicing events (for example, retained introns) and transcript fusions are modeled as subgraphs with additional small variants (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Graphs are replicated four times to fully cover peptides of back-splicing junction read-through in circular RNAs (circRNAs; Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). moPepGen outputs non-canonical peptides that cannot be produced by the chosen canonical proteome database. It documents all possible sources of each peptide to eliminate redundancy, such as where different combinations of genomic and transcriptomic events can produce the same non-canonical peptide.

We first validated moPepGen using 1,000,000 iterations of fuzz testing (Supplementary Fig. 2). For each iteration, a transcript model, its nucleotide sequence, and a set of variants composed of all supported variant types were simulated. Then non-canonical peptides generated by moPepGen were compared with those from a ground-truth brute-force algorithm. moPepGen demonstrated perfect accuracy and linear runtime complexity (4.7 × 10−3 seconds per variant) compared to exponential runtime complexity for the brute-force method (Fig. 1b,c). A comprehensive non-canonical peptide database of human germline polymorphisms was generated with 15 GB memory in 3.2 h on a 16-core compute node; the brute-force method was unable to complete this task.

Having established the accuracy of moPepGen, we next compared it to two popular custom database generators, customProDBJ18 and pyQUILTS22. We tested all three methods on five prostate tumors with extensive multi-omics characterization34,35,36. We first evaluated the simple case of germline and somatic point mutations and indels. Most peptides (84.0 ± 0.9% (median ± median absolute deviation (MAD))) were predicted by all three methods, with moPepGen being modestly more sensitive (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Next, we considered the biological complexity of alternative splicing, RNA editing, RNA circularization and transcript fusion. Only moPepGen was able to evaluate peptides generated by all four of these processes, and therefore 80.2 ± 2.1% (median ± MAD) of peptides were uniquely predicted by moPepGen (Extended Data Fig. 3b). By contrast only 3.2% of peptides were not predicted by moPepGen, and these corresponded to specific assumptions around the biology of transcription and translation made by other methods (Extended Data Fig. 3c and Methods). By generating a more comprehensive database, moPepGen enabled the unique detection of 53.7 ± 12.2% (median ± MAD) peptides from matched proteomic data (Extended Data Fig. 3d). An example of a complex variant peptide identified only by moPepGen is the combination of a germline in-frame deletion followed by a substitution in SYNPO2 (Fig. 1d). In addition, moPepGen's clear variant annotation system readily enables peptide verification across the central dogma. For example, the somatic mutation D1249N in AHNAK was detected in ~30% of both DNA and RNA reads and was detected by mass spectrometry (MS; Fig. 1e–i), confirmed by three search engines. Taken together, these benchmarking results demonstrate the robust and comprehensive nature of moPepGen.

To illustrate the use of moPepGen for proteogenomic studies, we first evaluated it across multiple proteases (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Using independent conservative control of false discovery rate (FDR) across canonical and custom databases (Methods and Supplementary Fig. 3)7,18, we focused on detection of novel ORFs (that is, polypeptides from transcripts canonically annotated as noncoding) across seven proteases37 in a deeply fractionated human tonsil sample38 (Supplementary Table 1). moPepGen enabled the detection of peptides from 1,787 distinct ORFs previously thought to be noncoding, and these peptides were most easily detected with the Arg-C protease (Extended Data Fig. 4b), suggesting alternative proteases may enhance noncoding ORF detection (Extended Data Fig. 4c). In total, 184 noncoding ORFs were detected across four or more proteomic preparation methods in this single sample, demonstrating that moPepGen can reliably identify novel proteins (Extended Data Fig. 4d,e).

We next sought to demonstrate that moPepGen can benefit analyses in different species by studying germline variation in the C57BL/6 N mouse37,39. Using strain-specific germline SNPs and indels from the Mouse Genome Project37,39, moPepGen predicted 5,481 non-canonical peptides arising from variants in protein-coding genes and 15,475 peptides from noncoding transcript novel ORFs (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Across the proteomes of three bulk tissues (cerebellum, liver and uterus), we detected 18 non-canonical peptides in protein-coding genes and 343 from noncoding ORFs (Extended Data Fig. 5b–d and Supplementary Table 2). Thus, moPepGen can support proteogenomics in non-human studies to identify variants of protein-coding genes and novel proteins.

To evaluate the use of moPepGen for somatic variation, we analyzed 375 human cancer cell line proteomes with matched somatic mutations and transcript fusions40,41 (Supplementary Data). moPepGen processed each cell line in 2:58 min (median ± 1:20 min, MAD), generating 2,683 ± 2,513 (median ± MAD) potential non-canonical variant peptides per cell line. The number of predicted variant peptides varied strongly with tissue of origin, ranging from median of 838 to 16,255 (Fig. 2a), and was driven largely by somatic mutations in protein-coding genes and by fusion events in noncoding genes (Extended Data Fig. 6a–c). Searching the cell line proteomes identified 39 ± 27 (median ± MAD) non-canonical peptides per cell line (Methods and Supplementary Fig. 4). The majority of these were derived from noncoding transcript ORFs (Extended Data Fig. 6d and Supplementary Table 3). Variant peptides from coding somatic mutations were more easily detected than those from transcript fusion events (Extended Data Fig. 6e,f). A total of 26 genes had variant peptides detected in cell lines from three or more tissues of origin, including the cancer driver genes TP53, KRAS and HRAS (Fig. 2b). Peptide evidence was also found for fusion transcripts involving cancer driver genes like MET and STK11 (Extended Data Fig. 6g,h). We validated non-canonical peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) by predicting tandem mass (MS2) spectra using Prosit42 and verifying that variant peptide MS2 spectra correlated better with predictions based on the matched non-canonical peptide sequences than predictions based on their canonical peptide counterparts (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 6i). Coding variant peptide PSMs also showed high cross-correlations with their Prosit-predicted variant MS2 spectra, on par with those of canonical PSMs and their canonical spectra (Extended Data Fig. 6j). Thus, moPepGen can effectively and rapidly detect variant peptides arising from somatic variation. These variant peptides may also prove to harbor functional consequences in future studies. Genes, such as KRAS, trended toward greater essentiality for cell growth in multiple cell lines with non-canonical peptide hits, and the effects may be independent of gene dosage (Extended Data Fig. 7a–c). Across cell lines, detected variant peptides were also predicted to give rise to 416 putative neoantigens (3.0 ± 1.5, median ± MAD per cell line; Extended Data Fig. 7d and Supplementary Table 4), including recurrent neoantigens in KRAS, TP53 and FUBP3 (Extended Data Fig. 7e).

We next sought to demonstrate the use of moPepGen in data-independent acquisition (DIA) MS using eight clear cell renal cell carcinoma tumors with matched whole-exome sequencing, RNA sequencing and DIA proteomics43. In each tumor, moPepGen predicted 157,016 ± 34,215 (median ± MAD) unique variant peptides from protein-coding genes (Extended Data Fig. 8a). Using a Prosit-generated spectral library, we detected 307 ± 112 (median ± MAD) variant peptides in each tumor using DIA-NN44 (Extended Data Fig. 8b and Supplementary Table 5). Germline-SNP and alternative splicing were the most common sources of detected variant peptides (Extended Data Fig. 8c,d). Non-canonical peptides derived from RNA editing events were detected in 21 genes (Extended Data Fig. 8e–i). Thus, moPepGen can enable the detection of variant peptides from DIA proteomics.

Finally, to demonstrate the use of moPepGen on complex and comprehensive gene expression data, we analyzed five primary prostate cancer samples with matched DNA whole-genome sequencing, ultra-deep ribosomal-RNA-depleted RNA sequencing and MS-based proteomics34,35,36. moPepGen generated 1,382,666 ± 64,281 (median ± MAD) unique variant peptides per sample, spanning 115 variant combination categories (Fig. 2c). Searching this database resulted in the detection of 206 ± 56 (median ± MAD) non-canonical peptides per sample, with 138 ± 28 (median ± MAD) derived from protein-coding genes (Extended Data Fig. 9a and Supplementary Table 6). The distribution of intensities and Comet expectation scores of non-canonical PSMs closely resembled that of canonical PSMs and was distinct from all decoy hits (Supplementary Fig. 5), lending confidence in our non-canonical peptide detection. All samples harbored proteins containing multiple variant peptides (9 ± 1.5, median ± MAD proteins per tumor; range 2–6 variant peptides per protein; Fig. 2d). Some detected peptides harbored multiple variants, including two from prostate-specific antigen (PSA from the KLK3 gene; Extended Data Fig. 9b). Germline SNPs were the major common cause of variant peptides on coding transcripts and alternative splicing events were the most common cause on noncoding transcripts (Extended Data Fig. 9c–e). Nine genes showed recurrent detection of peptides caused by circRNA back-splicing (Extended Data Fig. 9f–g), with 36/78 circRNA PSMs validated by de novo sequencing (Supplementary Table 7)45. These recurrent circRNA-derived peptides were verified in five additional prostate tumors (Supplementary Fig. 6). We also detected four peptides from noncoding transcripts with the recently reported tryptophan-to-phenylalanine substitutants46. Thus, moPepGen can identify peptides resulting from highly complex layers of gene expression regulation.

moPepGen is a computationally efficient algorithm that enumerates transcriptome and proteome diversity across arbitrary variant types. It enables the detection of variant and novel ORF peptides across species, proteases and technologies. moPepGen integrates into existing proteomic analysis workflows, and can broadly enhance proteogenomic analyses for many applications.

A transcript variant graph (TVG) is instantiated for each transcript, incorporating all associated variants. In a TVG, nodes are transcript fragments with reference or alternative nucleotide sequences, whereas edges are the opening or closing of variant nodes connecting them to the reference sequence, or the elongation of reference sequences. The TVG starts with three linear nodes of the entire transcript sequence representing the three reading frames, offset by 0, 1 or 2 nucleotides from the transcript 5′ end. A variant is incorporated into the graph by breaking the node at the variant's start and end positions and attaching a new node with the alternative sequence to the new upstream and downstream nodes. An in-frame variant is represented as a node with incoming and outgoing nodes in the same reading frame subgraph, whereas frameshifting variants have incoming nodes and outgoing nodes in different reading frames. The outgoing reading frame index equals to (Sref−Salt) mod 3, where Sref is the length of the reference sequence and Salt is the length of the alternative sequence. For transcripts with an annotated known canonical ORF, variants are only incorporated into the subgraph of the appropriate reading frame (Extended Data Fig. 2a). If frameshifting variants are present, downstream variants are also incorporated into the subgraphs of the outgoing frameshift nodes. For transcripts without an annotated ORF, all variants are incorporated into all three reading frames (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Large insertions and substitutions as the result of alternative splicing events (for example, retained introns, alternative 3′/5′ splicing, etc.) are represented as subgraphs that can carry additional variants (Extended Data Fig. 2b).

After the TVG has been populated with all variants, nodes that overlap with each other in transcriptional coordinates are aligned to create variant bubbles within which all nodes point to the same upstream and downstream nodes (Extended Data Fig. 1b). This is done by first finding connection nodes in the TVG, the reference nodes without any variants that connect two variant bubbles after they are aligned. The root node is the first connection node, and the next connection node is found by looking for the first commonly connected downstream node with length of five or more nucleotides that is outbound to more than one node (Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig. 7). Nodes between the two connection nodes are then aligned to form a variant bubble by generating all combinations of merged nodes so that they all point to the same upstream and downstream nodes (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Overlapping variants in the variant bubble are automatically eliminated because they are disjoint. The sequence lengths of nodes in the variant bubble are also adjusted by taking nucleotides from the commonly connected upstream and downstream nodes to ensure that they are multiples of three. A peptide variant graph (PVG) is then instantiated by translating the nucleotide sequence of each TVG node into amino acid sequences.

A PVG is converted into a peptide cleavage graph (PCG), where each edge represents an enzymatic cleavage site (Extended Data Fig. 1c). For connection nodes, all enzymatic cleavage sites are first identified, and the node is cleaved at each cleavage site. Because enzymatic cleavage site motifs can span over multiple nodes (for example, the trypsin exception of not cutting given K/P but cutting given WK/P), connection nodes are also merged with each downstream and/or upstream node and cut at additional cleavage sites if found. To optimize run time, different merge-and-cleave operations are used depending on the number of incoming and outgoing nodes, and the number of cleavage sites in a node (Supplementary Fig. 8). Hypermutated regions where variant bubbles contain many variants and/or the lack of cleavage sites in connection nodes can result in an exponential increase in the number of nodes in the aligned variant bubble. We use a pop-and-collapse strategy, such that when merge-and-cleave is applied to a connection node, x number of amino acids are popped from the end of each node in the variant bubble. The popped nodes are collapsed if they share the same sequence. The pop-and-collapse operation is only applied when the number of nodes in a variant bubble exceeds a user-defined cutoff.

Variant peptides with the permitted number of miscleavages are called by traversing through the PCG. We use a stage-and-call approach that first visits all incoming nodes to determine the valid ORFs of a peptide node (Supplementary Note 3). Stage-and-call also allows cleavage-gain mutations and upstream frameshift mutations to be carried over to the downstream peptide nodes. Peptide nodes are then extended by merging with downstream nodes to call variant peptides with miscleavages (Supplementary Note 4). For noncoding transcripts, novel ORF start sites, including those caused by start-gain mutations, are found by looking for any methionine (M) in all three subgraphs. Terminology used in subsequent sections, including canonical and non-canonical database, variant peptides, non-canonical peptides and proteoform, is defined in Supplementary Note 1.

Most fusion transcript callers detect fusion events between genes, causing ambiguity of which transcripts of the genes are involved in a particular fusion event. We took the most comprehensive approach and endeavored to capture all possible variant peptides by assuming that a fusion event could happen between any transcript of the donor and accepter genes. Fusion transcripts are considered as novel backbones in graph instantiation, with an individual graph instantiated for each donor and acceptor transcript pair. Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertion/deletions (indels) of both donor and acceptor transcripts are incorporated into the TVG. The translated and cleaved PCG is then traversed to call variant peptides, identical to a canonical transcript backbone. If the fusion breakpoint occurs in an intron, the intronic nucleotide sequence leading up to or following the breakpoint is retained as unspliced, and its associated intronic variants are included. The ORF start site of the donor transcript is used if exists when calling variant peptides. The fusion transcript is treated as a noncoding transcript if the donor transcript is annotated as noncoding.

Similar to fusion transcripts, circRNAs are treated as novel backbones, with an individual graph instantiated for each circRNA (Extended Data Fig. 2c). A circular variant graph (a counterpart to TVG) is instantiated by connecting the linear sequence of the circRNA onto itself at the back-splice junction and incorporating SNVs and indels. Novel peptides can theoretically be translated from circRNAs if a start codon is present, by ribosome read-through across the back-splicing junction site. If the circRNA length is not a multiple of three nucleotides, translation across the back-splicing site induces a frameshift. Without a stop codon, the ribosome may traverse the circRNA up to three times before the amino acid sequence repeats. Therefore, moPepGen extends the circular graph linearly by appending three copies of each reading frame as a subgraph to account for frameshifts. The extended graph is then translated to a PVG and converted to a PCG. Variant peptides are called by treating every circRNA as a noncoding transcript and scanning all novel start codons in all three reading frames.

moPepGen applies various assumptions to selectively include or exclude certain variant events or peptides (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Start-codon-altering variants are excluded due to the uncertainty around whether and where translation will still occur. Similarly, splice-site-altering variants are omitted due to the complexity of splicing determinants, which can result in skipping to the next canonical or non-canonical splice site. We terminate translation at the last complete peptide when stop codons are unknown, as incomplete transcript annotations create ambiguity in downstream sequences, obscuring enzymatic cleavage sites. Stop-codon-altering variants do not extend translation beyond the transcript, as the downstream genomic region is not assumed to be part of the RNA transcript.

Genomic (SNPs, SNVs, indels) and transcriptomic variants (fusion transcripts, RNA editing sites, alternative splicing transcripts, circRNAs) are first converted into gene-centric entries for each transcript that they impact. We defined a gene-based GVF (genetic variant format) derived from VCF (variant calling format) to store all relevant information for each variant, including the gene ID and offset. moPepGen includes built-in parsers to convert variant caller outputs into GVFs. SNPs, SNVs and indels require the annotation via Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)47 for compatibility with the parseVEP module. Parsers for fusion, alternative splicing, RNA editing and circRNA operate directly on native outputs. moPepGen is implemented in Python and supports easy extension and addition of new parsers. The full Nextflow pipeline (https://github.com/uclahs-cds/pipeline-call-NonCanonicalPeptide)48,49,50, automates data preprocessing, peptide prediction and database tiering, with optional transcript abundance filtering. Our DNA data processing pipeline is described elsewhere51.

To validate moPepGen, we implemented a fuzz testing framework where transcripts with varying properties (for example, coding status, strand, selenocysteine and start or stop codon position) and artificial sequences are simulated. Each is paired with simulated variants across all supported types. The resulting peptides are compared against those generated by a brute force algorithm, which iterates through all possible variant combinations to identify non-canonical peptides. The brute force algorithm also performs three-frame translation for noncoding transcripts. Fuzz testing and the brute force algorithm are included in the moPepGen package.

Proteomic characterization of 375 cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) was obtained from Nusinow et al.41. Fractionated raw mass spectrometry (MS) data were downloaded from MassIVE (project ID: MSV000085836). Somatic SNVs and indels, and fusion transcript calls were downloaded from the DepMap portal (https://depmap.org/portal, 22Q1). Somatic SNVs and indels were converted to GRCh38 coordinates from hg19 using CrossMap (v0.5.2)52. Gene and transcript IDs were assigned to each SNV/indel using VEP (v104)53 with genomic annotation GTF downloaded from GENCODE (v34)54. Fusion results were aligned to the GENCODE v34 reference by first lifting over the fusion coordinates to GRCh38 using CrossMap (v0.5.2). After liftover, the records were removed if the donor or acceptor breakpoint location was no longer associated with the gene, if either breakpoint dinucleotides did not match with the reference or if either gene ID was not present in GENCODE (v34).

MS-based proteome of mouse strain C57BL/6 N was obtained from Giansanti et al.37. Fractionated raw MS data of the liver, uterus and cerebellum proteomes were downloaded from the PRIDE repository (project ID: PXD030983). Germline SNPs and indels were obtained from the Mouse Genomes Project39 with GRCm38 VCFs downloaded from the European Variation Archive (accession: PRJEB43298). Germline SNPs and indels were annotated using VEP (v102) against Ensembl GRCm38 (v102)47.

A human tonsil tissue processed using ten different combinations of proteases and peptide fragmentation methods (ArgC_HCD, AspN_HCD, Chymotrypsin_CID, Chymotrypsin_HCD, GluC_HCD, LysC_HCD, LysN_HCD, Trypsin_CID, Trypsin_ETD, Trypsin_HCD) was obtained from Wang et al.38. Fractionated raw mass spectrometry data were downloaded from the PRIDE repository (project ID: PXD010154).

DIA proteomic data from eight clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) samples were obtained from Li et al.43. Raw mass spectrometry data were retrieved from the Proteomic Data Commons (PDC, PDC000411). WXS and RNA-seq BAM files were obtained from Genomic Data Commons (GDC, Project: CPTAC-3, Primary Site: Kidney). WXS data was processed using a standardized pipeline to identify germline SNPs, somatic SNVs and indels51. BAM files were reverted to FASTQ using Picard toolkit (v2.27.4) and SAMtools (v1.15.1)55, realigned to GRCh38 using BWA-MEM2 (v2.2.1)56, and calibrated using BQSR and IndelRealignment from GATK (v4.2.4.1)57. Germline SNPs and indels were called following GATK (v4.2.4.1) best practices57,58, whereas somatic SNVs and indels were called using Mutect2 (from GATK v4.5.0.0), followed by annotation with VEP (v104)53 against GENCODE v34. RNA-seq BAM files were converted to FASTQ using Picard toolkit (v2.27.4) and SAMtools (v1.15.1) and re-aligned to GRCh38.p13 with GENCODE v34 GTF using STAR (2.7.10b)59. Transcript fusion events were called using STAR-Fusion (v1.9.1)60, alternative splicing events were called using rMATS (v4.1.1)61 and RNA editing sites were called using REDItools2 (v1.0.0)62 using paired RNA and DNA BAMs.

The proteomic characterization of five prostate cancer tissues were obtained from Sinha et al.36. Raw mass spectrometry data were downloaded from MassIVE (project ID: MSV000081552). Germline SNPs and indels, as well as somatic SNVs and indels, were obtained from the ICGC Data Portal (Project code: PRAD-CA). Variants were indexed using VCFtools (v0.1.16)63 and converted to GRCh38 using Picard toolkit (v2.19.0), followed by chromosome name mapping from the Ensembl to the GENCODE system using BCFtools (v1.9-1)55. Mutations were annotated using VEP (v104)53 against GENCODE (v34). Raw mRNA sequencing data were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (accession: GSE84043). Transcriptome alignment was performed using STAR (v2.7.2) to reference genome GRCh38.p13 with GENCODE (v34) GTF and junctions were identified by setting the parameter–chimSegmentMin 10 (ref. 59). CIRCexplorer2 (v.2.3.8) was used to parse and annotate junctions for circRNA detection64. Fusion transcripts were called using STAR-Fusion (v1.9.1)60. RNA editing sites were called using REDItools2 using paired RNA and DNA BAMs (v1.0.0)62. Alternative splicing transcripts were called using rMATS (v4.1.1)61.

All MS raw files (.raw) were converted to mzML using ProteoWizard (3.0.21258)65. The GRCh38 human and the GRCm38 mouse canonical proteome databases were obtained from GENCODE (v34) and Ensembl (v102), respectively, with common contaminants66 added and reversed sequences appended for target-decoy FDR control. Database searches were performed using Comet (v2019.01r5)67 with static modifications of cysteine carbamidomethylation, and up to three variable modifications (methionine oxidation, protein N-terminus acetylation, peptide N-terminus pyroglutamate formation), under full trypsin digestion with up to two miscleavages (except for the tonsil samples processed with alternative enzymes), for peptide lengths 7–35. For CCLE, static modification of tandem mass tag (TMT; 10plex) on the peptide N-terminus and lysine residues and variable modification of TMT on serine residues were additionally included, following the original study. CCLE data were searched in low resolution with 20 ppm precursor mass tolerance, 0.5025 Da fragment mass tolerance, and clear TMT m/z range, following the original publication. All other datasets used high-resolution label-free quantification, with precursor mass tolerance of 20 ppm (mouse), 10 ppm (tonsil) and 30 ppm (prostate), and fragment mass tolerance of 0.025 Da for tonsil or 0.01 Da otherwise, following original publications. Tonsil proteomes were searched with the appropriate fragmentation method setting and with the protease used in sample preparation, with a maximum of two miscleavages for Lys-C and Arg-C, three miscleavages for Glu-C and Asp-N and four miscleavages for chymotrypsin, as in the original publication38. The eight DIA ccRCC proteomes were not searched against a canonical database.

Peptide-level target-decoy FDR calculation was performed using the FalseDiscoveryRate module from OpenMS (v3.0.0-1f903c0)68 using the formula (D + 1)/(T + D), where D and T are the numbers of decoy and target PSMs, respectively. Peptides were filtered at 1% FDR, and PSMs were removed from the corresponding mzML for subsequent non-canonical database search. Post hoc cohort-level FDR was calculated to verify an FDR cutoff smaller than 1%. Peptide quantification was performed using OpenMS FeatureFinderIdentification (v3.0.0-1f903c0)69 with ‘internal IDs only' and adjusted precursor mass tolerances as above, and otherwise default parameters. TMT quantification was performed using OpenMS IsobaricAnalyzer (v3.0.0-1f903c0), without isotope correction due to absence of correction matrix.

Human (GRCh38) and mouse (GRCm38) reference proteomes were obtained from GENCODE (v34) and Ensembl (v102), respectively. Non-canonical peptide databases were generated with trypsin digestion of up to two miscleavages and peptide lengths 7-25, except for alternative protease samples. Alternative translation peptides were generated using callAltTranslation, including those with selenocysteine termination70 or W > F substitutants46. Peptides from noncoding ORFs were generated using callNovelORF with ORF order as min and with or without alternative translation. Noncoding ORF peptide databases were also generated for each alternative protease used in processing of the tonsil proteome, with appropriate number of maximum miscleavages as outlined above.

Non-canonical peptide databases were generated for 376 CCLE cell lines, 375 of which have non-reference channel proteomics characterization. This included all 10 cell lines in the bridge line and 366 non-reference cell lines with mutation data. Of the 378 non-reference channels across 42 plexes, three cell lines were duplicated, seven were in the bridge line, two didn't have mutation or fusion information and additional eight didn't have fusion information. Variant databases from all cell lines in a TMT plex, including the ten cell lines in the reference channel, were merged along with noncoding ORF peptides to generate plex-level databases. Plex-level databases were split into three tiers: ‘Coding' (SNVs, indels and fusion in coding transcripts), ‘Noncoding' (novel ORFs) and ‘Noncoding Variant' (SNVs, indels and fusion in noncoding transcripts).

Non-canonical peptide databases for the proteome of mouse strain C57BL/6 N were generated by calling variant peptides based on germline SNPs and indels, followed by merging with the noncoding ORF peptides. The resulting non-canonical peptides were then split into ‘Germline' (variants in coding transcripts), ‘Noncoding' (novel ORFs) and ‘Noncoding-Germline' (variants in noncoding transcripts).

For the eight ccRCC tumors, sample-specific variant peptides were called from germline/somatic SNVs and indels, RNA editing, transcript fusion and alternative splicing. Resulting peptides were merged with noncoding ORF and alternative translation peptides and split into four tiers: ‘Variant' (variants in coding transcripts), ‘Noncoding' (novel ORFs), ‘Noncoding Variant' (variants in noncoding transcripts) and ‘Alt Translation' (selenocysteine termination and W > F substitutants46).

For the five prostate tumors, variant peptides were called from all available genomic and transcriptomic variants, including germline/somatic SNVs and indels, RNA editing sites, transcript fusions, alternative splicing and circRNA. These peptides were then merged with the noncoding ORF and alternative translation peptides and split into five tiers: ‘Variant' (variants in coding transcripts), ‘Noncoding' (novel ORFs), ‘Noncoding Variant' (variants in noncoding transcripts), ‘Circular RNA' (circRNA ORFs) and ‘Alt Translation' (selenocysteine termination and W > F substitutants46).

Non-canonical database searches were performed similarly to canonical proteome searches for each dataset, as described in detail above. Custom databases of peptide sequences were concatenated with the reverse sequence for FDR control. Non-canonical peptide searches with Comet (v2019.01r5) were set to ‘no cleavage' and did not permit protein N-terminus modifications or clipping of N-terminus methionine. Peptide-level FDR was set to 1% independently for each tier of non-canonical database, and PSMs of peptides that passed FDR were removed from the mzML for subsequent searches. Post hoc cohort-level FDR was calculated to verify an FDR cutoff smaller than 10% in tiers with at least 100 PSMs, as cohort-level FDR is not meaningful for smaller tiers. Each database tier thus had independent FDR control using database-specific decoy peptides, and a spectrum is excluded from subsequent searches after finding its most probable match. This strategy minimizes false-positives caused by joint FDR calculation with canonical peptides and enables a conservative detection of non-canonical peptides7,18. For CCLE, peptides were only considered for detection and quantitation for a cell line if they existed in the sample-specific database. For prostate tumors, additional searches were conducted with the same non-canonical databases using MSFragger (v3.3)71 and X!Tandem (v2015.12.15)72 with equivalent parameters for verification. For all datasets, quantified peptides were distinguished by charge and variable modifications, and detected but not quantified peptides were excluded from subsequent analysis.

Raw files were converted to.mzML files using ProteoWizard (3.0.21258)65. Sample-specific variant peptide FASTA databases were generated using the aforementioned non-canonical database generation pipeline, with individual spectral libraries.msp files generated by Prosit42. Prosit was configured with instrument type of LUMOS, collision energy of 34, and fragmentation method of HCD, with all default parameters otherwise. Searches were conducted using DIA-NN (v1.8.1)44 against the sample-specific predicted variant peptide spectral libraries with protein inference disabled, a q-value cutoff of 0.01, and ‘high precision' quantification.

Neoantigens were predicted from non-canonical peptides detected in CCLE proteomes. Cell line-specific HLA genotype was inferred using OptiType (v1.3.5)73 from WGS or WXS data. Detected non-canonical peptides from the ‘Coding' tier were converted to FASTA and analyzed using MHCflurry (v2.0.6)74 with default parameters and cell line-specific HLA genotypes.

All statistical analysis and data visualization were performed in the R statistical environment (v4.0.3), with visualization using BoutrosLab.plotting.general (v6.0.2)75. All boxplots, except for Extended Data Fig. 7a, show all data points, the median (center line), upper and lower quartiles (box limits), and whiskers extend to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5 times the interquartile range. In Extended Data Fig. 7a, data are summarized as boxplots to improve visual clarity without individual points due to the large number of gene and cell line combinations. All comparisons were performed on biological replicates, defined as independent patients, tumors, or cell lines as appropriate to each analysis. Schematics were created in Inkscape (v1.0) and Adobe Illustrator (27.8.1), and figures were assembled using Inkscape (v1.0).

Gene dependency data from CCLE CRISPR screens were downloaded from the DepMap data portal (https://depmap.org/portal, 24Q2). Twelve cell lines with non-canonical peptide detections in proteomic data from at least ten genes were selected. The CERES scores76 of genes with non-canonical peptide hits were compared to those without, using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Additionally, pooled CERES scores across all genes and cell lines were compared between the two groups using the same test. For KRAS, CERES scores and RNA abundance were compared between cell lines with non-canonical peptide detections in proteomic data and those with only canonical peptides, using the Mann-Whitney U-test.

Target PSM experimental spectra were extracted from mzML files using pyOpenMS (v3.1.0)77 and visualized in R. Theoretical spectra were generated from the target peptide sequences using the TheoreticalSpectrumGenerator module of OpenMS and compared to the experimental spectra using hyperscores via the HyperScore module with consistent parameters as described above (for example, fragment mass tolerance). Fragment ion matching between the experimental and theoretical spectra was performed using a similar approach to IPSA78. Theoretical spectra with predicted fragment peak intensities were generated using Prosit via Oktoberfest (v0.6.2)79 with parameters (for example, fragmentation method and energy) matching the original publication41 and compared using cross-correlation80 with settings matching Comet searches (for example, fragment_bin_offset). To assess the distribution of cross-correlation values for variant peptide PSMs, we randomly selected 1,000 canonical PSMs from each of the 42 TMT-plexes as control. circRNA peptide PSMs were validated using the Novor algorithm through app.novor.cloud, using parameters (for example, fragmentation method, MS2 analyzer, enzyme, precursor and fragment mass tolerance) consistent with database searches45.

A post hoc approach was used to estimate the FDR threshold at the cohort level for each database tier. Within each sample and database tier, we first identified the target hit with the highest FDR value under the 1% threshold, denoted as FDRi:

The number of decoy and target hits with FDR values less than FDRi for each sample was tallied. The equivalent cohort-level FDR threshold was then calculated by dividing the total number of decoy hits by the total number of target and decoy hits across the cohort:

The graph algorithm of moPepGen implements the following key steps: a) A transcript variant graph (TVG) is generated from the transcript sequence with all associated variants. All three reading frames are explicitly generated to efficiently handle frameshift variants. b) Variant bubbles of the TVG are aligned and expanded to ensure the sequence length of each node is a multiple of three. c) Peptide variant graph (PVG) is generated by translating the sequence of each node of the TVG. d) Peptide cleavage graph is generated from the PVG in such a way that each node is an enzymatically cleaved peptide.

a) For coding transcripts, variants are only incorporated into the effective reading frames. For transcripts that are canonically annotated as noncoding, variants are added to all three reading frames to perform comprehensive three-frame translation. b) Subgraphs are created for variant types that involve the insertion of large segments of the genome, which can carry additional variants. c) The graph of a circular RNA is extended four times to capture all possible peptides that span the back-splicing junction site in all three reading frames. In the bottom panel, the nodes in magenta harbor the variant 130-A/T and the nodes in yellow harbor 165-A/AC. d) Illustration of a circRNA molecule with a novel open reading frame. Each translation across the back-splicing site may shift the reading frame. If no stop codon is encountered, the original reading frame is restored after the fourth crossing.

a) and b) Non-canonical peptide generation results from benchmarking of moPepGen, pyQUILTS and customProDBJ using only point mutations (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions (indels; a), and with inputs from point mutations, indels, RNA editing, transcript fusion, alternative splicing and circular RNAs (circRNAs). b). Top boxplot shows the number of peptides in each set intersection and right barplot shows the total number of non-canonical peptides generated by each algorithm in five primary prostate tumour samples (n = 5). c) Assumptions made by moPepGen for handling edge cases that differ from other algorithms. Start-codon-altering and splice-site-altering variants are omitted due to the uncertainty of the resulting translation and splicing outcomes. Transcripts with unknown stop codons do not have trailing peptide outputs because of the uncertainty of the trailing enzymatic cleavage site. Stop-codon-altering variants do not result in translation beyond the transcript end, adhering to central dogma.

Metrics details

The image of Earth at night from space, with its constellations of cities, has become iconic. However, our understanding of the source and scale of artificial light emissions is still in the dark, hampering urban environmental protection efforts. In 2021, our citizen scientists used the Nachtlichter app to count and classify 234,044 light sources across a 22-km2 area, primarily in Germany. We show that such a dataset can be used to translate space-based radiance observations to the more understandable unit of installed lights per km2 on the ground. We find that in German city centers, more total light sources are used for advertising and aesthetic purposes than for street lighting. Furthermore, we estimate that 78 ± 3 million individual light sources remain illuminated at midnight across Germany, highlighting great potential for mitigation. These findings not only offer direct knowledge for artificial light research but also serve as a practical resource for policymakers to mitigate urban light pollution.

Artificial light is now widely recognized as an important environmental pollutant1,2, affecting about a quarter of Earth's land surface and 88% of Europe3. Despite this, the character of the sources of light emissions, particularly in cities, remains poorly understood as public inventories lack information about sources other than streetlights (for example, signs and decorative lights). This information cannot be directly determined from aerial or satellite views (Fig. 1) because of insufficient sensitivity and spatial resolution. We addressed this knowledge gap by co-designing a citizen science4 app called Nachtlichter5 (night-time lights) and using it to observe and classify the different types of light sources visible from public spaces. Our main goals were to examine the relative frequencies of lights present at different levels of urbanization and how the absolute numbers of lights relate to radiance measured by satellites. This information is needed for effective targeting for lighting, energy and environmental policy and for modeling the environmental impacts of light pollution.

a, Low-resolution (750 m) satellite data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Day–Night Band (October 2018), with high-resolution aerial data in the background (taken 20 December 2021). b, The red rectangle highlights a single reprojected pixel (290 × 460 m), which is shown in greater detail on the aerial photographs (~1-m resolution). c, Further zoom, near the bottom right of the rectangle. While the positions of individual light sources can be identified, the type of light source (for example sign, floodlight) cannot be determined, even at this relatively high resolution.

Overhead images of cities at night (Fig. 1) emphasize street networks due to the viewing angle and suggest that public street lighting is the main or only relevant source of light from cities. Public authorities are responsible for streetlights, and with the rise of geographic information systems, have records of their locations and properties. Perhaps for these reasons, much of current lighting discussion and policy focuses on street lighting. Observational studies, however, have found the majority of light emissions from cities generally come from other sources5 (median 67%, range 25–92%). For example, an evaluation of light sources in Flagstaff, Arizona, USA, based on surveys, sampling and luminaire information, suggested that streetlights are responsible for only about 12% of upward escaping light emissions6. An intervention experiment in Tucson, Arizona, USA, found that streetlights were responsible for only 16% of the radiance in satellite observations taken after midnight7. The largest reported streetlight fraction was 75% for Ribeira, Spain, but even in this case, the same publication reported 45% after reconstruction of the lighting8. Comprehensive lighting inventories that identify all of the light sources have so far only been conducted in peacetime for areas with small numbers of lights, for example, in International Dark Sky Place applications9,10 (a US Corps of Engineers study from 1943 provides a wartime example11). An important question for anyone wishing to control urban light pollution is therefore ‘what makes up the rest of the light?'

Beyond policy, the lack of direct knowledge of light sources is problematic for several research areas. The contribution of light towards artificial skyglow above and near cities, for example, depends strongly on the direction of radiance3. Information about the typical distributions of light source type, color and degree of shielding are therefore critical inputs for skyglow models, which may strongly underestimate skyglow if they neglect sources other than streetlights12. Relatedly, studies of lighting change based on late-night satellite observations suggest widespread but relatively slow global increase of about 2% annually13,14, whereas early evening visual observations of stars by citizen scientists suggest a much more rapid annual increase of about 10% (ref. 15). This difference could potentially be explained by changes in the type, color and direction of lights active at different times of night16. However, without large-scale lighting inventories, it would be difficult to confirm or refute such a hypothesis.

Despite lacking understanding of the sources of light, the environmental, social and health consequences of lighting are increasingly clear17. For example, urban lights attract birds from large distances, often with deadly consequences18,19. The artificial brightening of the night sky has altered Earth's night environment over vast areas, extending far from cities3. Despite its comparatively weak illuminance, this skyglow has been shown to affect the behavior of wild animals20. Laboratory studies suggest that even plants react to skies brighter than those under which life evolved21. Night-time light emissions are also directly linked to monetary and energy issues, as recently illustrated by temporary restrictions on outdoor light use enacted in Germany22 and other countries, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Light reductions therefore promote climate stability and biodiversity.

The Nachtlichter project aimed to obtain a basic empirical understanding of the character of lighting in cities and smaller settlements in Germany through citizen science supported by a mobile app. This methodology was ideal for allowing residents in multiple places to collect data during the same time period. In Nachtlichter, participants walked along a transect, usually from one street corner to the next, and counted and classified the light sources they observed according to 18 pre-defined categories (Methods and Fig. 2). Consistency between different observers was ensured through a mandatory online training23. The standard deviation of variability in light counts between different observers on the same street was estimated to be roughly 10–20% (ref. 5), which is similar to the standard deviation of monthly radiance reported by the satellite sensor used in this study24.

These and similar icons were used in the tutorial during training and in the app during data acquisition.

Observations were performed during autumn of 2021, and the study areas were designed to completely cover all publicly accessible areas within specified reprojected satellite pixels of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Day–Night Band (DNB), a night-time lights observing satellite25. As a German-speaking citizen science team, we had initially planned to cover a total of 6 km2 in three German communities. However, the response was greater than expected, and we acquired data over a total area of roughly 22 km2 in 33 communities, nine of which were outside of Germany5.

During 2021, a total of 234,044 lights were reported on 3,868 individual transects, by 258 registered participants during 4,409 observation surveys. The number of surveys exceeded the number of transects because some transects were surveyed multiple times. Private windows were the most frequently observed light type, followed by streetlights and commercial windows (Table 1). Five light categories were found to change considerably, depending on the time at which the transect was observed: private and commercial windows, signs (meaning the sum of the three sign categories shown in Fig. 2), canopy lights and lights mounted on buildings (Extended Data Fig. 8). A correction based on a logistic function was applied to estimate the number of active lights that would have been observed during early (19:00) or late (00:00) evening (Methods).

The radiance observed by satellite was positively correlated with the total number of light sources per km2 (Fig. 3a; Spearman r = 0.67). This positive correlation was also observed for 17 of the 18 different light types (Spearman r from 0.3 to 0.65; Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2); only garden decoration lights exhibited a negative correlation (Spearman r = −0.15, p < 0.04). We find a median radiance of 1 nW cm−2 sr−1 per 317 counted lights per km2 across all locations. When the entire dataset was treated as a single analysis area, the relationship was 302 counted lights per km2. On the basis of our temporal correction and for Germany only, if all observations were made at 19:00, we would expect to have a relation of 385 ± 16 lights per km2 per nW cm−2 sr−1 (standard errors) or 219 ± 11 lights per km2 for observations at 00:00 (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). For several light types, the counted number of lights was not proportional to the satellite radiance. For example, the density of street and path lights rises more slowly than the median value in the dataset, whereas the density of signs rises more quickly (Fig. 3). This is because the mix of lighting types differs between more and less urban areas, as discussed below. The relationship between lights expected at midnight and DNB radiance was considerably smaller (120 ± 6) for the areas surveyed outside of Germany, compared to those inside.

a–c, The relationship is shown for the sum of all lights (a), for the sum of street and path lights (b) and for the sum of the three sign categories (c). The line is not a fit but rather shows the median relationship over all analysis areas (both inside and outside of Germany). A time correction is not applied for these graphs; the results of multiple surveys are simply averaged. Each satellite pixel covers an area of about 0.15 km2 at the latitude of Germany. Satellite pixels for which no signs were observed are indicated with red points at 0.1 lights per km2.

We attempted to estimate ‘weights' for different types of light, representing the amount that a single example of a given light type typically contributes to a DNB observation of radiance. This was done by searching for fit parameters in a linear model that reproduce the radiance observed by an overhead sensor, given Nachtlichter light counts as input. We tried this with three datasets: DNB data (750-m resolution), SDGSat-1 imagery (10-m resolution) and aerial photographs (1-m resolution). In all cases, the parameters returned by the fit were unphysical (for example, assigning larger weights to small signs than to large signs).

We examined the relationship between land cover and the types of lighting present for locations in Germany (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 7). For our three main land-cover types, private windows were the most commonly observed light source, both for our actual counted numbers and our extrapolation to midnight (Fig. 4, Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 2). In dense urban areas (that is, continuous urban fabric and industrial and commercial areas (Extended Data Fig. 9)), we find that lights used for advertising outnumber streetlights; in the early evening, there was roughly one illuminated sign and one commercial window for each streetlight. In the late night, the fraction of streetlights relative to total lights increases as signs and windows are turned off. Nevertheless, streetlights remained outnumbered by other light sources by roughly a factor of 5–7 in dense areas. Despite the fact that many signs and shop windows turn off late at night, their relative fraction of total lights stays similar, due to the larger extinction of private windows. As we were not able to measure the frequency with which other light types turn off during the night, the true relative contribution is probably slightly smaller from what is presented here. Whereas ‘garden decoration' lights are present even in city centers (for example, as small lights on balconies), their fraction relative to the total number of lights was considerably larger in small towns and suburbs (that is, discontinuous urban fabric).

The bar graphs show the extrapolated fraction of lighting types in the early and late evening for the three land-cover types in turn. The three types of sign are combined, and ‘H&D&G' stands for ‘house numbers, doorbells and garden decoration lights'.

The same subset of data (Germany only) was used to examine the additional parameters associated with the lights recorded by the citizen scientists (shielding, brightness and color). The vast majority of streetlights in Germany were either fully (48%) or partially (49%) shielded (Extended Data Fig. 4). Pathway lighting, which in general fulfills a similar visual objective as street lighting, was far more frequently unshielded (16%). The lack of shielding was even more common for lights mounted on the sides of buildings, where only 29% were fully shielded and 26% were unshielded. The majority (58%) of observed flood lights were unshielded, implying upward lighting rather than downward lighting. This practice was most common in continuous urban fabric areas, where 70% were unshielded.

The likelihood of a light source being described as bright or dim varied considerably depending on the light type (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4) and to some extent on the geographical context (Extended Data Fig. 10). For example, house numbers were frequently reported as dim, but our participants told us during the campaign that they often appeared brighter in areas with little or no street lighting. This was reflected in the data, in that house numbers and doorbells were much more frequently reported as ‘bright' in discontinuous than in continuous urban fabric. The color of lights varied considerably between light types (Extended Data Fig. 5), with canopy lights being reported as overwhelmingly (88%) white and streetlights the category most frequently classified as orange (46%). We also examined the frequency of use of presence detection for controlling at least one light on a transect (Extended Data Fig. 6). Currently, the use of motion control is more common in dimly lit villages and suburbs (29%) than in continuous urban fabric (15%) or industrial and commercial areas (11%).

The results provide a complete and large-scale lighting inventory of city lights and demonstrate the value of applying a citizen science approach to the problem of understanding lighting makeup on large spatial scales. Our participants classified all of the light sources visible over a walking distance of 600 km during an observation period of over 500 h. Whereas space-based sensors17,25 can quickly survey large areas, they do not report what is actually installed on the ground (Fig. 1). In contrast, our application of human cognition provided a rich understanding of the types and properties of light sources. These results allow a ‘translation' of satellite (DNB) radiance observations from radiometric units to lights per km2, putting the scale of the problem of light pollution from cities into terms humans can relate to. For example, for DNB the number of lights in a German pixel can now be estimated simply by multiplying the average radiance (in nW cm−2 sr−1) first by 219 and then by the coverage area. If we assume that our observations are representative of the lighting practice in all of Germany, we estimate that on a typical clear night, the DNB observes the radiation emitted by approximately 2.52 ± 0.11 million individual light sources from Berlin and 78 ± 3 million light sources over the mainland of Germany (somewhat less than one light per person). This can be compared to a total estimate of 9–9.5 million public streetlights in Germany26.

These results have implications for a number of application and research areas. For example, shielding lights to prevent upward emission is one of the most effective ways to prevent light pollution11,27, but we found only about half of the German streetlight stock and 29% of lights mounted on buildings are fully shielded. Improving shielding is therefore an area that policymakers could focus on. The effectiveness of policy measures could be examined by a future lighting inventory. The results provide further evidence that it is not sufficient to consider only streetlights in studies of animal behavior28 and simulations of skyglow12. Within and near cities, skyglow studies have consistently observed radiance decreases3,29,30,31 and color shifts32,33 over the course of the night. These are both consistent with our observations of late-night extinction of residential and business lighting, underscoring the importance of including private lighting in research studies. This temporal change in city lighting also demonstrates the need for a more robust set of night-time light observations from space, particularly with regard to multiple overpass times17 and for remote sensing of human and economic parameters34. This will be increasingly important with the transition to smart cities, where adaptive lighting emits light only when needed (Extended Data Fig. 6).

While we found correlations between the total number of light sources per square kilometer and satellite radiance, we were not able to estimate physically plausible weighting factors that reproduce the satellite datasets. Several factors may be responsible for this. First, Nachtlichter observations provide little radiometric information—in urban areas, signs with a luminance of 20 or 100 cd m−2 would probably be classified as ‘normal' but might both be classified as ‘bright' in an area with little or no other light sources. Second, differences in building heights and street widths affect how easily light can escape to space35. While a broad street may use the same number of streetlights as a narrow street, their overall lumen outputs are likely different. Indeed, our attempted algorithm often assigned a large (unphysical) weight to traffic lights, which are most often installed on wider, busier streets. In the future, Nachtlichter observations could be combined with information about urban morphology36 and more detailed information about land use37 to better estimate weighting factors. Nevertheless, our results already show that ground-based lighting inventories provide an important complement to satellite datasets and are probably necessary to understand the root causes of lighting change observed from space.

Ground-based surveys such as Nachtlichter could also help to explain geographical differences in urban light use. Countries with similar wealth and development often have dramatically (>200%) different average per capita light emissions observed from space13,38. Even within a single country, emissions from cities with similar populations differ by up to an order of magnitude27,38,39. It is still unclear why this is the case and to what extent it is due to differences in luminance40 or types of light. A Nachtlichter-style approach could be used to obtain targeted observations in cities for which the satellite has identified a dramatic difference in total light emissions. The results of such a study could provide important information for sustainability science by identifying what industries, specific lighting applications or policy approaches are responsible for the differences. Furthermore, Nachtlichter observations could be used to assess the efficacy of lighting policy9,41,42,43,44,45.

Street lighting has been the dominant focus of urban energy and environmental policy related to light44. This is understandable as governments control these lights and they are an important contributor to total light emissions. Our data, however, confirm the finding that streetlights represent a minority of total light emissions from cities. The consequence of this narrow policy focus is illustrated by recent trends in skyglow radiance in the United States. In 2017, a Department of Energy report suggested that widespread conversion to light emitting diode (LED) street lighting was likely to decrease skyglow46. However, observations of skyglow taken during 2011–2022, when many lights were converted, suggest a rapid (10% per year) increase15. While it is an open question as to whether existing approaches have failed to control the growth in emissions due to the neglect of private lighting or other factors, it is at least clear that existing policy results in increasing light growth.

New approaches to sustainable lighting policy that go beyond energy efficiency are therefore needed. For example, lighting regulation in France now requires advertising lighting to be turned off at hours when pedestrians are unlikely to be present and interior lights to be turned off when buildings are not occupied47. This approach has the potential to reduce light emissions without adversely affecting advertisers. Matching streetlight provision to resident needs with lighting curfews48 or motion sensors similarly reduces light without affecting objective or perceptive safety49. Finally, because private windows are the most common outdoor light source, policy encouraging the use of curtains after sunset could have a larger impact than one might first assume.

The effectiveness of policy changes, for example, the degree of compliance among advertisers, could be tested in the future using the Nachtlichter methodology. In addition to providing an evidence-based assessment, this would have the advantage of increasing citizen participation in the evaluation and planning of city spaces. This may lead to further opportunities for energy and light savings as observations could help identify installations where light is being wasted. For example, our participants reported that 24% of bollards were bright, indicating that they were glaring or otherwise not well matched to the surroundings. In commercial and industrial areas, over a quarter of signs were reported as being exceptionally bright, which is consistent with previous research that has found that signs are often much brighter than is recommended or appropriate50. This may reflect a need to update regulations about glare as the existing guidelines predate the use of highly luminous LEDs by several decades. Finally, we believe the involvement of citizens raises overall awareness of both effective and problematic lighting practice, as many of our participants have shared their insights with city leaders and in public presentations.

Limitations of the Nachtlichter methodology itself are discussed in Gokus et al.5, but some additional points apply to these analyses. The relation between DNB radiance and lights per km2 appears to be specific to Germany and should be investigated in other countries before being applied. Areas with skyscrapers and private industrial parks were not surveyed and would need a different approach. The dimming or turning off of streetlights that occurs in many smaller German communities is not well captured here because of our lack of radiometric observations, the generally early time at which participants conducted their surveys and our limited number of observations from such communities. Finally, the contribution of car headlights remains unknown.

The Nachtlichter methodology has provided a unique measure of the status quo of lighting practice and its relation to upward radiance and land-cover type. Running the experiment in targeted areas, especially in other countries, could reveal the causes behind the large per capita variation in light emissions between and within developed countries38. This would require a considerable effort, however, as the training materials and app would need to be adapted to different languages, and a native language team would need to coordinate each national campaign. This may become more feasible as future satellites with higher spatial resolutions and sensitivities are developed17 because the survey areas would not need to be as large as was the case for this analysis. With higher-resolution imagery, a targeted mix of transects with different characteristics (for example, urban, rural, commercial, industrial) could allow improved generalization of the results and modeling of light pollution and its impacts. Additionally, by repeating the experiment on the same transects after several years have passed, lighting change at the individual light source level could be studied. Such an effort would probably be most successful in the context of a long-term campaign, with sufficient resources allocated to participant recruitment, training and retention.

The Nachtlichter app was developed within a project called Nachtlicht-BüHNE (Citizen-Helmholtz Network for research on night light phenomena)5, using a co-design process in which academic and citizen scientists met regularly over a several year period. Our co-design process, app methodology, site selection, systematic variability of the observations, data pre-processing and data structure have already been described in detail5. This section therefore briefly covers the data and validation and focuses mainly on the methods unique to the analyses presented here.

In a Nachtlichter observation, participants conducted a ‘survey' while walking along a ‘transect', which typically extended from one street corner to the next. The participants used the app to classify and count all of the light sources that they could see. A total of 18 light categories were used for the 2021 experiment (Fig. 2). Depending on the light type selected, participants provided additional information about the size, emission direction (that is, shielding), color and subjective brightness. Transects were pre-defined in most cases and selected and arranged to completely survey the publicly accessible areas covered by a reprojected DNB satellite pixel. We therefore somewhat undercount the total number of installed lights because we did not record lights installed in areas not visible from public spaces (for example, backyards, courtyards and rooftops; Supplementary Fig. 5).

The observation time (of night) was not constrained, but the main experiment took place from 23 August to 14 November 2021, usually over a period of weeks for each pixel51. Additional smaller data-taking campaigns were conducted in the spring and autumn of 2022 to develop a correction for certain lighting types that were found to frequently turn off. The campaign in autumn of 2022 took place immediately after a German law requiring switch offs of some signs was passed22. However, as our statistics were not sufficient to observe a difference to the data taken in 2021, all of the available data were combined for determining the correction factors. The app and training materials were updated in 2023 to perform an experiment directly investigating lighting changes; data from that campaign is not included in the analyses reported here.

Observations were collected mainly in Germany from city centers, suburbs and villages (Extended Data Fig. 7). Region selection was based partly on where citizen scientists were present and able to count, and areas without sharp changes between land use near the boundaries were preferred5. Brighter areas in cities are therefore overrepresented compared to their relative frequency by area, but this means we cover nearly the full range of radiance observed for German communities13. Areas with high-rise buildings were generally avoided because of the difficulty in counting windows, but there were a few cases in which buildings of approximately ten stories were located along the transect. For most of the counting areas, buildings were one to four stories tall. The raw data may be downloaded from within the app itself (https://lichter.nachtlicht-buehne.de), and a processed dataset more suitable for analysis is available from GFZ Data Services52.

Observations were validated by comparing our total counts of streetlights to the numbers reported in public databases5. The values agreed to better than 7% for our areas in Berlin, Cologne and Dresden. In Fulda and Leipzig, the Nachtlichter counts were 40% and 90% larger, respectively. This was due to the presence of streetlights on private roads in these two measurement areas and exemplifies how Nachtlichter data are more complete than existing public lighting databases. Observations were additionally validated by comparing the counts of different participants to each other on the same transect. This was complicated by the fact that participants did not count at identical times, and later observations had fewer lights. The standard deviation for the total number of lights on the two most frequently observed streets was 15% for observations during 19:30–21:30. The counts were more consistent for streetlights than for other types of light, such as signs and windows, for which participants estimated sizes.

As mentioned above, some light source types turn off during the course of the night5. Different satellite pixels were sampled at different dates of the campaign, and the earliest (by date) observations were acquired later at night, due to the late sunset. We therefore developed an approximate temporal correction to account for the changes and tested a few strategies using a Monte Carlo simulation of counting data. We found that the dataset size limitation would prevent fitting a general function. We therefore decided to model the switch off with a logistic function:

where p is the probability that a light is on at time t (in hours relative to midnight), f is the fraction of lights that turn off, s is a parameter that describes how quickly the lights turn off and h is the time (relative to midnight) at which half of the lights that will turn off have done so (Extended Data Fig. 8).

This function was motivated by published curves for private window illumination in Manhattan, New York, USA53, and for its simple interpretation (for example, for private windows, h is effectively the average bedtime and s is related to the variability in bedtimes across the population). For most light source types, we do not have sufficient data to detect a change in lighting, or the returned fits did not describe the data well (for example, streetlights in Extended Data Fig. 8). For these sources, we do not apply a correction. The function is based on the assumption that all transects in Germany behave identically. While this is not the case, we found the fit for five of the light source types to be plausible and use it to extrapolate (or in some cases interpolate) the observations from each street to an estimate for what would have been observed at 19:00 and 00:00 (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 1). The category ‘signs' is based on the sum of illuminated signs, self-luminous signs and video screens. The same correction is applied to all three.

The fit parameters were found by minimizing the sum of errors over all surveys on transects with multiple observations. The individual survey error is defined by a least-squares-like function (Supplementary Fig. 6):

where Nc is the reported (counted) number of lights and Ne is the expected number of lights based on our fit. Ne is calculated via Ne(t) = Nt × p(t), where Nt is the estimated number of total lights on the transect in the early evening. Nt is found by minimizing Esurv for the current fit parameters. This minimization causes the red dots and yellow stars in Extended Data Fig. 8 to be distributed equally above and below the fit line as Nt is estimated separately for each transect.

The left term of equation (2) is similar to the usual weighted least-squares term for normally distributed data, but we have effectively increased the standard deviation to account for participant counting errors and the (frequently) small number of lights counted. However, our errors are not actually normal (or Poisson) distributed; large differences can occur if a set of lights is controlled by the same switch and turned off in unison, if a participant makes a dramatic counting error, or if the lights on the transect do not behave like the ‘average German street'. The right-hand term, therefore, minimizes the contribution of information from transects that do not behave in a typical fashion (that is, the difference compared to what we expected is larger than 3σ). In our tests based on Monte Carlo data, this procedure successfully returned fit parameters that reasonably match the inputs used in the simulation, even when we included the possibility of counting errors and correlated lights.

When a single Nachtlichter observation was made for a transect, the extrapolation process to obtain an estimate of the number of lights at an alternative time is straightforward. If Nc lights were observed (counted) at time t0, then the estimated (maximum) total number of lights that would be turned on in the early evening for this transect is Nt = Nc / p(t0). The number of lights we would expect to be observed at a different given time t is then Ne = Nt × p(t). When a transect was surveyed multiple times, then Nt is estimated by finding the value of Nt that minimizes the sum of Esurv for all observations on the transect. The estimate at a given time t is then Ne = Nt × p(t) as before. For the light types for which no corrections are applied, multiple observations were simply averaged. These procedures lead to fractional values for the total number of lights.

The DNB54 observes the Earth nightly at an equatorial crossing time of 1:30, with a consistent resolution of 750 meters across the scan. The detector is sensitive to electromagnetic radiation in the wavelength range 500 nm to 900 nm (for convenience referred to here as ‘light'). The combined light emissions from all sources within the ~0.56 km2 is integrated into a single observed radiance value for the pixel. The nightly observations are combined into monthly and annual composite products by the Earth Observation Group25, which uses a 15-arcsecond global raster. The pixel size therefore depends on latitude and is roughly 470 by 300 meters in central Germany (Fig. 1). Because the reprojected pixel is smaller than the intrinsic resolution, the radiance reported for a single pixel includes light from surrounding pixels. To the greatest extent possible, we therefore aimed to have Nachtlichter study sites located in areas surrounded by areas of similar character5. Nevertheless, the satellite radiance is biased downwards for lit areas near the city limits, and the radiance observed by adjacent DNB pixels is correlated.

We estimated the radiance of the Nachtlichter study areas using DNB observations taken during September through November during 2019 to 2021 (September 2021 was excluded because of considerable areas of Germany with no data, due to stray light on the sensor). We also calculated the total radiance from the mainland of Germany using airglow corrected data55,56 for the months of October and November of 2015–2023 (a longer time series was used to better estimate uncertainties). The standard deviation of the sum of Germany's lights was 7%, and the standard error was 1.7%. For Berlin, these numbers were 9% and 2.0%, and for our selection of DNB pixels (below), 12% and 4%.

We defined 181 analysis areas, usually associated with single DNB pixels (Fig. 1). In 12 cases, we joined multiple DNB pixels and Nachtlichter counts into a combined analysis area, as we felt it was more appropriate based on the relative positioning of the transects and pixel boundaries (for example, in the case of a single very long rural street segment that runs through multiple pixels and that was created directly by a participant rather than pre-defined by the main team). These were mainly in rural sites; the group of 12 had a median DNB radiance of 2.3 nW cm−2 sr−1.

We calculated the fraction of each transect that lay inside of a pixel boundary and multiplied this by the individual light type counts to obtain an estimate of how many of the transect's lights are located inside of the pixel. These results were then summed to obtain a total number of counted lights within the pixel. The median relationship for all 181 analysis areas was 317 counted lights per km2 per nW cm−2 sr−1. This is shown as a straight line in Fig. 3, and similar medians are shown in Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2 and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2.

Graphing the median relationship is useful for showing when light types do or do not have a proportional relationship to satellite radiance, but it means pixels are weighted equally, rather than by the number of counted lights. As an alternative that assigns equal weight to counted lights and radiance, we divided the sum of counted lights over all pixels by the sum of the product of radiance and area for each individual pixel. This effectively treats all of our observations as if they were one single contiguous analysis area. When done for the German pixels only, and for the estimated light counts at midnight, we find a conversion factor of 219 ± 11 (standard error) lights per km2 per nW cm−2 sr−1 (Supplementary Table 1 provides other selections). This factor was then multiplied by the product of mean radiance and total area to obtain the estimated number of lights that would be observed if all of Germany or all of Berlin were sampled using our methodology at midnight.

The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was calculated for each of the individual light types separately (Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2). In all cases, the (two-sided) null hypothesis of no correlation between satellite radiance and light type was rejected. The null hypothesis was least strongly rejected for garden decoration lights (p < 0.04) and house numbers and doorbells (p < 0.0002).

The estimation of the number of lights on at midnight is affected by three sources of uncertainty: person-to-person variability in the number of lights counted, uncertainty on the fit to the time-of-night light extinction curve and the uncertainty on the ‘sum of light' from the DNB (reported above). The uncertainty on person-to-person variability was estimated via Monte Carlo. In a series of simulations, the sum of lights count (Nc) of each participant was adjusted according to Nsim = Nc / v, where ‘v' is an individual variability factor randomly chosen from a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 15%. We then calculated Ntotal = ∑N for each simulation and measured a standard deviation of 2.1%.

The uncertainty on both the fit parameters and the total lights at midnight were estimated using bootstrap with replacement57. Each survey with N > 1 observations was assigned a statistical weight of N − 1 (because one degree of freedom is used for each transect to estimate the total number of lights). A total of 1,000 replacement samples were then randomly assembled with an equivalent statistical weight to the full sample, and the extinction curve was fit for each light type for this sample. For the uncertainty on the fit parameters, we report the confidence interval covering the 15.715th to 84.285th percentile (corresponding to 1σ; Supplementary Table 3). For each bootstrap dataset and fit, we then calculated the sum of lights for the five fit light categories and its standard deviation. We find that the fit introduces a standard error of 3.2% for the estimate of the total lights (all 18 categories) at midnight (Supplementary Table 4). The three uncertainties were then added in quadrature to yield a total standard error of 4.1% for Germany and 4.3% for Berlin.

Our land-cover analysis makes use of the most recent CORINE (Coordination of Information on the Environment) Land Cover (CLC) classification from 201858. The CLC includes 44 different types of land cover, but 94% of our transects were located in one of just three land-cover classes: continuous urban fabric (typically city or town centers, with >80% of the land surface covered by impermeable features), discontinuous urban fabric (built-up areas with 30 to 80% of the surface covered by impermeable features) and industrial and commercial areas (Extended Data Figs. 9 and 10). Only 2% of transects were associated with the next most frequent land-cover class: urban green areas. Because our observations were made primarily in cities, the ‘industrial and commercial' areas within this analysis are mainly commercial areas.

The minimal mapping unit of CLC is 25 ha. Because our transects are rarely longer than 200 meters, they are typically entirely within a single CLC class. (A higher-resolution land-cover dataset, such as the Copernicus Urban Atlas, would introduce additional complications, because transects would be more frequently split between land-cover types. It would also not be available for our rural sites.) We calculated the midpoint of each transect and assigned the transect to the land-cover category at that point. We then summed the light counts for all of the selected transects within the land-cover type, using the 19:00 and 00:00 projection for the overall comparison (Fig. 4) and the actually counted data (using the mean in case of multiple surveys) for the examination of the shielding, color and brightness properties (Extended Data Figs. 4 and 5 and Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). For our examination of the prevalence of motion control detection (Extended Data Fig. 6), we treat each transect separately and show the maximal value reported. This is because in the early evening, observers may not notice that lights are activated based on presence detection, due to the higher number of people present on the street.

Light is additive, so each light source located within a radiometer's pixel increases the overall radiance measured by the instrument for that pixel proportional to its flux at the sensor. We attempted to find ‘weighting factors' that would return radiance estimates based on the lights counted on the ground:

Here Lpred is the predicted radiance observed for a given pixel, wi is a weighting factor for one of the 370 combinations of light and associated characteristics (for example, ‘video screen, small, medium brightness, white'), Ci is the total number of lights of that type observed within the pixel and the sum is over all of the different individual light types counted within the pixel. The values of wi can be estimated by minimizing the value of a cost function that depends on them, such as:

Because we observed fewer than 370 DNB pixels, it was necessary to reduce the number of parameters. By assuming four variables representing the contribution of different sizes, emission directions, colors and brightnesses are constant across all lighting types, the number of variables could be reduced to 22. We attempted such minimizations with DNB, SDGSat and aerial photography data, with several different cost functions (the value of 0.2 above was motivated by the observation that the standard deviation of pixels in monthly DNB data is proportional to its radiance24). Regardless of what we tried, the procedure never returned physically meaningful results.

Each satellite pixel is shown as a single point, and a line shows the median relationship between the two parameters for the actually counted dataset (no timing correction is applied). Red points at 0.1 lights per square kilometer are used to show observations for which no lights of this type were observed. The median value (relative to 1 nWcm−2sr−1) and the Spearman Rank Correlation coefficient (rs) of the dataset are shown directly on each plot.

Each satellite pixel is shown as a single point, and a line shows the median for the actually counted dataset (no timing correction is applied). Red points at 0.1 lights per square kilometer are used to show observations for which no lights of this type were observed. The median value (relative to 1 nWcm−2sr−1) and the Spearman Rank Correlation coefficient (rs) of the dataset are shown directly on each plot.

The background shows individual reprojected DNB pixels. Red boxes surround the 11 pixels for which Nachtlichter observations were made. Ring diagrams show the fraction of lights counted for 8 different groupings of light categories, with the total number of lights counted printed below the ring. The three types of signs were combined into a single category, and flood lights, lit facades, light strings, and garden decoration lights were combined into the category ‘decorative' lights.

The relative frequency of shielding is shown for five different light types across the three main land cover types, as well as for Germany as a whole (top) including all land cover types. The numbers at top left in each frame show the total number of lights counted. Full cutoff lights are shown in green, partly shielded in gray, and unshielded in orange.

The relative frequency with which participants reported a particular light was ‘orange', ‘white', or ‘other' is shown for five different light types across the three main land cover types, as well as for Germany as a whole (top). Lights reported as white are shown in gray, lights reported as orange in orange, and reported as colorful or another color in green. The numbers at top left in each frame show the total number of lights counted. The relatively high frequency for which private windows were reported as orange (39%) may be related to interior reflection from warmly colored interior surfaces before the light escapes, or transmission through a colored shade.

The pie charts show the proportion of transects for which participants said that ‘some' or ‘many' of the lights they observed turned on due to motion detectors in the different land cover areas within Germany. The number shown at top right is the total number of transects included in the sample.

The map indicates the regions within Germany at which Nachtlichter observations were made. The numbers indicate the number of discrete analysis areas (usually single reprojected DNB satellite pixels) located within the circle. The observation locations were not always adjacent, and in some cases are in different communities within the same circle (see the detailed methods paper5 for a list of all communities). The background map is a DNB image, for which darker spots represent brighter light emissions. The names of Germany's four largest cities are shown for reference only (no observations were made in Hamburg or Munich).

The logistic fits to observations from transects with multiple surveys are shown as a blue curve. Individual survey light totals are shown with red dots as a fraction relative to our expectation of how many lights would be on if the survey was observed in the early evening. Streetlights are shown above, and private windows below. For each multiply surveyed transect, the dots are positioned such that the average distance from the curve for observations on the same transect is close to zero. The yellow stars show the data for a single transect sampled four times by the same participant on a single evening (the variability in streetlight count was due to counting error, not a real change in lights). The results for streetlights are based on 2906 lights observed on 423 surveys, and for private windows on 8327 windows from 386 surveys. The temporal profile of private windows is reasonably well described by the fit curve, but this is not the case for streetlights.

The black lines show the individual transects surveyed in the city of Potsdam, Germany, and are overlaid on the Corine Land Cover map for the area. Nearly all transects are associated with one of three land cover types: ‘Continuous urban fabric', ‘Discontinuous urban fabric', and ‘Industrial or Commercial units'.

The black lines show the individual transects surveyed in the city of Potsdam, Germany, and are overlaid on an image of radiance of light emissions measured by satellite. The area is identical to that shown in Extended Data Fig. 9.

Metrics details

High ambient temperatures are associated with reduced sleep duration and quality, but effects on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity are unknown. Here we quantify the effect of 24 h ambient temperature on nightly OSA severity in 116,620 users of a Food and Drug Administration-cleared nearable over 3.5 years. Wellbeing and productivity OSA burden for different levels of global warming were estimated. Globally, higher temperatures (99th vs. 25th; 27.3 vs. 6.4 °C) were associated with a 45% higher probability of having OSA on a given night (mean [95% confidence interval]; 1.45 [1.44, 1.47]). Warming-related increase in OSA prevalence in 2023 was estimated to be associated with a loss of 788,198 (489,226, 1,087,170) healthy life years (in 29 countries), and a workplace productivity loss of 30 (21 to 40) billion United States dollars. Scenarios with projected temperatures ≥1.8 °C above pre-industrial levels would incur a further 1.2 to 3-fold increase in OSA burden by 2100.

In 2023, mean temperature recordings in the northern hemisphere were the highest on record in over 2000 years1, with temperatures 2.07 °C warmer than the pre-industrial period ( ~ 1850-1900)1. Mean global temperature is projected to increase by 2.1 to 3.4 °C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century, in the absence of additional reductions in greenhouse gas emissions2. High ambient temperatures have strong, well-established, negative effects on health3,4, including mental health outcomes5,6,7, reduced physical activity8, and ultimately, mortality9,10,11,12,13,14. High ambient temperatures are also associated with considerable reductions in sleep duration and quality15,16,17, including a near doubling of short sleep ( < 6 h) prevalence18. Sleep loss due to global warming in 2023 was recently estimated to incur a loss of 3.9 million years of life because of disability or death18.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder with an estimated global prevalence of nearly 1 billion adults19. OSA severity is typically quantified using the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), a count of partial (hypopnea) or total (apnea) upper airway collapses per hour of sleep. Untreated OSA is associated with a wide range of adverse health outcomes20, road safety events21, and all-cause mortality20. Increased OSA severity also has a dose-response relationship with the incidence of co-morbid chronic conditions, such as hypertension and type-2 diabetes20. In addition, untreated OSA is associated with large decreases in workplace productivity and absenteeism. This is estimated to cost the Australian economy nearly 4 billion AUD22 and the US economy nearly $87 billion US per year23; while data for other countries is lacking.

Some studies have shown an association between outdoor ambient temperature and OSA severity24,25,26,27. A major limitation is that most prior studies are cross-sectional and use single-night estimates of AHI, therefore neglecting to account for the substantial night-to-night variability in AHI28,29,30. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, personal, and social burden of OSA due to increased temperatures, including changes in prevalence, wellbeing burden, and workplace productivity loss have not been quantified to date. Given the potential future impact that global warming is expected to have on OSA prevalence, better estimates of the subsequent burden are needed.

Accordingly, in this global study involving 116,620 users of a validated and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared nearable OSA monitor, we investigate the dose-response relationship between daily ambient temperature and nightly OSA status, using data from the fifth generation of European Reanalysis (ERA5) dataset31. We demonstrate that high-temperature days (99th percentile; 27.3 °C) increase the probability of OSA by 45% compared to low-temperature days (25th percentile; 6.4 °C). The effect size varies by country and is generally stronger in European countries. The increased prevalence of OSA attributed to global warming in 2023 is associated with a loss of over 780,000 healthy life years and 105 million workplace productivity days across 29 countries, resulting in an estimated economic cost of ~98 billion United States dollars. Projections estimate that a ≥ 1.8 °C increase in global ambient temperature above pre-industrial levels could double the burden, impacts, and costs of OSA by 2100.

Data for final analysis was acquired from 116,620 regular users of the under-mattress OSA sensor, for a combined total of ~62 million nights. The most common reason for excluding participants (N = 8261, ~6.6%) was a lack of regular use of the device (see flow chart in Supplementary Fig. 1). Users were mainly middle-aged and predominantly male (22.7% female), with a median [IQR] of 509 [246, 787] sleep recordings per user (Table 1). The overall prevalence of moderate-to-severe (AHI ≥ 15 events/h) and severe OSA (AHI ≥ 30 events/h) was 25.4% and 8.9%, respectively. Users were located across most world regions (Fig. 1), including 41 countries with at least 100 users. OSA prevalence was between 15 and 32% depending on the country (Fig. 1), and demographics were consistent across countries (Table S1).

Country by country prevalence of moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (blue) and severe OSA (dark blue) is highlighted in the bar chart. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

There was a non-linear dose-response association between 24 h daily average ambient temperatures and the risk of having OSA on the following night (Fig. 2a). Globally, the probability of having OSA was 45% (risk ratio (RR) [95%CI]; 1.45 [1.44, 1.47]) higher during days with high temperatures (99th; 27.3 °C) vs. during days with lower temperatures (25th; 6.4 °C). Similarly, the probability of having severe OSA was 49% (1.49 [1.46, 1.52] higher in high vs. low temperature days. The probability of nightly OSA was higher at T99 in countries with lower gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (Fig. 2b). Out of the 41 studied countries, we found a significant association between ambient temperature and increased probability of nightly OSA in 29 countries (Fig. 2d). The effect size at T99 varied by country (Fig. 2c) and was generally stronger in European countries, with up to ~2.0 -fold increase in the probability of nightly OSA. Similar results were observed for the probability of nightly severe OSA (Table S1). The number of users was generally lower in countries where we did not find a significant association between temperature and OSA prevalence (Table S1). The association between ambient temperature and the probability of nightly OSA was stronger in males, users with higher body mass index (BMI), and among participants with usual sleep duration longer than 6 h (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 4). Age did not have a strong effect on the association between temperature and nightly OSA (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). Heterogeneity in country demographics (see Table S1), including mean age (p-value = 0.17), mean BMI (p-value = 0.57), and sex proportion (p-value = 0.68) was not associated with a differential effect in the association between ambient temperature and the probability of nightly OSA. The exposure-response curve between ambient temperature and the probability of nightly OSA remained largely similar in the sensitivity analyses, when minimum or maximum 24 h temperature were used as exposure variables (Supplementary Fig. 4). The exposure-response curve between ambient temperature and the probability of nightly OSA also remained similar when adjusting for particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <10 µm (Supplementary Fig. 5), previously shown to be associated with increased OSA severity in some studies26. The association between temperature and nightly OSA was also not modified by air pollution levels (Supplementary Fig. 5). A total of 9.4% of nightly sleep recordings did not have an AHI measurement, as the AHI cannot be calculated for nights with a sleep duration of less than 5 h. There was a bias towards a lower effect size in the association between temperature and nightly OSA for participants with a higher amount of missing AHI data (see Supplementary Fig. 6). Given the association between high temperature and short sleep duration16,18, this may suggest that our estimates are conservative.

We use disability adjusted life years (DALYs), a standardized measure employed by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD)32 studies that captures the combined impact of illness, injury, and premature mortality, to quantify the wellbeing and societal burden due to increased prevalence of OSA from high temperatures. DALYs combines time lost due to premature death (years of life lost; YLL) and time lived with less than-optimal health (years lived with disability; YLD). The increased prevalence of OSA due to global warming was associated with a strong societal impact. For example, in the UK (London; Fig. 3a), we observed a ~ 0.7 °C temperature increase from 2000 to 2023, which corresponded with an additional ~150 million person-days with OSA in 2023 compared to 2000. The increase in OSA prevalence due to global warming was associated with a loss of 59,365 DALYs (uncertainty range: 36,975 to 81,755), including 58,341 YLDs (36,463 to 80,2189), and 1024 YLLs (512 to 1,536); 92% higher than in 2000 (Table S2). In the 29 countries where we found an association between OSA prevalence and ambient temperature (involving 1.02 billion people), temperature-related increase in OSA prevalence was associated with a loss of 788,198 (489,226 to 1,087,170) DALYs in 2023, including 27,180 (13,590 to 40,770) years of life lost. The economic cost of this wellbeing impact in 2023 was estimated to be ~68 billion USD (Table S2) in the 29 studied countries. These estimates were ~2-fold higher than in 2000.

Wellbeing burden of warming-related increase in moderate-to-severe OSA prevalence is exemplified for the UK (a–c and d) and globally (e–g). a Historical and projected temperatures for different climate scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were used to (b) derive the number of additional person-days with OSA due to temperature increases, which were subsequently used to calculate (c) years lived with disability (YLD) and (d) years of life lost (YLL). Baseline temperatures were based on the historical 1950-1990 data. The wellbeing and economic impact of the estimated temperature-related increase in OSA by 2100 for different climate scenarios from the IPCC were calculated for (e) YLL, (f) YLD, and (g) wellbeing economic cost, expressed as rate per 100,000 persons per year.

We used the climate scenarios CMIP633 from the 2021 sixth assessment report of the IPCC2—termed the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP), to estimate future OSA burden for different levels of global warming. We downloaded daily temperatures from 2023 to 2100 projections for 4 SSPs (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, SSP585), based on 27 climate models from multiple countries and climate modelling groups. In the 29 studied countries, a ~ 1.8°C increase in global ambient temperatures above pre-industrial levels (SSP126 by 2100) was associated with in a ~ 15% increase in wellbeing burden compared to 2023 estimates (Table S3). Scenarios with projected increased temperature higher than SSP126 were estimated to further increase the wellbeing burden by 10 to 30% by 2050, and 1.5 to 2.5-fold by 2100, depending on the country (Fig. 3b). Temperatures higher than 1.8 °C above pre-industrial levels were estimated to incur an additional 12 to 36 million YLDs, 0.5 to 1.3 million YLLs, and an associated cost of 1.0 −2.8 trillion USD, over the 2023 to 2100 period. Country by country rates of DALYs per 100,000, absolute number of YLLs, absolute numbers of YLDs, and associated economic cost persons under different scenarios in 2050 and 2100 are presented in Tables S3 to S6. Accounting for population forecast and a potential 30% increase in OSA prevalence by 2050 due to rise in obesity34 would further increase these estimates in most countries by 10 to 25%. Comparison of the main model estimates vs. the alternative scenario is available in Tables S7 and S8. Under these assumptions, any other scenario than SSP126 would be estimated to incur an additional 16.9 to 47.4 million DALYs lost over the 2023 to 2100 period.

OSA has a considerable impact on productivity and is associated with increased likelihood of absenteeism and presenteeism (being at work but not functioning at full capacity)22,35. The calculated increase in OSA prevalence from global warming is estimated to incur additional productivity losses (Fig. 4). In 2023, for the 29 studied countries, the increase in OSA prevalence due to higher temperatures was associated with an additional 80 million presenteeism days (59 to 101 million) and an additional 25 million absenteeism days (12 to 38 million). The total economic cost of this loss of labor was 30 (21 to 40) billion USD. Globally, the rate of labor loss in 2023 was 8.4 (5.7 to 11.1) million USD per 100,000 persons and was double the rate of labor loss of 2000 (4.0 [2.7 to 5.2] million USD; see Table S7).

Scenarios with projected increased temperatures higher than 1.8 °C (SSP126) above pre-industrial levels are expected to increase labor loss by 10 to 25% by 2050, and 1.3- to 2.2-fold by 2100, depending on the country (Fig. 4; Tables S10, S11). These scenarios are projected to incur an additional cost of 0.9 to 2.0 trillion USD in labor loss over the 2023 to 2100 period (Fig. 4). In 2100, the labor loss rates per year for different climate models in the 29 studied countries are projected to be 37 billion (10.0 million per 100,000 - SSP126), 50 billion (13.3 million per 100,000 - SSP245), 69 billion (18.4 million per 100,000 - SSP370) and 84 billion (22.8 million per 100,000 - SSP545), see Tables S10 and S11. Country by country rates and absolute numbers of labor loss for different climate scenarios in 2050 and 2100 are presented in Tables S10 and S11.

High ambient temperatures (99th vs. 25th; 27.3 vs. 6.4 °C) are associated with a ~ 45% increase in the probability of having OSA on a given night, globally. The increase in OSA prevalence in 2023 due to global warming was associated with a loss of 788,198 (489,226 to 1,087,170) healthy life years, and a productivity loss of ~105 million days from impaired workplace attendance in the 29 studied countries. In 2023 alone, the estimated total economic cost associated with the warming-related increase in OSA prevalence was ~98 billion USD, including 68 (34 to 102) billion USD from additional wellbeing burden and 30 (21 to 40) billion USD from workplace productivity loss.

Modelled temperatures consistent with the continuation of government climate change policies implemented by 2020 are projected to lead to global warming of 2.1 to 3.4 °C by 21002,36. The health and economic impact of these estimates would be consequential, and the increase in OSA prevalence due to rising temperatures in such scenario may double the overall OSA burden. Indeed, rates of DALYs, without considering temperature, for OSA in 2019 in Australia were already ~200 to 260 DALYs per 100,00022. Estimated 2100 rates of DALYs observed for most countries under SSP245 ( ~ 2.8 °C degrees of warming) were also around 150 to 300 DALYs per 100,000 people depending on the country, which would approximately double the current OSA burden. A previous, not yet peer reviewed, study also estimated a 122 billion USD wellbeing cost due to warming-related increase in short sleep prevalence18. Together, these studies highlight the economic burden associated with sleep-related inadequacy from rising temperatures. In addition, these estimates contribute to the growing body of evidence that investment to limit global warming would be a cost-effective strategy to prevent climate-related sleep impairment and its consequences37,38.

The sample used in this study likely under-represents lower socioeconomic groups, given that all participants owned a consumer-grade sleep tracking device, and most participants resided in highly developed countries. Hence, participants may have also had access to more favorable sleeping environments and heat stress-mitigation strategies such as air conditioning, which are less readily available in lower socioeconomic populations39. There are large global inequalities in availability of population sleep health data—with only 22% WHO member states (mostly highly developed) having published population data in sleep duration40. Similarly, published global estimates of OSA prevalence are derived from population studies in mostly high socio-economic countries19. Our study is also biased towards higher socioeconomic countries and highlights the urgent need for global strategies to collect appropriate sleep and temperature data worldwide40. In addition, 77% of the participants in the current study were male. We did not detect a large difference between sex in the temperature-OSA association. However, this study sample may not be representative of the wider general population and does not resolve the long-standing issue in sleep research of under-representation of female in such analyses.

Furthermore, since we lacked access to precise geographical locations and the indoor temperature of users, exact temperature-related effects could not be calculated. The potential confounding effect of air pollution on the association between high temperature and nightly OSA status may also have been underestimated since we lacked precise geographical locations and indoor measurements of air pollution. We also lacked clinical information on participants' co-morbidities, treatment status, daytime symptoms, and impairments, and thus, could not explore potential modifiable effects of these conditions and symptoms on the detected association. Individuals with OSA and daytime sleepiness are at much greater risk of motor-vehicle accidents compared to those with OSA alone41. Hence, the temperature-related burden of OSA may be greater in this specific population. This aligns with previous studies that indicate that sleep loss and ambient temperature disproportionately affect more vulnerable populations16,17. High ambient temperatures have also been found to exacerbate the severity of chronic diseases42. Thus, further consideration of co-morbidities and daytime symptoms associated with OSA is warranted to better determine the impact of ambient temperature on OSA in vulnerable populations, and the additional burden this may incur. Although our robust time-series analysis design provides support for a potential causal association between high temperature exposure and increased OSA prevalence, other time-varying confounders (e.g., alcohol intake) were not available in the current study, and should be accounted for in further studies.

The under-mattress sensor used in this study does not measure the contribution of some physiological aspects of OSA (e.g., hypoxia, arousals) which may undermine OSA detection. However, existing validation studies versus gold standard polysomnography in over 150 participants28,43 support the device performance characteristics. Furthermore, OSA prevalence estimates using non-contact multi-night data found in this study yield very similar findings to previously published literature19,28. Similarly, previous studies that used this device have shown that misclassification rates and AHI variability are comparable to other devices30, and that the effect size of the association between the estimated AHI and health outcomes is also similar to existing epidemiological trials44,45. Furthermore, conventional single-night polysomnography can lead to inaccurate OSA diagnoses and severity estimation in 20 to 50% of patients due to high-night-to-night variability of OSA28,29,46. Thus, these studies provide support that the multi-night AHI estimates used in the current study provide comparable or superior insight to conventional single-night polysomnography AHI while being less cumbersome and allowing nightly data collection over ~1.5 years per individual.

Our main analysis aimed to model rising temperature's impact on OSA-related wellbeing and productivity by holding other factors constant. However, BMI is projected to increase over the next 50 years, likely leading to higher OSA prevalence34. This suggests our main estimates may understate the future temperature-related OSA burden. Indeed, once accounting for BMI-related increase in OSA prevalence in our sensitivity analyses, our estimates were 10 to 30% higher. On the other hand, recent developments in OSA treatment47, including FDA-approved weight loss medications48, could help manage OSA more effectively. Given that approximately 80% of OSA patients are currently undiagnosed or untreated49, improved treatment rates could serve as an adaptation mechanism to offset temperature-induced increases in OSA burden. We also assumed constant heat adaptation at the population level. However, heat-related mortality in Europe has declined over the past two decades50, and global air conditioning adoption has increased from 19.3% (2000) to 35.3% (2021). Studies that have investigated heat adaptation strategies and its effects on sleep and OSA are scarce15. Thus, we could not account for heat adaptation. In addition, heat adaptation is not uniform: highly developed countries have 44-48% household air conditioning coverage, while low and medium developed countries have 4% and 14%, respectively51. Accordingly, given our sample's socioeconomic bias toward developed nations, we likely underestimate the global impact of temperature-induced OSA, even without accounting for increased adaptation capabilities.

In conclusion, our study underscores the potential significant impact of increasing ambient temperatures on the prevalence of OSA, globally. Without substantially greater policy change to slow global warming, the health and economic burdens associated with OSA may double by 2100. These results highlight the urgency of limiting global warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, in alignment with the Paris Agreement. Our findings also emphasize the immediate need for targeted measures to potentially minimize the health and economic impacts of the growing OSA prevalence associated with rising temperatures.

Retrospective data were acquired from 125,295 participants who registered to use an under-mattress sleep sensor (Withings Sleep Analyzer/Sleep Rx; WSA) between January 2020 and September 2023. To be included in this analysis, participants were required to have ≥28 nights of data and an average of ≥4 sleep recordings per week. When participants sign-up to the Withings app, they are prompted to fill in their age, sex, height, and weight. Information on gender is not collected. Participants were required to be 18 years or older to be included in this study. Participants were geo-localized to the closest city within a given time zone. A more precise location was not available due to concern for re-identification and privacy. All participants provided written consent through the Withings app for their deidentified data to be used for research purposes when signing up for a Withings account.

Country level GDP per capita and GDP per capita employed were collected from the World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD). Population and life expectancy estimates were based on the United Nations World 2024 Populations Prospects report53.

The WSA is a FDA-cleared sleep monitoring device placed under the mattress that estimates sleep timing, quality, and breathing using ballistography and sound data (FDA 510(k) number: K231667)43. WSA-derived sleep duration, timing, and AHI have good agreement against polysomnography in multiple independent validation studies28,43,54. The WSA-estimated AHI also shows good agreement with in-laboratory polysomnography-derived AHI to classify moderate-to-severe OSA (88% sensitivity and 88% specificity to detect ≥15 events/h during sleep)28,43. The AHI cannot be reliably calculated for nights with a sleep duration of less than five hours43, and these nights were excluded from analysis. Our primary outcome of interest was the nightly OSA status for a given participant on a given night, based on the AHI and clinically defined severity categories (nightly OSA: AHI ≥ 15; and nightly severe OSA: AHI ≥ 30 event/h). For each participant, we also calculated the average OSA severity category based on the average AHI on all available nights and using pre-defined clinical cut-offs (mild: 5–15; moderate: 15–30 and severe: ≥30 events/h). The prevalence of OSA per country was calculated based on the average OSA severity category for each participant.

Weather information was time-matched for each day of data for every user based on their closest location, collected from the Copernicus Climate Change Service55. We extracted and calculated 24 h minimum, maximum, and average daily temperature as well as total cloud cover, surface pressure, and relative humidity from the fifth generation of ERA5 dataset31. We extracted fine particulate matter (aerodynamic diameter <2.5 µm) concentration from the ECMWF Atmospheric Composition Reanalysis 4 model as a measure of air quality56. These re-analysis models have been validated against station-based measurements57,58,59 and are widely applied in environmental health research57,58,60. We used the climate scenarios CMIP633 from the 2021 sixth assessment report of the IPCC2. We downloaded daily temperatures from 2023 to 2100 projections for 4 SSPs (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, SSP585), based on 27 climate models from multiple countries and climate modelling groups. Averaged daily projections were calculated as the daily median of the 27 projections. Detailed information on pre-processing and weather variable extraction can be found in the Supplementary Methods.

Non-linear fixed effect models were used to study the effects of 24 h average ambient temperature on nightly OSA status on the following night, defined as an AHI ≥ 15 events/h for that night. We followed the recently proposed case-time series methodology61 which has been used extensively in environmental health studies42,62,63,64,65, including in our previous study estimating the effect of high ambient temperature on sleep18. We used participant/year/month strata intercepts, natural splines of time (day of the year; with 4 degrees of freedom [df]), and indicators of the day of the week to model individual baseline risks, in addition to shared long-term, seasonal, and weekly trends. Models were further adjusted for total cloud cover (4 df), relative humidity (4 df), density of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <2.5 µg/m3 (4 df), surface pressure (4 df), total precipitation (4 df), wind speed (4 df) and variation in total sleep time (4 df) as these potential confounders may have effects on OSA prevalence within the 1-month stratum27.

The exposure-response association of interest between temperature and nightly OSA status was modelled using distributed lags9,66. We primarily chose a 4-day lag structure since the effect of temperature on sleep duration was shown to be significant up to the fourth day18. Other lag structures were explored but made little difference to the main findings (see Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8). Similar to previous studies on the effect of temperature on health9,10,13,66, we used the sum of the effect over the lag period to summarize the association between temperature and nightly OSA status. This analytic approach was conducted on the complete dataset, and in independent analyses stratified by country. Further analyses examined specific subgroups of interest, including age groups (10-year categories), sex, BMI categories, habitual sleep duration categories (average sleep duration over the recording period), and tertiles of GDP per capita. The above analyses also estimated the association between ambient temperature and severe OSA (AHI ≥ 30 events/h) prevalence rates. Models are summarized using RR [95%CI], calculated from the odds ratio using existing formula67. We used the R programming language (version 4.3.3), specifically with the dlnm68 (version 2.4.7) and gnm69 packages (version 1.1-5). Sensitivity analyses were conducted, and the analysis was repeated by using minimum 24h-average temperature and maximum 24h-average temperature to further validate our findings. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis to investigate potential bias due to missing data when users are sleeping less than five hours. In this sensitivity analysis, we calculated the exposure-response curve between temperature and nightly OSA for each quartile of missing data proportion (determined per-participant).

For each country, we calculated the difference in temperature for a given year compared to the 1950–1990 historical average temperature (see Fig. 5a for an example in the UK). This difference in temperature was used to calculate the change in the probability of having OSA between a given calendar year (e.g., 2022) versus historical data, which was subsequently transformed into a RR. Using this RR, we calculated the relative change in nightly OSA prevalence associated with global warming-related increased temperatures for each calendar day (in person-days) for that specific year and country. This approach was repeated for each location and each calendar day between 1950 and 2100, as well as for each tested climate projection.

a The difference in temperature for a given year (here 2023—black solid line) was compared to the 1950–1990 historical average temperature (dashed red line). b This difference in temperature (blue arrow) was used to calculate the change in the risk of nightly OSA between current vs. historical average temperature, for a particular day. This daily change was summed over the year and used to calculate the associated wellbeing and workplace productivity burden (see text for further details).

DALYs are a standardized summary measure employed by the World Health Organization and the GBD studies32 to quantify the impact of illness, injury, and/or dying prematurely. DALY combines time lost due to premature death (YLL) and time lived with less than-optimal health (YLD). DALYs measures have been used to assess the effect of temperature on health in other studies70,71. For this study, we followed the methodology previously used to assess the wellbeing burden of OSA in Australia22,72 and our previous report on the global wellbeing burden of reduced sleep duration18. DALYs, YLLs, and YLDs were quantified using the calculated warming-related person-days increase in OSA prevalence (see previous section) and published literature on associations between OSA and health outcomes.

Given the well-established association between OSA and motor-vehicle accidents, we estimated the years of life lost (YLL) due to increased motor vehicle accidents associated with the warming-related increase in OSA prevalence. We also estimated temperature-related OSA effects on other conditions that may induce less-than-optimal health and hence increase the number of YLD. In our study, we based these estimates for the YLD using data from a previous studies22,72. More formally, \({{YLL}}_{c,y}\) for a given country c at a year y was calculated as follows:

where \({{MVA}}_{{{death\_rate}}_{c}}\) is the daily rate of fatal motor vehicle accidents for a given country c, extracted from the GBD73; \({{RR}}_{{MVA\_OSA}}\) is the daily RR of fatal motor vehicle accidents associated with OSA, here estimated to be 100% based on previous literature21,41,74,75,76; \({{RR}}_{c}\) is the daily RR function for OSA function for a given country c; \({{Thist}}_{d,1950-90}\) is the average historical temperature (1950–1990; Fig. 5a red) for a particular day of the year (1–365); \({T}_{d,y}\) is the temperature for a particular day of the year d and a year y; \({p0}_{c}\) is the prevalence of OSA for a given country c; and \({{APOP}}_{c,y}\) is the given adult population for a country c in year y; \({{RLE}}_{c}\) is the average years of life lost for a given fatal motor vehicle accident for a country c, also extracted from the GBD73. Uncertainty intervals for YLLs were constructed using an \({{RR}}_{{MVA\_OSA}}\) of 50% (lower bound) and 150% (upper bound), using 100% as the mean.

Similarly, \({{YLD}}_{c,y}\) can be calculated as follows:

where DW is the daily disability weight associated with OSA, and was estimated to be between 0.05–0.11 based on previous literature22,72. Uncertainty intervals for YLDs were constructed using a disability weight of 0.05 (lower bound) and 0.11 (upper bound), using 0.08 as the mean. L is the duration of the “diseases/impairment” associated with OSA on a given day. Here, we conservatively assumed this duration to be 1 day, similar to a previous study on quality of life lost to heatwaves in Japan77. Other terms are similar to the calculation of \({{YLL}}_{c,y}\). Finally, \({{DALY}}_{c,y}\) can be calculated as follows:

The economic cost of wellbeing loss can be calculated using estimated values of DALYs. Here we used values of one time (lower bound), two times (mean) and three times (upper bound) GDP per capita (2023 USD) as proxies for the value of a DALY, as used in previous studies78,79. In our primary model, to isolate the effect of temperature on DALY modelling, we fixed the prevalence of OSA and population per country to a constant number (2023 estimate) until 2100. However, in a sensitivity analysis, we account for these factors using population forecasts from the UN world prospect 2024 and using projection on increased OSA prevalence (30% increase by 2050) due to increased obesity34.

Sleep disorders have a considerable impact on productivity and are associated with increased likelihood of absenteeism and presenteeism (being at work but not functioning at full capacity)80. On average, people with OSA report five additional days of sick leave per year, relative to people without OSA, and spend 6.8% of their working days with reduced productivity22,35. The additional absenteeism and presenteeism due to the increase in OSA prevalence days were quantified using similar methodology to the wellbeing burden in the previous section. The overall labor loss was then calculated by adding absenteeism and presenteeism days and multiplying by the average gross domestic product per capita employed. Presenteeism and absenteeism days for a given country c and year y can be calculated as follows:

where \({NWD}\) is the number of working days per person on a given year for a full-time employee, here assumed to be 235 (assuming 5 weeks of annual leave). \({{PRES}}_{{rate}}\) and \({{ABS}}_{{rate}}\) is the daily absenteeism on presenteeism rate (2.1% and 6.8% for absenteeism and presenteeism, respectively). \({{LF}}_{c}\) is the labor force for a given country c in 2023, downloaded from the World Bank. Since labor force estimates do not account for part-time labor, we weighted overall labor force using estimate of part-time worker percentage from the World Bank. We multiplied labor force population by half the percentage of part time employment (assuming part-time employment is 50% full time equivalent) and subtracted it to the overall labor force. The overall labor loss was then calculated as follows:

Metrics details

The interaction of intense infrared pulses with a solid target can initiate light-field-driven phenomena that enable the reversible manipulation of their electro-optical properties on an attosecond timescale. This interaction regime therefore offers a unique opportunity to induce and control new functionalities with very high speed. However, the efficient exploitation of coherent light–matter states for future applications requires a detailed understanding of the underlying physical processes. This task is complicated by the complex and intertwined nature of inter- and intraband dynamics of real and virtual carriers underlying field-driven phenomena in solids. Here we used attosecond transient reflection spectroscopy to investigate ultrafast virtual electron dynamics in a prototype dielectric (monocrystalline diamond) over a broad photon energy range not previously accessed. Independent calibration of the pump–probe delay axis allowed direct comparison with numerical calculations, revealing that virtual interband transitions affect the timing and adiabaticity of the crystal response, even in a regime believed to be dominated by intraband motion. By demonstrating that virtual interband transitions are indispensable for an accurate description of strong-field-induced phenomena in solids, our results constitute a relevant step towards understanding transient nonlinear optical processes, a cornerstone for the future development of information processing and petahertz electronics.

Metrics details

Due to the structural complexity of natural products, their target-oriented syntheses usually require the design of individualized routes that are tailor-made for the specific targets. As such, route redesign is needed when targets of different skeletal connectivities are considered. Here we report a versatile synthetic strategy that runs counter to this conventional wisdom and allows access to a range of terpenoids with distinct skeletal frameworks from the sesquiterpene lactone sclareolide as the starting material. By viewing a biocatalytically installed alcohol as an exploitable motif rather than a structural endpoint, a number of abiotic skeletal rearrangements were designed, resulting in substantial structural divergence from the original drimane ring system of sclareolide. Using this approach, the syntheses of four terpenoid natural products, namely, merosterolic acid B, cochlioquinone B, (+)-daucene and dolasta-1(15),8-diene, were achieved.

On a sunny April afternoon in Seattle, around 40 activists gathered at the Pine Box, a beer and pizza bar in the sometimes scruffy Capitol Hill neighborhood. The group had reserved a side room attached to the outside patio; before remarks began, attendees flowed in and out, enjoying the warm day. Someone set up a sound system. Then the activists settled in, straining their ears as the streamed call crackled through less-than-perfect speakers.

In more than a decade of climate organizing, it was the first time Emily Johnston, one of the group's leaders, had attended a happy hour to listen to a company's quarterly earnings call. Also the first time a local TV station showed up to cover such a happy hour. “This whole campaign has been just a magnet for attention,” she says.

The group, officially called the Troublemakers, was rewarded right away. Tesla CEO Elon Musk started the investors' call for the first quarter of 2025 with a sideways acknowledgement of exactly the work the group had been doing for the past two months. He called out the nationwide backlash to the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, an effort to cut government spending staffed by young tech enthusiasts and Musk company alumni, named—with typical Muskian internet-brained flourish—for an early 2010s meme.

Right now, everyone seems ready to throw down. More than ever, it's important to pick your battles—and know how to win.

“Now, the protests you'll see out there, they're very organized, they're paid for,” Musk told listeners. For weeks, thousands of people—including the Troublemakers—had camped outside Tesla showrooms, service centers, and charging stations. Musk suggested that not only were they paid for their time, they were only interested in his work because they had once received “wasteful largesse” from the federal government. Musk had presented the theory and sharpened it on his social media platform X for weeks. Now, he argued, the protesters were off the dole—and furious.

Musk offered no proof of his assertions; to a person, every protester who spoke to WIRED insisted that they are not being paid and are exactly what they appear to be: people who are angry at Elon Musk. They call their movement the “Tesla Takedown.”

Before Musk got on the call to speak to investors, Tesla, which arguably kicked off a now multitrillion-dollar effort to transition global autos to electricity, had presented them with one of the company's worst quarterly financial reports in years. Net income was down 71 percent year over year; revenue fell more than $2 billion short of Wall Street's expectations.

Now, in Seattle, just the first few minutes of Musk's remarks left the partygoers, many veterans of the climate movement, giddy. Someone close to the staticky speakers repeated the best parts to the small crowd: “I think starting probably next month, May, my time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly,” Musk said. Under a spinning disco ball, people whooped and clapped. Someone held up a snapshot of Tesla's stock performance over the past year, a jagged but falling black line.

“If you ever wanted to know that protest matters, here's your proof,” Johnston recalled weeks later.

The Tesla Takedown, an effort to hit back at Musk and his wealth where it hurts, seems to have appeared at just the right time. Tesla skeptics have argued for years that the company, which has the highest market capitalization of any automaker, is overvalued. They contend that the company's CEO has been able to distract from flawed fundamentals—an aging vehicle lineup, a Cybertruck sales flop, the much-delayed introduction of self-driving technology—with bluster and showmanship.

Musk's interest in politics, which kicked into a new and more expensive gear when he went all in for Donald Trump during the 2024 election, was always going to invite more scrutiny for his business empire. But the grassroots movement, which began as a post on Bluesky, has become a boisterous, ragtag, and visible locus of, sorry to use the word, resistance against Musk and Trump. It's hard to pin market moves on any one thing, but Tesla's stock price is down some 33 percent since its end-of-2024 high.

Tesla Takedown points to a uniquely screwed-up moment in American politics. Down is up; up is down. A man who made a fortune sounding the alarm about the evils of the fossil fuel industry joined with it to spend hundreds of millions in support of a right-wing presidential candidate and became embedded in an administration with a slash-and-burn approach to environmental regulation. (This isn't good for electric cars.) The same guy, once extolled as the real-life Tony Stark—he made a cameo in Iron Man 2!—has become for some a real-life comic book villain, his skulduggery enough to bring together a coalition of climate activists, freaked-out and laid-off federal workers, immigrant rights champions, union groups, PhDs deeply concerned about the future of American science, Ukraine partisans, liberal retirees sick of watching cable news, progressive parents hoping to show their kids how to stick up for their values, LGBTQ+ rights advocates, despondent veterans, and car and tech nerds who have been crying foul on Musk's fantastical technology claims for years now.

To meet the moment, then, the Takedown uses a unique form of protest logic: Boycott and protest the electric car company not because the movement disagrees with its logic or mission—quite the opposite, even!—but because it might be the only way to materially affect the unelected, un-beholden-to-the-public guy at its head. And then hope the oft-irrational stock market catches on.

So for weeks, across cities like New York; Berkeley and Palo Alto, California; Meridian, Idaho; Ann Arbor, Michigan; Raleigh, North Carolina; South Salt Lake, Utah; and Austin, Texas, the thousands of people who make up the Takedown movement have been been stationed outside of Tesla showrooms, making it a little bit uncomfortable to test drive one of Musk's electric rides, or even just drive past in one.

When Shua Sanchez graduated from college in 2013, there was about a week, he remembers, when he was convinced that the most important thing he could do was work for Tesla. He had a degree in physics; he knew all about climate change and what was at stake. He felt called to causes, had been protesting since George W. Bush invaded Iraq when he was in middle school. Maybe his life's work would be helping the world's premier electric carmaker convince drivers that there was a cleaner and more beautiful life after fossil fuel.

“I do think we're at a point where people need to stick their necks up out of the foxhole en masse, or we're simply not going to get through.”

In the end, though, Sanchez opted for a doctorate program focusing on the quantum properties of super-conducting and magnetic materials. (“I shoot frozen magnets with lasers all day,” he jokes.) So he felt thankful for his choice a few years later when he read media reports about Tesla's efforts to tamp down unionizing efforts at its factories. He felt more thankful when, in 2017, Musk signed on to two of Trump's presidential advisory councils. (The CEO publicly departed them months later, after the administration pulled out of the Paris climate agreement.) Even more thankful in 2022, when Musk acquired Twitter with the near-express purpose of opening it up to extreme right-wing speech. More thankful still by the summer of 2024, after Musk officially endorsed Trump's presidential bid.

By the time Musk appeared onstage at a rally following Trump's inauguration in January 2025 and threw out what appeared to be a Nazi salute—Musk has denied that was what it was—Sanchez, now in a postdoctorate fellowship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was ready to do something about it besides not taking a job at Tesla. A few days later, as reports of DOGE's work began to leak out of Washington, a friend sent him a February 8 Bluesky post from a Boston-based disinformation scholar named Joan Donovan.

“If Musk thinks he can speed run through DC downloading personal data, we can certainly bang some pots and pans on the sidewalks in front of Tesla dealerships,” Donovan posted on the platform, already an online refuge for those looking for an alternative to Musk's X. “Bring your friends and make a little noise. Organize locally, act globally.” She added a link to a list of Tesla locations, and a GIF of the Swedish Chef playing the drums on some vegetables with wooden spoons. Crucially, she appended the hashtag #TeslaTakeover. Later, the internet would coalesce around a different rallying cry: #TeslaTakedown.

The post did not go viral. To date, it has only 175 likes. But it did catch the attention of actor and filmmaker Alex Winter. Winter shot to prominence in 1989's Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure—he was Bill—and has more recently produced multiple documentaries focusing on online culture, piracy, and the power of social media. He and Donovan had bonded a few years earlier over activism and punk rock, and the actor, who has a larger social media following, asked the scholar if he could create a website to centralize the burgeoning movement. “I do think we're at a point where people need to stick their necks up out of the foxhole en masse, or we're simply not going to get through,” he tells WIRED. In the website's first 12 hours of existence, he says, thousands of people registered to take part in the Takedown.

Donovan's Bluesky post brought Sanchez to the Boston Back Bay Tesla showroom on Boylston Street the next Saturday, where 30 people had gathered with signs. For Sanchez, the whole thing felt personal. “Elon Musk started a PhD at Stanford in my field. He quit after two days and then went and became a tech bro, but he presents that he's one of us,” he says. With Musk's new visibility—and plans to slash government research dollars while promoting right-wing ideology—Sanchez was ready to push back.

Sanchez has been outside the showroom during weekly protests throughout the Boston winter, megaphone in hand, leading chants: “It ain't fun. It ain't funny. Elon Musk is stealing your money.” “We don't want your Nazi cars. Take a one-way trip to Mars.”

“We make it fun, so a lot of people come back,” Sanchez says. Someone slapped Musk's face on one of the inflatable tube guys you often see outside of car dealerships; he whipped around at several protests. A popular bubble-themed routine—“Tesla is a bubble”—saw protesters toss around a giant, transparent ball as others blew bubbles around it. Then the ball popped, loudly, during a protest—a sign? At some of Boston's biggest actions, hundreds of people have shown up to demonstrate against Tesla, Musk, and Trump, Sanchez says.

Donovan envisioned the protests as potent, visible responses to Musk's slashing of government programs and jobs. But she also knew that social movements are a critical release valve in times of upheaval. “People need to relieve the pressure that they feel when the government is not doing the right thing,” she tells WIRED. “If you let that pressure build up too much, obviously it can turn very dangerous.”

In some ways, she's right. In at least four incidents across four states, people have been charged by the federal government with various crimes including defacing, shooting at, throwing Molotov cocktails toward, and setting fire to Tesla showrooms and charging stations. In a move that has worried civil liberties experts, the Trump administration has treated these attacks against the president's richest backer's car company as “domestic terrorism,” granting federal authorities greater latitude and resources to track down alleged perpetrators and threatening them with up to 20 years in prison.

In posts on X and in public appearances, Musk and other federal officials have seemed to conflate the actions of a few allegedly violent people with the wider protests against Tesla, implying that both are funded by shadowy “generals.” “Firing bullets into showrooms and burning down cars is unacceptable,” Musk said at an event last month in which he appeared remotely on video, his face looming over the stage. “Those people will go to prison, and the people that funded them and organized them will also go to prison. Don't worry.” He looked into the camera and pointed his finger at the audience. “We're coming for you.”

Tesla Takedown participants and leaders have repeatedly said that the movement is nonviolent. “Authoritarian regimes have a long history of equating peaceful protest with violence. The #TeslaTakedown movement has always been and will remain nonviolent,” Dallas volunteer Stephanie Frizzell wrote in an email. What violence has occurred at protests themselves seems limited to on-site spats that mostly target protesters.

Donovan herself skipped some protests after receiving death threats and hearing a rumor that she was on a government list targeting disinformation researchers. On X, prominent right-wing accounts harassed her and other Takedown leaders; she says people have contacted her colleagues to try to get her fired.

Then, on the afternoon of March 6, Boston University ecology professor Nathan Phillips was in his office on campus when he received a panicked message from his wife. She said that two people claiming to represent the FBI visited their home. “I was just stunned,” Phillips says. “We both had a feeling of disbelief, that this must be some kind of hoax or a joke or something like that.”

Phillips had attended a Tesla Takedown event weeks earlier, but he wasn't sure whether the visit was related to the protests or his previous climate activism. So after sitting shocked in his office for an hour, he called his local FBI field office. Someone picked up and asked for his information, he remembers, and then asked why he was calling. Phillips explained what had happened. “They just abruptly hung up on me,” he says.

Phillips never had additional contact from the FBI, but he knows of at least five other climate activists who were visited by men claiming to be from the agency on March 6.

The FBI tells WIRED that it “cannot confirm or deny the allegations” that two agents visited Phillips' home. Tesla did not respond to WIRED's questions about the Tesla Takedown movement or Musk's allegations of coordinated violence against the company.

After the incident, Phillips began searching online for mentions of his name, and he found posts on X from an account that also tagged Joan Donovan and FBI director Kash Patel.

Phillips says that the FBI visit has had the opposite of a chilling effect. “If anything, it's further radicalized me,” he says. “People having my back and the expression of support makes me feel very confident that it was the right thing to do to speak out about this.”

Mike had attended a few protests in the past but didn't know how to organize one. He has a wife, three small kids, a house in the suburbs, and a health issue that can sometimes make it hard to think. So by his own admission, his first attempt in February was a mixed bag. It was the San Francisco Bay Area–based Department of Labor employee's first day back in the office after the Trump administration, spurred by DOGE, had demanded all workers return full-time. He was horrified by the fast-moving job cuts, program changes, and straight-up animus he had already seen flow from the White House down to his small corner of the federal government.

“Attacks on federal workers are an attack on the Constitution,” Mike says. Maybe, he figured, if he could keep people from buying Teslas, that would hurt Elon Musk's bottom line, and the CEO would lay off DOGE altogether.

“I've been in politics professionally for almost 20 years. It is genuinely the most grassroots thing that I've seen.”

Mike, who WIRED is referring to using a pseudonym because he fears retaliation, saw that a Tesla showroom was just a 20-minute walk from his office, and he hoped to convince some coworkers to convene there, a symbolic stand against DOGE and Musk. So he taped a few flyers on light poles. He didn't have social media, but he posted on Reddit. “I was really worried,” he says, “about the Hatch Act,” a law that limits the political activities of federal employees.

In the end, three federal workers—the person sitting next to him at the office and a US Department of Veterans Affairs nurse they ran into on the street—posted up outside of the Tesla showroom on Van Ness Avenue in downtown San Francisco holding “Save Federal Workers” signs.

Then Mike discovered the #TeslaTakedown website that Alex Winter had built. (Because of a quirk in the sign-up process, the site is now putatively operated by the Seattle Troublemakers.) It turned out a bunch of other people had thought that Tesla showrooms were the right places to air their grievances with Trump, Musk, and DOGE. Mike posted his event there. Now the SF Save Federal Workers protest, which happens every Monday afternoon, draws 20 to 40 people.

Through the weekly convening, Mike has met volunteers from the Federal Unionists Network, who represent public unions; the San Francisco Labor Council, a local affiliate of the national AFL-CIO; and the East Bay chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. As in any amicable custody arrangement, Mike's group shares the strip of sidewalk outside of the San Francisco Tesla showroom with a local chapter of the progressive group Indivisible, which holds bigger protests on Saturdays. “I'm trying to build connections, meet other community groups,” Mike says. “My next step is broadening the coalition.”

About half of the people coordinating Takedown protests are like Mike, says Evan Sutton, who is part of the national team: They haven't organized a protest before. “I've been in politics professionally for almost 20 years,” Sutton says. “It is genuinely the most grassroots thing that I've seen.”

Well into the spring, Tesla Takedown organizers nationwide had held hundreds of events across the US and even the globe, and the movement has gained a patina of professionalism. Tesla Takedown sends press releases to reporters. The movement has buy-in from Indivisible, a progressive network that dates back to the first Trump administration, with local chapters hosting their own protests. At least one Democratic congressional campaign has promoted a local #TeslaTakedown event.

Beyond the showrooms, Tesla sales are down by half in Europe compared to last year and have taken a hit in California, the US's biggest EV market. Celebrities including Sheryl Crow and Jason Bateman have publicly ditched their Teslas. A Hawaii-based artist named Matthew Hiller started selling “I Bought This Before Elon Went Crazy” car decals in 2023; he estimates he has sold 70,000 anti-Musk and anti-Tesla stickers since then. (There was a “Space X-size explosion of sales after his infamous salute,” Hiller says.) In Seattle, the Troublemakers regularly hold “de-badging” events, where small handfuls of sheepish owners come by to have the T emblems drilled off their cars.

In Portland, Oregon, on a recent May Saturday, Ed Niedermeyer was once again sweating through his shark costume as he hopped along the sidewalk in front of the local Tesla showroom. His sign exhibited the DOGE meme, an alert Shiba Inu, with the caption “Heckin' fascism.” (You'd get it if you spent too much time on the internet in 2013.) Honks rang out. The shark tends to get a good reaction from drivers going by, he said. About 100 people had shown up to this Takedown protest, in front of a Tesla showroom that sits kitty-corner to a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement office.

Niedermeyer is a car writer and has spent a lot of time thinking about Elon Musk since 2015, when he discovered that Tesla wasn't actually operating a battery swapping station like it said it did. Since then, he has written a book, Ludicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors, and documented many of what he claims to be Musk's and the automaker's half-truths on their way to the top.

Niedermeyer acknowledges that Musk and Tesla have proven difficult to touch, even by nationwide protests literally outside their doors.

Despite the Seattle cheers during Tesla's last quarterly earnings call, the automaker's stock price gained steam through the spring and rose on the news that its CEO would no longer officially work for the federal government. Musk has said investors should value Tesla not as a carmaker but as an AI and robotics company. At the end of this month, after years of delays, Tesla says it will launch a robotaxi service. According to Wall Street analysts' research notes, they believe him.

Even a public fight with the president—one that devolved into name-calling on Musk's and Trump's respective social platforms—was not enough to pop the Tesla bubble.

“For me, watching Musk and watching our inability to stop him and create consequences for this snowballing hype and power has really reinforced that we need a stronger government to protect people from people like him,” says Niedermeyer.

Still, Tesla Takedown organizers take credit for the cracks in the Musk-Trump alliance—and say the protests will continue. The movement has also incorporated a more cerebral strategy, organizing local efforts to convince cities, states, and municipalities to divest from Musk's companies. They already had a breakthrough in May, when Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, became the first US public pension fund to say it wouldn't purchase new Tesla stocks for its managed investment accounts.

The movement's goals may be lofty, but Niedermeyer argues that despite Tesla's apparent resilience, Musk is still America's most vulnerable billionaire. And sure, Musk, the CEO of an electric car company, the guy who made himself the figurehead for his automaker and fired his PR team to make sure it would stick, the one who alienated the electric car company's customer base through a headlong plunge not only into political spending but the delicate mechanics of government itself—he did a lot of it on his own.

Now Niedermeyer, and everyone involved in Tesla Takedown, and probably everyone in the whole world, really, can only do what they can. So here he is, in a shark costume on the side of the road, maintaining the legally mandated distance from the car showroom behind him.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","A New Obesity Pill May Burn Fat Without Suppressing Appetite","https://www.wired.com/story/new-obesity-pill-may-burn-fat-without-suppressing-appetite/","Mon, 16 Jun 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

An experimental obesity pill that works in a different way from the wildly popular Ozempic may help people lose weight, according to results from a small, preliminary human trial.

Ozempic and other GLP-1 drugs reduce food intake by stimulating a feeling of fullness. They act on the brain to promote satiety and on the gut to slow the movement of food through the stomach, helping people feel full longer. As a result, people on the drugs lose weight because they eat less.

But a new drug may be able to burn energy, and thus fat, without reducing appetite. In a Phase I trial described today in the journal Nature Metabolism, the drug led to statistically significant weight loss in participants after two weeks. Dubbed SANA, the drug is derived from salicylate, a compound used to make aspirin. Developed by Eolo Pharma of Montevideo, Uruguay, it activates a pathway called creatine-dependent thermogenesis.

Creatine is perhaps best known as a nutritional supplement taken after exercise to help build muscle mass, but the compound also occurs naturally in the human body and is important for energy production.

“It has been known for a long time that creatine has good effects on metabolism,” says Carlos Escande, cofounder and chief scientific officer of Eolo. In the 1970s, researchers found that rats exposed to cold used a lot of creatine. It wasn't until a decade ago that a Harvard team found that creatine is used in fatty adipose tissue during exposure to cold to generate heat.

The process of burning energy and generating heat to maintain a stable internal temperature is known as thermogenesis. Creatine-dependent thermogenesis refers to how the breaking down of creatine, particularly in fat cells, contributes to this heat and energy production.

“What we have found is that our compound stimulates this creatine-dependent heat production pathway,” Escande says.

In the first part of the trial, Eolo scientists randomly assigned 17 healthy-weight individuals to receive either a placebo or a single pill of SANA at a low, medium, or high dose. At all doses, the drug was safe and well-tolerated with no serious side effects. In the second part of the trial, they tested the drug in 24 participants with obesity for 15 days. Volunteers were randomly sorted into three groups to receive either a placebo or a low, medium, or high dose of SANA twice a day for the length of the study. Each group had six people taking the drug and two on a placebo. During the study period, participants stayed at a clinical facility where they received high-carbohydrate meals.

At the end of the two weeks, the participants taking the highest dose of SANA showed weight loss of about 3 percent, which is comparable to the weight loss seen in people taking Ozempic and Wegovy over the same period of treatment. They were also asked to fill out a questionnaire regarding appetite and satiety, and none reported decreased appetite or satiety.

While injected GLP-1 drugs are incredibly effective at spurring weight loss, they also come with some downsides. There can be gastrointestinal side effects and loss of muscle mass. The drugs are also expensive, at $1,000 a month or more in the US before insurance. Drug companies are interested in developing anti-obesity pills because of their relatively cheap cost to manufacture compared to injectables, and the fact that some patients would prefer to take a pill.

“There's still an unmet clinical need, and that's where Eolo wants to help,” says María Pía Garat the company's CEO.

Eolo didn't exactly set out to make a weight-loss pill. Researchers at the company were originally trying to develop a drug to target inflammation, especially the kind that occurs in obesity and type 2 diabetes. But when they started testing their experimental drug in mice, it not only improved inflammation but also led to a reduction in body weight while they were on a high-fat diet. They have performed experiments out to nine months and found that the mice eventually dropped to their starting weight even while they were still eating the same, high-fat diet.

In mice, SANA also preserved lean muscle mass. MRI scans show that mice treated with SANA had a greater percentage of lean body mass compared to controls, despite substantial fat loss.

“We've had stimulants before to try to increase your caloric output,” says Hans Schmidt, chief of bariatric surgery and co-director for the Center for Weight Loss and Metabolic Health at Hackensack University Medical Center, who wasn't involved in the study.

One of those was the drug combination fenfluramine-phentermine, known as fen-phen, which was sold in the 1990s for weight loss but was taken off the market for causing heart damage. “Those work on overall metabolism. They make you jittery, make you energized. This seems to work specifically at a cellular level on your fat cells,” he says.

Of course, Eolo's study was very small, and the drug will need to be tested in more people to better understand its effects. The company is planning a Phase II trial later this year that will include around 100 participants with obesity and follow them for 12 weeks. They hope to conduct that trial in the United States. Garat thinks Eolo's drug could eventually be used as a stand-alone approach or in combination with GLP-1 drugs to produce more weight loss.

“Right now we are bringing a backhoe to the construction site when we need many more tools. We need more mechanisms like this that work on pathways other than appetite,” says Angela Fitch, former president of the Obesity Medicine Association and the cofounder and chief medical officer of Knownwell, a primary care company specializing in obesity care. Fitch is not involved with Eolo.

Current GLP-1s can achieve up to 20 percent weight loss, and while that may be enough for some patients, others may still need to lose more to get to a healthy weight. “New medications,” she says, “present the opportunity to make an even greater impact.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","How to Fight Like a ‘Ballerina'","https://www.wired.com/story/ballerina-fighting-tips-from-a-stunt-performer/","Mon, 16 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

It's a common nightmare scenario: You're alone—walking home at night, maybe, or waiting to meet someone at a bar—and someone approaches you, intending harm. They're bigger than you, and you've (maybe, probably) never been in a fight before. What do you do?

Right now, everyone seems ready to throw down. More than ever, it's important to pick your battles—and know how to win.

Turns out, even experienced brawlers worry about being assaulted. Cara Marie Chooljian, a seasoned Hollywood stunt performer, often wonders how she would react—and she knows jujitsu. And kickboxing. And judo. “When I'm out, I think about this stuff,” she says. “A, because of my work, and B, because I want to keep myself safe.”

For her latest movie, the John Wick spinoff Ballerina, Chooljian had to fight like someone who has been trained to kill since childhood: She was the stunt double for Eve (played by Ana de Armas), an assassin who is trying to avenge her father's death. Cue scenes involving shoot-outs, hand-to-hand combat, and even a flamethrower battle. The movie also required de Armas and Chooljian, both about 5'6"", to go toe-to-toe with John Wick himself, played by 6-foot-tall Keanu Reeves.

Choreographing fights between the two, then, proved to be an amped-up version of what anyone might do when faced with someone bigger or stronger. “What was fun for the film was thinking, ‘How would I win?'” says Chooljian. “We wanted to make it as real as possible, because the reality is that if I'm fighting a giant man, I'm not going to be able to just hit him in the face and win.”

But what about the rest of us, the people who aren't trained in combat? WIRED asked Chooljian for some tips on what the average person could do to defend themselves in a hand-to-hand fight they can't escape.

It might sound ridiculous, but falling down right away can throw your attacker off-guard. “If someone's going to fight you, and then all of a sudden you sit on the ground,” she says, “they're going to be like, ‘What the fuck?'” She recommends a favorite move from her jiujitsu training: Flop down fast, right at their feet; hook your hands behind their ankles, rock back slightly, and use both of your feet to kick them on their hip bones, knocking them flat. You can also just pull their ankles toward you to topple them; but if you can kick, your chances of getting them down greatly improve.

If you're able to sweep your assailant off their feet, hopefully they've hit their head on the way down. Use that moment to climb on top of them, and then get to work, beating them with your elbows. (In a fight against someone much larger than you, your smaller fists aren't going to be as effective.)

Ultimately, you're trying to wear your assailant out until you can get away or help comes—or, ideally, they give up. Chooljian says use whatever tactics you can. Gouge them in the eyes, scratch them in the face, knee them in the groin. “One of my favorites is the fish hook,” she says, demonstrating by pulling the side of her mouth with her finger. “Anything that could really start to beat them down.”

If falling on your ass doesn't get the results you wanted, you have other options. If you get pinned down on an elevated surface like a table, as Eve does in Ballerina, you can use the leverage and proximity of your attacker to your advantage. Get them in what the stunt world calls a “triangle.” You know the move; you've probably seen it before in movies. To execute, lift your hips, wrap one leg behind the person's neck, then wrap your other leg around it, locking your knee around your ankle. Then squeeze. “So his head is between my legs, choking him out,” Chooljian says.

Throughout any fight, always look around for tools that can help you. The cord on a curling iron? That'll do. A candlestick? Why not? It worked in Clue. “If I'm in a bar and I'm not trusting a situation, the first thing I'm probably going to grab is a bottle,” Chooljian says.

It's the one move that Chooljian says is her go-to when facing bigger, stronger dudes: You kick 'em in the nuts. “It's cliché, but you know what? It works.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Social Media Replaced Zines. Now Zines Are Taking the Power Back","https://www.wired.com/story/zines-social-media-power/","Mon, 16 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

One sunny afternoon in May, a century-old power plant in Brooklyn was buzzing—not with electricity, but with hundreds of creatives congregating at the Black Zine Fair. Handmade booklets piled up on table after table, forming vast paper topographies of politics and activism and culture. Marginalized groups in skating! Fictional characters “that probably made me queer”! Someone else presented zines dedicated to all the TV shows they had recorded onto VHS. Still more tables hosted zine assembly. Everyone seemed to have stickers for sale. The scene evoked New York in the 1980s or '90s, when the city was home to a thriving DIY zine culture built on late nights at Kinko's. Only now many of the zine makers swapped online handles along with their analog wares.

For over a decade, social media platforms have served as cultural loci, and in many ways still do, but recent events have deepened the notion that digital spaces aren't safe or effective for everyone. Once beloved platforms like Twitter have been overtaken by white supremacist speech. Meta now allows users to call gay and trans people mentally ill. TikTok has been on the verge of being banned in the US for years now. Meanwhile, the US Department of Homeland Security has announced its plans to screen the social media of immigrants and visa applicants. What's next? Even if the bigotry and surveillance don't bother you, major platforms often feel like content wells for advertisers and AI scavengers, picking through the detritus of influencers chasing engagement. Breaking through seems impossible.

Right now, everyone seems ready to throw down. More than ever, it's important to pick your battles—and know how to win.

For those looking for alternatives, zines have taken on new importance as a way to spread ideas outside the easy reach of unfriendly eyes and unhelpful algorithms. Organizer Mariame Kaba, who cofounded the Black Zine Fair in 2024, says she's seen lots more interest in the medium lately, especially from Gen Z. About 1,200 people attended the fair this year, and similar gatherings and workshops are happening around the world. Online, people who want to talk about abortion access or queer rights or the war in Gaza are “feeling like they can't say certain things,” Kaba says. Zines allow them to “share personal experiences, to make connections with other people, to fight censorship, to evade the surveillance that's consistent and constant when you are on digital platforms.”

With the Trump administration and GOP lawmakers limiting access to certain kinds of health care in the US, for example, zines about DIY health care for trans people or pamphlets about self-managed abortions could become even more prevalent. “If they start criminalizing that kind of information, how will you access that information, if not literally somebody passing you a pamphlet or a flyer or a zine?” Kaba asks. “For folks who are on the left, we better figure out how we're going to transmit information about important things to each other that is not using social media.”

Zines, and their predecessors, have a long history of political and cultural impact, particularly in the US. In the 18th and 19th centuries, pamphlets helped spread messages about the abolitionist movement. LGBTQ+ people made paper booklets to share information during the AIDS crisis. Riot grrrls used them to spread feminist messages in the '90s, the last time zines saw a huge boom.

Graphic novelist and documentary filmmaker James Spooner was just a high schooler when he stumbled upon his first zine: an anarcha-feminist zine called “Aim Your Dick” that Mimi Nguyen made in 1993. “It introduced me to the idea that a teenager could have a voice that the world outside of school would be interested in hearing,” Spooner says. He quickly made a zine of his own.

But within a decade of Spooner's discovery, the internet reached the mainstream, and zines were drowned out by digital culture. Diehards kept making paper handouts, but most people with ideas or messages to share went on social media. The prospect of a digital public square where anyone could broadcast their thoughts to the world was new and exciting. Since then, however, Americans' perceptions of social media have darkened.

Zines, meanwhile, are seeing a resurgence, popping up in museum collections and, in at least one instance, online comics. They are taking on new forms, modified by a generation seeking to make something that won't go the way of Tumblr.

“By producing physical, tangible objects that don't exist on the internet, you can circumvent or avoid feeding into that machine,” says Kyle Myles, a photographer who sells zines out of his Baltimore shop. “I think a lot of people worry that when they share things on, say, Instagram, suddenly it's the property of Mark Zuckerberg or Meta.”

“For folks who are on the left, we better figure out how we're going to transmit information about important things to each other that is not using social media.”

Last year at the Black Zine Fair, Jennifer White-Johnson, a designer known for creating the Black Disabled Lives Matter symbol, presented a zine-making workshop; for this year's event, held in May, they distributed copies of “A Black Neurodivergent Artist's Manifesto.” (It sold out.) Several years ago, after their son was diagnosed with autism, White-Johnson created an advocacy photo zine called “KnoxRoxs.” They've often organized gatherings to create zines with other caregivers for autistic kids. Making zines, White-Johnson says, provides “a powerful act of collective liberation and a radical practice of self and community care.”

White-Johnson's zine was one of many at this year's fair focused on solidarity and social justice. Several were historical, like Kaba's “Arrested at the Library: Policing the Stacks” about the history of law enforcement's presence in libraries. Some zines were structured like newspapers; some took the form of grade school art. Others channeled the format's earlier punk aesthetics.

Many zines bridged the gap between analog and digital. An independent publisher called Haters Cafe presented “10 Anarchist Theses on Palestine Solidarity in the United States,” one of several works also hosted on the publisher's website. One of its creators, who asked not to be identified, tells WIRED that while the internet has allowed Haters' zines to spread far, their somewhat untraceable physical forms appeal to people who are concerned about repression. “In certain spaces, I cover my face; I wear a mask,” they say. Anonymous zines serve a similar function. “We're trying to broaden cultural distaste for surveillance.”

Which is to say, modern zine makers aren't anti-technology. They're opposed to what often comes with its use. If anything, they're incorporating analog creations into digital ones, like people who post about woodworking or knitting on Reddit.

Zines are taking hold in fields outside politics and culture, too. Like science. During the 2024 meeting in Mexico of the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution, a respected computational biologist named Pleuni Pennings did away with handing out a sedate paper containing her research and instead distributed a stylized zine, illustrated with hand-drawn diagrams and figures, to accompany her presentation on antimicrobial resistance.

Pennings says she hoped audience members would be inspired to show the zine to other people, like their colleagues, and spread her work that way. “I mean, that's what we all want when we give a talk, right?”

Communication constantly evolves, along with the way people want to receive information. As social media replaced zines, the messages traveled farther, but their permanence dissipated. Friendster fizzled. Tumblr will never be what it was. Posts on X or TikTok get drowned in the churn of what's trending or what platform owners want to boost. Handmade zines can last much longer. “Writing things down on paper has value,” Spooner says. “It's more permanent.”

As fears of surveillance and authoritarianism grow, the zine community may provide a means to organize under the algorithmic radar, in a format less beholden to the whims of multibillion-dollar social media companies. A vision of the future copied from the past.

After years of providing free services without any bells attached, WhatsApp is now going to start showing ads on the popular chat app. To be clear, users will only see ads on the Status screen — the app's take on Instagram's Stories. 

So just like you see an ad after watching a few stories on Instagram, you will see ads on WhatsApp after you've scrolled through a few Status updates.

The company said that its ad mechanism uses signals like users' country or city, language, and the channels they're following, as well as data from ads that users interact with.

Meta said it is not using personally identifiable data, such as users' phone numbers, messages, calls, and groups to serve targeted ads. If a user has added their WhatsApp account to Meta's Account Center, the company will use their Account preferences to show ads.

The company said it is allowing companies and users to promote their Channels, WhatsApp's broadcast feature, in the discovery section, and that it would allow select creators and businesses to charge users a subscription to unlock exclusive updates on Channels. The company said these subscription payments will be facilitated by app stores.

Meta said that over 1.5 billion people use Status and Channels per day. 

So far, WhatsApp has generated revenue via its WhatsApp Business platform and click-to-WhatsApp ads. Meta has repeatedly mentioned these as growing channels of revenue in its last few quarterly earnings calls.

Alice Newton-Rex, VP of product at WhatsApp, said in a briefing ads are a fitting extension of the app's revenue streams.

“[The new ads and promotion products] felt like the next natural evolution, now that both those businesses have scaled to help people discover businesses directly within WhatsApp. And that was what we were increasingly hearing from businesses that they wanted to do as well,” she said.

WhatsApp said ads and these features will roll out globally in the coming months.

Throughout her years working in technology, Jenny Wang, 28, always found herself stumbling back to one idea — a personal styling agent to help users decide what to wear and buy based on their budget, lifestyle, weather, and calendar. 

She has tried to build such a product numerous times in the past, “but the AI technology was not yet mature enough,” she told TechCrunch. That's changed, so a few months ago she announced the launch of her dream company, Alta, followed by the announcement today of an $11 million seed round led by Menlo Ventures. 

The product, which feels straight out of the movie “Clueless,” is indeed an AI stylist and personal shopper that makes outfit recommendations and lets users try on those looks with their personalized virtual avatar. For example, a person can ask Alta what the best outfit might be for, say, TechCrunch Disrupt, and the AI will offer suggestions and present a lookbook of outfits. 

Users upload their closet by either taking photos, forwarding purchase receipts, or searching what is already in the Alta database. People can also dress themselves in clothes they are looking to buy, mixing and matching with clothes already in their closet. 

There are others playing around in the AI styling space, such as Whering and Cladwell, all trying to recreate the magic of that iconic scene in “Clueless,” where Cher plans an outfit from her closet using computer technology. Wang considers herself to be part of the new wave of consumer technology, looking to make styling and shopping more effective. 

“There are existing players like Google Shopping and Pinterest who are also experimenting with AI,” she continued. “But the experiences that consumers will crave and use in the future will need to be built with new technical architectures and new user interfaces.” 

The product is backed by some heavy names, including Michelle Obama's stylist Meredith Koop, who Wang said helped train Alta's AI. 

Other investors in the company include Benchstrength; Algaé Ventures, the investment firm backed by fashion's prestigious Arnault family of LVMH; Phenomenal Ventures, the firm founded by Kamala Harris' niece Meena; Anthropic's VC arm Anthology fund; and a slew of angel investors including DoorDash CEO and co-founder Tony Xu, super models Jasmine Tookes and Karlie Kloss, Rent the Runway co-founder Jenny Fleiss, and Poshmark CEO and co-founder Manish Chandra. 

Wang used the word “aligned” to describe her fundraising process and leaned heavily on the network she amassed while working in various tech roles throughout her career. She's a Harvard engineer by training and has invested in numerous companies, served as a technical advisor to brands, and also held roles at investment firms. 

Years ago, for example, she was an intern at DoorDash, and previously volunteered on Karlie Kloss' podcast “Kode With Klossy.” 

“I am still actively coding every day and learning from our team and technical advisors,” she said. 

Wang said the fresh capital will be used to grow the team and fund more research and development. “Our team is continuously updating our in-house models and improving the experience based on community feedback,” she said. 

Alta has already struck a partnership with the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) to offer Alta to its membership base. Wang used to live in San Francisco but relocated to New York to help build out the technology. “NYC is also a closer flight to Paris than SF,” she said, adding that LVMH and one of her angel investors, tech influencer Zita d'Hautville, are helping the company expand throughout Europe.

Alta is also working with Marie Kondo as the company expands throughout parts of Oceania and the Pacific. 

The plan is to next look at partnering with retailers worldwide.  

“Many of the most exciting consumer AI companies are being started in NYC,” Wang continued, adding that she's assembled a highly technical but also fashion-obsessed team. This startup is her dream come true.

The fintech startup, founded in 2018, abruptly shut down earlier this year. Per an email from CEO Paul Aaron, the closure follows an unsuccessful attempt to find a buyer, though Employer.com has a new offer under consideration to acquire the company post-shutdown.

This list updates regularly.

On April 24, 2025, we corrected the number of layoffs that happened in March.

Food distribution giant United Natural Foods (UNFI) said it is making “significant progress” in recovering from a cyberattack that occurred almost two weeks ago, as grocery stores across North America reliant on the distributor continue to report food shortages.

UNFI said in an update on Sunday that it was restoring its electronic ordering systems, which its customers use to place orders for their grocery stores and supermarkets.

The company, which provides more than 30,000 stores across the United States and Canada with fresh produce and other products, was hit by a cyberattack on June 5, which the company disclosed several days later. 

UNFI has not yet described the nature of the cyberattack, though it told investors last week that it had shut down its entire network to contain the incident. The ongoing outage is preventing the company from fulfilling and distributing customer orders at scale.

One of the largest grocers affected is Whole Foods, which relies on UNFI as its “primary distributor.” Several Whole Foods stores, including one visited by TechCrunch last week and others in the New York area, are experiencing shelf shortages amid the UNFI outages. One employee at a Whole Foods in California told TechCrunch described supply issues at their store, saying they had not seen some products for days. 

Whole Foods previously told TechCrunch that it was working to restore its shelves “as quickly as possible,” but did not say when shipments would return to normal.

People working at local grocery stores and big-chain supermarkets alike have told TechCrunch that they continue to experience disruption of varying degrees. Some said that other distributors are providing some supplies, while others are still reporting issues with ordering products from UNFI. 

UNFI has not yet provided a timeline for recovery.

India has been one of the top recipients of remittances in the world for more than a decade. Inward remittances jumped from $55.6 billion in 2010-11 to $118.7 billion in 2023-24, according to data from the country's central bank. The bank projects that figure will reach $160 billion in 2029.

This means there is an increasing market for digitalized banking experiences for non-resident Indians (NRIs), ranging from remittances to investing in different assets back home.

Aspora (formerly Vance) is trying to build a verticalized financial experience for the Indian diaspora by keeping convenience at the center. While a lot of financial products are in its future roadmap, the company currently focuses largely on remittances.

“While multiple financial products for non-resident Indians exist, they don't know about them because there is no digital journey for them. They possibly use the same banking app as residents, which makes it harder for them to discover products catered towards them,” founder Parth Garg said.

In the last year, the company has grown the volume of remittances by 6x — from $400 million to $2 billion in yearly volume processed. 

With this growth, the company has attracted a lot of investor interest. It raised $35 million in Series A funding last December — which was previously unreported — led by Sequoia, with participation from Greylock, Y Combinator, Hummingbird Ventures, and Global Founders Capital. The round pegged the company's valuation at $150 million. In the four months following, the company tripled its transaction volume, prompting investors to put in more money.

The company announced today it has raised $50 million in Series B funding, co-led by Sequoia and Greylock, with Hummingbird, Quantum Light Ventures, and Y Combinator also contributing to the round. The startup said this round values the company at $500 million. The startup has raised over $99 million in funding to date.

After pivoting from being Pipe.com for India, the company started by offering remittance for NRIs in the U.K. in 2023 and has expanded its presence in other markets, including Europe and the United Arab Emirates. It charges a flat fee for money transfer and offers a competitive rate. Now it also allows customers to invest in mutual funds in India. The startup markets its exchange rates as “Google rate” as customers often search for currency conversion rates, even though they may not reflect live rates.

The startup is also set to launch in the U.S., one of the biggest remittance corridors to India, next month. Plus, it plans to open up shop in Canada, Singapore, and Australia by the fourth quarter of this year.

Garg, who grew up in the UAE, said that remittances are just the start, and the company wants to build out more financial tools for NRIs.

“We want to use remittances as a wedge and build all the financial solutions that the diaspora needs, including banking, investing, insurance, lending in the home country, and products that help them take care of their parents,” he told TechCrunch.

He added that a large chunk of money that NRIs send home is for wealth creation rather than family sustenance. The startup said that 80% of its users are sending money to their own accounts back home.

In the next few months, the company is launching a few products to offer more services. This month, it plans to launch a bill payment platform to let users pay for services like rent and utilities. Next month, it plans to launch fixed deposit accounts for non-resident Indians that allow them to park money in foreign currency. By the end of the year, it plans to launch a full-stack banking account for NRIs that typically takes days for users to open. While these accounts can help the diaspora maintain their tax status in India, a lot of people use a family member's account because of the cumbersome process, and Aspora wants to simplify this.

Apart from banking, the company also plans to launch a product that would help NRIs take care of their parents back home by offering regular medical checkups, emergency care coverage, and concierge services for other assistance.

Besides global competitors like Remitly and Wise, the company also has India-based rivals like Abound, which was spun off from Times Internet.

Sequoia's Luciana Lixandru is confident that Aspora's execution speed and verticalized solution will give it an edge.

“Speed of execution, for me, is one of the main indicators in the early days of the future success of a company,” she told TechCrunch over a call. “Aspora moves fast, but it is also very deliberate in building corridor by corridor, which is very important in financial services.”

New technologies can help close the gaps between the government and the public. But they're not without risks.

In recent decades, cities have become increasingly adept at amassing all sorts of data. But that data can have limited impact when government officials are unable to communicate, let alone analyze or put to use, all the information they have access to.

This dynamic has always bothered Sarah Williams, a professor of urban planning and technology at MIT. “We do a lot of spatial and data analytics. We sit on academic papers and research that could have a huge impact on the way we plan and design our cities,” she says of her profession. “It wasn't getting communicated.”

Shortly after joining MIT in 2012, Williams created the Civic Data Design Lab to bridge that divide. Over the years, she and her colleagues have pushed the narrative and expository bounds of urban planning data using the latest technologies available—making numbers vivid and accessible through human stories and striking graphics. One project she was involved in, on rates of incarceration in New York City by neighborhood, is now in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Williams's other projects have tracked the spread and impact of air pollution in Beijing using air quality monitors and mapped the daily commutes of Nairobi residents using geographic information systems. 

Cities should be transparent in how they're using AI and what its limitations are. In doing so, they have an opportunity to model more ethical and responsive ways of using this technology.

In recent years, as AI became more accessible, Williams was intrigued by what it could reveal about cities. “I really started thinking, ‘What are the implications for urban planning?'” she says. These tools have the potential to organize and illustrate vast amounts of data instantaneously. But having more information also increases the risks of misinformation and manipulation. “I wanted to help guide cities in thinking about the positives and negatives of these tools,” she says. 

In 2024, that inquiry led to a collaboration with the city of Boston, which was exploring how and whether to apply AI in various government functions through its Office of Emerging Technology. Over the course of the year, Williams and her team followed along as Boston experimented with several new applications for AI in government and gathered feedback at community meetings.

On the basis of these findings, Williams and the Civic Data Design Lab published the Generative AI Playbook for Civic Engagement in the spring. It's a publicly available document that helps city governments take advantage of AI's capabilities and navigate its ­attendant risks. This kind of guidance is especially important as the federal government takes an increasingly laissez-faire approach to AI regulation. 

“That gray zone is where nonprofits and academia can create research to help guide states and private institutions,” Williams says. 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology's new harm reduction initiative is helping prevent needless deaths.

The lab's playbook and academic papers touch on a wide range of emerging applications, from virtual assistants for Boston's procurement division to optimization of traffic signals to chatbots for the 311 nonemergency services hotline. But Williams's primary focus is how to use this technology for civic engagement. AI could help make the membrane between the government and the public more porous, allowing each side to understand the other a little better. 

Right now, civic engagement is mostly limited to “social media, websites, and community meetings,” she says. “If we can create more tools to help close that gap, that's really important.”

One of Boston's AI-powered experiments moves in that direction. The city used a large language model to summarize every vote of the Boston City Council for the past 16 years, creating simple and straightforward descriptions of each measure. This easily searchable database “will help you find what you're looking for a lot more quickly,” says Michael Lawrence Evans, head of the Office of Emerging Technology.  A quick search for “housing” shows the city council's recent actions to create a new housing accelerator fund and to expand the capacity of migrant shelters. Though not every summary has been double-checked by a human, the tool's accuracy was confirmed through “a really robust evaluation,” Evans says. 

AI tools may also help governments understand the needs and desires of residents. The community is “already inputting a lot of its knowledge” through community meetings, public surveys, 311 tickets, and other channels, Williams says. Boston, for instance, recorded nearly 300,000 311 requests in 2024 (most were complaints related to parking). New York City recorded 35 million 311 contacts in 2023. It can be difficult for government workers to spot trends in all that noise. “Now they have a more structured way to analyze that data that didn't really exist before,” she says.

AI can help paint a clearer picture of how these sorts of resident complaints are distributed geographically. At a community meeting in Boston last year, city staff used generative AI to instantly produce a map of pothole complaints from the previous month. 

AI also has the potential to illuminate more abstract data on residents' desires. One mechanism Williams cites in her research is Polis, an open-source polling platform used by several national governments around the world and a handful of cities and media companies in the US. A recent update allows poll hosts to categorize and summarize responses using AI. It's something of an experiment in how AI can help facilitate direct democracy—an issue that tool creator Colin Megill has worked on with both OpenAI and Anthropic. 

But even as Megill explores these frontiers, he is proceeding cautiously. The goal is to “enhance human agency,” he says, and to avoid “manipulation” at all costs: “You want to give the model very specific and discrete tasks that augment human authors but don't replace them.”

Misinformation is another concern as local governments figure out how best to work with AI. Though they're increasingly common, 311 chatbots have a mixed record on this front. New York City's chatbot made headlines last year for providing inaccurate and, at times, bizarre information. When an Associated Press reporter asked if it was legal for a restaurant to serve cheese that had been nibbled on by a rat, the chatbot responded, “Yes, you can still serve the cheese to customers if it has rat bites.” (The New York chatbot appears to have improved since then. When asked by this reporter, it responded firmly in the negative to the nibbling rat question.)

Amid takedowns of various government sites and databases, several organizations are working to preserve vital climate, health, and scientific data before it's gone for good.

These AI mishaps can reduce trust in government—precisely the opposite of the outcome that Williams is pursuing in her work. 

“Currently, we don't have a lot of trust in AI systems,” she says. “That's why having that human facilitator is really important.” Cities should be transparent in how they're using AI and what its limitations are, she says. In doing so, they have an opportunity to model more ethical and responsive ways of using this technology. 

Next on Williams's agenda is exploring how cities can develop their own AI systems rather than relying on tech giants, which often have a different set of priorities. This technology could be open-source; not only would communities be able to better understand the data they produce, but they would own it. 

“One of the biggest criticisms of AI right now is that the people who are doing the labor are not paid for the work that they do [to train the systems],” she says. “I'm super excited about how communities can own their large language models. Then communities can own the data that's inside them and allow people to have access to it.”

Right now, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is Amazon's top-selling phone. It came out in January 2025 and is now seen as the best Android phone – even better than the iPhone 16 Pro according to many. Amazon is selling it for $1,099 which is $200 less than its original price of $1,299, and a record low price. It's also a lot cheaper here than at the official Samsung store, but it could sell out fast.

See at Amazon

The Galaxy S25 Ultra is regarded by experts as the best phone available currently: Samsung has pushed the boundaries of hardware and software by integrating artificial intelligence at every level to deliver a seamless user experience. At the heart of the phone is the newest Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 processor which offers lightning-quick performance for lag-free multitasking and media consumption. The huge 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display offers stunning colors and clear graphics so whether it's work or gaming, everything is a treat. Its battery life is long enough for you to use during a whole day (and maybe even more) of heavy usage without needing to worry that you'll be running out of power, which makes it ideal for business people, influencers, and others who use their phone all day long.

You will also adore its AI-driven camera system: The Galaxy S25 Ultra features a high-end quad-camera setup, including a 200MP main sensor, a 50MP periscope telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom, a 12MP ultra-wide lens, and a second telephoto lens for versatile photography. The Audio Eraser camera captures stunning video in challenging low-light environments and eliminates background noise. So that you can relive your most cherished moments with less distraction and greater sharpness. The portrait features are optimized to sharpen skin tones while preserving natural texture so that each photo looks professional and stylish.

Other than photography, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is also great at keeping your day simple through its wide usage of AI: With features like “Multiple Tasks With One Ask,” you can keep your day simple by instructing your phone to perform several tasks all at the same time with a single request. For example, you can have it search for a nearby vegan pet-friendly restaurant and text the results to a friend in one shot. It's this combination of premium hardware—like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chipset and multi-purpose camera array—with smart AI features that makes the Galaxy S25 Ultra such a compelling choice for those seeking the best in performance and innovation.

If you're looking for a premium AI smartphone that makes life easier, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is a great pick at its lowest price ever.

Outdoor security cameras can feel like more trouble than they're worth at times – running wires together, with battery packs that take forever to charge, wrestling with terrible video quality and with monthly subscription fees that shoot up fast.

But today, Amazon's offering a solution that trims all those problems on its head and it's priced nearly too low to believe: The Eufy Security Cam (S220) is a wireless outdoor security camera with solar power and it is currently discounted by 50%, bringing the price down to just $64 from its original list price of $129. At this price, it's one of the best deals you'll find for a reliable high-quality security camera.

See at Amazon

Google's latest flagship, the Pixel 9, is here to raise the bar on what one can expect from a premium smartphone – most notably in the fields of photography and video. Launched in September, this Android phone is very popular with its mind-boggling performance, seamless integration with Gemini AI, and, most importantly, world-class camera capabilities.

While Pixel phones have been praised in the past for their incredible value and camera prowess, the Pixel 9 takes it to the next level – particularly now that it's available at an all-time low. Amazon currently has the Pixel 9 listed with 256GB storage for a mere $699, a staggering 22% discount from its retail price of $899. You can also get the 128GB model for $599 down from $799.

Pixel 9 is typically the highest-rated smartphone on the market for both photography and videography. Its pro-level camera technology uses Google's own AI and computational photography capabilities to provide images and videos that are on par with and frequently better than, those of much more costly rivals. From everyday snaps or low-light photography, Pixel 9 provides clear, bright and life-like output. The camera on the phone is equally stunning, delivering silky-smooth stabilization, rich colors with its capture and AI-edited capabilities thanks to Gemini AI driving the process.

Its camera boasts a main sensor with advanced pixel-binning technology for better low-light performance an ultra-wide-angle lens for expansive shots, and a suite of AI-powered features like Magic Eraser, Night Sight, and Real Tone. Video recording isn't left out, either, with 4K resolution at 60 frames per second, cinematic stabilization, and AI-fortified optimization that makes each clip appear as if it had a pro behind the camera.

Internally, the Pixel 9 is powered by Google's latest Tensor chip delivering zip in terms of performance, effortless multitasking and organic integration within Google's ecosystem. The smartphone has a 6.3-inch Actua screen, which provides sharp images, rich blacks, and a silky smooth 120Hz refresh rate for seamless scrolling and gaming. The screen is bright and colorful with no struggle to use it in direct sunlight or outdoors.

The Pixel 9 promises up to 24 hours of usage from a single charge. Wireless charging is also enabled, adding to the device's convenience and versatility.

At the software level, Pixel 9 runs on the newest version of Android, guaranteed updates and security patches for future years.

The Pixel 9 is one of the wisest value smartphone available today, especially at this record-low price on Amazon.

On the official Apple site, the new MacBook Air laptops that debuted in March are, naturally, still at full retail price. But on Amazon, the MacBook Air 2025 256GB with the M4 chip is available for only $849 which is a massive discount from its list price of $999. With a record-high rating of 4.8 out of 5 stars, the model is not only a bestseller but, in our own view, also the best money-for-value option available now. Higher capacity models (e.g., 512GB) and more RAM options also have their lowest prices ever since launch.

See at Amazon

The MacBook Air 2025 is built upon the latest M4 chip which offers incredible performance for everyday use and even more demanding creative work. The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display is a real showstopper and offers vivid colors, sharp details and excellent brightness which are ideal for business or entertainment use. With its 16GB of total memory, this MacBook Air is a cinch to multitask with. Its 256GB SSD storage is quick on the draw with your programs and files but still has enough space for most users' needs. And if you need more, Amazon's larger-capacity models are an easy way to get the perfect option.

You will also enjoy the Apple Intelligence support which is a collection of intelligent features that are meant to boost your creativity and productivity. Whether editing images or simply browsing the web, the M4 chip and Apple Intelligence seamlessly collaborate to provide a responsive and seamless experience. The 12MP Center Stage camera turns you into your best self on video calls and dynamically adjusts the frame to keep you centered, and Touch ID provides quick and secure fingertip authentication for your Mac.

Lightweight at just under three pounds and a fraction of an inch thick, this laptop is simple to take with you wherever you go. With its sleek design, even though it's thin, the MacBook Air provides all-day battery life so you can work or browse without constantly looking for a plug. The keyboard is comfortable and quiet which makes it perfect for long typing sessions, while the large trackpad supports all the gestures and shortcuts you'd expect from a premium Apple device.

There are two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports for high-speed data transfer and charging, and a headphone jack for audio. The laptop also has Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 for high-speed and secure wireless connections. Wherever you are at home, in the office, or on the road, the MacBook Air maintains you connected and productive.

Don't let your chance to acquire one of the best laptops of the year slip away, inventory is flying off the shelves and these prices won't last.

Among the best-rated running watches available today, the Garmin Forerunner series consistently earns top marks from runners and fitness enthusiasts. The Garmin Forerunner 265 and Forerunner 265S are no exception, boasting an impressive 4.7 out of 5 stars across hundreds of Amazon reviews.

These two models—the 265S in 42mm and the standard 265 in 46mm—have both dropped to an all-time low price of $349 since Monday morning, down from their original list price of $449. With a discount of $100, this is a great opportunity if you're looking to upgrade your running watch without waiting for Prime Day.

See at Amazon

The Garmin Forerunner 265 and 265S are packed with features that cater to both serious athletes and everyday runners. The watch faces are equipped with vibrant, colorful AMOLED displays that make it easy to view your stats and notifications, even in direct sunlight. The AMOLED technology enhances visibility but also helps conserve battery life so that your watch stays powered for long training sessions or busy days.

Under the hood, the Garmin Forerunner 265 and 265S are designed to deliver advanced training metrics and in-depth recovery insights: These watches track a wide range of data including heart rate, VO2 max, training load, and training status, and give you a comprehensive picture of your fitness progress. The recovery insights help you understand when your body is ready for another hard workout or when you might need a rest day which makes it easier to avoid overtraining and injury. Whether you're training for a marathon or simply trying to stay active, these features provide valuable feedback to help you reach your goals.

Both watches offer built-in GPS so that you can track your runs, hikes, and bike rides with precision. You can also upload your favorite routes and follow turn-by-turn directions right on your wrist. The watches connect seamlessly with your smartphone, so you can receive notifications, control music, and even make contactless payments with Garmin Pay.

The lightweight design and breathable silicone strap ensure a secure, comfortable fit even during long runs or intense workouts. The watches are also water-resistant so you don't have to worry about sweat, rain, or accidental splashes. With a battery life that lasts for days on a single charge, you can focus on your training without constantly worrying about recharging your device.

The Garmin Forerunner 265 and 265S are among the best running watches you can buy right now, and the current Amazon deal makes them more accessible than ever. Don't wait for Prime Day: this deal is too good to pass up, and the stock won't last long.

If you own a PS5, having multiple controllers is almost a necessity as there's nothing better than sharing your favorite PlayStation games with friends or family in the same room. While it's always wise to have a spare controller ready for multi-player sessions or simply as a backup for you, genuine discounts on the PlayStation DualSense wireless controller are rare.

Even during Black Friday, major promotions were hard to find which makes this moment the perfect opportunity to add another controller to your setup. Right now, the PlayStation DualSense controller is available on Amazon for just $54 which is a substantial 27% off its usual $74 price. This limited-time deal marks an all-time low, so it's an ideal time to buy.

See at Amazon

The biggest feature of the DualSense controler is haptic feedback which puts the feel of in-game action and environments right in your hands. Whether you're racing down rough roads, wielding guns or feeling the crash of a collision, the controller's next-gen vibration motors plunge you further into the game.

Aside from the haptic feedback, adaptive triggers provide varying levels of force and tension so that you can feel the distinction between drawing back a bowstring or slamming on the brakes in a racing title. They work together to create a feeling of realism and immersion that was not achievable on previous PlayStation controllers.

The built-in microphone allows you to chat online without a headset and the 3.5mm audio jack allows you to plug in your favorite headphones for individual use. The create button is convenient to use to capture and stream your most excellent gaming moments in case you're playing with buddies or capturing highlights to playback later. The controller's iconic appearance has been fine-tuned for comfort with enhanced sticks and an intuitive layout that feels great in your hand even after long gaming sessions.

DualSense isn't only for PlayStation 5 gamers: With its USB Type-C and Bluetooth connectivity, you can easily play it on Windows desktops and Macs too which gives you even more gaming possibilities outside of the console. Most high-end PC games currently support advanced features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, which lets you experience the same immersive experience playing from your computer.

With over 33,000 reviews and a lovely 4.6 out of 5-star rating, the PlayStation DualSense Wireless Controller is a proven winner among gamers. Don't hesitate too much: These sales don't come around often, and the stock may not be here.

All in the name of science, of course.

The scope of 3D printing has gotten much bigger over the years, so much so that 3D-printed buildings are on track to become less of a novelty. A team of scientists from the UK, more specifically professors from the University of Bristol, have thankfully been hard at work developing a giant simulator capable of testing these 3D printed buildings for safety in the event of natural disasters like earthquakes by shaking them.

The simulator is essentially a huge table with mounting brackets to hold 3D-printed structures in place. The team can program a handful of movements, particularly horizontal motions, which can provide a look at how the structure will behave during sudden seismic activity. This work is being handled in the University of Bristol's Soil Foundation Structure Interaction Laboratory (SoFSI) and has been showcased by the BBC, which claims this project is the first of its kind.

Anastasios Sextos is a professor of earthquake engineering and confirmed that a major goal of this project is to help find a crossroads between affordability and safety when it comes to the future of 3D printed housing. Tests like these are crucial in helping designers create stable 3D designs that can be replicated safely for consumers who may not have the means to ensure the design integrity on their own.

Joking with BBC, Professor Sextos claims the team can test ""anything that we can bolt to the table."" So far, the simulator seems to be exclusively dedicated to testing 3D printed buildings. Once the simulator has completed the test, the information gathered can be shared with the original designers for further study.

Professor Sextos hopes that this work can help designers create safe and reliable building designs for people worldwide. Some countries are more likely to encounter earthquakes than others, and these tests make a huge difference for the people who rely on housing options like 3D-printed buildings.

There are some limitations with the simulator, mainly in the department of size. Speaking of giant 3D-printed buildings, you might like our recent story on the world's tallest 3D-printed building, found in Switzerland.

A complex network of bank accounts, businesses, couriers, and cryptocurrency accounts is under further investigation.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Australian law enforcement has charged four people who were allegedly behind an “elaborate and calculated” large scale money laundering operation. Over an 18-month period, investigators allege AUD$190 million ($124 million) was channeled through a “complex network of bank accounts, businesses, couriers and cryptocurrency accounts,” to avoid the attention of the authorities. Of course, the source of all this money was alleged illicit activities.

As the purported money laundering operation was so complex, uncovering it meant significant work for multiple agencies and more than 70 staff over the last year and a half.

The official PR indicates that the Australian Federal Police (AFP) coordinated the investigations, with their Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT). Other parties involved in uncovering this apparent web of deceit include the Queensland Police Service, Australian Border Force, the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, AUSTRAC, and Australian Taxation Office – under the auspices of the Queensland Joint Organized Crime Taskforce (QJOCTF).

The above law enforcement organizations coordinated the execution of 14 search warrants at homes and businesses across Brisbane and the Gold Coast on June 5 and 6. At the same time, the aforementioned four people were charged. Some are now in custody, others on bail.

Obfuscating the source of millions of dollars is a lot of work, and those charged are claimed to be part of a network which:

Clearly, some of those businesses were chosen for their ease of mixing legitimate money with illicit income, in order to launder it. The degree of anonymity, speed of transactions, and loose global regulation of cryptocurrency made it instrumental to the income obfuscation efforts in the uncovered operation.

For the four people now formally charged, the next big event on their calendars will be upcoming appearances in court through July and August. We'd expect investigators to use the results of their searches and seizures to firm up their cases in the meantime.

The maximum sentences the accused will face range from 10 years to life imprisonment. Some of those charged face multiple counts.

“Many Australians are feeling the financial pinch but remain law-abiding and honest citizens,” said AFP Detective Superintendent Adrian Telfer, in an official statement. “Criminals always choose greed over decency and will constantly find opportunities to increase their wealth at the expense of others.” It was also underlined that money laundering isn't a victimless crime, as it fuels serious organized crime like drug trafficking, exploitation, and violence.

It calls to me... 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


I'm not especially in the market for a GPU upgrade right now (especially if my Wife is listening), but I've just come across a pretty excellent deal at Amazon that's making me itch for a new GPU.

Right now at Amazon UK, you can score the MSI GeForce RTX 5070 12G Ventus 3X OC edition fully 17% off, now just £545.

Not only is that considerably cheaper than its £654 list price, it's also £30 cheaper than the most recent lowest price we've seen on this, £575, according to our price tracking.

MSI GeForce RTX 5070 12G VENTUS 3X OC: (was £654.99) now £545.70 at Amazon The lowest-ever price we've seen on this card, and just £20 shy of the MSRP Founder's Edition, despite its heftier clock and performant triple fan cooling.  

A 1440p card that easily outstrips the RTX 4070, the RTX 5070 is our number one pick in our best GPU roundup for a reason. With a decent jump over the previous gen, it's a great overall pick thanks to the combination of price and performance.

Over the RTX 3070 sat in my gaming PC under this desk, it's certainly an enticing upgrade. This MSI variant boasts much heftier triple fan cooling compared to the dual fan configuration of the FE.

Not only are you getting more cooling for your money, but the MSI Ventus comes with a 2.54 GHz boost clock (compared to 2.51 GHz on the FE), as well as the MSI Extreme Performance option, which dials it up to 2.55 GHz.

If you want to save a bit more money, or space is a constraint, there's also a similarly chunky saving on the more modest Ventus 2X variant, now just £509.99 instead of £619.99. Sporting one fewer fan than the 3X, this is also another lowest-ever price on MSI's range, and, crucially, is cheaper than MSRP.

'You Serve, You Save,' but you have to hunt through nondescript brown boxes.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The U.S. Navy Exchange store seems to be a treasure trove of MSRP RTX 50 graphics cards. This bargain alert comes from a Redditor who recently picked up a keenly priced Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 FE model for a cool $1,900, after various store and credit card promotions were applied. However, the NEX isn't open for everybody. As the site snappily says, ""You Serve, You Save,"" meaning it is for active and retired military families, but many readers might have a close friend or relative who can shop there. Additionally, every branch of the US armed forces has its own equivalent shop, although it is unclear how widespread deals on GPUs would be (if at all).

If you don't have experience with the NEX store, Redditor Accomplished-Feed123 sums it up as “like a Target or Walmart mixed with a Best Buy and Marshall's that also sells snacks and beer but no groceries.” That might not sound like an ideal hunting ground for the best graphics cards, but the Redditor had experience finding prior bargains like open-box electronics and/or computer gaming products at the store.

Drawn by spider-senses towards the locked Apple cage of goods, Accomplished-Feed123 spotted some “largeish brown boxes.” At this point, they didn't know they would be stuffed with green GPU gold. But, it soon became apparent that this was a bounty of “several 5070s, 5080s, and one single 5090,” wrote the Redditor. ""All were priced at MSRP (550, 999, and 1999, respectively)."" It was obviously hard to resist, and they ""said YOLO and picked up the 5090.""

Googling the part number on the nondescript RTX 5090 package, it was discovered that inside was an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 FE model. These are sometimes sought after for their brand status, build quality, and relatively compact design. If your case is large enough, you might prefer a bigger, quieter, and better-cooled model, though.



Thanks to the canny use of various credit card and store rewards, Accomplished-Feed123 managed to walk away with Nvidia's current flagship for $1,900. Not bad, in the current GPU retail climate.

To conclude their tale of bargains at NEX, it was interesting to hear that the Redditor previously owned a capable but now last-gen Radeon RX 7900 XTX. They haven't been in the green team since owning an RTX 3060 Ti (launched Dec 2020).

We are happy for Accomplished-Feed123, and hope others with access to NEX can grab similar MSRP-beating bargains. However, the wider public, and shoppers elsewhere around the globe, should probably be content with the way the latest and greatest graphics cards are trending downwards in price.

At the time of writing, we are starting to see more MSRP-and-under graphics cards become available. Sometimes they might not be obvious, requiring a special code or promo voucher, but a patient price sniper can do OK right now. For example, someone snagged an RTX 5090 from Walmart for a cool $1,679. We've also reported on sub-MSRP RTX 5090s in the UK. If you don't need a top-end flagship GPU, we are also happy to report that recently launched cards like the AMD Radeon RX 9600 XT didn't sell out, and thus they haven't been subject to the inevitable pricing inflation from slim stock levels. I've also been able to snag an RX 9070 at below MSRP in the UK using various discount codes.

It is always hard to know whether prices will continue to slide as demand cools, or there will be some tech movement (crypto, AI, etc.) that will inflate prices, or even some kind of supply-side calamity (wars, earthquakes) to cause fresh price spikes.

Recent tracking polls report that about one in eight people have taken a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, more commonly known as GLP-1 medications. 

Originally used to help treat type 2 diabetes, these medications have gained in popularity over the last few years for weight loss. 

Currently, the most common types of GLP-1 drugs are semaglutide — sold under the brand names Ozempic for type 2 diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss — and tirzepatide, sold under the brand names Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss. 

Just like any medication, GLP-1 drugs have possible side effects and complications. One potential complication was first reported in July 2024 when a study found people using semaglutide were at a four times higher risk of developing nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). This was followed by research published in January 2025 that discovered people taking either semaglutide or tirzepatide may be at an increased risk for potentially blinding vision issues. 

Now, a new study recently published in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology reports that older adults with diabetes taking any type of GLP-1 medication may be at a heightened risk for developing neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD).

For this study, researchers analyzed health records from 2020 to 2023 of more than 139,000 Ontario residents with an average age of 66 and diagnosis of diabetes. Participants who used GLP-1 medications did so for more than six months. 

“Our study included any GLP-1 receptor agonists that were prescribed during the study period in Ontario, Canada; we did not exclude any specific type of these medications,” Rajeev H. Muni, MD MSc FRCSC, associate professor and vice chair of Clinical Research in the Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences at the University of Toronto in Canada, and principal investigator of this study explained to Medical News Today. “However, semaglutide represented the vast majority of use in our cohort, accounting for 97.5% of all GLP-1 prescriptions.”

“Lixisenatide made up the remaining 2.5%, and nearly all prescriptions of lixisenatide were in combination with insulin glargine,” Muni continued. “Tirzepatide was not included because it had not yet been approved in Canada during the study period.” 

“Furthermore, while Wegovy was approved in late 2021, our study focused on patients with diabetes from 2020 to 2023,” he added. “Therefore, it is very likely that the semaglutide included in our analysis was prescribed as Ozempic, which is indicated for blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes.” 

Upon analysis, researchers found that participants with diabetes taking a GLP-1 medication had a two-fold higher risk of developing nAMD — a type of AMD where malformed blood vessels grow underneath the retina, causing fluids to leak into the macula of the eye. 

There is currently no cure for nAMD and it is a condition that can potentially cause blindness. 

“We found that among patients with diabetes aged 66 and older, the incidence of nAMD was approximately 1 in 1,000 in those who had never used GLP-1 receptor agonists, compared to about 2 in 1,000 among those who had been exposed to these medications for at least six months,” Muni said. “While the absolute risk remains low, this represents a relative doubling in risk.” 

“While our findings should not prompt alarm, they do warrant increased clinical awareness,” he continued. “These medications have well-established benefits for cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic health. However, patients who may be at higher risk for nAMD, such as older adults, should be aware of the possibility of new visual symptoms. If any new changes in vision occur while taking these medications, patients should promptly inform their doctor and be referred to an ophthalmologist for further assessment.” 

Additionally, Muni and his team observed that the highest nAMD risk was associated with participants who had used GLP-1 medications for the longest amount of time. 

“We observed a clear dose-response relationship in our analysis, with the risk of nAMD increasing as the duration of GLP-1 receptor agonist exposure increased,” Muni explained. “This finding is clinically meaningful because it suggests that the risk may accumulate over time.” 

“Given that many individuals use these medications chronically, whether for blood sugar control or for weight loss, the long-term ocular safety of GLP-1 RAs requires further investigation,” he continued. “While observational data can't prove causation on its own, seeing a graded relationship like this suggests that prolonged exposure could play a role in increasing risk; however, this needs to be validated in future studies.” 

MNT also talked to Demetrios Vavvas, MD, PhD, director of the retina service at Mass Eye and Ear in Massachusetts, about this research.

Vavvas commented that the study's strength is on its massive scale of real-world data, the robust statistical technique used, and the evidence it found of a “dose-response” relationship.

“The risk of developing nAMD appeared to increase the longer a patient was exposed to the medication,” he continued. “This type of pattern makes a potential link more compelling than a single, static finding and provides a significant signal that warrants serious follow-up investigation.”

However, Vavvas did point out that the study has some limitations.

“The most significant limitation is that this study can only show an association, not prove that the drug causes this eye condition. This is because critical risk factors like smoking, obesity (BMI), and sun exposure were not accounted for in the data. Since GLP-1 RAs are often prescribed to patients with obesity, this single unmeasured factor could be the true driver of the observed risk.”— Demetrios Vavvas, MD, PhD

“Second, the results may be influenced by surveillance bias,” Vavvas continued. “Patients starting a powerful new medication like a GLP-1 RA are likely to be monitored more closely by their doctors. This increased medical attention could lead to a higher likelihood of their eye problems being detected and treated, which is what the study measured, creating the appearance of increased risk.”

“Thirdly, the actual events were very small — less than 0.2% so despite statistical adjustment results may not be accurate,” he added. “Lastly as the majority of GLP-1 RAs in this study were semaglutide, this may not apply to all GLP-1 RAs and additionally, because the analysis excluded over 26,000 patients who could not be matched, the results may not apply to the full spectrum of patients taking these drugs in the real world, particularly those with more complex health profiles.”

MNT spoke with David I. Geffen, OD, FAAO, director of optometric and refractive services at the Gordon Schanzlin New Vision in La Jolla, CA, about this study. 

Geffen commented that as GLP-1 medications are being prescribed to a huge number of patients — and as it's been observed that not all patients are symptom free and not side effect free — doctors must be very careful to make sure their patients' eye health is not compromised utilizing these medications. 

“It is important to make sure that we know our patients are taking these medications,” he explained. “This study shows that as new medications are approved we need to be careful as long term side-effects may be seen that we were not aware of.” 

“Diabetes is very common in our practices and many of our patients are put on the GPL-1s,” Geffen continued. “We need (to) be vigilant in examining patients with diabetes. If using these meds, it is even more important. One study is not enough to make too many assumptions however in deciding to use these meds. The GLP-1 medications have shown many benefits for most patients.”

“It is important to carry on further studies in other countries to see if this is seen in other populations,” he added. “It would be important to know more of the demographics of the afflicted populations. Knowing the status of the retina in the individuals before being put on the medications would be helpful in determining safety profiles.”

Two new Canadian studies suggest that the plant-based Portfolio Diet, which features cholesterol-lowering food choices, can reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality across diverse groups. The diet previously had been evaluated mostly among older, White participants.

The first study found an association between the diet, which was developed in 2003 by David J.A. Jenkins, MD, PhD, DSc, a researcher at the University of Toronto, Toronto, and a lower risk for CVD mortality and all-cause mortality. It was published last month in BMC Medicine.

Researchers analyzed data of 14,835 US adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994) and found that adhering to the Portfolio Diet was associated with a significant reduction in the risk for death from CVD, coronary heart disease (CHD), and all causes.

Participants' diets were evaluated by 24-hour dietary recall and a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at baseline using the Portfolio Diet Score (PDS). Patients were assigned positive points for the four focus groups of the diet: Nuts, plant protein (eg, beans or tofu), viscous fiber (eg, apples, oatmeal, and eggplant), and phytosterols and plant monounsaturated fatty acid sources (eg, enriched margarine or oils). Patients received negative points for foods high in saturated fat and cholesterol. The primary outcome was CVD mortality.

For all participants, an 8-point increase in PDS was associated with a 12% lower risk for CVD mortality. Other mortality outcomes included CHD, stroke, and all-cause mortality.

Examining 22 years of follow-up, the researchers found that higher adherence to the diet was associated with lower risk factors, including blood lipids, glycemia, and inflammation. An increase in PDS of 8 points was associated with a 12% lower risk, 14% lower risk, and 12% lower risk for CVD, CHD, and all-cause mortality, respectively, after adjustments for known CVD risk factors.

“We know that it works,” study author Meaghan E. Kavanagh, PhD, of the Department of Nutritional Sciences at the University of Toronto's Temerty Faculty of Medicine, told Medscape Medical News. It has been clear since early clinical trials that the diet can lower the level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol substantially, she said. “It's the same effect as a first-generation statin.” The current research is the next step, she explained, and the studies demonstrate that the diet can reduce people's risk for dying from these factors. They also broaden the diversity of the cohort.

The focus of the related trial, which was published last month in BMC Public Health and written by many of the same researchers, “was to look at [the diet] in a younger population to see if we could find associations with LDL cholesterol in such a healthy, young population. We're trying to show it works in all groups,” Kavanaugh said.

The trial, led by Victoria Chen, a student at the University of Toronto, included 1507 ethnoculturally diverse people in their 20s using data from the Toronto Nutrigenomics and Health Study.

In that study, diet was assessed by a validated Toronto-modified Harvard 196-item FFQ. Participants were instructed on how to complete the FFQ using visual aids of portion sizes. Adherence to the Portfolio Diet was measured using the PDS, and data analysis was adjusted for potential confounders.

Researchers studied the association of the PDS with LDL and other established CV risk factors in young people.

In this group, “an 8-point higher PDS was associated with 3% lower LDL-C, the primary outcome,” the authors wrote. “Our findings are also in agreement with cross-sectional analyses of other dietary patterns that share some similar components (legumes, whole grains, nuts, plant oils, fruits, and vegetables) to the Portfolio Diet, including the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Mediterranean diets, which have been associated with more favorable lipid, blood pressure, and/or adiposity markers in young adults who are predominantly university students.”

According to the study, 50% adherence to the Portfolio Diet beginning in young adulthood may delay increases in CVD risk later in life by about 6 years. Strict adherence could delay it by up to 13 years.

“This diet reinforces that patterns of eating are important over and above any one nutrient or food group,” said Jodi Heshka, MD, director of the Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy Clinic at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, Ottawa. “These new data show the Portfolio Diet also works in a variety of patients, ages, different backgrounds.” Heshka did not participate in the study.

Heshka, who recommends the diet to her patients, said another benefit is that even low adherence improves outcomes. “You don't have to go crazy following the Portfolio Diet to a tee,” she pointed out. “Simply by incorporating more of these foods and by default reducing other foods — even that alone can add benefit.”

Michele Blanchet, RD, a registered dietitian with Vancouver Coastal Health, Vancouver, told Medscape Medical News that she's been recommending the Portfolio Diet to patients since she started specializing in CV health 14 years ago.

“It's been the crux of me helping individuals lower cholesterol,” she said, but she also combines it with parts of the Mediterranean diet, particularly the visual representations of proportions of food groups.

She said she was particularly glad to see the finding that the diet can reduce the risk even in young, healthy people. “We're seeing in our cardiac rehab program younger and younger individuals coming in needing bypass surgeries, having heart attacks,” Blanchet said.

To work with young adults to follow the diet, she takes a diet history and looks at where they can make small changes: Adding vegetables and legumes and sprinkling flaxseed on foods, for instance.

“By making small changes throughout the day, they can have this synergistic effect of lowering their cholesterol and seeing the heart health benefits of this diet,” she said.

The study led by Kavanaugh was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR). The study led by Chen was funded by a Toronto 3D Research Fellowship Award, CIHR, and a University of Toronto fellowship. Kavanaugh, Chen, Heshka, and Blanchet reported having no relevant financial relationships.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among veterans living with HIV significantly increased the risk for AIDS and multiple comorbidities, particularly arthritis, cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and multimorbidity — with the greatest impact seen in the first decade after diagnosis.

“It is recommended that providers who work with VWH [veterans with HIV] consider adopting a trauma-informed model of HIV care and that providers screen veterans for PTSD, so that their unique trauma history can help guide medical decisions and treatment,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Kartavya J. Vyas, PhD, Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta. It was published online on May 22, 2025, in AIDS.

The data could not capture each individual's true index trauma or the severity of their PTSD. Additionally, the study was limited by considerable loss to follow-up, potential uncontrolled confounding related to homelessness, and a lack of generalizability to veterans with HIV who were not receiving antiretroviral therapy.

The study did not receive any specific funding. Two authors reported receiving federal research support — one from the Emory Center for AIDS Research and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the other from the National Institutes of Health and the CDC — in addition to investigator-initiated grants and consulting fees from various pharmaceutical companies.

A noninvasive, home-based brain treatment with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can reduce pain severity, improve pain-related disability, and enhance endogenous pain modulation in women with fibromyalgia, suggested the results of a clinical trial published in JAMA Network Open.

The study included 112 women between the ages of 18 years and 65 years with fibromyalgia. Half received anodal tDCS (A-tDCS), which applied 2 mA of electrical current through electrodes placed on the scalp over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, for 20 minutes daily and 5 days per week. The other half used a lookalike sham device that did not deliver sustained stimulation. In addition, all participants completed exercise and pain neuroscience education. 

At the end of the 4-week treatment period, and after a 3-month follow-up, study participants rated their pain from 0 (none) to 10 (worst pain) for seven activities. Patients who used tDCS experienced an average 39% reduction in pain, and 62.5% of them had a 50% or more improvement in pain. In comparison, subjects who used the sham device experienced an average 16% reduction in pain. tDCS also reduced pain severity compared to sham treatment. “These results are consistent with evidence suggesting that stimulating the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex enhances top-down control over pain, emotion, and cognitive processing,” said study author Wolnei Caumo, MD, PhD, professor of anesthesia and pain in the medical school at Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil. “The moderate to large effect sizes observed reaffirm expectations about the clinical relevance of targeting the prefrontal cortex in fibromyalgia.”

Prior research suggested that tDCS applies low-level electric currents to modulate neuronal excitability and neuroplasticity. Modulating activity in the brain's dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in particular can enhance control over pain processing networks and reduce pain catastrophizing, Caumo said. “This region is implicated in both cognitive control and emotional regulation,” said E. Baron Short, MD, MSCR, a professor of psychiatry and medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina. To understand how the placebo effect might influence the results, the patients had been randomly assigned to either treatment group and then stratified according to placebo test response; patients were evenly split between the A-tDCS and sham tDCS groups and between responders and nonresponders such that of the 56 placebo test nonresponders assigned to A-tDCS, 28 received sham treatment and 28 received active treatment, and of the 56 placebo test responders assigned to sham tDCS, 28 received sham treatment and 28 received active treatment. They found that placebo responses influenced pain intensity but not pain interference or psychosocial measures. 

“While a placebo can shape subjective pain perception, functional improvements require active neuromodulation,” Caumo said. “Moreover, placebo responders in the sham group regressed toward baseline at follow-up, while A-tDCS responders sustained their gains, highlighting the limited durability of placebo-only effects.”

In this study, tDCS didn't act alone — the education and exercise that participants completed are also beneficial in fibromyalgia. 

“The evidence so far says that for chronic pain, the two therapeutic approaches that have the best evidence are pain science education and physical exercise,” said María Teresa Carrillo De La Peña, PhD, a professor of clinical psychology and psychobiology at the University of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain, who studies novel treatments for chronic pain and cancer pain.

Exercise promotes the production of pain-relieving endorphins. And when patients learn about the brain's role in pain perception and processing, they start paying more attention to the psychological and social factors that affect their pain, she said. “Sometimes patients think that their pain is in the knee or the back, and they are waiting for a solution for that,” she said. “Thanks to pain science education, we stress that we need to attend to the brain.”

“Given the limited and often poorly tolerated options currently available for fibromyalgia, I do believe tDCS deserves serious consideration, particularly for patients who have not responded to conventional treatments or who struggle with medication side effects,” Baron said. “Its relative safety, ease of use, and the growing body of supportive evidence position it as a viable adjunctive treatment.”

The current study demonstrates that home-based tDCS is feasible, safe, and something patients stick with. The device used in the study was designed to be user-friendly with guidance from a healthcare professional who controls the electrode placement and timing settings. “It reduces transportation, cost, and time barriers, [which are] especially relevant for patients with chronic pain and mobility limitations,” Caumo said. “Additionally, the unsupervised model mimics real-world conditions and enhances scalability and autonomy, making it a cost-effective and patient-centered alternative to clinic-based sessions.”

Autonomy is powerful for patients with pain. “One of the most important things that we are seeing right now in the management of pain is that the patient takes this active role,” Carrillo De La Peña said.

This trial was supported by grants from the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, the Postgraduate Research Group at the 

Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, the Committee for the Development of Higher Education Personnel, and the US National Institutes of Health.  Caumo and a coauthor reported holding a pending patent for BR 20 2015 016450 0 U2 and receiving licensing royalties from Quark Medical. Carrillo De La Peña reported receiving research funding from the European Union. Short is a cofounder of Zendo Meditation and holder of patent 12257392.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

This is Dr JoAnn Manson, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital. I'd like to talk with you about a recent report in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology that addressed the modifiable risk factors for sudden cardiac arrest, the extent to which this outcome is preventable, and the percentage of cases that could be averted by changes in modifiable risk factors.

There's been surprisingly little research on this subject. Most of the research on sudden cardiac arrest has looked at genetic factors and clinical risk factors that are managed with pharmacologic agents, such as hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes, and proximate risk factors like what the patient was doing shortly before the sudden cardiac arrest. However, there's been very little research on the role of behavioral and lifestyle factors in long-term studies. It's important to have this research because we know that sudden cardiac arrest is highly fatal in about 90% of cases. In the US alone, there are more than 200,000 cases per year, and more than double that if we include total cardiac arrest inside and outside of the hospital. 

In the present study, researchers leveraged the large-scale UK Biobank, which included more than 500,000 participants whose mean age was 56 years and about 50% of whom were women. Over a follow-up of 14 years, there were about 3100 cases of incident sudden cardiac arrest. The researchers looked at about 125 risk factors and linked 56 of those factors to the risk for sudden cardiac arrest. These included lifestyle, behavioral, adiposity, psychosocial, and environmental factors. 

What they found was that the American Heart Association Life's Essential 8 factors were generally strongly related to risk for sudden cardiac arrest. For example, sedentary lifestyle, higher adiposity, higher waist circumference, short sleep duration (less than 7 hours per night), and tobacco use were associated with an increased risk. Other factors that were also linked to sudden cardiac arrest risk included psychosocial factors (eg, depressive symptoms, low mood, social isolation), dietary factors (eg, low fruit and vegetable intake), and air pollution. 

The researchers used Mendelian randomization to evaluate the likelihood of a causal relationship. In these analyses, about nine factors were determined to be causally related. These factors included adiposity factors, low fruit intake, low educational level, and some of the mood-related factors. Overall, they estimated that between 40% and 63% of sudden cardiac arrest cases could be preventable by reducing or even fully eliminating these risk factors. 

These findings underscore the importance of primary prevention, not only to nonfatal or total coronary heart disease and cardiovascular events, but also to sudden cardiac arrest. These results suggest that more could be done in terms of informing our patients about these risk factors in order to lower their risk — both informing them in the clinic and through community-based and public health campaigns.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Several medical groups have concluded regular consumption of alcohol in any amount poses a health risk, but a new scientific statement from the American Heart Association (AHA) offered more qualified guidance.

The premise that moderate alcohol use reduces cardiovascular risk has been widely accepted for decades. The authors of a 1993 editorial in The New England Journal of Medicine concluded “there now seems little doubt” that such a benefit exists. However, a review of the evidence in 2025 produced a more cautious summary.

“Considering the level of evidence, it remains unknown whether drinking is part of a healthy lifestyle, and therefore, clinicians should reinforce healthy lifestyle behaviors such as regularly engaging in physical activity, avoiding tobacco use, and maintaining healthy body weight,” the AHA document stated.

“Data from recent studies using new methodologies (eg, individual participant-level data meta-analysis and Mendelian randomization [MR]) have challenged the idea that any level of alcohol consumption has positive health effects,” according to authors of the new statement, led by Mariann R. Piano, RN, PhD, senior associate dean for research at the Vanderbilt University School of Nursing, in Nashville, Tennessee.

Prior to the new methodologies, protection against coronary artery disease from moderate alcohol use was derived from many observational studies. These studies used a variety of definitions of moderate drinking but typically considered that threshold to be two or fewer drinks per day for men and one or fewer drinks per day for women. In pooled analyses cited in the AHA statement, reductions in risks of 10%-15% relative to no drinking were common.

Yet analyses of alcohol consumption are complex, even leaving aside how a standard drink is defined or whether the risk calculations are needed for every type of alcohol, according to Piano and her colleagues. In addition, any potential benefit is eliminated by moderate drinkers who binge intermittently, according to several examples in the AHA statement.

The new methodologies for addressing the question of the safety of moderate drinking do not fully reverse conclusions that it is beneficial. They suggest little or no protection rather than harm. In one pooled analysis of MR studies, the finding was a “weak association” for benefit, which differs markedly from assertions that moderate drinking might be justified for a benefit to cardiovascular health.

Following a detailed review of the evidence for both moderate and heavy alcohol use on cardiovascular risks and risk factors, the AHA statement summarized messages clinicians can deliver to patients, but strict conclusions were limited to the harm of heavy drinking. The messages on moderate drinking largely consisted of talking points.

For coronary artery disease specifically, the AHA statement acknowledged that moderate drinking “may provide some risk reduction” for the condition even if this reduction has been rendered less clear by studies using analyses designed to apply more rigor for evaluating observational data.

For heart failure, the statement concluded that low-to-moderate alcohol consumption has not been associated with any beneficial or detrimental effect, although this statement is qualified with a citation suggesting five or more drinks per week may contribute to left ventricular dysfunction.

For patients who already have hypertension, the statement cautioned even moderate consumption of alcohol can contribute to elevated blood pressure — one of the few statements to link moderate alcohol use to a specific adverse effect on a cardiovascular risk factor. The authors characterized alcohol abstention as a reasonable part of lowering blood pressure in hypertensive patients.

For stroke, moderate alcohol use has produced mixed results, according to the AHA statement. One possible explanation for the increased risk for stroke in some studies might relate to the association of moderate alcohol with elevations in blood pressure among those who already have hypertension.

For arrhythmias and cardiomyopathies, low alcohol intake or abstention might be better than moderate or heavier drinking, even if data supporting this contention are limited, according to the AHA statement. For example, although a prospective study associated abstinence with a reduction in the burden of atrial fibrillation, the analysis, like the vast majority of studies cited in the AHA statement, was not a randomized comparison.

The focus of the new document was on cardiovascular health, but several health organizations taking a broader view of health risks have recently cautioned against alcohol use in general. Among them are the World Health Organization, which issued a statement in 2023 that “no level of alcohol consumption is safe for our health,” and the CDC, which earlier this year called for warning labels on alcoholic beverages linking consumption to cancer.

A 2023 report from the Canada called the Guidance on Alcohol and Health also called for drinking less as a general step to better health.

In the US, where a 2023 governmental survey found more than 50% of adults reported drinking alcohol within the past month, the US Department of Agriculture did not make definitive claims about the relationship between low-level alcohol use and health risks in its recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

Despite the recommendations the AHA listed for clinicians when advising patients, an urgent call was made for prospective studies that can confirm benefit, or at least the absence of risk, regarding moderate drinking. The list of gaps in knowledge in the statement was long.

The orientation regarding moderate alcohol use in relation to cardiovascular disease has shifted, according to Jamal S. Rana, MD, PhD, a clinical cardiologist and adjunct investigator in the Division of Research at Permanente Medical Group, Oakland, California.

At this point, “I think we should move away from the overarching public messaging that one should drink because it is good for heart health,” said Rana, who has been involved in several studies regarding alcohol use and cardiovascular risk.

For moderate use, he suggested the caution about potential risks should not exceed the evidence. Even if newer evidence is challenging the long-held belief that moderate alcohol offers some degree of cardioprotection, significant harm has been most closely associated with heavy alcohol use.

As for advising patients, he said he agrees in general with the AHA statement summary of the evidence: Risks should be emphasized to patients who drink more than moderately, but “drinking socially with low amounts of alcohol is okay.”

Piano and Rana reported having no potential financial conflicts of interest.

One of the priority objectives of research into rare diseases is to develop new treatments, and orphan medicines — which target conditions affecting no more than 5 in 10,000 people in the EU — provide a critical route toward that aim. 

A collaboration between the University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain, the August Pi Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS), and the Rare Diseases Unit of CIBER (CIBERER) has studied the potential application for the preventive and palliative treatment of aortic aneurysms, a characteristic of Marfan syndrome. The study, led by Professor Gustavo Egea, PhD, chair of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences at the University of Barcelona and the principal investigator at IDIBAPS, has identified new therapeutic potential for allopurinol in Marfan syndrome. Working alongside Isaac Rodríguez-Rovira, MS, postdoctoral researcher at the University of Barcelona, and Victoria Campuzano, PhD, senior researcher at CIBERER, the group demonstrated that allopurinol could prevent and slow the development of aortic aneurysms by inhibiting xanthine oxidoreductase and reducing oxidative stress in mouse models. Recently, Spain designated allopurinol as the first orphan medicine for Marfan syndrome under the European Medicines Agency (EMA) criteria.

Under European Union rules, orphan medicine is a drug intended to treat conditions that affect no more than 5 cases per 10,000. Marfan syndrome, a rare genetic disorder, affects approximately 7 in 100,000 individuals.

Speaking to Univadis Spain, Egea explained, “We were interested in Marfan syndrome. It is a genetic condition caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene, which encodes the fibrillin-1 protein, a protein essential for the structural integrity of many tissues in the body, as it forms part of the elastic fibres. This disease leads to serious vascular alterations, from abnormal dilation of the aorta, termed aneurysm, to its dissection and rupture. Other effects, although not fatal like those of the aorta, are respiratory such as pneumothorax and sleep apnoea, ocular including blindness due to lens displacement, and musculoskeletal involving muscle and joint flaccidity and tall stature.”

To explore potential treatments, the research team studied the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of aortic aneurysms. Using mouse models that closely mimic the clinical progression of Marfan syndrome, they identified key molecules significantly involved in the alteration and sought therapeutic tools that could interfere with the development or progression of the aneurysm.

Egea explained that “Allopurinol acts as a potent antioxidant that has been shown to halt and prevent the progression and development of aortic aneurysms and dissections. It is already used in clinical practice for the treatment of gout as it is an inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidoreductase, which generates uric acid and reactive oxygen species. Allopurinol is a safe, inexpensive, and well-known drug used in clinical practice. Therefore, the repositioning of this drug for cardiovascular treatment in Marfan syndrome and also for other vascular diseases makes it especially attractive due to its extensive clinical knowledge, its pharmacological safety, and its low cost.”

According to guidelines from the CIBERER, orphan designation from the EMA provides advantages such as exclusive marketing authorization for ten years during which similar products cannot be marketed, access to free or reduced-cost scientific advice and support protocols, and exemption from paying fees for the designation. Furthermore, the entities developing these drugs are eligible for specific subsidies from the European Union and member state programs, which favour the development of treatments for pathologies with little private investment due to their low prevalence.

With the designation of allopurinol, CIBERER has promoted 19 EMA-approved orphan medicines, six of which also hold orphan status from the US Food and Drug Administration in the United States. Of these, eight are gene therapies, and 11 are repurposed drugs, that is, drugs already used for other pathologies and are being evaluated for use in rare diseases. The University of Barcelona has previously contributed to the development of two CIBERER-backed orphan drugs approved by the EMA for cystinuria and megalencephalic leucoencephalopathy.

The Orphan Drug Regulation stimulated the development of new treatments for conditions that were once considered untreatable. Before 2000, the EMA had approved only eight orphan medicines. Currently, more than 200 of these are on this list.

“The designation does not establish that the drug is completely effective; it only indicates that it meets the EMA's definition of an orphan drug. Therefore, it is necessary to continue conducting corresponding clinical studies to obtain authorisation. International clinical trials of allopurinol are expected to begin in the future. The designation of an orphan drug makes it possible to conduct clinical trials for rare diseases.” Egea noted.

Like any other treatment, orphan-designated drugs must complete preclinical and clinical evaluations before marketing authorisation. Once approved, drugs are authorised through a centralised procedure that grants marketing approval across all European Union countries.

Gustavo Egea declared having no conflicts of interest.

Combination therapy with avelumab plus axitinib demonstrated a clinical benefit in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST), achieving a 69.6% disease control rate and a 57.1% progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 3 months.

""The AXAGIST trial is the largest prospective study evaluating the efficacy of the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitor and a multikinase inhibitor in patients with advanced/metastatic GIST. These results provide unique data on the activity of axitinib in GIST patients, which in combination with avelumab, resulted in long-term clinical benefit in a significant subset of patients,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Piotr Lukasz Rutkowski, Maria Skłodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology, Warsaw, Poland. It was published online on June 06, 2025, in the European Journal of Cancer.

This study lacked a comparator arm, which made it impossible to conclude whether the addition of avelumab improves the antitumour activity of axitinib.

In adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) on multiple antihypertensive medications, a modified Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension for Diabetes (DASH4D) diet combined with reduced sodium intake led to a clinically relevant reduction in systolic blood pressure (BP), with the benefits primarily attributed to sodium reduction. 

“[The findings] provide evidence of the efficacy of BP lowering through dietary change in people with T2D, including those treated with multiple antihypertensive and glucose-lowering medications,” the authors of the study wrote. “High adherence to the DASH4D lower sodium diet suggests that the diet is acceptable.”

This study was led by Scott J. Pilla, MD, MHS, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore. It was published online on June 9, 2025, in JAMA Internal Medicine.

This study was not powered sufficiently to detect individual effects of the DASH4D diet and sodium reduction. As a single-center study, the study population lacked diversity. Participant feeding was disrupted at multiple points owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

This study received funding from the Sheikh Khalifa Stroke Institute at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, grants from National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute grant, and the National Center for Advancing Translational Science Awards Program. Several authors reported receiving grants from sources including the funding agency and National Institutes of Health.

 June 16, 2025  

The most recent congress of the French association of healthcare professionals working in the prison service (ASPEP), held in Paris, revisited the issue of substance use disorders among incarcerated individuals.

For many years, drug use in prisons was met with ambiguity — or even outright denial — by authorities. The prison administration maintained the somewhat simplistic belief that because drug use is illegal, it could not exist in a system where the law is meant to prevail.

This perspective began to shift in the early 1980s, when concern over the transmission of HIV and hepatitis from injectable drug use prompted a more serious response. However, the focus at the time remained on controlling infectious disease risk rather than addressing addiction as a medical condition.

That era has since passed. Today, prison authorities — working alongside healthcare professionals — acknowledge the reality of both drug use and addiction within correctional settings.

A major step forward came in May 2024 with the publication of the first national statistical survey on substance use in French prisons: The ESSPRI study (Survey on Health and Substance Use in Prisons), led by the French Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (OFDT). The study reflects a growing commitment among the medical community to objectively assess and address substance use behind bars.

The survey was conducted between April and June 2023 and included approximately 1000 inmates aged 18 years or older. It assessed their use of psychoactive substances. The results — revisited at the March ASPEP congress — revealed significant levels of substance use:

By contrast, alcohol use within French prisons appears relatively low: Only 16% of inmates reported drinking alcohol while incarcerated. However, this is likely due to limited availability rather than a voluntary choice to abstain.

Based on its findings, the OFDT identified three broad patterns of substance use among inmates:

The OFDT called for health policies that reflect these actual patterns of use. In particular, they recommended that prevention and treatment strategies within prisons focus more specifically on tobacco and cannabis, which are the most widely used substances.

Across France, various initiatives have emerged to improve addiction care in correctional settings. However, program implementation remains fragmented, as most addiction services are organized independently by individual prison-based addiction treatment centers (known as CSAPAs). Despite this lack of coordination, some initiatives are particularly noteworthy.

At the Bois-d'Arcy remand center in Yvelines, for example, CSAPA staff have introduced “release kits” to support continuity of care for inmates with substance use disorders as they transition back into the community. This post-release period is a time of heightened vulnerability, marked by unstable living conditions and an increased risk of high-risk behaviors. In fact, post-release mortality — primarily due to suicide or overdose — is 3.6 times higher than during incarceration.

The release kits, developed collaboratively with inmates and grounded in harm-reduction principles, are available in three versions tailored to individual needs:

At Baumettes Prison in Marseille, France, the local CSAPA has developed a program focused on managing craving — the intense urge to use substances experienced by individuals with addiction.

Care is delivered through therapeutic workshops codesigned with inmates. These consist of four weekly group sessions facilitated by two healthcare professionals. Each group includes up to six participants and encourages open discussion of cravings and coping strategies, with a strong focus on shared experience and peer support.

“We explore how patients perceive their cravings and work to activate their psychosocial skills so they can draw on their own internal resources,” explained Camille Normandin, Elisa Carta, and Damien Mauillon during a presentation at the recent ASPEP congress.

The workshops provide education on the physiological mechanisms underlying craving, while also helping participants develop personalized relapse prevention strategies. Inmates are encouraged to identify their own high-risk situations and develop tailored solutions to avoid giving in to urges.

While pharmacologic substitution therapies are addressed, “the real focus is on empowering inmates to draw on their own experiences and insights,” emphasized the CSAPA team from Baumettes.

The ASPEP congress also served as a platform for healthcare professionals working in the prison system to call for better coordination of addiction services and, importantly, for more transparent and stable funding — which they described as inconsistent and difficult to track across facilities.

 June 16, 2025  

A new ultrasound-based treatment that destroys liver cancer tumours without surgery or radiation will be offered to NHS patients this summer in a European first.

The therapy, called histotripsy, is a noninvasive and nonthermal technique that uses focused sound waves to break down cancerous tissue. It causes minimal damage to surrounding organs and may be delivered in a single 30-minute session.

It is being hailed as a breakthrough by clinicians, patients, and academics.

Histotripsy works by generating high-amplitude, short ultrasound pulses via a platform known as the Edison System. These pulses create a ""bubble cloud"" from gases naturally present in targeted tissue. These bubbles form and collapse in microseconds, generating mechanical forces strong enough to destroy and liquefy targeted tumour tissue at cellular and subcellular levels.

The remnants are absorbed by the body within 1-2 months, leaving minimal scarring. 

Treatment can be used both for primary liver cancer and metastatic disease in the liver. The treating physician can monitor the bubble cloud continuously and observe the treatment effect in real time.

Animal research also suggests that the treatment may stimulate an immune response and induce abscopal effects, shrinkage of untreated tumours elsewhere in the body.

The technology was developed by ultrasound researchers at the University of Michigan and commercialised by US-based company HistoSonics.

Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting approved early access to the treatment under an unmet clinical need authorisation.

A joint announcement on 10 June from the Department of Health and Social Care and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency confirmed its authorisation for controlled early access use through the Innovative Devices Access Pathway (IDAP).

The government described the move as part of its “blitz on red tape” to support innovation in the NHS.

The first patients will receive histotripsy at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge this summer. The treatment is expected to reduce complications, shorten recovery time, and free up beds and surgical capacity. It will be available for both NHS and private patients.

The technology was procured and installed using a donation from the Li Ka Shing Foundation, which has a longstanding history of funding projects at the University of Cambridge.

Roland Sinker, chief executive of Cambridge University Hospitals, described histotripsy as “an exciting new technology that will make a huge difference to patients.”

According to Cancer Research UK, liver cancer is the 17th most common cancer in the UK. On average, over 6500 cases are diagnosed annually, and more than 5800 people die from the disease each year. 

Current treatment modes include surgery, chemotherapy, thermal ablation, targeted drugs, and radiotherapy.

Fiona Carey, co-chair of the Cambridge Cancer Research Hospital patient advisory group, who has advanced kidney cancer, said the announcement was ""seriously good news."" She added, “for patients for whom ordinary surgery is no longer an option, this could make all the difference.”

Histotripsy is also being explored as a potential treatment for other hard-to-reach cancers, including kidney and pancreatic tumours.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","‘Not accountable to anyone': As insurers issue denials, some patients run out of options","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250616/e28098Not-accountable-to-anyonee28099-As-insurers-issue-denials-some-patients-run-out-of-options.aspx","Mon, 16 Jun 2025 10:52:00 GMT","

By the time Eric Tennant was diagnosed in 2023 with a rare cancer of the bile ducts, the disease had spread to his bones. He weighed 97 pounds and wasn't expected to survive a year with stage 4 cancer.

Two years later, grueling rounds of chemotherapy have slowed the cancer's progress, even as it has continued to spread. But chemotherapy has also ravaged Tennant's body and his quality of life.

Recently, however, the 58-year-old had reason to hope things would improve. Last fall, his wife, Rebecca, learned of a relatively new, noninvasive procedure called histotripsy, which uses targeted ultrasound waves to destroy tumors in the liver. The treatment could extend his life and buy him more downtime between rounds of chemotherapy.

Early this year, Tennant's oncologist agreed he was a good candidate since the largest tumor in his body is in his liver. But that's when his family began fighting another adversary: their health insurer, which decided the treatment was ""not medically necessary,"" according to insurance paperwork.

Health insurers issue millions of denials every year. And like the Tennants, many patients find themselves stuck in a convoluted appeals process marked by long wait times, frustrating customer service encounters, and decisions by medical professionals they've never met who may lack relevant training.

Recent federal and state efforts, as well as changes undertaken by insurance companies themselves, have attempted to improve a 50-year-old system that disproportionately burdens some of the sickest patients at the worst times. And yet many doctors complain that insurance denials are worse than ever as the use of prior authorization has ramped up in recent years, reporting by KFF Health News and NBC News found.

When the Tennant family was told histotripsy would cost $50,000 and insurance wouldn't cover it, they appealed the denial four times.

""It's a big mess,"" said Rebecca Tennant, who described feeling like a pingpong ball, bouncing between the insurer and various health care companies involved in the appeals process.

""There's literally nothing we can do to get them to change,"" she said in an April interview with KFF Health News. ""They're, like, not accountable to anyone.""

While the killing of UnitedHealthcare chief executive Brian Thompson in December incited a fresh wave of public fury about denials, there is almost no hope of meaningful change on the horizon, said Jay Pickern, an assistant professor of health services administration at Auburn University.

""You would think the murder of a major health insurance CEO on the streets of New York in broad daylight would be a major watershed moment,"" Pickern said. Yet, once the news cycle died down, ""everything went back to the status quo.""

Back in West Virginia, Eric and Rebecca Tennant say they are realistic about Eric's prognosis.

They never expected histotripsy to cure his cancer. At best, the procedure could buy him more time and might allow him to take an extended break from chemotherapy. That makes it worth trying, they said.

As a safety instructor with the West Virginia Office of Miners' Health Safety and Training, Eric Tennant is a state employee and is insured by West Virginia's Public Employees Insurance Agency.

As the Tennants pleaded with the state insurance agency to cover histotripsy, they faced a list of other companies involved in the decision, including UMR, a UnitedHealthcare subsidiary that contracts with West Virginia to manage the public employee plans, and MES Peer Review Services, a Massachusetts company that upheld the insurer's decision in March, citing that histotripsy is ""unproven in this case and is not medically necessary.""

None of their appeals worked. After KFF Health News and NBC News reached out to West Virginia's Public Employees Insurance Agency with questions for this article, the agency changed its mind, explaining the insurer had consulted with medical experts to further evaluate the case.

""This decision reflects a rare and exceptional situation"" and does not represent a change in the Public Employees Insurance Agency's overall coverage policies,"" Director Brent Wolfingbarger said in a prepared statement to KFF Health News.

In a separate prepared statement, UnitedHealthcare spokesperson Eric Hausman said the company sympathizes with ""anyone navigating through life-threatening care decisions.""

""Currently, there is no evidence that histotripsy is as effective as alternative treatment options available,"" he said in late May, after the earlier insurance denials were reversed, ""and its impact on survival or cancer recurrence is unknown.""

MES Peer Review Services did not respond to a request for an interview.

Meanwhile, Rebecca Tennant worries it might be too late. She said her husband was first evaluated for histotripsy in February. But his health has recently taken a turn for the worse. In late May and early June, she said, he spent five days in the hospital after developing heart and lung complications.

Eric Tennant is no longer considered a viable candidate for histotripsy, his wife said, although the Tennants are hopeful that will change if his health improves. Scans scheduled for July will determine whether his cancer has continued to progress. Rebecca Tennant blames her husband's insurance plan for wasting months of their time.

""Time is precious,"" she said. ""They know he has stage 4 cancer, and it's almost like they don't care if he lives or dies.""

NBC News health and medical unit producer Jason Kane and correspondent Erin McLaughlin contributed to this report.

New results from a clinical trial reveal that a single dose of psilocybin-a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in mushrooms-can provide sustained reductions in depression and anxiety in individuals with cancer suffering from major depressive disorder. The findings are published by Wiley online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society.

People with cancer often struggle with depression. In this phase 2 trial, 28 patients with cancer and major depressive disorder received psychological support from a therapist prior to, during, and following a single 25-mg dose of psilocybin.

During clinical interviews conducted 2 years later, 15 (53.6%) patients demonstrated a significant reduction in depression, and 14 (50%) had sustained depression reduction as well as remission. Similarly, psilocybin reduced anxiety for 12 (42.9%) patients at 2 years.

An ongoing randomized, double-blind trial is currently evaluating up to two doses of 25 mg of psilocybin versus placebo as treatment for depression and anxiety in patients with cancer. This study is building on the single-dose study in an effort to bring a larger majority of the patients into remission of depression and anxiety.

One dose of psilocybin with psychological support to treat depression has a long-term positive impact on relieving depression for as much as 2 years for a substantial portion of patients with cancer, and we're exploring whether repeating the treatment resolves depression for more than half of the patients. If randomized testing shows similar results, this could lead to greater use of psilocybin to treat depression in patients with cancer.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Two existing medications work effectively together in treating alcohol use disorder","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250616/Two-existing-medications-work-effectively-together-in-treating-alcohol-use-disorder.aspx","Mon, 16 Jun 2025 12:41:00 GMT","

Two existing medications - one used for smoking cessation and the other for depression - appear to work effectively together in treating alcohol use disorder. The combination reduces alcohol cravings, lowers consumption, and may decrease the risk of nausea. These findings come from a new study led by the University of Gothenburg, Sweden.

Alcohol use disorder is a serious condition that can shorten the lives of those with severe forms of the disorder by 25 years or more. Yet, existing treatments are effective for only a small subset of patients.

The results are published in The Lancet Regional Health - Europe. The study was carried out in collaboration with researchers from Karolinska Institutet, Lund University, and Linköping University. It introduces a potential new treatment strategy: boosting dopamine levels in the brain.

The researchers based their approach on the hypothesis that a dopamine deficiency drives the craving for alcohol. They aimed to enhance dopamine signaling by combining varenicline, which stimulates dopamine release via nicotine receptors, with bupropion, which helps the brain maintain dopamine levels after release.

A total of 384 individuals with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder took part in the 13-week study. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups, receiving either the combination treatment, one of the two drugs alone, or a placebo. Neither the participants nor the researchers knew who received what during the trial.

Results showed the greatest reduction in alcohol consumption among those who received the combination therapy. Varenicline alone also produced a measurable effect. The outcomes were assessed using both blood biomarkers (B-PEth, which reflects long-term alcohol intake) and self-reported data.

One of the researchers behind the study is Bo Söderpalm, professor of psychiatry at the Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, and senior physician at Sahlgrenska University Hospital:

We observed approximately twice the effect compared to currently available medications, which is highly promising. However, additional studies are required before the combination treatment can be approved for alcohol use disorder.""

Bo Söderpalm, professor of psychiatry, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg

An important secondary finding was that the combination treatment caused less nausea, which is a known side effect of varenicline. Among those who did experience nausea, symptoms lasted for a shorter period of time, similar to what was observed in the placebo group.

Andrea de Bejczy, PhD researcher affiliated with the Sahlgrenska Academy and resident physician at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, played a central role in conducting the study:

""Nausea is a well-known and troublesome side effect of treatment with varenicline. It was surprising but very encouraging to see that nausea decreased when bupropion was added. The fact that the combination treatment is more tolerable for patients increases the chances that they will complete the full course of treatment,"" says Andrea de Bejczy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Indiana University researcher helps develop FDA-approved Alzheimer's test","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250616/Indiana-University-researcher-helps-develop-FDA-approved-Alzheimere28099s-test.aspx","Mon, 16 Jun 2025 12:02:00 GMT","

A first-of-its-kind blood test to detect amyloid plaques in the brain associated with Alzheimer's disease recently received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. An Indiana University School of Medicine researcher who helped lead the discovery and development of one of the biomarkers the test identifies hopes it will provide greater access and a more accurate diagnosis for patients.

The test received FDA clearance, which allows medical devices to be legally marketed in the U.S., on May 16. People 55 and older who exhibit signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease can now receive the test, which is more than 90% accurate in diagnosing the disease, through a blood draw ordered by their physician.

Jeff Dage, PhD, senior research professor of neurology at the IU School of Medicine, discovered nearly a decade ago that phosphorylated tau - a protein in the brain that is associated with Alzheimer's disease and gets filtered through the bloodstream - is a potential biomarker for Alzheimer's disease. Together with collaborators from the Mayo Clinic, Lund University in Sweden, the University of San Francisco and Columbia University, Dage worked to demonstrate the performance of the blood test across a wide population of patients.

The teams published landmark papers, from 2018 to 2020, establishing they had identified a useful blood-based test. Their results showed the test was 96% accurate in determining whether a patient had pathological evidence of disease - on par with FDA-cleared cerebrospinal fluid testing or PET scans.

The blood test measures the ratio of two proteins that are hallmark characteristics of Alzheimer's disease: phosphorylated tau (pTau217) and an amyloid protein (β-amyloid 1-42).

This offers a less invasive, more accessible and scalable method to identify Alzheimer's pathology early in the disease process. It opens the door to more efficient diagnosis, earlier interventions and broader participation in clinical trials, which is essential for advancing treatment.""

Jeff Dage, PhD, senior research professor of neurology, IU School of Medicine

According to the Alzheimer's Association, more than 7 million people in the U.S. are living with Alzheimer's disease, and that number is projected to rise to nearly 13 million in 2050.

For nearly 15 years, doctors detected amyloid plaques to diagnose Alzheimer's disease using positron emission tomography (PET) brain scans, and, in 2022, the FDA cleared collecting cerebrospinal fluid samples through lumbar punctures to detect plaques. Those methods, however, are more invasive, more expensive and less accessible for all types of patients.

""Now we can obtain more specific and accurate diagnoses of tens of thousands of patients and improve our understanding of the risk or protective factors specifically associated with Alzheimer's disease or non-Alzheimer's disease dementias,"" Dage said.

As the blood test is rolled out into the health care industry and doctors become more comfortable with its performance, Dage said it may provide earlier diagnoses for patients.

Dage, who joined the IU School of Medicine faculty in 2021 after more than 20 years as a scientist at Eli Lilly and Co., said developing an affordable and accessible blood test to aid in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is personal to him. He started his pursuit of a blood-based biomarker only a few years after walking through the steps of diagnosis as a caregiver for his mother, who passed away from complications of dementia in 2019.

""While the test is a major milestone, we must continue to refine it, expand its use and ensure it reaches those who need it most,"" Dage said. ""Above all, I'm grateful to the patients and families who have participated in our research - they are the true heroes of this story. I hope even more people will become excited about participating in research and even donate cerebrospinal fluid and blood so we can make the next discoveries.""

Biomarker research is an emerging facet of the IU School of Medicine's comprehensive Alzheimer's disease research program, which encompasses basic and translational research, drug discovery, testing new therapeutics and clinical research. 

Dage's expertise in biomarkers has supported multiple Alzheimer's disease research programs at the medical school, such as the Indiana Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, the Longitudinal Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease Study, the Target Enablement to Accelerate Therapy Development for Alzheimer's Disease center and the National Centralized Repository for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias.

Bruce Lamb, PhD, an IU Distinguished Professor and the executive director of the Stark Neurosciences Research Institute, said fluid biomarkers link the basic, translational and clinical research investigating Alzheimer's disease and related dementias at the IU School of Medicine.

""This program has allowed us to identify and validate biomarkers of disease in animal models, identify unique biomarkers linked to therapeutic targets, characterize novel fluid biomarkers in patient populations and clinical trials and implement biomarkers into the community,"" Lamb said.

SOLASCURE Ltd (SolasCure), a biotechnology company developing a novel treatment to transform chronic wound healing, today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track Designation for its investigational Aurase Wound Gel (AWG), in the treatment of patients with calciphylaxis ulcers. The designation recognizes the potential of AWG in the treatment of this new indication, widening its application in the healing of chronic wounds whilst expediting the speed at which the new therapy could be available to patients.

Calciphylaxis is a rare but serious condition involving the calcification of small blood vessels in the fat and skin tissues. It leads to blood clots, painful skin ulcers, and can progress to severe infections and sepsis. Although most commonly associated with end-stage renal disease, the condition can also occur in individuals with normal kidney function. With limited treatment options and a high one-year mortality rate, AWG offers an alternative debridement solution that potentially reduces the risk of infection and sepsis, opening up treatment options for patients previously considered too fragile to receive the current standard of care and improving outcomes in this vulnerable population.

AWG is a hydrogel releasing Tarumase, a recombinant enzyme originally isolated from medical maggots, which selectively targets fibrin, collagen and elastin in wounds to promote healing through debridement and wound bed preparation. It is currently in Phase II Clinical trials for the treatment of venous leg ulcers, having established proof-of-concept, a strong safety profile and pain-free application.

Given the unmet medical need and the poor outcomes for patients with calciphylaxis, the FDA's granting Fast Track Designation is a significant milestone. Not only does it reflect the promise of Aurase Wound Gel in the treatment of calciphylaxis ulcers, but it also adds a new indication, increasing its potential to help more patients, therefore opening up an even larger target market for SolasCure.""

Homelessness is increasing in pregnant and parenting people in Canada, posing health risks to children. Authors of a commentary in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.241623 argue it is a health crisis that needs urgent attention.

Housing is a basic life necessity for everyone. With rising numbers of pregnant and parenting people experiencing homelessness in Canada, more children are being put at risk of negative health outcomes. Adequate housing that interfaces with supportive health and mental health services is a fundamental first step to counter the effects of poverty, family fragmentation, and displacement for this vulnerable group.""

Drs. Nicole Racine and Stéphanie Manoni-Millar, University of Ottawa, and CHEO Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario

Recent data show that the number of people experiencing homelessness increased by 20% from 2018 to 2022, with 10% indicating they are part of a family. 

""The health and developmental implications of homelessness for infants and young children are profound,"" the authors write. It has been found that infants born to people experiencing homelessness have lower birth weights, higher risk of needing neonatal intensive care, and increased likelihood of infections and negative mental health and cognitive development.

They urge federal and provincial funding to provide access to safe and affordable housing with integrated services to support families, with support from municipal governments, social services and other providers. 

""Reducing service fragmentation by enhancing collaboration and communication between housing services, mental health and addiction services, and health services optimizes the continuity of service delivery. However, few services or programs currently have the capacity or funding to provide longer-term services to clients.""

New analysis of nearly 700,000 breast cancer cases reveals that statins may significantly improve patient outcomes, challenging earlier beliefs about their limited role in cancer care.

Study: Statin use and breast cancer-specific mortality and recurrence: a systematic review and meta-analysis including the role of immortal time bias and tumour characteristics. Image credit: Maria Sbytova/Shutterstock.com

A study published in Nature's British Journal of Cancer investigated the role of statins in breast cancer mortality and recurrence.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer and cause of cancer-related death in women. Older women, who are at higher risk, often have cardiovascular risk factors and are therefore prescribed medications to mitigate them, like statins for high blood lipids.

Prior research suggests that statins are associated with reduced breast cancer recurrence and mortality. However, the observed associations between breast cancer recurrence or mortality and risk factors could depend on certain factors, such as immortal time bias (ITB), estrogen receptor status, or cancer stage. These could have changed the size and direction of observed associations in past meta-analyses without adjustment.

ITB refers to periods during which an event like death could not have occurred but are incorrectly counted as part of the time a patient was exposed to treatment. For example, if a woman is prescribed statins after her breast cancer diagnosis, she must have survived until the prescription date, so including the time before the prescription as ‘statin use' would falsely inflate survival time. Additionally, the stage of cancer may influence how beneficial statins are.

The current paper is the first meta-analysis to systematically evaluate such effect modifiers. In addition to those already mentioned, it also evaluates the impact of the time of statin introduction (newly prescribed vs. already in use by the patient) and the type of statin.

Besides inhibiting a key enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, statins also affect the cell cycle, suppressing proliferation and inducing apoptosis. They also influence immune responses. Finally, the enzyme that they inhibit is overexpressed in breast cancers.

Animal and cell culture studies indicated the antitumor effect of statins. This prompted multiple observational studies and meta-analyses, most of which demonstrated that statins improve breast cancer prognosis.

The current study aimed to update these meta-analyses by including more recent or missed studies and adjusting for effect modifiers.

The analysis included 34 studies, including 689,990 women who had breast cancer. Of these, 21 and 20 focused on breast cancer death and recurrence as outcomes, respectively. Except for two studies, all studies adjusted for age-related differences in mortality.

Most studies adjusted for cancer stage and the presence of other medical conditions, but only about half adjusted for the use of different medications. Follow-up periods of up to five years and 5-10 years were reported for 16 and 14 studies, respectively.

While 27 studies were assessed as not being subject to ITB and 27 examined statin use after breast cancer diagnosis, five considered its use prior to the diagnosis, and two included both periods. Lipophilic and hydrophilic statins were considered separately in 14 studies. Five studies stratified patients by cancer stage, but 21 included only early-stage patients. Most studies were retrospective cohort studies, with only five prospective in design.

The results demonstrate that statin use was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer death by about 20%. Similar effects were found for recurrence.

Lipophilic statins had a more protective effect than hydrophilic statins against death but not recurrence, a finding that echoes preclinical studies demonstrating the anti-proliferative effects of statins on breast cancer cells.

Differences in outcomes by subgroup were not statistically significant. This contradicts earlier studies that, for instance, suggest that statins may be more effective in advanced breast cancer. Notably, the current study had only a few studies that included advanced-stage patients, two of which showed a protective effect in early-stage patients. Future studies are required to validate this finding.

There was a suggestion of a more protective association in studies with ITB for breast cancer recurrence, but overall, ITB did not appear to significantly bias the main pooled estimates. Similarly, the association for recurrence appeared stronger in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) patients, consistent with prior findings.

Small studies reported significant reductions in breast cancer recurrence risk with statins, the “small study effect.” This is mainly due to a few outlier studies that showed substantial protective effects associated with statin use. However, funnel plot analysis and Egger's test were used to assess publication bias, and a trim and fill analysis showed that the protective association remained significant even after accounting for potential bias. Statin use appeared to protect against breast cancer recurrence by an estimated 24%.

“Statin use, particularly lipophilic statin use, was associated with favorable outcomes for BCD and BCR.” The current study agrees with almost all prior analyses on the protective effects of statins on breast cancer mortality and recurrence rates.

This is the first meta-analysis to comprehensively assess effect modifiers such as ITB and the timing of post-diagnostic statin use. There was no significant difference in association with either outcome in studies at risk of ITB compared to those not at risk. Similarly, statin use that was initiated after breast cancer diagnosis was not significantly associated with reductions in death or recurrence rates. However, it only narrowly missed the threshold for significance in the case of recurrence.

The wide variation in methodology, study criteria, and outcomes between studies makes it challenging to understand whether the protective effects are due to statins or other factors acting independently or combined with statin use, such as cardiovascular disease, which predicts higher mortality.  Further research is required to identify specific subgroups of patients that may benefit from statins as adjuvants to cancer treatment.

Various reports have linked loneliness to premature death, with some - including the U.S. Surgeon General - suggesting that loneliness is as harmful to one's health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. 

However, a new international study led by researchers at the University of Waterloo's School of Public Health Sciences has found that while loneliness is common among older adults receiving home care, it is not associated with an increased risk of death.

The researchers analyzed data from more than 380,000 home care recipients aged 65 and older in Canada, Finland and New Zealand. Using standardized assessments and survival analysis, they found that lonely individuals had a lower risk of dying within one year compared to their non-lonely counterparts after adjusting for health conditions, age and other risk factors.

Our findings suggest that loneliness may not independently increase the risk of death after controlling for other health risk factors among older adults in home care. This contradicts much of the existing literature based on the general population.""

Dr. Bonaventure Egbujie, study's lead author, professor in Waterloo's School of Public Health Sciences

Loneliness prevalence - defined as the number of people per 100 who report feeling lonely - ranged from 15.9 per cent of home care recipients in Canada to 24.4 per cent in New Zealand. Interestingly, people in better physical shape and who got less help from family or friends were likelier to feel lonely, suggesting a complex link between health status, caregiving needs, and social connection.

The study urges policymakers and health-care providers to treat loneliness as a quality-of-life issue rather than focusing solely on its potential link to mortality.

""Loneliness is a serious threat to psychological well-being. The mental health consequences of loneliness make it an important priority for public health, even if loneliness doesn't kill you,"" said the study's senior author, Dr. John Hirdes, a professor in Waterloo's School of Public Health Science. 

""Home and community care services must play a protective role by supporting social contact for isolated people.""

The authors call for longer-term studies to better understand the causal relationship between loneliness and health outcomes and to explore how cultural and care system differences influence these dynamics.

The study, Cross-National Evidence on Risk of Death Associated with Loneliness: A Survival Analysis of 1-Year All-Cause Mortality among Older Adult Home Care Recipients in Canada, Finland, and Aotearoa in New Zealand, was recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Directors Association.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Health care employment rebounds after the pandemic but staffing gaps remain","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250615/Health-care-employment-rebounds-after-the-pandemic-but-staffing-gaps-remain.aspx","Mon, 16 Jun 2025 02:31:00 GMT","

The U.S. health care workforce has bounced back from the massive job losses of early 2020, with employment now matching pre-pandemic projections, according to new research from the University of Michigan.

The recovery, however, is uneven with some health care settings thriving while others continue to struggle with severe staffing shortages.

For example, while doctors' offices have exceeded pre-pandemic employment growth trends since 2023, skilled nursing facilities and intensive behavioral health centers are still dealing with widespread staffing shortages that began during the pandemic.

The study, led by School of Public Health researcher Thuy Nguyen and detailed in a research letter published in JAMA, captured staffing comparisons by analyzing employment data from 2016 through 2024 to track health care sectors' recovery from the pandemic's impact.

One of the most striking findings involves mental health services. Office-based behavioral health practitioners such as therapists and counselors working in private practice settings saw their employment numbers skyrocket by 84% from 2019 to 2024. Meanwhile, intensive behavioral health facilities that provide more comprehensive mental health and substance abuse treatment have struggled to rebuild their workforce.

The findings on behavioral health practitioners are significant and can guide policy changes in response to the rise of office-based practitioners amid a prolonged shortage in more intensive care settings that began during the pandemic.”

Thuy Nguyen, U-M assistant professor of health management and policy

The research points to several factors that may explain why some health care settings recovered better than others. Office-based practices may have been seen as lower-risk environments for COVID-19 transmission and offered less stressful working conditions compared to hospitals and nursing homes. The growth in demand for office-based mental health services through traditional and telehealth platforms likely contributed to the expansion of office-based mental health services.

“For patients and families, these employment patterns have real-world implications,” said study co-author Kosali Simon, the Herman B. Wells Endowed Professor in Health Economics at Indiana University. “The continued staffing challenges in nursing homes and intensive mental health facilities could affect access to care and quality of services in these critical health care settings.”

Health care employment dropped by nearly 7% in the second quarter 2020 due to pandemic-related shutdowns. By 2024, however, health care jobs had bounced back to pre-pandemic levels, reaching over 24 million jobs as of September last year. By comparison, nonhealth care employment fell more dramatically—more than 11%—and has been slower to recover, remaining at 3% below expected levels in 2024.

The research used data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and compared actual employment numbers to what would have been expected if pre-pandemic trends had continued uninterrupted.

The latest research on the pandemic and health care employment builds on Nguyen's previous work, which first identified that nursing homes were among the hardest hit by health care employment declines during the pandemic. Her earlier 2023 study found that long-term care facilities were still operating with staffing levels more than 10% below pre-pandemic numbers.

Co-authors include Christopher Whaley of Brown University School of Public Health and Jonathan Cantor of RAND.

But as the body ages, the activity of brown adipose tissue decreases. This inactivation of brown adipose tissue — also typical of obese people — remains poorly studied in the scientific literature.

Now, a study by the University of Barcelona has identified, for the first time, a molecule that represses the activity of brown adipose tissue. The paper opens new paths to understand why and how the inactivation of this key tissue for metabolizing fat in the body takes place, and especially to determine wether this repressor function can be reversed and help design strategies for the treatment of obesity and cardiometabolic diseases.

The study, published in Molecular Metabolism, is led by Professor Francesc Villarroya, from the UB's Faculty of Biology and the UB Institute of Biomedicine (IBUB) — headquartered at the Barcelona Science Park (PCB) —, Sant Joan de Déu Research Institute (IRSJD) and the CIBER area for Pathophysiology of Obesity (CIBEROBN). The article is the core of the research of the doctoral thesis of the expert Albert Blasco Roset, first author of the paper and doctoral student at the UB.

There are two types of adipose tissue in the body: white adipose tissue (it stores energy in the form of lipids) and brown adipose tissue (the main heat-generating organ in the body through thermogenesis).

Although the problem is to know what reduces the activity of brown fat, until now, research has focused on identifying the factors that activate its function in the organism, but not the factors with a repressive function.""

Francesc Villarroya, member of the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine at the Faculty of Biology

""As a result, it was generally assumed that the low activity of brown fat in ageing and obesity could be explained by the fact that its activators do not work properly"".

The new study, conducted in animal models, describes a repressor factor that blocks brown fat activity: the ACBP protein. Under normal conditions, this protein would regulate when brown fat activity is not needed (e.g. in a warm environment). However, this molecule would also be involved in ageing and in the pathological blocking of brown adipose tissue that leads to obesity.

The ACBP protein's control activity reveals further biomedical implications in the fight against diseases such as cancer. ""In some cancers, brown adipose tissue becomes pathologically overactive and causes uncontrolled metabolic energy expenditure, leading to cachexia (extreme malnutrition and muscle wasting). In this case, the function of the ACBP protein as a repressor factor could become a therapeutic tool of interest in cancer patients"", says Villarroya.

In another context, it is also known that global warming caused by climate change is contributing to rising obesity rates, as an increasingly warmer environment leads to inactive brown adipose tissue. ""An excess action of the ACBP protein blocking the activity of brown fat would be the molecular basis of this phenomenon. Once this factor has been identified, we can design intervention tools to promote a healthier lifestyle"", concludes the researcher.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Machine learning identifies key lifestyle factors for healthy brain function","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250616/Machine-learning-identifies-key-lifestyle-factors-for-healthy-brain-function.aspx","Mon, 16 Jun 2025 12:51:00 GMT","

A new study offers insight into the health and lifestyle indicators - including diet, physical activity and weight - that align most closely with healthy brain function across the lifespan. The study used machine learning to determine which variables best predicted a person's ability to quickly complete a task without becoming distracted.

Reported in The Journal of Nutrition, the study found that age, blood pressure and body mass index were the strongest predictors of success on a test called the flanker task, which requires participants to focus on a central object without becoming distracted by flanking information.

Diet and exercise also played a smaller but relevant role in performance on the test, the team found, sometimes appearing to offset the ill effects of a high BMI or other potentially detrimental factors.

""This study used machine learning to evaluate a host of variables at once to help identify those that align most closely with cognitive performance,"" said Naiman Khan, a professor of health and kinesiology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who led the work with kinesiology Ph.D. student Shreya Verma. ""Standard statistical approaches cannot embrace this level of complexity all at once.""

To build the model, the team used data collected from 374 adults 19 to 82 years of age. The data included participant demographics, such as age, BMI, blood pressure and physical activity levels, along with dietary patterns and performance on a flanker test that measured their processing speed and accuracy in determining the orientation of a central arrow flanked by other arrows that pointed in the same or opposite direction.

""This is a well-established measure of cognitive function that assesses attention and inhibitory control,"" Khan said.

Previous studies have found that several factors are implicated in the preservation of cognitive function across the lifespan, Khan said.

Adherence to the healthy eating index, a measure of diet quality, has been linked to superior executive function and processing speed in older adults. Other studies have found that diets that are rich in antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamins are associated with better cognitive function.""

Naiman Khan, professor of health and kinesiology, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign

The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, or DASH diet, the Mediterranean diet, and a diet that combines the two, called the MIND diet, all ""have been linked to protective effects against cognitive decline and dementia,"" the researchers wrote. Physical factors, such as BMI and blood pressure, along with increased physical activity also are strong predictors of cognitive health, or decline, in aging.

""Clearly, cognitive health is driven by a host of factors, but which ones are most important?"" Verma said. ""We wanted to evaluate the relative strength of each of these factors in combination with all the others.""

Machine learning ""offers a promising avenue for analyzing large datasets with multiple variables and identifying patterns that may not be apparent through conventional statistical approaches,"" the researchers wrote.

The team tested various machine learning algorithms to see which one best weighed the various factors to predict the speed of accurate responses in the flanker test. The researchers tested the predictive ability of each algorithm, using a variety of approaches to validate those that appeared to perform the best.

They found that age was the most influential predictor of performance on the test, followed by diastolic blood pressure, BMI and systolic blood pressure. Adherence to the healthy eating index was less predictive of cognitive performance than blood pressure or BMI but also correlated with better performance on the test.

""Physical activity emerged as a moderate predictor of reaction time, with results suggesting it may interact with other lifestyle factors, such as diet and body weight, to influence cognitive performance,"" Khan said.

""This study reveals how machine learning can bring precision and nuance to the field of nutritional neuroscience,"" he said. ""By moving beyond traditional approaches, machine learning could help tailor strategies for aging populations, individuals with metabolic risks or those seeking to enhance cognitive function through lifestyle changes.""

The Personalized Nutrition Initiative and National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the U. of I. supported this research.

Khan is a dietitian and an affiliate faculty member of the Division of Nutritional Sciences, the Neuroscience Program and the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at Illinois.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Video consultations match physical visits for surgical preparation","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250616/Video-consultations-match-physical-visits-for-surgical-preparation.aspx","Mon, 16 Jun 2025 11:36:00 GMT","

A video consultation between patient and surgeon is just as good as a physical visit to the outpatient clinic to discuss a major operation. This is evident from research by Amsterdam UMC, demonstrated that a video consultation is just as good as a physical consultation in terms of information uptake. Alongside this finding, patients save an average of two hours of travel time and waiting time per consultation, incur no costs for travel and parking, and reduce their ecological footprint. The CO₂ emissions of a video consultation are 99 percent lower than those of a physical hospital visit. The results were published today in The Lancet Digital Health. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Amsterdam UMC's, as with many other hospitals, video consultation infrastructure was quickly scaled up allowing consultations to continue to take place. Nevertheless, after the pandemic, many healthcare providers were still reluctant to make use of the digital tool, perhaps due to unfamiliarity or doubts about its effectiveness. 

Researchers at Amsterdam UMC wanted to know whether a video consultation works just as well as a physical conversation when preparing for major abdominal surgery. ""Do patients receive the same amount of information? Do they feel just as well helped? Does it work for all ages and digital skills? And how do surgeons experience it?"" summarizes PhD candidate at Amsterdam UMC, Britte ten Haaft. 

The outcome of the ""VIDEOGO"" trial leaves no doubt: a video consultation with the surgeon is just as good as a physical outpatient visit. The study involved 112 patients in two Dutch hospitals. Participants were divided in two groups, with half taking part in a video consultation and the others in physical conversation. 

Despite the change in setting, the researchers saw the same amount of information absorption, equal satisfaction among both patient and healthcare provider and a lot of extra benefits for the patient. An average of two hours less time per consultation, for example (including travel time and waiting time), but also savings on travel costs and parking and less dependence on a companion. 

There are also important social benefits. The CO₂ emissions of a video consultation are 99 percent lower than those of a physical visit. Moreover, it increases the accessibility of care, emphasizes ten Haaft: ""For patients with a long travel time or without travel guidance, a physical consultation can be a considerable barrier. Moreover, the healthcare sector is responsible for 7 percent of total CO₂ emissions in the Netherlands-so let's use video calling where possible."" 

Professor of Surgery Marc Besselink also sees practical advantages: ""Many patients enjoyed processing the explanation at home, in a familiar environment and with family present. Discussing a CT scan or surgery image also went well online."" 

Professor of Digital Health Marlies Schijven is just as enthusiastic: ""A fantastic expansion of the contact options with patients. It is important for healthcare providers to know that they can safely offer patients a video consultation, with all the benefits that come with it. In practice, this works as follows: patients indicate their preference for a physical appointment or a video consultation, the healthcare provider includes this in the file and acts accordingly if possible. A great step towards future-proof healthcare."" 

The research was carried out at the surgery outpatient clinics of Amsterdam UMC and Catharina Hospital and funded by ZonMw from the Citrine programme Towards Regional Oncology Networks 2019-2022.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","USMNT manager's pointed words for Christian Pulisic over Gold Cup controversy","https://nypost.com/2025/06/15/sports/usmnt-managers-pointed-words-for-christian-pulisic-over-gold-cup-controversy/","Mon, 16 Jun 2025 02:00:00 GMT","

U.S. Men's National Team boss Mauricio Pochettino isn't letting a single player “dictate the plan” he has for the American squad, even if that player is Christian Pulisic. 

The ongoing controversy surrounding Pulisic's absence from the squad after deciding not to play in this summer's Gold Cup has been the focal point of American soccer. 

It's led to a number of former USMNT players, most notably Landon Donovan, to criticise Pulisic, who has said he's taking a step back after a grueling season with his club team, AC Milan.

Pulisic added to the controversy when he appeared on CBS Sports Golazo Network last week and revealed that he had wanted to play in a pair of exhibition matches before the Gold Cup, but Pochettino declined the request, wanting to play the same squad all summer. 

The American soccer star said he had understood that it was a “coach's decision” and that “I fully respect that,” but Pulisic added that he “didn't understand it.” 

That didn't seem to bother Pochettino. 

“Players don't need to understand,” Pochettino said, according to Fox Sports. “Players need to listen and to stick with our plan. They cannot dictate the plan.

“He explained why he only wanted to be involved in two games and not the Gold Cup, and I respect that. I understand him. But I do need that he understands our decision. When I signed my contract with the [U.S. Soccer] Federation, I am the head coach. I am not a mannequin.”

The dynamic between the new USMNT head coach and one of the biggest stars on the team in Pulisic has added to the already concerning issues surrounding the program as it prepares for the World Cup next year and continues to struggle on the pitch more recently. 

A loss to Switzerland last week sent the US into the Gold Cup on a down note, but it rebounded by beating Trinidad and Tobago 5-0 in its group stage opener on Sunday. 

Pulisic had noted in his interview that he had only had one conversation with Pochettino, but the coach brushed that aside, asserting that he tries to maintain the same level of communication with all his players. 

“I love to be in communication with my players,” he said. “I love to communicate, but at the same time, I want to [ensure] that all the players feel the same respect from the coaching staff and from myself.”

The United States began its 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup campaign with a 5-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago to start the tournament on a high note before things really ramp up for next summer's FIFA World Cup. 

The win at PayPal Park in San Jose, California, snapped a four-game losing streak for Mauricio Pochettino's side. Malik Tillman had two goals in the win, and the USMNT will now turn its attention to Thursday's showdown against Saudi Arabia in Austin, Texas.

SAN JOSE, Calif. (June 15, 2025) - Seeking an eighth Concacaf Gold Cup trophy, the United States Men's National Team kicked off its 2025 campaign on a resounding high note Sunday afternoon, winning the first match of group play with a 5-0 victory against Trinidad and Tobago at PayPal Park in San Jose, Calif., behind an energetic team performance that will build momentum into the next two group stage matches.

Like Mauricio Pochettino's lineups for the June friendlies, tonight's starting XI was relatively inexperienced in global competition. The lineup Sunday averaged 15 caps and seven in official competition. Leading the group was the oldest and most capped player, Tim Ream. The 37-year-old was the only U.S. starter with previous Gold Cup experience, and the reliable defender captained the side.

The team's Gold Cup opener Sunday marked significant milestones for several players in the starting XI. Midfielder Sebastian Berhalter, defender Alex Freeman and goalkeeper Matt Freese all earned their first caps in official competition. Midfielder Jack McGlynn also collected his first start in official competition. Every player in the starting XI besides Ream made their Gold Cup debuts.

Trinidad and Tobago began the match sitting in a deep block, which allowed the United States to control possession and play some exciting soccer. Malik Tillman, making his first competitive start since the Concacaf Nations League semifinal in 2024, was especially effective distributing from the middle channel of the field. His lovely one-touch pass into space for Patrick Agyemang led to the first shot attempt of the match. Moments later, the midfielder was part of a beautiful combination that eventually led to a disciplined, one-touch strike from Sebastian Berhalter that was on frame but deflected out-of-bounds for a U.S. corner kick.

Agyemang would have another good look at goal in the 12th minute. After the U.S. shifted the ball side-to-side, Max Arfsten got wide and made a nifty stepover move before sending a scintillating ball into the box. Agyemang nodded a fierce header toward the far post, but it bounced just wide.

After having their way in the opening minutes, the Americans found the finishing touch for the first goal of the match. Agyemang won the ball deep in the Americans' attacking third and played it ahead to McGlynn to his right. With Trinidad and Tobago disorganized, the winger located an unmarked Tillman toward the far post. Tillman controlled the cross and finished it off with his right foot for his first international goal to put the United States ahead in the 16th minute.

The United States would've scored a second goal earlier if not for the heroics of Trinidad and Tobago's goalkeeper Marvin Phillip, including a diving save on Arfsten's right-footed shot taken from the center of the box. In the 25th minute, McGlynn played a terrific 40-yard ball across the field on a rope to Diego Luna. With space, the native of nearby Sunnyvale, Calif. took a good first touch, but Phillip won the battle, leaving his line swiftly to block Luna's attempted chip. Again, in the 36th minute, after a hard foul gave the United States a free kick, Phillip stopped Alex Freeman's header from McGlynn's left-footed service.

Tillman would make it 2-0 for the United States in the 41st minute after the Americans capitalized on a mistake from Trinidad and Tobago. Alvin Jones attempted to get out of pressure with a pass back to his goalkeeper, but he didn't see Luna in the area. The 21-year-old midfielder anticipated the pass perfectly, using his speed to regain possession for the United States. On the breakaway, Luna sent a rolling ball along the six-yard box line to Tillman, making a dead sprint into the box, who hammered it home to record a first-half brace.

Luna, showing his relentless work rate all throughout the first half, would soon record his second assist in three minutes.Tillman played a long ball out of the USA's defensive half deep into space for Luna, and the midfielder, fresh off assisting Tillman's second goal, decided to take it himself this time. He eluded his defender on the dribble inside the box and struck a low ball with his right foot that deflected off Agyemang and found the back of the net, and the USA led 3-0 heading into the halftime break.

Playing with a three-goal lead did not mean the United States would sit back in the second half. In the 50th minute, McGlynn nearly capitalized following a cross from Arfsten. Moments later, Agyemang used his physicality and speed to create a chance for himself, a smashing strike that required a push over the crossbar from Philip, his fifth of six saves on the day.

Trinidad and Tobago nearly got on the scoresheet in the 58th minute when Tyrese Spicer dribbled into dangerous territory and took a shot that was headed toward goal. The play called Matt Freese into action, and the United States goalkeeper, making just his second career appearance, came up with a crucial touch to preserve his clean sheet. Other than that play, and a flurry in the USA's defensive half in the 36th minute, Trinidad and Tobago never tested the United States, and the Americans piled up a 21-3 shot advantage.

Pochettino sent on subs for three of the match's biggest contributors. Haji Wright, Brenden Aaronson, and Mark McKenzie replaced Agyemang, Luna, and McGlynn.

Those substitutes added two more goals for the United States late in the match. Making a run, Aaronson received the ball at the end line and made a decisive cut with the outside of his right foot to set up his shot. The midfielder hit the ball hard to secure his ninth career goal, his first goal in almost two years for the United States, in the 82nd minute.

Just two minutes later, Wright added a goal of his own. Receiving the ball from Arfsten, Wright carried the ball into the center of the pitch, finding space with his speed and fresh legs. Putting the ball on his right foot, he curled the ball into the side netting for the fifth goal of the day as the United States ran up the score to 5-0.

The win places the United States solely atop Group D for the moment, with Saudi Arabia and Haiti set to face off later Sunday night. The outcome follows Saturday's tournament opener, where defending Gold Cup champion Mexico beat Dominican Republic 3-2 at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif.

The United States will carry the momentum from Sunday's win to Texas for their remaining group stages matches. The team will next face guest side Saudi Arabia on Thursday, June 19 at Q2 Stadium in Austin, Texas (9:15 p.m. ET; FS1, TUDN, ViX, FDP Radio) and conclude group play Sunday, June 22 against Haiti at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas (7 p.m. ET; FOX, TUDN, ViX, FDP Radio). 

USA – MALIK TILLMAN (JACK MCGLYNN), 16th minute: Following two shot attempts of his own, Patrick Agyemang produced a takeaway that ignited a quick United States counter. Agyemang sent the ball ahead to Jack McGlynn, who crossed the ball far post to Malik Tillman. The midfielder brought it down and put it away for his first international goal. USA 1, TRI 0

USA – MALIK TILLMAN (DIEGO LUNA), 41st minute: Diego Luna took advantage of a costly mistake from Trinidad and Tobago when he intercepted a pass back to the goalkeeper. Luna took possession and slid a rolling pass across the face of the goal for Tillman, sprinting into the box. The midfielder finished it off to record his second international goal and first brace. USA 2, TRI 0

USA – PATRICK AGYEMANG (DIEGO LUNA), 44th minute: Fresh off assisting Tillman's second goal, Luna tallied one more. Receiving a long ball up into space on the left side of the pitch, Luna carried the ball and beat his defender one-on-one. Luna's shot deflected off Agyemang and into the back of the net. USA 3, TRI 0

USA – BRENDEN AARONSON (MAX ARFSTEN), 82nd minute: Moments after entering the match as a substitute, Brenden Aaronson received a pass from Max Arfsten near the end line. Aaronson beat his defender one-on-one and delivered a right-footed shot near post to extend the lead for the United States. USA 4, TRI 0

USA – HAJI WRIGHT (MAX ARFSTEN), 84th minute: Max Arfsten found success working the right side of the pitch. Just after assisting Aaronson's goal, he found Wright making a run on the right side. Wright did the rest, beating his defender and carrying the ball centrally to set up his curling shot into the upper right corner of the net. USA 5, TRI 0 FINAL.

SAN JOSE, Calif. — The surprise on Chris Richards' face said it all.

Told following the U.S. men's national team's resounding 5-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago on Sunday that three-year veteran Malik Tillman had scored his first two goals for the USMNT, Richards couldn't believe it.

""I had no idea,"" said the U.S. center back. ""Malik, to be fair, he doesn't speak that much, so I wouldn't have known that. But that's crazy.""

Tillman earned the first of his 20 international caps in 2022. One of the final cuts from the USMNT's 2022 World Cup roster, the German-born Bayern Munich product is coming off a career season with PSV Eindhoven, which he helped win the last two Dutch titles and advance to the knockout stage of the UEFA Champions League in consecutive seasons.

Despite missing a chunk of the 2024-25 campaign because of injury, he still managed to score 16 goals in 34 appearances for PSV last term. Still, he'd never found the net at international level until Sunday.

With most of the Americans' top stars — Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Antonee ""Jedi"" Robinson and Tim Weah among them — missing for various reasons this summer, this Gold Cup and the two tuneups before it represent an opportunity for others to make their mark. 

Tillman, who manned an attacking midfield role for coach Mauricio Pochettino against the Soca Warriors, has made the most of his opportunity so far. He was the best U.S. player in last weekend's 2-1 loss to Türkiye. On Sunday, he was even better — with the goals to show for it. The 23-year-old opened the scoring for the hosts 16 minutes in, then doubled his team's lead before halftime.

""I've been waiting for this moment for a long time,"" Tillman, his voice barely above a whisper as always, said after earning Man of the Match honors. ""A lot of people have been waiting as well.""

Given his pedigree, Tillman's quality has never been in doubt. But until Sunday, he had struggled to duplicate his form for PSV with the national team — in part because his path to logging regular minutes was blocked. Now, with fellow attackers like Pulisic, Weah and Gio Reyna absent, he has his first real chance to occupy a significant role at the international level.

The payoff has been a long time coming, both for Tillman and the USMNT 

""I understand him better now,"" said Pochettino, who replaced former coach Gregg Berhalter last September. ""October, November, when we met for the first time, I think it was difficult to create this relationship that the player needs, and the coach needs, to trust each other,"" Pochettino said. ""That is about time. Now, after a few weeks together, I really start to understand him, and he starts to understand us. 

""He's a fantastic kid,"" the former Chelsea, Tottenham and Paris Saint-Germain manager continued. ""He's a talented player, one of the most talented players I think that we have in the USA.""

Tillman wasn't the only player to stand out against T&T. Diego Luna assisted on Tillman's second goal, then set up the Americans' third when his low shot hit striker Patrick Agyemang and then the back of the net. Luca de la Torre, who made the U.S. roster for the last World Cup but didn't play in Qatar, bossed the midfield alongside newcomer Sebastian Berhalter. With two late helpers, fullback Max Arfsten rebounded from a poor performance in last week's 4-0 loss to Switzerland. Haji Wright, another 2022 vet, scored the Americans' fifth on Sunday in clinical fashion.

The victory simultaneously snapped a four-match losing skid and set the U.S. up well for its final two group games, against guest team Saudi Arabia and Haiti. (The Saudis beat the Haitians 1-0 in Sunday's nightcap).

""That is only one victory,"" Pochettino said. ""Now we need to see the next one.""

With the 2026 World Cup on home soil now less than a year away, the opportunity isn't lost on his players.

""It's the last tournament that we have before the World Cup,"" Tillman said. ""So it's very important for us to show ourselves, to show that we are still there, that we're still a good team, even though some players are not here.""

Nobody boosted their stock on Sunday as much as Tillman, who is finally beginning to show U.S. fans and players alike his personality, both on and off the field.

""From the outside, he's very quiet. But then once you get to know him he's a teddy bear,"" said Richards of Tillman, who he's known since both were playing in Bayern's reserve squad six years ago.

""When I first met him he didn't speak any English, and now he's playing for the national team,"" Richards added. ""It's really amazing to not just see him develop as a player, but as a person. And he fully deserved two goals today. 

""He's a baller.""

SAN JOSE, Calif. – The USMNT regained its footing with a much-needed win over Trinidad and Tobago, led by standout performances from Malik Tillman and Diego Luna.

Tillman scored twice and Luna dealt out two assists in the first half, setting up a 3-0 lead that allowed the U.S. to coast to the finish line.

The win ended a four-game slide for the USMNT, the worst stretch for the program in nearly two decades.

The offensive fireworks started early and often.

The U.S. looked to open scoring three separate times in the first 15 minutes. They finally broke through in the 16th as Jack McGlynn assisted Tillman on the left side of the six-yard box.

In the 25th minute, Luna put a shot on target, but goalkeeper Marvin Phillip was able to get his gloves on it. After a few more threatening chances, Luna set up Tillman on the break for an easy brace-securing goal.

He wasn't done there, though.

Just minutes later, Luna came barreling down the left side again. After showing off his footwork, Luna called his own number but his low shot was redirected by Patrick Agyemang at the top of the box.

With two assists in three minutes, Luna was the driving force in increasing the USMNT's lead from one to three.

With a 3-0 lead and little contention from Trinidad and Tobago, the second half sped by.

Brenden Aaronson and Haji Wright found the back of the net in the 82nd and 84th minutes to increase the lead to 5-0.

The U.S. finished with 21 shots (11 on goal), 10 corner kicks, a 70/30 possession advantage, and goalkeeper Matthew Freese saved T&T's two shots on target.

Up next for the USMNT will be Saudi Arabia on Thursday, June 19. Kickoff is scheduled for 7:15 p.m. (MT).

Following an impressive U.S. youth career, Luna made his senior debut in January 2024. He has played in four games with two assists since then.

The most recent appearance, in the CONCACAF Nations League, marked an important moment in Luna's national career. With an assist and a late near-equalizer, the RSL star was a consensus top performer for the USA.

Mauricio Pochettino gives his thoughts after the USMNT's 5-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago in the Concacaf Gold Cup (0:31)

SAN JOSE, Calif. -- After a turbulent run-up to this summer's Gold Cup, the U.S. men's national team can breathe again.

In the throes of a four-game home losing streak under new-ish manager Mauricio Pochettino, the U.S. began the Gold Cup on Sunday with a resounding 5-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago. The scoreline was by no means a fluke, either. The U.S. dominated from start to finish, getting a pair of goals from Malik Tillman and another from Patrick Agyemang when he deflected in Diego Luna's goal-bound effort. Substitutes Brenden Aaronson and Haji Wright rounded out the scoring in the final 10 minutes, padding the USMNT's goal differential in the process.

It made for the kind of comfortable win that seemed beyond this group of players just last Tuesday following its 4-0 humbling against Switzerland. But the funk surrounding the USMNT went deeper than that result.

Just how low had the U.S. sunk? It hadn't lost four consecutive games at home since 1988, when it dropped two games each to Chile and Ecuador. That was at the tail end of a 40-year barren spell between World Cup appearances. The latest streak also involved almost the whole U.S. player pool from stars to second-teamers. It couldn't entirely be blamed on youth.

Then there was the off-field drama. Among the dominant storylines surrounding the side was Christian Pulisic's decision to take the summer off and not play in the Gold Cup, which resulted in a chorus of criticism from fans as well as former U.S. internationals such as Landon Donovan.

Pulisic's father, Mark, then came to his son's defense with the help of ChatGPT. That was followed by Pulisic saying he didn't understand the decision to turn down his offer to play in two friendlies and bypass the Gold Cup, to which Pochettino reminded the sometime U.S. captain that the manager is the one in charge, not the players.

The only way for the U.S. team to change the conversation was by winning. It didn't really matter that the victory came over the 100th-ranked team in the world -- one shorn of key forward Levi García who, in an only-in-Concacaf move, picked this weekend to get married. (He'll be back for T&T's remaining games.) This youthful side, with seven starters having fewer than seven caps entering the match, needed to start building a foundation somehow, and it did precisely that.

""I think [Sunday's win] is about [congratulating] them, and I think the first half there's a lot of positive things, that we need to keep evolving in different areas,"" Pochettino said. ""But I think overall it was a good game and three points. [It's] important to keep working.

""Nothing is done, but yes, to feel the victory and being more positive in the next few days, I think it's important to grow that confidence in between us.""

It helped that the more veteran elements of the U.S. lineup provided the required platform for success. Center backs Tim Ream and Chris Richards gave outside backs Alex Freeman and Max Arfsten the security to perform their two-way roles on offense and defense with confidence, Arfsten in particular pushing higher up the field. Luca de la Torre provided stability to Sebastian Berhalter in midfield, while Tillman led the attack, allowing Luna to buzz around defensively and provide two assists, with Jack McGlynn making attacking contributions as well.

Granted, it helps that the U.S. was playing T&T and not Switzerland, but scaling the rock face is a lot easier when the handholds are within reach. It will make for a greater level of confidence when the tougher moments arrive, and could apply to team veterans and youngsters alike.

For Tillman, this kind of performance has been a long time coming, so much so that Richards was shocked that the goals were Tillman's first with the national team. But more is being asked of the PSV attacker in this environment than in previous camps with the national team. He's as soft-spoken as they come, but is ready to take on a bigger role.

""I'm quite confident. I had a good season at PSV,"" said Tillman, who notched 16 goals and five assists for his Dutch team in 2024-25 (34 games, all competitions). ""I've been here quite some time now. So yeah, I just take the responsibility. I like to take it and try to show it to everyone else.""

That dynamic between youth and experience was also visible through a more unsung contribution deeper in midfield. Tyler Adams was out because of a foot injury and Johnny Cardoso was sidelined due to an illness, which meant Pochettino had to mine the depth chart. In this instance, he opted for De la Torre and Berhalter. The latter sat in a deeper role, allowing de la Torre to sniff out opportunities while also tracking back when needed.

Overall, the combination showed promise and is the latest sign that De la Torre is another player making an impression on Pochettino. The San Diego FC midfielder has long been a performer who knits the attack together in the middle third. But in this case, he has picked his moments to push farther upfield when the situation demands it.

Kasey Keller breaks down the situation between Christian Pulisic and Mauricio Pochettino, in which Pochettino said Pulisic isn't allowed to dictate games he plays in.

Pochettino liked what he saw out of both players, and is pleased that another midfield combination is emerging.

""I think the football relationship between Luca and [Sebastian], it was fantastic and they controlled the game,"" Pochettino said. ""They played really well. I am so happy. They both show that in that position they can fit very well.

""Of course, we didn't have the help of Tyler and Johnny, but this is a good thing -- a period of opportunity to see [the other two] players. But sometimes [they] surprise you and say, 'OK, they take the opportunity,' and that is good because the competition is going to be higher now.""

Luna, for one, felt the presence of his veteran teammates as well as the love of 30 friends and family members in the stands.

""It allows me to get the ball and combine,"" Luna said about playing with Tillman and De la Torre. ""And then have guys that have experience and have been in tough moments, be there and help along the way. [Having] good players around you always allows you to be more confident and have trust within the team.""

Luna's two-assist performance, including a steal and feed to Tillman for the USMNT's second goal, was another step forward for the native of nearby Sunnyvale. The bear hug he got from Pochettino after being substituted in the 74th minute showed his continued ascendency.

The extent to which this mix of youth and experience can move forward will get its next test in four days against Saudi Arabia in Austin, Texas. That is bound to be a much tougher assignment than Sunday's match. But for now, the clouds have parted a bit, and the hope is that the coming forecast for the U.S. team involves even more sunshine.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

There are an awful lot of problems with the Club World Cup. The competitive imbalance between a European giant and the best team in Oceania is not remotely near to being one of them.

Would it have been better for Gianni Infantino's summer jamboree if Bayern Munich had not run 10 past Auckland City in Cincinatti on Sunday? Of course. Given that Vincent Kompany's side slowed the scoring rate before troubling their own record winning margin -- 16-1 win against DJK Waldberg in the 1997-98 DFB Cup -- this is not a game that will make its way to the history books of either club. Auckland City have been here before and, given their dominance of the OFC Champions League, they will likely be here again.

For some that is a cause of contention. ""I don't want to belittle anyone, but Bayern's opponent is semi [pro],"" grumbled Boca Juniors manager Miguel Angel Russo, who really is setting himself up for the most embarrassing of falls when his side face Auckland City in the final round of Group C fixtures. In the immediate aftermath of the double digit defeat, the question was asked by many. Should Auckland City even be here?

The answer is of course. So long as we accept at first principle that a competition to establish the best club side in the world is a worthwhile endeavour then Auckland City have just as much right to be in the United States as anyone. Frankly they have more than Bayern Munich, who have not won their Champions League in the last four years. 

There is no more logical way to build a tournament like this one than to draw together the best of every continent. On an annual cycle it makes sense to trim representatives from the less wealthy of the six federations before the big boys enter; in its current format there is no reason why every team should not start from the same point. Indeed a fairer question is why Oceania only gets one representative, had another team from Fiji, Tonga or elsewhere in the federation won their Champions League in recent years it would be a matter of brazen unfairness that they would have to battle it out with Auckland City while Bayern got to swan in by dint of being one of the best teams at nearly winning the European Cup.

From the big picture global view, the deck is already weighted against the New Zealanders much as it is Esperance de Tunis, off the pitch. Any suggestion that they should have to jump through further hoops just to meet the likes of Bayern Munich defies the stated purpose of this competition, loosely followed though it may be.

It is not Auckland City's fault that the professional team in town opted to play in the Australian A League, rendering themselves ineligible for the OFC Champions League. Nor are they responsible for the power balances both within football and without that mean the champions of Oceania can get by on an annual budget of about $670,000, barely enough to cover a month's salary for one of Bayern's superstars.

They have not come to the competition asking for pity nor have they gotten any. Asked directly if he felt sorry for his Auckland City counterparts, Michael Olise simply said: ""No."" Nor should he. If nothing else, this is hardly an out of the ordinary experience for Bayern. Four years ago they ran 12 past Bremer SV in the first round of the German Cup. On Sunday they put up 4.28 expected goals (xG) to their opponent 0.03. That is a cavernous difference but still on six occasions in the last four years of Bundesliga football Bayern have had a higher xG difference. And yet no one could reasonably argue that Bochum should play their season in a different format to Bayern just because they got tanked when they ran into them. 

In the aftermath of Auckland's defeat it was widely noted that it had taken 52 years for a nation to score 10 goals at the men's World Cup proper and barely 52 hours for it to happen at Gianni Infantino's Club World Cup. That speaks to little more than the randomness of high scoring games. Using a basic match expected goals simulator speaks to the brutal imbalance between these two teams on the day. Based on the shots and xG value for both teams, this was a game Bayern Munich win 99.6 percent of the time. Even so, the odds that they run in 10 goals from the 31 shots they took? They're long. They have only a 0.2% probability of happening, at least absent other information.

This was a game of incredible scoring fortune for Bayern. Maybe the defenses Michael Olise meets across the remainder of the Club World Cup won't make it as easy for him to glide off the right flank as he did just before half time but plenty of goalkeepers who are not taking unpaid leave to be at the tournament wouldn't have been able to stop his brilliant strike for Bayern's sixth goal. 

The issues around the Club World Cup are to do with the load it is placing on players, the cynical addition of clubs, the seeming disinterest of the wider footballing public. It won't help competitive balance. Those problems should not include whether a continental champion should be given access to the intercontinental championship because of one freak result against them, even if the odds of them winning a match themselves remain long.

Filed under:

It just continues...

Like a movie with three endings, Chelsea's 2024-25 season just keeps going. We've had the top-four finish.  We've had the Conference League final.  Now we have at least three more games to play, and perhaps a few more if (when) we get to the knockout stages of FIFA's newfangled Club World Cup.  (That's a “when” for manifesting, not a “when” for underestimating.)

Our first group stage game sees us face late-entrants Los Angeles FC, who were granted the opportunity to get Club León's spot after the Liga MX side were kicked due to their shared ownership structure with fellow qualifiers Club Pachuca.  LAFC beat Club América in a one-game playoff to earn their chance against Chelsea, Flamengo, and ES Tunis.

For them, this game, this tournament means everything.  Or at least a lot.

For us, it might not mean that much.

But we play to win every game and every competition, and this one is about as competitive as you can get for a summer tournament.  If FIFA have it their way, this thing will grow to become as big of a deal as the Champions League or maybe even the World Cup.  I doubt that's going to be the case — the old format, which we won in 2021 (well, 2022), certainly never took off — but I've been wrong before.

So, put those vacation plans on hold.  Mykonos can wait.  A trophy's calling.

Chelsea team news: For logistical, competitive, and transfer-market reasons, we've decided to not make too many changes to the squad from the second half of the season, adding only the four new signings that we been already made: Liam Delap, Dário Essugo, Mamadou Sarr, and Mike Penders.

Penders replaces Marcus Bettinelli as the third goalkeeper, with Betts leaving for Manchester City.  Fourth goalkeeper Lucas Bergström was released and his place has gone to Gaga Slonina.  Chelsea wanted to bring Đorđe Petrović along at first, but Petro has decided to explore his transfer options instead.

Other notable absentees from the 28-man squad registered for the group stage include Wesley Fofana, who's currently recovering from hamstring surgery, and Mykhailo Mudryk, who's serving his (officially still just provisional) suspension for a doping ban.  And Jadon Sancho has gone back to Manchester United after failing to agree a (lower-paying) contract with Chelsea.

About a third of the squad had been involved in internationals in the last couple weeks, so they've had practically no break at all since the Conference League final.  That might actually be helpful in avoiding “pre-season mode”.

LAFC team news: Speaking of no break, LAFC are in the middle of their MLS season, which started at the end of February.  The defending Western Conference regular season champions began in fairly poor form, but have now gone unbeaten in their last ten in all competitions (five wins, five draws), including their 2-1 extra-time victory over Club América in the play-in game.

Their main threat is a man named Denis Bouanga, once of AS Saint-Étienee, who's scored 20 league goals in back-to-back seasons and is on track for a third consecutive.  A more familiar, though these days far less threatening name will be Olivier Giroud.  He does have three goals in MLS this season, which is three more than last season, but he's struggled since joining from AC Milan last summer.

Fellow 38-year-old veteran Hugo Lloris will be another familiar name: the former Spurs goalkeeper was an MLS All-Star last season.  We might also remember ex-Roma striker Cengiz Ünder from the season he spent on loan at Leicester City a few years ago.

Head coach Steve Cherundolo made over 300 appearances in the Bundesliga (all for Hannover 96 in a remarkable 15-year career at the club) so he's not blind to the reality of this situation.  But he will certainly do his utmost to prepare his team, who will be fired up for the occasion.

“I know our players are competitive, I know our players really want to be here, and I know our players want to show well, and we are prepared for this. But yes [...] it's very clear who the underdog is, and who the favourite is, but we feel fine with that, and we're comfortable with that. [We] try not to hope, we prepare and have plans for everything that can come our way.”

-Steve Cherundolo; source: ESPN

Previously: LAFC have only been in existence for eight years, so this is unsurprisingly our first ever game against them.  This is however the third straight year that we've played in Atlanta, after a 1-1 draw against Newcastle United in the Premier League Summer Series two years ago and a 3-0 win against Club América in a friendly last year.

The Football Reporters crew discuss Real Madrid's chances of winning the FIFA Club World Cup under new manager Xabi Alonso. (1:54)

When Real Madrid marked their upcoming involvement in the FIFA Club World Cup with a post on their social media accounts on Saturday, the biggest face in the composite image wasn't that of star striker Kylian Mbappé.

It wasn't Vinícius Júnior's or Jude Bellingham's, either, although all three superstars were featured, alongside the competition's glistening trophy and images of soaring U.S. skyscrapers and bridges.

Instead, the image was dominated by the -- admittedly very handsome -- face of new coach Xabi Alonso. It has been only a few weeks, but already Madridistas couldn't be more excited about the Alonso era, his messianic promise outshining the combined star power of three of the game's most high-profile players.

The new coach's arrival -- returning to the club where he impressed as a player and later began his coaching journey at the academy -- was made official on May 25, the day after Madrid's 2024-25 LaLiga season ended. He took his first training session on June 9, just seven days ago. But already Alonso's Madrid are in Palm Beach, Florida, preparing for the Club World Cup.

A post shared by Real Madrid C.F. (@realmadrid)

Beyond the hype, clues as to exactly what Alonso has planned for the team have been scarce. At home in Madrid, at the club's Valdebebas base, training took place behind closed doors last week. Just 15 minutes of Sunday's first open session in the United States, at their training camp in Palm Beach Gardens, were open to the media. But the little we've seen of Alonso at work, in photos and video carefully compiled and released by the club, has been intriguing.

Every image has already been pored over and analyzed by fans. In one photo, from a set released by the club on June 9, Alonso sits in an office with five of his key coaching staff: Sebas Parrilla (assistant manager), Ismael Camenforte (fitness coach), Alberto Encinas and Beñat Labaien (analysts) and Luis Lopis (the ongoing goalkeeping coach). Their laptops are at the ready, with what look like tactical plans on the screens. Alonso is poised with a tablet in front of him. The intended message, perhaps a little unfairly, is clear: This is a thoroughly modern coach, unlike his predecessor, Carlo Ancelotti.

Training footage shows Alonso to be just as focused, interventionist and detail-orientated as you'd expect: actively directing, stopping play when necessary, pointing and shouting, watching his players' every move and frequently correcting their positioning.

A post shared by Real Madrid C.F. (@realmadrid)

Again, the contrast with the more laid-back Ancelotti couldn't be more stark. Alonso might have played under the chilled-out Italian; but he learned his trade under Rafa Benítez, José Mourinho and Pep Guardiola, too.

At his introductory news conference on May 26, Alonso provided more hints as to the kind of team we might see begin to evolve at the Club World Cup and to flourish in LaLiga next season. He said: ""Today in football you have to be flexible, and dynamic. You have to move pieces around during games. I have an idea of how we want to play, but the system can change, with four [defenders], or with three.

""What I want is that we know how to choose our moments, to be organized, to control the ball, and know what to do when we don't have the ball. You have to press when it's necessary, and sit back when it's necessary. It's about taking the initiative, and we have the players to do it.""

We'll get a first real glimpse of how close Alonso's embryonic side are to that ideal when Madrid kick off against Al Hilal at Hard Rock Stadium, Miami, on Wednesday.

The task ahead for Alonso is considerable. Madrid underperformed last season, slumping into an ineffective shadow of the team that won LaLiga and the Champions League the year before. When pushed, Alonso refused to provide an analysis of the side's weaknesses, reluctant to get into specifics.

""I've seen the games, I've analyzed them, and now I'm thinking about what we can do to have balance and control,"" he said. ""That will give us a stability which will enable the individual qualities to flourish.""

Balance and control. Both were lacking for Ancelotti's Madrid last season. The campaign wasn't a catastrophe: The team finished second in LaLiga, kept the title race alive until May and reached the Copa del Rey final. But Madrid were embarrassed in their Champions League round-of-16 elimination to Arsenal, losing 5-1 on aggregate -- and they lost four consecutive Clásicos to Barcelona for the first time in 15 years, including the 4-3 on May 11 that handed Barça the league. Mbappé might have scored 43 goals in all competitions, but he was just about the only functioning part of the team.

That meant Ancelotti had to lose his job. It was a decision Ancelotti himself accepted and understood, content to bid an emotional farewell and move on to a next destination he had long fancied, as Brazil's national team coach. For an equally long time -- dating back years -- Alonso had been Madrid's favorite to replace him. That view was backed up by his performance at Bayer Leverkusen, with their 2023-24 unbeaten Bundesliga title-winning season.

Circumstances made the handover unexpectedly awkward. Madrid couldn't act while they were still, even theoretically, in the title race. Alonso, respectfully, didn't want to make his future plans public until the end of Leverkusen's season. And Brazil's football federation was keen -- for internal, political reasons -- to secure Ancelotti as soon as possible. The result was Alonso confirming his Leverkusen departure on May 9, and Ancelotti then being announced as Brazil coach, 11 days before his Madrid exit would be made official.

It didn't bother Ancelotti much, though, and he gave his former player his blessing, calling Alonso a ""fantastic"" coach who had ""all doors open to him."" The outgoing boss said of his successor: ""He's shown himself to be one of the best coaches in the world.""

Gustavo Hofman believes Real Madrid would be open to parting ways with Rodrygo but only for a transfer fee between 80-100 million euros.

When Alonso was finally presented as Madrid's new coach on May 26, he was predictably assured, charismatic and eloquent. However, there were some subjects he had to work hard to avoid, such as exactly when Madrid had offered him the job, and how much input he'd had on issues such as the decision not to award veteran midfielder Luka Modric a new contract.

He wouldn't commit to a formation, saying again that ""football is dynamic."" When asked how he would help Mbappé and Vini Jr. work together as a front two, he answered enigmatically: ""I have ideas."" There was more detail on a position for Jude Bellingham -- ""I see him as a midfielder. We'll try to make sure he's as efficient as possible"" -- and a noncommittal answer on Rodrygo who, sources have told ESPN, wants clarity on his future role. ""I'll talk to all the players, because we have to get to know each other,"" Alonso said.

With the 2024-25 season officially over, it's time to rank the top 100 players in the world of men's soccer right now. Welcome to the FC 100. Read the full list here.

This Club World Cup sits between two seasons, two eras, and two Real Madrid teams. Veterans like Modric and Lucas Vázquez will play for Madrid in the tournament for the last time, before their contracts expire. Two new players, center back Dean Huijsen and right back Trent Alexander-Arnold, have already signed and are with the squad in Florida. Two more are in the United States, but elsewhere. River Plate playmaker Franco Mastantuono will join in August when he turns 18, while left back Álvaro Carreras is still with Benfica, the two clubs unable to agree on a fee.

Ball-playing defender Huijsen believes he ""fits in well with Xabi's football."" Alexander-Arnold says Alonso was a ""big idol"" for him as a kid, and more than that, he has already affected the development of the full back's playing style. ""He impacted my game growing up,"" Alexander-Arnold said at his unveiling on Thursday. ""Watching him pass the ball gave me the hunger to do that. ... He's a new manager, but he's shown how amazing he is. I'll be soaking up all the information I can.""

Alonso was reluctant to take on the Club World Cup and would have preferred to begin afterward. An interim, internal appointment was considered, like director of football Santi Solari, before being dismissed as impractical.

Alonso has not had time yet to properly assemble a new team, with a new philosophy and identity, but the demands at Madrid are blind to that. They will be as high as ever. An early elimination, even in the knockout phase, would be viewed as unacceptable. But there's also the alluring possibility of a good performance, an early proof of concept for Alonso's project. ""These are the circumstances, and once it's like that, I see it as an opportunity,"" Alonso insisted last month. ""On the one hand, to get started with processes, how we want [the team] to be. And then on the other hand, to fight for a trophy. If we do those two things, it can be a great start.""

Former Liverpool and Real Madrid manager Rafa Benítez gives his thoughts on Xabi Alonso's imminent move to Real Madrid.

Those ""circumstances"" include three players -- Vini Jr., Arda Güler and Andriy Lunin -- meeting up with Alonso and the squad for the very first time on Saturday, at the Four Seasons Hotel in Palm Beach, after their international commitments ended. Other crucial figures -- Mbappé, Bellingham, Alexander-Arnold, Huijsen, Modric and Aurélien Tchouaméni -- only returned on Friday, meaning that they will have only completed five training sessions before Alonso's first game in charge.

And then there's a long list of others -- Dani Carvajal, Éder Militão, Antonio Rüdiger, David Alaba, Eduardo Camavinga, Endrick and Ferland Mendy -- who are still not fully fit and are working on their recovery. All were named in Madrid's Club World Cup squad and have traveled to the U.S.

Speaking on arrival in Palm Beach, Alonso did his best to stay upbeat. ""It's been very positive,"" he said. ""You get to know [the players] little by little, having that contact, that's very necessary. And more players are arriving.

""Everything has been sped up a lot, because we have very little time to get to know each other. Today we arrived, and we'll start to make a team. We have three training sessions before the [Al Hilal] match, but we're excited to be here, to have a good tournament, and to go all the way to the end.""

That's Madrid's target: getting to the final at MetLife Stadium and winning it. But there's also another, even more important objective: building an improved team for next season, a team that won't get hammered repeatedly by Barcelona or bested by any top side they come up against in the Champions League. And in that regard, it's not yet clear if this tournament will be a help, or a hindrance.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Xabi Alonso has emphasised working on the press during his first few days as coach of the club.

Xabi Alonso wants to fix the pressing. That damn pressing. It's one of his top priorities. On his first day—early last Monday—he opened his agenda and gathered his staff to decide where to stick the scalpel. There wasn't much time, so choices had to be made.

There would be just five training sessions before the trip to the USA—just enough time to tighten a screw. But which ones? That was the question. After several hours of meetings, there was white smoke: pressing. It wasn't the only issue, but it was the most urgent.

It's probably been the biggest headache of the season. “We're not a balanced team, but we have a lot of quality up front,” was Ancelotti's diagnosis near the end of the campaign, right after scraping into the Copa del Rey final. You can't change a comma in that statement. That's what Real Madrid has been: disorganized but dripping with talent. And that has to change. Because talent wins games—but disorganization makes it fleeting. That's not the way.

🔙🤩 Still got it! pic.twitter.com/m2kj3hQUia

Xabi Alonso wants order. But he needs time—and he doesn't have much. So, for these first few days, the decision has been to focus on pressing. With nuance. He's not asking for a very high press, but for a medium one. Press aggressively when the ball crosses into the final third. But do it with structure. Rehearsals have already started and will continue in the U.S., with the full squad available. The plan, as reported, is to iron out the flaws during the group stage. The opponents, on paper, allow for some breathing room. For now.

Madrid won't be a team that just drops deep without the ball. They'll attack around the 70% mark of the field. But it has to be done right. “We haven't been compact all season,” Carletto admitted, visibly shaken in the heart of the Emirates. A night that pierced their Achilles' heel. Madrid tried to press up front—but did it poorly, exposing themselves over and over. It was the clearest example of chaos.

Xabi wants this to be one of the first things to change. If you're going to press in a medium block, do it right. And if you can't—don't. It's better not to do it at all than to do it badly. But you have to try. You have to work on it. And that's not all—attitude. What a word. What a key.

These days, he's been drilling it into the squad: he wants players who bite. And he wants it to show in one specific action—biting immediately after losing the ball. Let those first seconds after possession is lost be full of teeth. He wants to see that hunger. Whether the ball is recovered or not is secondary. But try.

That's something every player already carries—in their head, in their game. In his first training session, with 21 players present (though only 15 trained, and 10 were youth players), he was clear: he promised to give 200%, in exchange for 200% from each one. His part, for now, is more than visible. He's giving everything. Maximizing every minute of every session. With drills to speed up transitions, nonstop demands for intensity—and yes, a constant focus on pressing.

👕🤍🇺🇸📍@adidasfootball pic.twitter.com/K441PW7oDP

Those are his three commandments on the tablets of law: 1. Press. 2. Intensity. 3. Compactness. Objective: become a cohesive unit. Finally. Fix that damn pressing.

SEATTLE – A resurgent second half wasn't quite enough for Seattle Sounders FC, who opened Group B play in the 2025 FIFA Club World Club with a narrow 2-1 defeat against Botafogo at Lumen Field on Sunday evening.

After conceding twice in the first half against the storied Brazilian outfit, the match seemed in danger of slipping away from the Rave Green. Instead, they nearly gave a lively home crowd a result to remember.

Midfielder Cristian Roldan halved the deficit with a 75th-minute header, setting the stage for a frantic final 15 minutes that saw Seattle come tantalizingly close to a leveling goal.

“At 2-0 you have nothing to lose, right?” Roldan told reporters in the post-match mixed zone. “We talked about keeping that scoreline at [2-0] and giving ourselves a chance to get back in the game.

“We felt that if we got one goal, we could ride that momentum and potentially make a game out of it.""

The result leaves Seattle with an uphill climb to emerge from a stacked Group B, which also includes Spanish powerhouse Atlético Madrid and UEFA Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain.

Although their comeback bid fell just short on Sunday, winger Paul Rothrock said his side can take some ""good lessons"" from their second-half response as they prepare to face two European juggernauts.

“Anyone who's watched our team before, and watched [us] this season, we turned up the dial a little bit on our intensity today, and hopefully we can continue to do that throughout the tournament and carry that on to the rest of the season,” Rothrock said.

“It's a really exciting opportunity to get to play Atlético and we're going to focus on that first, and then the best team in the world, PSG,” he continued. “So I think we're going to approach the games the same way, I still believe we have a chance to make it out of the group depending on how these next two games go. I think we learned some good lessons today.”

PSG flexed their tournament favorite credentials in their Group B opener, routing Atlético 4-0 at the Rose Bowl in Los Angeles.

That leaves Atlético seeking a get-right result in Thursday's trip to Lumen FIeld, providing perhaps an even loftier test for the Sounders, who qualified for the tournament via their historic 2022 Concacaf Champions Cup title.

“I would love to see a performance where we bring intensity, we show that can compete at that level,” Roldan said after battling the reigning Brasileiro Série A and Copa Libertadores champions.

“We show that not only can we compete not only from an intensity and an athletic standpoint, but from a tactical standpoint, playing out of the back, show that this league is good enough at the world stage. I think that's what this tournament is all about.”

While Seattle will be underdogs in each of the next two matchups, homegrown midfielder Obed Vargas said they're relishing the opportunity.

“I can tell you one thing: I won't be a fan whenever we play them,"" Vargas said of Atlético. ""I'm going to be motivated to beat them and do as much as I can to beat them.

“And then playing the Champions League winners, you saw the game today – 4-nil. They are a powerhouse. We just have to go out there and try and compete as best as we can.""","{'href': 'https://www.mlssoccer.com', 'title': 'MLSsoccer.com'}","soccer"

Club World Cup

The head coaches of both FC Porto and Palmeiras, as well as the Brazilian wonderkid Estevao, criticised the turf at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on Sunday night following the draw between the two teams in the Club World Cup.

MetLife Stadium will host eight Club World Cup matches this summer, including both semi-finals and the final, before hosting the men's World Cup final next summer in a tournament which will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico.

Playing surfaces were a cause for complaint at last summer's Copa America in the U.S. and the Argentine head coach Lionel Scaloni described the field at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta as not being up to standard while goalkeeper Emi Martinez said it was a “disaster” and “like a trampoline.” Brown patches were also visible on the sides of the pitch at MetLife during last summer's tournament, which was organised by CONMEBOL rather than FIFA.

In a news conference following the 0-0 draw between Brazilian team Palmeiras and the Portuguese team FC Porto, the 18-year-old man of the match Estevao raised the pitch as a cause of concern.

Estevao, who has already agreed to join Premier League team Chelsea after this tournament, said: “I think the pitch should have been watered a little more as the ball was a little slow which interferes with the pace of the game. It was both for ourselves and for Porto. As the game went on, it rained which made it roll a bit faster.”

Over the past year, FIFA has studied which grass type would be best for MetLife, before deciding upon a “warm-season grass” it believed would endure the local conditions. The Athletic has previously reported that grass was grown at Tuckahoe Turf Farms, which is also responsible for the grass being grown for the men's World Cup in 2026.

The stadium, shared by the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets, usually has a synthetic turf but the FIFA competitions this year and next summer require natural grass. This week has been inconsistent in terms of weather, with boiling temperatures midweek before dropping closer to 60 degrees Fahrenheit over the weekend.

Abel Ferreira, the Palmeiras coach, said: “In the beginning, the pitch was dry. I don't know who is the patron saint for rain but after it rained it then enabled us to play our game.”

The Porto player Ze Pedro also said the pitch “could be better” while the Porto coach Martin Anselmi added: “I do feel like the pitch caused us to be a bit imprecise. This was particularly when we wanted to accelerate the game. There were some mistakes that happened (as a result) but the grass is the same for both teams. We had to adapt.”

Meanwhile, the Palmeiras coach also suggested that FIFA should consolidate fans within the lower rings of the stadium when attendances fall considerably below a sell-out during this tournament. This match had a creditable attendance of 46,275, largely made up of passionate Palmeiras fans and while the lower rings appeared close to full, supporters were scattered across three tiers which does not make for the best atmosphere. Some had flown in but the match also benefited from the Brazilian diaspora within the U.S.

Ferreira said: “The issue is the stadium is huge. Forty-six thousand is a big number but maybe they could have closed the third ring and placed everyone in the first and second (to bring it closer).. But with the amount of Palmeiras fans, it was like we were playing at home and this was a strength for Palmeiras. The stadium is too big but 46,000 is very good when people from Brazil and Portugal had to come and fly in and it's not so easy to do that.”

He declined to comment as to whether FIFA should look to reduce ticket prices further in order to make the game more accessible to a broader audience. FIFA did provide QR codes to fans attending the game on boards outside the stadium which offered 20 per cent discount on other group stage games being played at MetLife Stadium.

Thursday's fixture for Palmeiras against Al-Ahly at MetLife has now dropped down to $45 on Ticketmaster for standard admission while Tuesday's noon kick off between Borussia Dortmund and Fluminense is now down to $33 at the same venue.

After their trophy-less campaign, Los Blancos have been busier than most in preparing for this summer's tournament in the United States

Carlo Ancelotti was adamant: the Club World Cup did not matter. He didn't care for it, and he insisted hat Real Madrid would not take it seriously either. In fact, his Blancos team could even refuse the opportunity to play in the competition.

""FIFA forgets that players and teams will not participate in the new Club World Cup. A single Real Madrid match is worth €20 million and FIFA wants to give us that amount for the entire tournament. Negative. Like us, other clubs will refuse the invitation,"" the then-Madrid manager said in June 2024.

Within 24 hours, both he and the club themselves had a remarkable change of heart. Suddenly, they were pro-Club World Cup. Ancelotti insisted his comments had been taken out of context, while Madrid put out a defiant statement: ""Our club will take part, as planned, in this official competition which we face with pride and with the utmost enthusiasm to once again make our millions of fans all over the world dream of a new title.""

Since then, Madrid have been up for this summer's tournament in the United States. However, in recent weeks, their obsession with being crowned world champions has intensified. After their domestic and European seasons crumbled, Madrid turned their focus fully towards retooling for competition, and after bringing in some big names - in the form of both players and managers - Los Blancos have made it clear that they are playing to win.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The new Premier League champions have pulled off a major coup by landing the Germany international, who can take them to an even higher level

""He's probably the best player in Europe at the moment,"" former Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann said on the Aldo Meets Podcast after confirmation of Florian Wirtz's British-record £116 million ($159m) move to Anfield from Bayer Leverkusen was widely reported. ""He played in a team that were 16th or 17th when [Xabi] Alonso took over, they end up winning the league the season after, this year they finished second. The biggest reason is Florian Wirtz. He is exceptional.""

Hamann added on whether Wirtz can hit the ground running in the Premier League: ""The reason why I think he will be a success is that he can look after himself. He is like a street kid. He won't shirk a challenge."" In other words, Wirtz is a game-changer with an edge. Liverpool have broken the bank to sign the 22-year-old ahead of Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Manchester City, but it's a shrewd investment that could pay off handsomely.

Almost three-and-a-half years ago, Wirtz tore his anterior cruciate ligament in a Bundesliga clash against Koln, and underwent a gruelling 10-month rehabilitation programme. It was feared that the injury would derail the playmaker's career before it had properly taken off, but under the guidance of Alonso, he defied all the odds to come back and spearhead the most successful period in Leverkusen's entire history.

The technical quality and mental fortitude Wirtz has shown at such a young age are nothing short of remarkable. Hamann's confidence in the Germany international is a reflection of that, and will be shared not only by all the decision-makers at Liverpool, but also neutral fans across the Premier League. This feels like the rarest type of transfer in the modern era: a sure thing.

Because of Wirtz's elite status and the money involved, it's also a deal that will have far-reaching implications. As such, GOAL has come up with eight winners and losers from the biggest transfer of the summer so far...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The U.S. dominated the Soca Warriors to build some much-needed momentum to kick off this summer's tournament

SAN JOSE, Calif. - In the days leading up to the Gold Cup, Christian Pulisic made waves with an Instagram post. ""Just what the doctor ordered"" he wrote, setting off a string of soundbites from across the American soccer landscape. While many of the headlines remain focused on Pulisic's absence, the players that are featuring for the USMNT in this Gold Cup started the tournament with, well, just what the doctor ordered.

Facing off with an overmatched Trinidad and Tobago team, the U.S. jumped out to a 3-0 first-half lead and ran away as 5-0 winners Sunday night to open the 2025 Gold Cup, bringing back some form of positive momentum after several months of negativity.

That four-game losing streak? Over. Those pre-Gold Cup questions? At least partially answered. This was exactly the response the USMNT needed, both to start this tournament and in the big picture of it all.

It started early with a 16th-minute goal from Malik Tillman, who finished off a Jack McGlynn assist to set the tone for the day. It was a huge goal for Tillman, his first in a USMNT shirt - but an even bigger one for the team, who were clearly spurred on to attack in that goal's aftermath. Tillman made it 2-0 just 25 minutes later, tapping home an assist from Diego Luna, before the Real Salt Lake star banked a shot off Patrick Agyemang and in to make it 3-0 before halftime.

The U.S. would add two more in the second half, as Brenden Aaronson and Haji Wright came off the bench to join the party with goals of their own.

This wasn't quite perfect - although the USMNT is now a perfect 6-0 all-time against Trinidad and Tobago in the Gold Cup. But it was pretty damn good, helping the U.S. start this tournament on the right foot after tripping over themselves so many times in the last year. And the fact that so few of the USMNT players had ever featured in this tournament speaks volumes - captain Tim Ream was the lone starter with Gold Cup experience

Pulisic isn't showing up this summer but, if Sunday's win is any indication, the U.S. - starting their most-inexperienced squad in the Gold Cup since 2009 - may just find a way to cancel the noise and respond again.

Betis make creative proposal in desperate bid to bridge financial gap with Man Utd as Brazil winger accepts pay cut to agree long-term contract","https://www.goal.com/en/news/antony-betis-creative-proposal-desperate-bid-man-utd-brazil-winger-accepts-pay-cut-agree-long-term-contract/blt6ac16e7e67b59794","Mon, 16 Jun 2025 10:51:58 GMT","

Real Betis have made another desperate bid to keep Antony, with a co-ownership proposal reportedly being put to Manchester United.

The Spanish outfit saw Brazil international Antony make an impressive contribution to their cause during a productive loan spell in the second-half of the 2024-25 campaign. The South American forward was able to rekindle a lost spark in Andalusia.

Antony is now being linked with clubs across Europe, as United prepare to cash in on a player who flopped for them on the back of an £85 million ($115m) transfer from Ajax in 2022. Betis are still hoping to remain at the front of that queue.

ABC Sevilla reports on how Betis executives recently travelled to Old Trafford for talks with United officials. During those discussions, a co-ownership agreement was proposed that would see Betis buy a percentage of Antony's rights - with United standing to benefit from a high sell-on clause that would be triggered by any future sale.

Betis are unable to meet United's demands when it comes to a flat fee this summer. Instead, they are willing to part with €20m (£17m/$23m) now or as a purchase obligation in 2026 after a season-long loan. The wide man is also willing to take a pay cut to make the transfer happen.

It is claimed that there is a “sense among both sides that they are destined to come to an understanding”, with Betis eager to keep the 25-year-old on their books while United can raise important funds immediately and in an upcoming transfer window.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

LONDON -- Ben Shelton rose two spots to No. 10 in the ATP rankings Monday, joining No. 4 Taylor Fritz and No. 8 Tommy Paul to give the United States three men in the top 10 for the first time in nearly 20 years.

In April 2006, Andy Roddick was No. 4, James Blake was No. 7 and Andre Agassi was No. 10.

There are four American women in the WTA's top 10 this week again, and five in the top 13: No. 2 Coco Gauff, No. 3 Jessica Pegula, No. 6 Madison Keys, No. 9 Emma Navarro and No. 13 Amanda Anisimova.

Aryna Sabalenka remains at No. 1, a spot she took over in October from Iga Swiatek, who dropped to No. 8 on Monday.

Tatjana Maria, a 37-year-old German, rose 43 spots to No. 43 on Monday by winning the Queen's Club title as a qualifier.

The 22-year-old Shelton, who won the 2022 NCAA singles title for the University of Florida, is in only his third full season on tour. He'd never traveled out of the U.S. until 2023.

Shelton is a two-time Grand Slam semifinalist, making it that far at the US Open in 2023 and the Australian Open this January.

Fritz moved up three spots to match his career high after winning a grass-court title at Stuttgart, Germany, on Sunday. The top three men remained the same: No. 1 Jannik Sinner, No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz and No. 3 Alexander Zverev, the runner-up to Fritz in Stuttgart.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","tennis"

Taylor Fritz has only just won his first ATP title of the 2025 season at the BOSS Open in Stuttgart.

Fritz beat Alexander Zverev to win the ATP 250 tournament in Stuttgart for the first time in his career.

This has enabled the American to return to world number four in the ATP rankings, bouncing back after Fritz lost in the first round of Roland Garros.

While this is a positive sign of where Fritz's game is heading, he has now admitted that he has some limitations.

Before Fritz beat Zverev in the Stuttgart final, he spoke on WTA player Caroline Garcia's Tennis Insider Podcast.

During this conversation, Fritz was asked about his game and what he thinks he does well, as well as what he thinks he could improve.

In his response, Fritz praised his mental resilience, but claimed that he was a bit limited in his shot selection and wished he had more variety in his game.

“Yeah, I think one of my best abilities on the court is my mind and thinking, and I think I think really well on the court,” said Fritz.

“I wish I could do…I wish I had more shots so I could do more things I'm somewhat limited and all the different strategies and stuff I can do, because I have to play, at least in some way play to my game.

“But yeah, I never want a coach to just tell me something, and I just blindly listen. I want to understand why they're saying that and then maybe some situations, once we like talk it through, I still decide that I think my way of thinking is the right way to do it.”

Fritz will not have much time to celebrate his Stuttgart victory, as he is playing in both singles and doubles, with Jiri Lehecka, at the Queen's Club Championships.

The 27-year-old achieved his best result at Queen's last year by reaching the quarter-finals, but will want to go even further as the third seed in 2025.

Fritz's first round opponent at the ATP 500 tournament will be qualifier Corentin Moutet, in a first-time meeting between the pair.

If he is able to match his result at Queen's from last year, Fritz could potentially play fifth seed Alex de Minaur or his doubles partner Lehecka.

Jack Draper is a potential semi-final opponent for Fritz, and he would only play Carlos Alcaraz if both players reach the final.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Jack Draper is back in Queen's this week, and will be hoping to enjoy a solid run ahead of Wimbledon later this month.

However, any hopes of winning this upcoming Grand Slam will certainly have been reduced somewhat after watching the Roland Garros final just a few weeks ago.

There, Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner put on the most magnificent display, battling through a five-set epic that left the tennis world, and many beyond it, stunned.

It's the kind of event that draws countless new people into the sport, such was the quality and drama of each point.

Jack Draper has since sought to review the action.

Speaking to the press ahead of his return to Queen's this week, one reporter wondered if Draper had made the time to watch that historic recent French Open final between Alcaraz and Sinner.

He replied: ‘I didn't watch the first two sets… I watched it in my flat. I watched the last three sets, unbelievable tennis. 

‘I think it inspired all the players and I think it captured the attention of all the spectators, all the people around the world, even people who aren't into tennis, it was one of those sporting moments I think everyone was embraced by, so I think Jannik and Carlos did an unbelievable show there.

‘Shame someone had to lose, but that's the nature of sport; but I think tennis won for sure. 

Asked if he felt like he could reach that level soon, Draper then continued: ‘Yeah, I mean, I think so. 

‘I think, you know, the tennis they were playing that was, I think the combination of them two together, I think it was the moment they were in. 

‘My friend said to me when we were watching them play, like, “How are they playing this way in this moment in this after five hours or something like that?” And I said, “I don't think they're thinking about anything. I think they're just thinking about playing”. 

‘I don't know what I'm capable of yet, but I aspire to be at that level, and I think what those guys are doing is setting away and it's changing the game. And I think that, you know, players like myself are going to be working very hard to get to that point. That's that's 100% for sure.'

Jack Draper's relationship with Andy Murray was analysed by Jamie Murray over the weekend, and perhaps the 22-year-old can seek some counsel from the legendary Scotsman on how he can compete with such forces of nature.

Draper has troubled Alcaraz in the past when they have played, beating him at Queen's this time last year, and on his way to his Indian Wells title earlier in 2025.

He's also had his fair share of beatings, but on his day, he can challenge the Spaniard.

However, much like the rest of the tour, Sinner proposes a wholly different challenge that he cannot seem to overcome.

He did beat the world number one back in 2021, but when they faced more recently, whilst the Italian was at the level he currently is, the Brit was swept aside in the US Open semi-finals.

Draper managed to compete, dragging the opening two sets to tiebreaks, but could not find that extra level needed to trouble the most consistent and ruthless player on tour.

If he is to challenge for the Wimbledon title, he'll need to follow in Alcaraz's footsteps and try and unsettle Sinner with a variety of shots on this unique surface. ","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

No one must be happier that the clay season is over than USA's Taylor Fritz.

After enduring a torrid time on the red dirt and crashing out in the first round of the French Open to Germany's Daniel Altmaier, Taylor Fritz rediscovered his missing form to capture his fourth ATP Tour title on grass and ninth overall on Sunday at the BOSS Open in Stuttgart, where he defeated World No. 3 Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6(0).

Thanks to the win, Fritz, who has now won his past five meetings against Zverev, will return to No. 4 in the ATP Rankings on Monday, overtaking British lefty Jack Draper following his triumph. 

Fritz's performance in Stuttgart was so much more impressive, judging from the fact that he did not drop a set all week at the ATP 250 event in Germany and became the first player to lift a tour-level trophy without losing serve since Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in Basel last October.

By winning in Stuttgart, Fritz recorded his fourth career title on grass, putting him level alongside Matteo Berrettini and Nicolas Mahut. Only Novak Djokovic has more titles on grass (8) among active players. 

At the Queen's Club in London, the 37-year-old Tatjana Maria proved that age is just a number for her as she became the oldest champion on tour since Serena Williams in 2020, when she blew away four top 20 players to capture her first WTA 500 title at the HSBC Championships.

Maria even came through the qualification to earn her ticket for the tournament, but went from strength to strength and capped off an amazing week of upsets to capture the title on Sunday with a 6-3, 6-4 final victory over No. 8 seed Amanda Anisimova of the United States. 

Another qualifier, Elena-Gabriela Ruse, made it all the way to the final in 's-Hertogenbosch but had no answer to the power of Belgium's Elise Mertens in the final.

Mertens, who enjoyed plenty of support from friends and family in the final as 's-Hertogenbosch is only about an hour-and-a-half by car from Mertens' Belgian hometown of Leuven, won 6-3, 7-6(4) to secure her 10th career WTA singles title.

The win was the Belgian's second on tour this year after she won the WTA 250 in Singapore in February. She was also runner-up in Hobart at the start of the season in Australia.

Czech tennis star Karolina Muchova is currently going through a challenging period in her career. Following a disappointing loss at Roland Garros where she was defeated by the USA's Alycia Parks, Muchova crashed out of the 1/8-finals at Queen's to the champion Maria. 

Muchova has revealed she might need to undergo another surgery due to persistent pain in her left wrist, a procedure that could sideline the world No. 13 again for several months.

Wrist problems continue to be an everlasting problem on the ATP and WTA Tours and should certainly not be underestimated. Just look at former Grand Slam winner Dominic Thiem, who never recovered his form and chose to retire after persistent wrist problems. 

Injuries have continued to disrupt Muchova's momentum throughout the season, raising questions if she will be able to recover her consistency which saw her reach the French Open final in 2023 and propelled her to a career-high ranking of No. 8 in September 2023.

""I treated my right wrist conservatively for half a year and then I had surgery anyway. That is always the last option for me, I don't want to have it. I will try some alternative solutions, but if they don't work, I will have to go back to the operating room,"" says Muchova.

Elise Mertens launched one of the most improbable comebacks in recent WTA history on Saturday at the Libéma Open in 's-Hertogenbosch, when she managed to save no less than 11 match points in her 2-6, 7-6(7), 6-4 victory over Ekaterina Alexandrova in the semi-final.

According to the WTA, it is the most match points saved by a player in a main-draw match in the 2020s. They all came in the second set, and 10 of the 11 came with Mertens serving.

""I didn't even know it was 11, after one or two I lost count,"" Mertens said, after her comeback. ""I was very focused on the game, which, of course, I like that about me, that I just keep going.""

""It was a difficult match, I think she started really well, and it was 6-2, 5-3 for her. I just stayed with my head in the game and gave everything I had. Especially in the third set, I felt like, ‘OK, this is maybe my opportunity.' So I'm very happy I took that chance.""

Canada's Gabriel Diallo captured his first ATP Tour title at the Libema Open in the Netherlands on Sunday, when the 23-year-old from Montreal defeated Belgium's Zizou Bergs 7-5, 7-6(8). Diallo sealed the win with a superb backhand cross-court winner after a spectacular rally with the Belgian. 

It's not easy to complete a lob over the 1.98 metres tall Alexander Zverev, but Brandon Nakashima still managed to accomplish the virtually impossible challenge when he faced the German during last week's tournament in Stuttgart. 

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz will be back on grass for the first time this season at ATP 500 events in Halle and London, respectively.

World No. 1 Sinner leads an impressive field at the Terra Wortmann Open in Germany, where spectators will also enjoy the chance to see Alexander Zverev, Daniil Medvedev and Joao Fonseca in action. Sinner heads into the tournament as defending champion at the ATP 500 event, after beating Hubert Hurkacz in the final 12 months ago. 

At the HSBC Championships in London, Alcaraz is the main attraction in a draw that also features British No. 1 Jack Draper and Top 10 stars Taylor Fritz and Holger Rune.

On the WTA Tour, nine of the top 10 players in the WTA singles rankings will compete at the year's second WTA 500 grass-court event, the Berlin Tennis Open while the WTA 250 event at Lexus Nottingham Open features 32 singles players aiming to to get their grass court preparation just right before Wimbledon starts in two weeks time.","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","tennis"

Coco Gauff is determined to put her recent French Open triumph behind her - at least mentally - as she sets her sights on Wimbledon. The 21-year-old claimed her second Grand Slam title earlier this month, defeating Aryna Sabalenka in the final to become the first American woman to win at Roland Garros since Serena Williams in 2015.

It was her first major victory since the 2023 US Open, a milestone that reaffirmed her place at the top of women's tennis and solidified her status as a frontrunner for upcoming majors. But as Wimbledon looms just two weeks away, Gauff is focused on staying grounded. She's intent on avoiding the same trap she fell into two years ago, when the high of winning in New York led to complacency. ""I think I can give myself the best shot [of winning Wimbledon] by trying to keep the moment [winning the French Open] as minimised as possible,"" she said on the Nice Talk with Nikki Ogunnaike podcast. ""I'm kind of trying to forget the Roland Garros win, honestly.""

Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. Read our Privacy Policy

When asked why, Gauff explained: ""Just to stay hungry. After [my] US Open win, for the rest of that season I was like, 'I won the US Open, the season's almost over, I'm pretty satisfied.'

""I don't want to approach the rest of this season from that standpoint, also because there are two other Grand Slams that are very possible for me to win. So I think I've learned from that mindset, and I'm just going to try to forget [Roland Garros]. Not now, I'm definitely remembering it now. But when the time comes, when I step out on Centre Court at Wimbledon, I will definitely try to forget.""

Wimbledon has been Gauff's most challenging Grand Slam to date, with her best result being a fourth-round finish. That said, many will now be tipping the Georgia-born star to go on and win the title. Gauff, however, insists her main goal is simply to go further than she ever has before.



""Going into Wimbledon, I definitely feel pretty confident,"" she said. ""I've [been knocked out in the] fourth round there a few times, so I'm really focused on getting past that stage.""

Expectations are sky-high for Gauff, particularly amid a broader lull in American tennis. When asked how she handles the weight of that pressure, the youngster admits it's been ""a lot of trial and error.""

She added: ""I realise that it's impossible to escape the noise, so for me it's about trying to remember what my expectations for myself are, what expectations the people around me have for me.

""Sometimes I do welcome the noise, I think it gives me reason to prove people wrong and also prove people right. So sometimes it's about finding the right balance of doing both.""

While Gauff continues to embrace her status as one of the sport's biggest stars, she remains remarkably self-aware for her age. Her approach to mental preparation - balancing ambition with humility - has become a cornerstone of her evolving game.

That maturity has been evident in her on-court resilience and off-court poise, qualities that have helped her navigate the intense spotlight that's followed her since she burst onto the scene as a 15-year-old at Wimbledon in 2019. Now, six years on, she returns to the All England Club not just as a prodigy with potential, but as a proven champion aiming to add another title to her bulging trophy cabinet.

Tennis icon Rafael Nadal has made an honest admission after watching the epic French Open final as a fan this month. Nadal was one of millions around the world captivated by the epic contest between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, which the Spaniard won 4-6 6-7(4) 6-4 7-6(3) 7-6(2) after saving three match points.

Dubbed the ‘King of Clay', 14 of Nadal's 22 major titles came at Roland Garros. This year signified the first time the tournament in Paris had taken place since his retirement last year. However, he's now insisted there were no cravings to be on court as he watched the epic drama unfold in the final.

Refuting suggestions that he would have loved to have been in the shoes of Alcaraz on the Court Philippe-Chatrier, Nadal said: “I don't feel like I would have liked to be there.

“I watched the tournament like any other fan, excited to see a place that was so important during my career and simply enjoying the tennis. This is my new reality, I don't look beyond that.”

Speaking from a charity golf tournament in Spain, Nadal did admit to being gripped as Alcaraz fought back from two sets down. However, despite voicing his pleasure at his compatriot winning his fifth Grand Slam title, he also warned it was no formality that he and Sinner would continue to dominate at the top level.

“It was a match for the ages,” he said. “I'm very happy for Carlos. It was a spectacular final, very exciting. Ending up with the cup after Sinner was so close to taking it for so long, I'm very happy for him.

“There will be Grand Slam champions every year, and each of them will tread their own path. New stars will always appear, and here we have two of them. They are two players who are head and shoulders above the rest at the moment.”

Alcaraz and Sinner have now won the last six Slam tournaments between them. That run dates back to September 2023 when Novak Djokovic prevailed at the US Open.

Rafael Nadal has opened up about his experience watching the thrilling French Open final as a spectator this month.

The match, which saw Carlos Alcaraz triumph over Jannik Sinner in a nail-biting 4-6, 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 7-6 victory after fending off three match points, had fans worldwide on the edge of their seats, including Nadal. Fellow tennis legend John McEnroe, who recently named the only player he'd pay to watch, hit the headlines during the French Open for turning up late for live TV coverage.

Known as the 'King of Clay' for his dominance at Roland Garros, where he won 14 of his 22 Grand Slam titles, Nadal observed the Paris tournament for the first time since hanging up his racket last year. Despite the intense action, Nadal insists he felt no longing to be back on the court.

He said: ""I don't feel like I would have liked to be there.

""I watched the tournament like any other fan, excited to see a place that was so important during my career and simply enjoying the tennis.

""This is my new reality, I don't look beyond that.""

While attending a charity golf event in Spain, Nadal acknowledged being captivated by Alcaraz's comeback from a two-set deficit.

He praised his fellow Spaniard's fifth Grand Slam win but cautioned that it's not guaranteed that Alcaraz and Sinner will maintain their dominance in the sport.

""It was a match for the ages,"" he said. ""I'm very happy for Carlos.

""It was a spectacular final, very exciting. Ending up with the cup after Sinner was so close to taking it for so long, I'm very happy for him.

""There will be Grand Slam champions every year, and each of them will tread their own path.

""New stars will always appear, and here we have two of them. They are two players who are head and shoulders above the rest at the moment.""

This win cements Alcaraz and Sinner's dominance in the sport, as they have now taken home the last six Grand Slam tournaments between them, a streak that started in September 2023 when Novak Djokovic won the U.S. Open.

Djokovic, who is chasing a record-extending 25th Grand Slam title, will look to end Alcaraz and Sinner's dominance at either Wimbledon or the U.S. Open later this year.

The eyes of the world are on SW19 for two weeks of the year when the best tennis players in the world compete at the only grass court Grand Slam.

Many would argue Wimbledon is the most prestigious of all four major titles and that brings with it plenty of pressure.

Now we've all lost our rag on the tennis court, but perhaps not as badly as Tarango did back in 1995.

Out on Court 13 in front of a few dozen spectators, the American was playing 117th ranked German Alexander Mronz.

Things were not going Tarango's way as he was trailing 7-6 (6), 3-1 and was serving at break point down.

He thought he had hit an ace, but the line judge quickly called the ball out. Chair umpire Bruno Rebeuh overruled the decision.

Instead of awarding the point to Tarango, he decided to replay the point. This sent the American into a meltdown.

He argued his case with the umpire and the spectators jeered at him and led him to yell out ‘shut up'.

Tarango's outburst led to a code violation warning and only sent his fury rising.

He was heard shouting: “You are the most corrupt official in the game and you can't do that.”

Another violation followed, this time leading to a point penalty.

By this point Tarango had had enough and picked up his bags and walked out.

“No way, that's it.” He could be heard yelling as he walked off court.

The bizarre incident saw him become the first player in Wimbledon history to default himself.

However, things turned a whole lot weirder.

His wife Benedicte gatecrashed his press conference and revealed she had slapped the umpire in the face.

Benedicte said: “I don't think it's bad, I think it's good. This guy can do whatever he wants because he's on the chair. Players have nobody to defend them in any situation.”

Tarango's facial expression hinted that he had been unaware of what had happened.

The American was fined and banned from Wimbledon for the following year.

The incident became the talk of the tournament with many top players asked for their opinions.

Seven-time singles champion Steffi Graf said: ""She must have a lot of guts to do that, and she must like her husband very much.

She added: “I don't think it's very appropriate. I think she must be - no, I don't want to say it - maybe a little out of her mind for a couple of minutes.""

In 2014, in an interview for Welovetennis.fr, Tarango stood by his view. 

He said: “It's a chain of suspicious decisions which, if you saw the entire match, could lead to only one conclusion: according to me, the match was fixed.”

In a celebration of Wimbledon heritage and iconic sportswear, adidas unveils The London Originals Collection ahead of the iconic London-based Grand Slam.

The 36-piece collection reimagines the timeless elegance of the world's oldest tennis tournament through a contemporary lens, channeling the longstanding history of its storied clubhouse and the enduring legacy of its all-white dress code. 

With modern tailoring, unexpected silhouettes, and architectural lines, the collection honors icons of tennis past, such as Stan Smith and the trefoil design he wore on his way to the Wimbledon title in 1972. 

Nostalgia meets innovation in every detail: open collars nod to 1970s courtside style while vivid green accents pay tribute to Wimbledon's grass lawns, embedded in the traditional adidas trefoil insignia and detail stitching. 

Argyle-inspired polo patterns and zips shaped like tennis balls add refinement to the kits, while discreet silhouettes like the traditional tennis dress ground the collection in tennis' sports heritage.  

""This collection is a curated balance of elevated design and technical precision,"" Kerryn Foster, GM adidas Specialist Sports, said in a press release. ""Modern yet timeless, it brings refined court style to life with versatile pieces that move effortlessly from high-performance play to everyday wear.""

While the collection is heavily rooted in 70s era styling, unconventional designs bring a modern edge to the kits. The women's Tennis Climacool Bodysuit ($140) builds upon the classic tennis dress and polo collar before devolving into shorts rather than a skirt. 

The romper style kit is unique in composition while paying tribute to the style legacies of Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova. 

Other women's styles include the Tennis Pro Climacool Polo Shirt ($70) as well as the Tennis Pro Climacool Tank Top ($70), both of which pair with either the Tennis Pro Climacool Pleated Skirt ($75) or the Tennis Pro Climacool Shorts ($70). 

The collections also offers a simple adidas tennis dress in the collection's color palette: the Tennis Pro Climacool Dress ($120).

The men's tennis shirts are similar to the women's in terms of design, with the Tennis Pro Climacool Tank Top ($75) in plain white with green contrast stitching and the Tennis Pro Climacool+ FreeLift Polo Shirt ($80) in the argyle-inspired pattern with the green trefoil. 

Bottoms include the Tennis Climacool Shorts Set ($80) and the Tennis Pro Climacool Ergo Shorts ($70), both of which can be mixed and matched with any of the men's tops. It's a simple yet elevated men's collection adhering to Wimbledon's dress code without producing dull, all-white kits. 

""Working within The London Originals Collection's tight color palette demands a heightened attention to detail – delivering depth through material, silhouette and crafted finishes,"" Foster said. ""Every piece stands strong on its own, but together, they tell a cohesive story.""

Additional statement pieces round out the collection. A two-piece maxi dress and men's long pants draw on bold volume and tailored silhouettes to bring elevated off-court apparel to the drop. 

A sports jacket with bold green stitching is the collection's signature piece, using adidas' snap button detailing on the sleeves for the option of a short sleeve warmup jacket. Everyday accessories like tennis bags, headbands, and visors round out the launch.

In 2022, Nick Kyrgios had his greatest ever run at a Grand Slam, making the final of Wimbledon, where he met Novak Djokovic. 

Kyrgios had enjoyed a career-best campaign at the championships, earning wins over Stefanos Tsitsipas, Brandon Nakashima and Cristian Garin to advance to the semi-finals of the tournament.

Scheduled to play Rafael Nadal in the final four, the Australian automatically advanced to the final after the Spaniard withdrew from the event prior to the match due to injury.

Having only reached the quarter-finals at majors previously, which he achieved in Melbourne and London earlier in his career, the match was the first Grand Slam final Kyrgios had made.

It was also the first time an Australian man had made the final of Wimbledon since 2003, a feat that Kyrgios said, prior to the clash with Djokovic, wasn't celebrated by tennis greats from his home nation. 

In his pre-final press conference, when asked about potentially joining the list of his compatriots to become champion at Wimbledon, Kyrgios said: “As for the greats of Australian tennis, they haven't always been the nicest to me personally. 

“They haven't always been supportive, and they havent been supportive these two weeks.

“So it's hard for me to read things that they say about me, when, for instance, when I saw Ashleigh Barty in the final of the Australian I was nothing but happy, and I would never say a bad word about an Australian making a final, like that's just mean.

“The only great that's been supportive of me the whole time has been Lleyton Hewitt. He's our Davis Cup captain, and he kind of knows that I do my own thing; he knows to keep his distance and let me do me.

“He sends me a message here and there [saying] ‘keep going', but it's pretty sad because I don't get any support from any of the other Australian tennis players; not the players, I mean, the past greats. 

“It's weird, they just have a sick obsession with just tearing me down for some reason. Whether they don't like me, or whether they're afraid, like, I don't know.

“It sucks because if it was roles reversed, and I saw de Minaur in the final or Jordan Thompson, I'd be pumped, I'd be stoked, I'd be having a pint watching and going nuts. 

“So shoutout to Lleyton I guess.”

Since his campaign at the All England Club in 2022, Kyrgios has only played in two Grand Slam events due to injuries he has sustained in recent years.

After ultimately losing to Djokovic in the Wimbledon final, he entered the US Open later that season, where he made the quarter-finals. 

He lost to Karen Khachanov over five sets in the last eight at Flushing Meadows, which would be the last match at a major he would play for over two years. 

Kyrgios' next, and most recent, appearance at a Grand Slam was at the Australian Open this year, where he crashed out in the first round to Britain's Jacob Fearnley. 

Despite announcing earlier in the season that he would play at Wimbledon, the former world number 13 has since withdrawn from the championships after another injury setback. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Taylor Fritz, on Sunday, won his fourth ATP Tour title on grass and ninth overall, as he beat World No. 3 Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6(0) to lift the Stuttgart trophy. While American produced a splendid show on serve in the rain-disrupted final to maintain his dominant recent record against the German, the result brought bad news for Novak Djokovic ahead of Wimbledon.

The reason simply boils down to ranking. Jack Draper, previously ranked fourth, failed to defend his crown in Stuttgart as he suffered an opening-round exit, and hence fell to the sixth position in the live rankings. While the fourth spot was Djokovic's for the taking, Fritz's unlikely victory saw the American move to the top four.

Fritz's move, hence, left Djokovic in the fifth spot. With the Serb not playing any tune-up event ahead of the Wimbledon, his ranking is likely to remain the same, implying that he could be in for a nightmarish draw at the SW19. His current ranking means that the 24-time Grand Slam winner could face either Jannik Sinner (No. 1), Carlos Alcaraz (2) or in-form Zverev (3) and Fritz (4) in the quarterfinal.

Djokovic still has the edge over the German, who he defeated comfortably in the Roland Garros quarterfinals earlier this month, and against Fritz, to whom he has never lost, but a potential spot in Alcaraz or Sinner's quarter could leave the former champion in danger of an early exit.

Djokovic is an eight-time Wimbledon champion and has reached the final in each of the seven times he has played in London since 2018—which includes four titles in a row and two consecutive defeats to Alcaraz.

Djokovic heads to London on the back of a semifinal exit at the Roland Garros earlier this month, where he lost to Sinner. An injury in Melbourne forced him to retire during the semifinal against Zverev in the Australian Open.

It's been a very tough season for Hubert Hurkacz. The Pole has been struggling to find the desired consistency and has been dealing with back issues since Miami. This was the reason he had to withdraw from the competition last week in Den Bosch and has led to his last-minute withdrawal from ATP Halle 2025. Hurkacz, who was on the same side of the draw as Jannik Sinner (potentially meeting in the quarterfinals), will lose the runner-up points from last season and, most importantly, will arrive at Wimbledon 2025 without being a seeded player. This makes him (assuming he's physically fit) one of the opponents to avoid in the first round. One more tough opponent to face in the draw of the third Grand Slam of the year.

Former tennis player Andy Murray will “bring his new show Centre Stage to four U.K. venues in the run-up” to Wimbledon 2025, according to Georg Szalai of the HOLLYWOOD REPORTER. Murray developed the “interactive live stage shows with a screen with video footage behind him with WME and its IMG Tennis team.” In the shows, Murray will “look back at his tennis career, sharing anecdotes and insights on life on tour, the circuit and beyond.” The show will be in three cities throughout the U.K. grass court season, kicking off with its debut on Wednesday in at the SEC Armadillo in Glasgow, the city where Murray was born. The show will travel to the Playhouse in Edinburgh the following day before heading to the Eventim Hammersmith Apollo in London on Saturday. The grand final is set for June 29, the night before the Wimbledon Championships, at the New Wimbledon Theatre. The WME and IMG team working on the show said that Murray “didn't simply want to be a talking head or analyst for a TV network or move into a similar traditional role for athletes once he retired from tennis.” IMG Tennis agent Chris Helliar said that the stage show will have a “rough structure, but ‘it definitely won't be scripted'” (HOLLYWOOD REPORTER, 6/16).","{'href': 'https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com', 'title': 'Sports Business Journal'}","tennis"

Last Word On Tennis

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

British tennis player Dan Evans has weighed in on the ongoing debate surrounding the demanding nature of the professional tennis calendar, urging his fellow players to show perspective and acknowledge the privileges of their profession.

Speaking before his match at Queen's Club, Evans was candid about his views, suggesting that players should be more mindful when complaining about their workload.

“I think first and foremost, we're in a fortunate position,” Evans said. “When I hear about the schedule, these guys don't have to play every week. You are allowed to not play.”

The World No. 59 noted that many players opt to participate in extra tournaments to secure end-of-year financial bonuses, rather than because they are forced to.

“The reason they play is so they pick up their bonus pool at the end of the year,” he explained.

After the remarks, the British tennis veteran delivered more than just a stunning 7-5 6-2 upset over World No. 13 Frances Tiafoe at the 2025 Queen's Club Championships to grab his first win against a Top 20 player since 2023.

While acknowledging that the Tour's demands can be intense, Evans stressed the importance of keeping things in perspective.

“We've got to be careful moaning about how we have a lot of work, which is good,” he added. “There are other people in the world who are struggling for work.”

He pointed out that professional tennis players operate as independent contractors and ultimately control their schedules.

“We are allowed to take weeks off. We are independent contractors. We can take the week off.” he emphasised.

Evans' Queen's performance seemed to prove his point. Despite a challenging year and a slip on these same courts in 2024 that jeopardised his season, he seized the moment as a wild card to grab his first win at the tournament since 2021.

US Open Fan Week 2025 returns from 18 to 23 August, offering free access to the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York, with a packed schedule of matches, player practices and fan activities. While general entry is free, select events will require a paid ticket or Fan Access Pass.

The heart of Fan Week lies in the US Open Qualifying Tournament, which kicks off on a Monday, 18 August. Over the course of four days, 128 men and 128 women will compete for a place in the main US Open draw. Matches begin at 11 a.m., with gates opening an hour earlier.

In addition to the qualifying rounds, fans will have the chance to witness some of the biggest names in tennis fine-tuning their game during practice sessions, many of which take place inside Arthur Ashe Stadium. Access to these sessions, however, will require a free Fan Access Pass, which can be obtained through the US Open app.

The week also features a variety of ticketed events, most notably the Stars of the Open showcase, scheduled for Thursday, 21 August at 7 p.m. This event combines tennis with entertainment, often featuring appearances by former champions and celebrities. Families will also be drawn to Arthur Ashe Kids' Day on Saturday, 23 August, which includes on-court activities and live performances tailored for younger audiences.

While the majority of Fan Week remains free and open to the public, tickets are required for certain headline events. Fans can purchase tickets for featured matches and exhibitions directly via the official US Open website.

For enhanced access, the Fan Access Pass allows entry into select stadium areas, including Ashe practice sessions and reserved seating zones. Registration for the 2025 pass is now open, and all adults are required to register individually — even if they've held a pass in previous years. Children may accompany a registered adult without needing their own pass.

Once registered, fans will receive a QR code via email or can retrieve it by logging into the Fan Access Hub.

Visitors are encouraged to arrive early, especially on the opening days of the tournament. With matches and events beginning at 11 a.m., arriving shortly after gates open at 10 a.m. provides the best chance to secure seating and avoid queues.

Fans are also advised to download the official US Open app, which includes the full event schedule, player practice times, and ticketing information. With warm weather expected in New York during August, appropriate sun protection, hydration and comfortable clothing are also essential.

With free entry, early glimpses of top-ranked players, and engaging off-court experiences, US Open Fan Week 2025 offers a rare opportunity to enjoy Grand Slam tennis without the premium price tag. Whether attending as a dedicated follower of the sport or bringing the family for a summer outing, the event remains a unique and accessible way to experience one of tennis's greatest stages.

 Goran Ivanisevic is more than familiar with the ups and downs of life on the ATP Tour. 

 A former No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings who famously won Wimbledon as a wild card after struggles for form and fitness led to him dropping down to No. 125, Ivanisevic now hopes his experience at tennis' top table can help bring Stefanos Tsitsipas back to the sport's elite. That remains a group where the Croatian coach firmly believes his new charge belongs. 

 “He is for me a Top 10 player any day,” Ivanisevic told ATPTour.com when asked about his excitement at working with Tsitsipas, a former World No. 3 who is now No. 25. “At the moment he lost that edge a little bit. A lot of things happened and now he has to find it back. 

 “I'm not a magician who can make it work after one week. It's a long process, but he's a great player. He was two times in Grand Slam finals and had so many great victories, so I'm not worried that it's not going to come back.”

 Ivanisevic was speaking after Tsitsipas hit with Tomas Martin Etcheverry on Saturday at the Terra Wortmann Open in Halle. It was the first practice for Ivanisevic and Tsitsipas together at a tournament — the Greek travelled to Zagreb for a few days following the start of their partnership after Roland Garros. 
 Tsitsipas, who is a 12-time ATP Tour champion, starts against Luciano Darderi on Monday at the German ATP 500, where the 26-year-old will look to rejuvenate a patchy 2025 season so far. Tsitsipas is 18-11 for the year, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, a tally highlighted by a title in Dubai. 
 “It's exciting to me because of his temperament,” said Ivanisevic, when asked what attracted him to work with Tsitsipas. “Greek, Croatian are pretty similar temperaments. He's a very aggressive player, which I like. I always liked the way he played, and his style. It's nice to see, and nice to put some input into his game, as a server, as a serve and volleyer. For me it's actually a huge challenge and hopefully it's going to work well.” 

 Tsitsipas could hardly have added a more experienced grass-court head to his camp ahead of Halle. As well as his 2001 Wimbledon title run, Ivanisevic also reached the final at SW19 on three other occasions, while he coached Novak Djokovic to three of his seven titles at the grass-court major. 
 Tsitsipas will hope Ivanisevic's presence can help him bolster his grass-court record, which stands at a moderate 22-17 but does include a title won in Mallorca in 2022. While it is statistically the Greek's least successful surface, Ivanisevic sees no reason why a player renowned for his big serve and punishing first-strike tennis cannot succeed on the grass. 
 “There is a lot to work with,” he said, when asked about Tsitsipas' potential on the surface. “Generally, he doesn't have good results on grass. I don't know why. It's only [mental]. If you put in your head, ‘I cannot play on grass', then you cannot play well, because grass doesn't forgive you anything. If you get pissed on grass, the grass gives you it back. You have to be nice to the grass. 
 “So there's lots of room to improve there. I can't say it will happen this week for sure, but generally he can play well on grass.”

Tatjana Maria and Elise Mertens set some new standards in their title runs last week on the Hologic WTA Tour. See those eye-catching stats, along with social buzz, hot shots and more in the Week in Review.

Just like that, here we are in the thick of grass-court season. And the opening week of the swing on the lawns already provided a number of engrossing stories and memorable moments on the Hologic WTA Tour.

With the long-awaited return of Queen's Club and the latest edition of 's-Hertogenbosch in the books, the stars of the WTA will continue on the turf as they march towards the grass-court Grand Slam at Wimbledon -- which is somehow only two weeks away.

Here is a look back at some of the highlights from last week on tour:

Tatjana Maria's journey to the WTA 500 HSBC Championships at the prestigious Queen's Club in London was significant for many reasons.

Any champion at the tournament would have been historic: this was the first time Queen's Club was part of the WTA calendar since 1973, 52 years ago.

But mother-of-two Maria was an especially notable winner considering the following stats:

Maria spoke after her big win: ""People were always saying, 'Oh, now maybe it's time. You are too old. You are...' Whatever reason they say sometimes. 

""I'm a good example that even in my age you still can win big trophies. I'm super proud of myself that I could win this tournament, because actually, I believed always in it, and my husband too. That's why we kept also going, because there was always this belief that I can win big tournaments and that I can do great things on the court.""

Meanwhile, at the Libema Open in 's-Hertogenbosch, Elise Mertens won her second title of the year. 

The historic part of Mertens' 's-Hertogenbosch run came in the semifinals, when she saved 11 match points in her comeback against two-time Libema Open champion Ekaterina Alexandrova. This is the most match points saved by any match-winner on tour during the 2020s.

With her latest title, Mertens bounced back from a three-set first-round loss to a wild card at Roland Garros -- but that narrow defeat seems very different in retrospect. That wild card was Lois Boisson, who went all the way to the semifinals.

There was more to this week beyond our two tour-level singles champions. Here are a few other players who deserve the spotlight:

Amanda Anisimova: The American was the last player to fall to Maria's slice-and-dice game at Queen's, but she still beat two Top 10 players at one event for the first time in her career. This was also her first career grass-court semifinal and final.

February's WTA 1000 Doha champion Anisimova has now made multiple finals in a calendar year for the first time. She reached a new career-high ranking of No. 13 on Monday.

Zheng Qinwen: Zheng also had a career-best grass-court run at Queen's, at last making her first quarterfinal and semifinal on that surface. The Chinese star is up to a new career-high ranking of No. 4 on Monday.

Elena-Gabriela Ruse: The Romanian clinched a spot in her fourth career WTA singles final this past week, making the Libema Open showpiece as a qualifier. Her ranking skyrockets from No. 80 to No. 58.

Iva Jovic, Tereza Valentova and Nuria Parrizas Diaz: In another busy week on the WTA 125 circuit, veteran Parrizas Diaz and teenagers Jovic and Valentova were the singles champions. Read more here.

A few of the WTA's best branched out into different fields this week. First, Ukraine's top player Elina Svitolina released a new capsule clothing collection, co-created with Ukrainian fashion designer Svitlana Bevza.

And former World No. 1 players Serena and Venus Williams announced they will launch a video podcast in August. Working in a partnership with social media platform X, the legendary sisters will co-host the project.

You ready @Venuseswilliams - let's go get 'em! https://t.co/PrPFjo01Tf

At Queen's Club, runner-up Amanda Anisimova and qualifier Anastasia Zakharova executed two of the top plays of the week:

And in 's-Hertogenbosch, Elisabetta Cocciaretto punctuated her semifinal run with a superb overhead:

The grass-court swing continues with two more key Hologic WTA Tour events on the Road to Wimbledon.

Berlin: Draws | Scores | Order of play | 411 | Draw reaction

One of the most stacked fields of the year thus far will contest the WTA 500 Berlin Tennis Open by HYLO. Nine of the Top 10 players in the PIF WTA Rankings will contend for the trophy in Germany's capital.

World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, reigning French Open champion Coco Gauff, and defending champion Jessica Pegula are the Top 3 seeds. Main-draw play starts Monday.

Nottingham: Draws | Scores | Order of play

Also beginning on Monday is the WTA 250 Lexus Nottingham Open. British hope Katie Boulter will be back in an attempt to defend her title, with Queen's Club champion Tatjana Maria and No. 1 seed Beatriz Haddad Maia also in the field.

“I am really happy, as I lost a few finals before,” Pellegrino told Tennis.com. “I came here with different expectations. I played well the entire week and I am really happy to win the title.”Pellegrino only dropped the very first set of the week against Italian qualifier Gabriele Piraino. From then on, the Bisceglie native enjoyed a fantastic run of form. “The first match was really tough. I didn't play well in the beginning. But I took the opportunity to win this match and afterwards my level increased match by match.“Winning the title here in Perugia is very special. I really like the tournament. It's my seventh time here and I always played well but couldn't win it. But I am a different player now and I am really happy.”

Trungelliti triumphs in LyonMarco Trungelliti of Argentina captured his first title of the season by lifting the trophy of the Open Sopra Steria in Lyon, France. The No. 8 seed of the ATP Challenger 100 clay-court event outlasted Spaniard Daniel Merida 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 in the singles final. It's his fourth ATP Challenger Tour career crown and first since the Rwanda Challenger in Kigali last March.""I'm quite happy with the way I played and, above all, with the mental approach I had during the match,"" said Trungelliti after his win. ""I was very close to taking the second set, I had a break point at 4-2 to serve for 5-2 and suddenly, he started playing really well. At that moment, I felt a bit overwhelmed. Maybe I made one or two mistakes when serving at 5-4, but nothing major that would justify such a drop in rhythm.""Then, in the third set, he started a little slower, just like he did at the end of the previous set, and that gave me some breathing room. I stayed calm and felt that, at some point, either I would play better on the match points or he would eventually miss, which is what happened in the end.""

The key factors behind Norris and Piastri's Canada crash

Fernando Alonso and George Russell were quick to praise Robert Kubica's efforts in the wake of the Canadian Grand Prix, as the Polish driver and his fellow team mates took victory in the famous Le Mans 24 Hours while the F1 were stars were racing in Montreal.

Kubica, Phil Hanson and Yifei Ye won in the satellite #83 AF Corse Ferrari 499P LMH, with the former F1 star completing a mighty final stint to ensure victory for his team. He completed the final 59 laps without a functioning drinks bottle, and was behind the steering wheel for 43% of the race.

While Kubica's F1 career never reached the heights it once seemed destined to following a horrific 2011 rallying crash, winning the illustrious Le Mans is just reward for a driver once described by Fernando Alonso as “the best” he'd faced.

CANADA LOWDOWN: All the key moments as Norris and Piastri collide, Russell shines and F1 ACADEMY puts on a show

His win at Le Mans follows that of Alonso himself, who triumphed back in 2018 and 2019 when he took a hiatus from F1 racing. And the Spaniard was swift to congratulate his former rival on social media.

“Bravo Robert,” Alonso posted, with Russell – fresh from triumphing in Canada – adding his own praise.

“Congrats mate on winning Le Mans, so happy for you!!” Russell wrote on social media. The British star was Kubica's team mate at Williams when the Pole attempted an F1 comeback in 2019 following his rally crash, which severely injured his right arm.

Kubica's career has always been one of huge highs and crushing lows. He suffered a shocking crash in Canada in 2007 when driving for BMW, before going on to win that race the following season – which ended up being his only F1 victory.

HIGHLIGHTS: Watch the action from the Canadian GP as Russell clinches victory while Norris and Piastri collide

So, it seemed apt that his Le Mans win coincided with the Canadian Grand Prix, and that his last team mate in F1 managed to take the win in Montreal.

Winning Le Mans in a Ferrari is especially poetic for Kubica, who reportedly had a contract to join the Scuderia in 2012 – only for his rallying crash to end put paid to his Ferrari F1 dreams.

“An all time moment for Robert Kubica,” F1 commentator Alex Jacques wrote, echoing the sentiments of many. “His dreams of racing for Ferrari in F1 were dashed by a horror crash which would have ended most careers, a lost LMP2 win on the last lap in '21 added more heartbreak, today a comeback for the ages is complete. Congrats to the whole #83 entry”.

Ferrari team boss Fred Vasseur knows Kubica well from their time together at Alfa Romeo when Kubica was the team's reserve driver, and was another who wanted to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the popular racer.

“I have a close relationship with Robert, he stayed with me a couple of years at Alfa Romeo and before in F3 Formula Renault,” Vasseur explained after the Canadian Grand Prix.

“For me, he's an extra-terrestrial. What he's doing is mega and to win in Le Mans in this situation and to be the leader of the car, to [lead] the team, it's something that I can't imagine.

“I'm very, very pleased for Robert. He had a chaotic career in motorsport, and when you see the level of effort that he put into his career, I'm very, very pleased for him to have this kind of result today.”

Russell made a great start and led throughout the entire race, bar the pit stop periods. Mercedes nailed his two-stop strategy and Russell did not put a foot wrong to convert pole to the win, his first of the year. Antonelli also had a brilliant getaway, a bold move on Piastri making his race. He ran third from there, and came close to picking off Verstappen at times. He came under huge pressure from Piastri late on, but defended superbly to pick up his first career podium and become the third-youngest driver to stand on the rostrum.

George Russell, 1st

""I am really pleased to take the team's first victory of the season. I felt in control throughout and was able to manage the race to bring home the win. With the slightly higher temperatures, we thought we may struggle a little more than we saw on Friday. We did a good job of managing the tyres though and had the pace to hold off the chasing pack. A big well done and thank you to everyone at Brackley and Brixworth and a massive congratulations to Kimi on taking his first of what I am sure will be many podiums.

""We look to have made a step forward with our car in recent races. We have typically gone well in Montreal though and we knew this race would likely suit us a little more than others. We can't get ahead of ourselves as there is still plenty of work for us to do to get into the fight for victories more regularly. I am looking forward to trying to do that next time out in Austria.""

Kimi Antonelli, 3rd

""That was a very intense and stressful race! I am really happy to take my first podium in F1 though. The start was the key to achieving that. I managed to get track position on Piastri and that enabled us to show our pace. At moments I was able to catch Verstappen and put him under pressure. In the final stint, I think I pushed a little too hard in the early stages and that made it difficult near the end. I was able to defend from the McLarens though and bring the car home in P3.

""I want to say thank you to everyone at Brackley and Brixworth. They have been working so hard to improve the car and I am glad to be able to get a result like this and have both our cars on the podium. It is a special moment for me personally and I am looking forward to building on it in the coming races.""

Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport

""That was a superb race by the team and both drivers today. George was absolutely faultless at the front. He controlled the race throughout and didn't put a foot wrong. It was another assured performance of which we have seen many so far this season. He was quick on both compounds and didn't come under threat after the first corner. Kimi meanwhile drove his own great race. He made a strong start and that set him up for the rest of the race. He nearly managed to get second and then battled and defended well in the closing stages to hold off the McLarens. He fully deserved to get on the podium and his first top three finish which I am sure there will be many more of.

""We've taken a positive forward step this weekend. The track temperature today was nearly 50°C but we managed to look after the tyres well and combine that with good pace. We know that there is more for us to do for this to be a consistent level of performance each and every race. That is what we are focused on doing though and we look forward to the upcoming races to continue that momentum.""

Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director

""Our first race win and double podium of the year are a fantastic reward at the end of a strong weekend. George put in a faultless drive and controlled the race from the front - it was a truly accomplished performance. For Kimi, scoring his first podium is another major milestone in his first half-season as an F1 driver, and he did it under some serious pressure from the championship leader, too.

""After Friday's long runs, we hoped that we could keep ourselves in the mix across the race distance, and so it proved today. We were competitive in terms of our tyre usage on both the Medium and Hard compounds, and able to build useful gaps to Red Bull and McLaren when it mattered. After a difficult triple header, this was a great way to bounce back and reward the hard work that both factories have put into improving the car. We know that some of the circuit characteristics suited us this weekend, but it nonetheless feels like we've made some good learnings. There are still weaknesses we need to improve on but we are working hard to do that and to continue fighting at the sharp end of the field.""

1 / 3

Verstappen was unable to pick Russell off at the start, but kept a close watch on the Mercedes. Unfortunately, running in the dirty air cost him and forced Red Bull to pit early. His second stint was not much better, but in his final stint he did manage to get a bit closer to Russell. In the end, Verstappen settled for second, close but no cigar. As for Tsunoda, he started P18 after his penalty and went for a long one-stop race. Running the hard tyre for the majority, he couldn't quite make it back to the top 10, to make it a run of three races without points.

Max Verstappen, 2nd

“Today we definitely maximised everything that we had available. We drove quite a defensive race today and it was quite tough out there. The tyre degradation was quite high and in the first two stints we were going through the tyres quite quickly. We were quite aggressive with our strategy to stay ahead and during the last pit stop I thought it might be difficult to make it to the end. The last stint helped us a bit with the lighter fuel load and we were a bit more kind on the tyres which was positive. If you look at the whole race this was the maximum result possible. We didn't really have the pace to fight upfront and had a bit too much degradation to be in the fight for the win, so I'm happy to be P2. The gap wasn't big to George but didn't think I had the pace to fight for the win. There are lots of positives from the weekend: as a Team we did the best performance possible, got it right and our car was in a decent window. Looking to the next race we have a bit of work to do with our tyre management and the degradation but lots of positives to take forward.""

Yuki Tsunoda, 12th

“The pace felt okay today so we were able to make up some positions after starting in P18. On the medium tyre I was in more traffic and just couldn't maximise in the dirty air, the safety car also was not at the best time for our race. It was at least a clean race after a messy day yesterday, and we made some improvements and upgrades to the car this weekend so we are going in a positive direction. This was the best we could achieve today, but I want more. I'm looking forward to debriefing with the Team, resetting, and then going to Austria next as it is a track I really like. My focus is on building up the confidence and trust in the car and hopefully can get good results in Austria in front of a home crowd.""

Christian Horner, Team Principal

""It was a good race by Max today, he was competitive from start to finish, so it's been a solid day in the Drivers' Championship and those are good points for Max. We were competitive in the last stint and there were probably points in the race we could have maybe pushed a bit harder, but certainly that final stint was pretty competitive. We will focus on the race and take the positives out of it. McLaren obviously had a difficult race in the end today and you have to be there to capitalise on it in the end, you can only focus on yourselves. McLaren have two guys racing hard and they have actually done quite well that it's taken 10 races for something like that to happen. That is racing and on days like that you have to try and take advantage. Mercedes have done a good job here this weekend and it just shows how things can shift around. Well done to them and well done to George, we will fight back at the next one. I thought as a Team we did a good job today and got everything out of it that we could. Yuki drove a good race on a one stop today and he was unlucky not to get points in the end.""

1 / 2

Piastri lost a place off the line to Antonelli, which hampered the rest of his race. Try as he might, he could not get back past the Mercedes. Norris meanwhile had started on the hard tyre and ran a long first stint. But not long enough to make a one-stop race work, the result being both McLarens on the same strategy and the same hard tyres late on as Norris hounded Piastri, who in turn was chasing Antonelli.

Norris made a move and got his team mate in the hairpin, Piastri retaliated and got back past, and then it all went wrong as Norris misjudged the distance to the Australian and swiped the rear of his car. That sent Norris into the wall and out of the race, while Piastri limped home. The two immediately cleared the air, with Norris accepting full responsibility. The stewards handed him a five-second time penalty for the incident.

Oscar Piastri, 4th

“It was a tricky race. It wasn't my best start and then we were a little on the backfoot from there. In the second half of the race, the pace was good, it was just tough to overtake. We come away with 12 points which is what we could have maximised today.”

Lando Norris, DNF

“Our number one rule is to not make contact with your team-mate, and unfortunately that is what happened today. I apologise to Oscar and the team. I thought I had a small opportunity, but with hindsight, I should never have gone for that move. I've paid the price and I'm glad nothing adverse happened to Oscar. I will put it behind me and learn from today's mistake to come back stronger as a team in Austria.”

Andrea Stella, Team Principal

“A challenging weekend for the team both in terms of performance and in terms of the outcome. From a performance point of view, we managed to improve the competitiveness of the MCL39 thanks to the good work of the team and the drivers. In the race we were able to stay in contention for a podium finish, but we didn't have the advantage that we have experienced in previous races this season. We now have a few things to review to make sure we get back in contention to win races at the upcoming events.

“In terms of outcome, for the first time this season we scored points with only one car. Lando, after a strong recovery in the race, was in fact involved in an accident while challenging Oscar, which put him out of the race. This resulted in contact between the two cars due to a misjudgement by Lando.

“The team appreciated that Lando immediately took responsibility for a situation which has cost him important points in the Championship. We will now regroup, take our time to review a few things and make sure we come back stronger, and continue what has been an extremely positive season so far.”

Ferrari split their strategies, Hamilton starting on the mediums, Leclerc the hards. Unfortunately for the former, he picked up floor damage which cost him lap time from an early stage. Leclerc ran a long first stint and even led at one stage, but the team opted to pit for more hards – converting the Ferrari man to a two-stop race. Leclerc did not have the pace to climb back to the top cars, but he did beat his team mate who was struggling with that damage.

Charles Leclerc, 5th

""P5 was the best we could do today. We could maybe have tried to do something different with the strategy, but at the end of the day, it wouldn't have changed much for the outcome of the race. Most of all, our starting position was what put us at a disadvantage.

""It's quite a specific track, so I don't think that too much of what we saw in terms of performance will carry on to the coming races. We will regroup and come back stronger.""

Lewis Hamilton, 6th

""P6 is a good result considering the cards we were dealt today. The car felt good in the opening laps and I was optimistic about what we could do, but unfortunately we picked up significant damage early on which cost us a lot of downforce. From that point, it was tough to manage the balance and pace, and some brake issues in the middle stint made things even harder. We're not where we need to be, but we're fully focused on the steps we need to take to compete at the front. That's our priority heading into Austria.""

Fred Vasseur, Team Principal

""I believe the main issue this weekend is that we made too many mistakes and had too many issues right from FP1, when we lost one car, then came a mistake in qualifying and in the race Lewis lost a good amount of points of downforce early on after unfortunately hitting a small animal that ran onto the track which damaged the front part of the floor. If I could replay the weekend I would choose not to have missed FP2 with one car as it meant we were unable to long stint the tyres and that was our main issue today. And that's how you end up P5 and P6. We have to take some positives from the weekend, starting with our pace in quali. Yesterday Charles had the fastest first sector before having to abort the lap and our race pace is not far off the quickest, but when you don't put everything together you find yourself in traffic. I am sure we will get a break soon, we just need a clean weekend. If we put everything together we can do it.""

1 / 2

Alonso opted not to defend too hard from Norris early on, but was still running solidly in the top 10. His first pit stop dropped him into traffic and forced him to play the long game, but he worked his way back into the points. Keeping out of trouble, he came home a season's best P7. Stroll had a more difficult race on home soil. He was handed a 10-second penalty for forcing Gasly wide onto the grass when battling for the lower positions, and serving that dropped him further down the order.

Fernando Alonso, 7th

""It was a good race for us today. I felt happy with the car and as expected managing the tyres was difficult. We went into the race and knew eighth position would be more our realistic pace and I couldn't keep the faster cars behind. It seems our race pace is not as competitive as Qualifying and it's something which we need to look into going forward. Let's see if anything comes from the investigations later and we'll look ahead to Austria and our home race in Silverstone.""

Lance Stroll, 17th

""It's been a long rough day and I'm not so pleased with this weekend overall. It was always going to be difficult starting the race from P17, but I also didn't feel like the car had the pace today to make up any positions. We go again in Austria in two weeks time. We will work hard to find areas of improvement in all areas until then.""

Andy Cowell, Team Principal

""A good step forward for us here in Montreal as we mark our 100th race as a team. Fernando finished P7, his highest of the season, scoring some well-deserved points for the team. We stuck to our Plan A strategy and executed it well.

""It was good to have Lance back in the car this weekend. Today was challenging for him after an unlucky Qualifying. We need to learn from this weekend to help improve the feel of the car for him.

""We are determined to keep pushing in all areas as we head to Austria in two weeks' time.""

1 / 2

Hulkenberg continued where he left off in Spain, with his second points score in a row. Despite starting outside the top 10, a good start and solid first few laps saw him climb up through the order. He pulled off a couple of strong overtakes too, and made a one-stop strategy work as he grabbed more valuable points for his team as they continue to chase Aston Martin in the Championship. Bortoleto had a busy race fighting in the midfield, coming home 14th.

Nico Hulkenberg, 8th

“I'm really happy with today's result - another strong race and more points on the board, which is always satisfying. I was able to stay out of trouble and take advantage of some battling ahead between Franco [Colapinto] and Alex [Albon] into Turn 8, which allowed me to gain a couple of positions exiting Turn 9. From there, it was about tyre management and maintaining consistent pace, making sure we executed the race cleanly.

“We've now shown competitive pace at two very different circuits which also means the recent update has been a clear step forward. Especially under race condition our car was more consistent, better balanced, and overall much more predictable to drive. That kind of stability really allows you to push when it counts.”

Gabriel Bortoleto, 14th

""It was a tough weekend overall for me, but I am pleased to see the team score again. We were very close to Q2 in qualifying, but not making the cut yesterday compromised our Sunday: starting from P15 with faster cars like the Williams, Red Bull, and RB behind made it difficult. I had to push a lot on the tyres to keep ahead, and that in turn affected how the race progressed for me. We tried a strategy with a long first stint on the hard tyre, hoping for a Safety Car that came far too late, and once you're 20 seconds back after a pit stop, there's only so much you can recover, even on fresh tyres. I feel there was more potential - we could've gained another couple of positions on pace alone - but we need to understand what more we can do to start scoring points.

“Nico is doing a great job again, probably extracting all this car has to give, but knowing how close we are on a Saturday shows that our performance is close. We're usually within half a tenth of each other in qualifying but, in this midfield, that can make a huge difference, as we've seen in the last couple of weekends. I think I'm extracting the pace, but I also need to learn how to maximise outcomes over the course of the race, and this will come with experience, weekend after weekend. I'm not going to complain—it's about reviewing everything, learning, and coming back stronger. We've made progress since Barcelona, even if this track didn't suit us as much, and I'm confident we're going in the right direction.""

Jonathan Wheatley, Team Principal

""It's a fantastic atmosphere within the team tonight after a really strong performance here in Canada. Both drivers got off the line well, and Nico in particular showed great awareness and racecraft on lap one - holding back just enough to avoid the early chaos and seizing the opportunity to gain two places. From there, he delivered a composed and intelligent drive. Starting on the medium compound, our switch to the hard tyre proved to be spot on. It ultimately paid off as Nico brought it home in P8 under the Safety Car, delivering back-to-back points for the team, which is a big achievement and a milestone we hadn't reached since Canada 2023.

“Gabriel had a tougher run, from further back but still put in a solid stint on the hards - battling through graining, traffic, and some intense racing to finish a respectable P14.

“The team has delivered another strong performance today. Strategically, our calls were right on the mark, the pit crew executed clean and efficient stops, and most importantly, we've once again shown that we have a race car capable of fighting in the midfield. Credit also goes to the wider team back in Hinwil - their hard work is starting to translate into results on track. Together with Mattia, it's been great to build momentum, and we're all looking forward to carrying that energy into the European races.""

Haas tried to make a one-stop race work with both drivers, despite starting them on different compounds. It worked out for Ocon, who ran long on the hards and made his mediums last to the end as he picked up two vital points. Bearman spent much of his afternoon in traffic before he chucked on some softs under the late Safety Car in case of any racing laps, eventually coming home P11.

Esteban Ocon, 9th

“I'm pleased with all the work the team has done this weekend; we maximised our potential because it wasn't clear-cut that our strategy was going to be better before the race, but it paid off to take the risk today. We managed to deliver a solid race, achieve good laps in clear air which was important, so we overcut quite a lot of cars, and then we brought the car home. It's a good reward for the team to get something out of our 200th race, and to seize the opportunity as they don't come every day.”

Oliver Bearman, 11th

“Honestly, we had more pace in the car today than it looked, but with the strategy we got stuck in traffic with other people starting on the hard tyre. In a DRS train it's really hard to overtake, so we had a lot more pace and once I got into free air, we had that, but I spent the race stuck. There could've been a bit more today, but I'm happy the team scored points in their 200th race.""

Ayao Komatsu, Team Principal

“Overall, it was a good result for the team today to score P9 with Esteban coming from P14. We decided to split strategy between Ollie and Esteban, and what Ollie faced today – starting on mediums and getting stuck behind hard starters – was one scenario that could happen, so that was the case and it didn't work for him. Esteban's strategy, which was actually slower on paper, was great. I think both drivers drove very well today; Ollie was frustrated behind traffic but he clearly had the speed, and Esteban's tyre management was perfect and he didn't make any mistakes. We showed that we have strong race pace, but next race we need to put it all together from FP1 and qualify well.”

1 / 2

Williams scraped one point today from another tricky race. Albon was forced wide on the opening lap, bouncing across the grass and losing a handful of places. He was then informed of a Power Unit issue, and missed his opportunity to pit early on. That left him betwixt and between a one or two-stop race, but in the end it was immaterial as he had to retire with that PU problem. Sainz ran a one-stop strategy after starting on the hards, and despite one hairy lock-up that saw him nearly collect Bearman, he managed to make it home in P10.

Alex Albon, DNF

""It's been a frustrating one today. We retired with the PU issue, but the race was already over for us. I struggled on the first lap, and then we tried to make a one stop work, but with the graining today it was really hard to manage the tyres. Sometimes you can drive around it but not today. Race strategy is also something we are usually strong at, but we struggled today and that's not to blame the team, but it just wasn't quite there, so we'll have a look at it and come back stronger next time.""

Carlos Sainz, 10th

""Good to at least score one point today, but I'm pretty frustrated as I spent the race managing an issue, so I couldn't even compete properly. We did a good job to bring the car home and save a point but, as a team, we need to avoid these situations. We didn't show our maximum potential this weekend for one reason or the other and with such a tight field, it obviously affects the final outcome. We'll regroup and go back at it again in Europe in a couple of weeks.""

James Vowles, Team Principal

""A really strong race from Carlos. He showed great race pace under difficult circumstances, managing a number of aspects of the car, and he did a brilliant job to come home and bring another valuable point to the team. After Alex got pushed back at the start, his race was a lot more difficult. Ultimately it was a DNF, which we need to understand, but he had potential to fight back through the field again and pick up points. What it demonstrates is we need perfect weekends executed against this very tight midfield in order to score points and we haven't been executing as well as we could do. However, still an important point today for our Championship battle.""

1 / 2

Colapinto's race unravelled early. He lost a place early on to a feisty Hulkenberg, and when he pitted for the first time, found himself stuck in traffic. From there, he just could not find a way back to the top 10. The team had Gasly on a one-stop strategy and enacted team orders to let Colapinto pass when he pitted a second time, but it was all to no avail. As for the Frenchman, he could only recover to P15 from his pit lane start.

Pierre Gasly, 15th

“We have lots to review after today's race. It was always going to be difficult starting from the Pit Lane after tactical changes to the car under parc ferme conditions. We tried something a little different on strategy and, in the end, it was a frustrating afternoon being stuck behind cars and struggling on the straights to make any overtakes. We need to aim to start higher up on the grid as for sure we can be much more competitive with better track position. I think our pace was decent when we had clean air but, unfortunately, we were just stuck too long in traffic. We will regroup and aim to have a better weekend in Austria next time out.”

Franco Colapinto, 13th

“A tough afternoon for us and certainly not what we expected or wanted. We put ourselves in a good position starting from tenth on the grid and I had a good start to the race to overtake some cars on the first lap. Of course, from there, points are the target and we were a bit unfortunate on strategy and reaching traffic, which impacted our race. I do think the car had good pace today and we need to understand what we can do better next time. It's a very tough track, one we expected to be challenging for us, so we can certainly take positives from some parts of the weekend. I am happy with the progress I made through the weekend despite the end result and for sure I want to continue that into Austria.”

1 / 2

It was a day to forget for Racing Bulls in Canada. Lawson started from the pit lane with a raft of new Power unit components, and yet wound up retiring the car with an issue detected with his PU. Hadjar was going for a one-stop strategy, but ran out of tyre life late on and swapped to the softs a couple of laps before the Safety Car came out. That dropped him down the order, and ended his run of top 10 finishes.

Isack Hadjar, 16th

""It was a difficult Sunday here in Montréal. I had high graining on the medium tyres at the start of the race and unfortunately, I think we pitted a little bit too late, which made us lose a few places. After that, I just got stuck in a DRS train for the rest of the race, and towards the end, we didn't really have much pace and therefore got past from other cars. Since the start of the weekend we've been struggling a bit with the car, so we'll review everything together with the team and we'll get back pushing always more in Austria in two weeks time.”

Liam Lawson, DNF

“It was always going to be a difficult race starting from the pit lane, but we took the decision to install a new PU after a tough Quali yesterday. A cooling issue towards the end of today's race meant we unfortunately had to retire, which is a shame given the pace of the car this weekend was good. We'll keep working on the speed and I'll keep working on myself to reset ahead of Austria.""

Laurent Mekies, Team Principal

“We arrived in Montréal with good expectations after three very strong weekends in Europe. However, we knew how tough this circuit is and how intense the battle in the midfield would be. Yesterday's Qualifying was another strong performance for Isack who qualified P9 before he got penalized. The mistake was on our side as we failed to give him the right information about Carlos coming behind. Everything started to become a bit more difficult today with Isack starting in P12 and Liam from the pit lane, as we took the opportunity to introduce a new PU on his car after a difficult result in Qualifying. The hard fact is that we didn't have enough pace today to fight in the top ten. Isack suffered high graining on his tyres during the first stint on the mediums and sadly we had to retire Liam's car due to an issue in the cooling system. It's a tight battle in the midfield and even only one-tenth can make the difference, and today it was enough to drop back instead of attacking forward. Looking back at the last few months, every single improvement we've made as a team has been made after tough weekends like this one in Canada. We certainly take some positives from this weekend and the fight is on, so we'll keep pushing all together in Faenza and Milton Keynes to come back stronger. Hopefully, we'll be able to do it straight away at our next home race in Austria in a couple of weeks.”

1 / 2

Mario Isola, Motorsport Director

“A very closely contested race from start to finish, as can be understood from the fact that when the Safety Car came out, the top five drivers were separated by less than seven seconds, with just four laps to go to the chequered flag.

""In terms of strategy, the two-stop proved to be fastest with the Hard compound being the most effective. Making one stop was possible but, honestly, it was really only an option for those starting from the back half of the grid who therefore had less to lose. Those starting from the front rows were able to push in all stints thus giving rise to a very hard fought race, with notable differences in stint length and in the sequence of compound use. The most effective tyre was the Hard, even if we had little data on it available, given that during Friday free practice only Sauber used it. The Medium probably suffered a bit because of the temperatures being higher than on the first day.

HIGHLIGHTS: Watch the action from the Canadian GP as Russell clinches victory while Norris and Piastri collide

""This was the third event of the year which featured the C6. Clearly, we will now carefully analyse all the data gathered here to work out if and how to use it again this season after the summer break. Here too we saw that the difference in outright performance between the newcomer and the C5 is relatively small – one to one and half tenths – but, as we predicted yesterday, having a wider range of compounds allowed the team a greater range of strategic options. Honestly, if we did not have the C6, we would have had to bring the same trio as last year, namely C3, C4 and C5, and it's probable that would have produced a more linear race with just the one pit stop.

""Finally, let me say that, as an Italian, I was very happy to see one of our compatriots on the podium. It's the first time it's happened since Pirelli returned to Formula 1 in 2011 and interestingly, the last time an Italian driver finished in the top three in a car running our tyres was also here in Montreal in 1991, when Stefano Modena in a Tyrrell-Honda finished second, behind winner Nelson Piquet in a Benetton-Ford, also fitted with Pirellis.

""Our work continues next week with an important test for 2026 wet weather tyre development. Working with Ferrari, we will be using their Fiorano track where Zhou Guanyu will drive on 19 June, followed by Charles Leclerc on 20th.""

The juror said he spends the week in his Bronx apartment and weekends with his daughter in New Jersey, which was not made clear previously. 


							By 

	Kevin Dolak



	After a week of arguments between prosecutors and the rap mogul's defense team, a juror in Sean “Diddy” Combs' sex trafficking and racketeering trial has been dismissed after the Southern District of New York judge overseeing proceedings announced there were discrepancies in where the juror resides, saying he showed a “lack of candor” with the court.


	U.S. District Court Judge Arun Subramanian dismissed Juror No. 6 on Monday morning after telling the court that “concerns about his candor and whether he shaded answers to get on and stay on the panel” led to his decision. Whether Juror No. 6, a Black male, lives within New York and, therefore, in the bounds of the Southern District of New York, or lives with his girlfriend in New Jersey, was the question. He had indicated New York residency in jury selection, but was overheard discussing residing in New Jersey at one point. Upon questioning, he said he lives in his Bronx apartment during the week and spends weekends in New Jersey with his daughter and her mother.

	“There are serious questions about the juror's candor and the juror's ability to follow the court's instructions,” Subramanian said, emphasizing that an individual who appears to have a personal agenda must not sit on a jury. “Removal of the juror is required, in this court's view.”




			Related Video		







	The dismissal of the juror is another win for federal prosecutors. Last week, lead prosecutor Maurene Comey had requested that the juror be dismissed for what she described as “a lack of candor.” Combs' defense team is crying foul and, for a third time, has asked for a mistrial, pointing out that the dismissed juror is of the same gender and race as the defendant. In a letter to the judge from the entire defense team, they wrote that the jurors' inconsistencies over his residence were “likely completely benign.”

	











	Add their statement, “The government's motion must be evaluated in light of the entire history of this investigation and prosecution, and not in isolation. Unfortunately, when considered against that background, it is impossible to believe that this motion is merely a good-faith attempt to raise a valid question about the juror's integrity rather than an effort to take advantage of an opportunity to strike yet another Black male from the jury.”


	The alternate juror who will replace Juror No. 6 is a 57-year-old white male accountant from Westchester County in New York.


	Meanwhile, questions have arisen around another juror hearing the case, this time over conversations he may have had with a colleague. Judge Subramanian questioned the juror on Friday and gave him his phone. As of Monday morning, no determination has been made on his potential dismissal.


	Combs was arrested in September and is facing five criminal counts in the federal trial, which has now entered its sixth week after a May 5 start date. The charges include one count of racketeering in conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty and denied all charges.


	The trial was originally said to last eight weeks and appears to be running on time, despite this and other setbacks. Prosecutors were expected to rest their case on Wednesday and Judge Subramanian has consistently said he wants to have the case to the jury and ideally have it wrapped up before the July 4 holiday.

CNN's Scott Jennings remains, however, as IDF issues evacuation warnings to Tehran and both sides claim casualties and injuries in the hundreds.


							By 

	Seth Abramovitch


Senior Writer


	Amid Israel's rapidly escalating armed conflict with Iran, now in its fourth day, transgender influencer and Olympic gold medalist Caitlyn Jenner has managed to escape the country on Sunday.


	Jenner, 75, had been in Tel Aviv as guest of honor of the city's gay pride festivities, which were called of after Israel began a series of strikes on Tehran on Friday, killing top military officials and nuclear scientists, as well as eradicating several nuclear facilities.




	All airspace was closed as Iran responded with a barrage of ballistic missiles aimed at highly populated areas in cities like Tel Aviv and Haifa. Jenner was able to leave the country by land and cross into neighboring Jordan, whose air space has been intermittently open and closed throughout the conflict, according to a report from The Times of Israel.

	From there, Jenner plans to fly back home to Los Angeles. The Hollywood Reporter could not immediately confirm the details of Jenner's movements with her L.A.-based representatives.


	Jenner arrived at Ben Gurion Airport on Thursday, part of a much-publicized good will trip that saw her embraced by the Israeli government amid its three-year conflict with Hamas. During the missile assaults, she posted several updates conveying her support for Israel and its people. 


	“What an incredible way it has been to celebrate Shabbat. I am here in Israel, in Tel Aviv with you all. I am a friend, advocate, ally,” Jenner posted to X. 


	On Instagram, Jenner posted a striking photo of Tel Aviv's skies lit up by the country's Iron Dome defense system intercepting Iranian missiles. 

	











	“A ‘quiet' night in Tel Aviv. There is not a place I'd rather be, than with the brave people of Israel. God, please continue to shield and protect us,” read the caption.


	In a photo by Israeli influencer Regev Gur, Jenner can be seen drinking a glass of red wine in a bomb shelter. “What did you do during the alerts, because I'm drinking wine with Caitlyn,” Gur wrote. He later deleted the post. 


	Another high-profile American caught in the conflict, CNN political analyst Scott Jennings, spoke to THR from his hotel room in Tiberias on Friday as IDF fighter jets roared overhead. 


	Jennings remains in Israel while the conflict rages on. Since the interview, he has since relocated to Jerusalem. His last post to X shared video of incoming missiles amid heavy smoke and wailing air ride sirens.


	“4am footage from Jerusalem last night,” Jennings writes. “When these intercepts hit you can hear the boom and sometimes feel the vibration. Pray for the people in Israel killed & injured by Iranian missile strikes.”


	According to Reuters, at least 24 Israelis have been killed by Iran's response so far, with 500 injured. The Iranian government reports at least 224 confirmed deaths, saying 90 percent of them were civilians. 


	Multiple loud explosions have been reported across Tehran through the night and into Monday morning. The IDF has issues evacuation warnings to several districts, citing imminent action.

Smith explains why he turned down the lead role in Christopher Nolan's multi-layered thriller — but he wasn't the only A-lister to reject it. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


	The next time Will Smith gets offered an alternate reality sci-fi thriller, he should seriously consider just saying, “Yes!”


	First, the actor admitted he turned down The Matrix, which cast Keanu Reeves instead.




	Now Smith confirms he also turned down the lead role Christopher Nolan‘s Inception, which starred Leonardo DiCaprio.


	“I don't think I've ever said it publicly before, but I am going to say it now because we are opening up to one another,” Smith told the radio station KISS XTRA, with a fair amount of good humor. “Chris Nolan brought me Inception first and I didn't get it. I've never said that out loud. Now that I think about it, it's those movies that go into those alternate realities they don't pitch well. But I am hurt by those, too … It hurts too bad to talk about.”

	The Independence Day star turning down 1999's The Matrix is actually pretty understandable, as writers-directors The Wachowskis were still an unknown quantity at the time. Rejecting 2010's Inception when Nolan was coming off his blockbuster masterpiece The Dark Knight, however, seems like a more baffling move. Yet he wasn't the only A-list actor to pass on the role — likely due to Nolan's high-pressure casting strategy.


	In Inception, the lead character plants ideas in people's dreams as a novel form of corporate espionage. As The Hollywood Reporter revealed at the time, Nolan first offered the twisty script to Brad Pitt but demanded the actor accept within 48 hours. When Pitt didn't commit, Nolan went to Smith. When Smith didn't accept, Nolan sent it to DiCaprio, who took it.


	“It's never couched as, ‘Hey, I'm more important than you, therefore just say yes,'” said an executive, noting big stars “are used to having people wait a year or more” before they commit and “usually don't have to board a moving train.”

	











Inception went on to gross more than $800 million at the global box office. Needless to say, nowadays the Oscar-winning director can probably get top actors to sign onto a project even without showing them a script.

	As for The Matrix, Smith has candidly detailed the pitch meeting for that project and recently did a music video for “Beautiful Scars” where Smith played a parody version of Neo. 


	“I'm not proud of it, but it's the truth, all right, I did turn down Neo in The Matrix,” Smith said in a YouTube video posted five years ago. “After we made Men in Black, the Wachowskis came in and they'd only done one movie. They did a movie called Bound. And then they made a pitch for The Matrix. And as it turns out, they're geniuses, but there's a fine line in a pitch meeting between genius and what I experienced in the meeting. So this is the actual pitch that they made for The Matrix …”


	At this point in the video, Smith humorously enacted a meeting where the Wachowskis enthuse confusingly about various wild action moves the character would be doing, but didn't discuss the film's plot or character (“And then we'll put in 50 cameras, and you'll see the whole jump while you stop in the middle of the jump …”).


	“So I made Wild Wild West [instead],” Smith admitted, referring to his notorious 1999 sci-fi flop.


	Having said that, Smith added, “Keanu was perfect. Laurence Fishburne was perfect. If I had done it, because I'm Black, [Fishburne's character] Morpheus wouldn't have been Black because they were looking at Val Kilmer [for] Morpheus. So I probably would have messed The Matrix up. I would have ruined it. I did y'all a favor.”

The 'Last Week Tonight' host criticized the president for sending National Guard troops and Marines into Los Angeles: ""Why would you send troops if there is nothing for them to do?""


							By 

	Kimberly Nordyke


Managing Editor, Digital


John Oliver again criticized President Trump on Last Week Tonight, this time over the latter's response to increasing protests against immigration raids across the country.


	“As you undoubtedly know, last weekend, ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] conducted sweeping raids across the country as part of an escalation ordered by Stephen Miller,” the White House deputy chief of staff, Oliver said on Sunday's edition of his show. “Miller reportedly told ICE officials to just go out there and arrest illegal aliens, suggesting they target Home Depots or 7-Eleven convenience stores. So that's what happened, and from the start, it was a mess.”

	Oliver showed a news segment featuring footage of people getting detained by Homeland Security in Los Angeles. A man who was interviewed on camera said, “My friends started yelling ICE, ICE, ICE. I thought he was joking, but he wasn't. Then I saw all the day laborers starting to run.”


	Said Oliver: “That is awful. Someone yelling ICE is almost never going to be a positive thing. Best-case scenario, you've somehow time traveled back to 2014 and have to do an ice bucket challenge, something, by the way, that [Trump] did because he was nominated by, this is true, Mike Tyson, Vince McMahon and Homer Simpson. It was a simpler time,” he quipped.


	Oliver then mentioned the escalating protests in Los Angeles, which prompted Trump to send in thousands of National Guard troops and hundreds of Marines “to protect federal law enforcement from the attacks of a vicious and violent mob,” as Trump put it. 


	“And some of the radical left, they say, ‘Oh, that's not nice,'” Trump added. “Well, if we didn't do it, there wouldn't be a Los Angeles. It'd be burning today, just like the houses were burning a number of months ago” in the devastating fires that swept through areas of L.A. including Pacific Palisades and Altadena.

	











	Said Oliver: “OK, I know I'm not saying anything new right now, but he is such a dick. There is just no reason to bring up the traumatic fires that are still very much on people's minds in L.A. for the same reason you shouldn't open a toast at a retirement party with, ‘Wow, [the] only milestone left after this is death.' Yeah, everyone knows that and we're all trying not to think about it.”


	Oliver then noted that Trump's move was opposed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, among other officials.


	“Why would you send troops if there is nothing for them to do?” Oliver asked. “You're just gonna have 4,000 soldiers wandering around L.A., swinging by the Hollywood Walk of Fame and going, ‘Oh, Christian Slater. OK.'” (The actor received a star on the Walk of Fame earlier this month.)


	Oliver then acknowledged that there was “sporadic vandalism and rock throwing and some Waymo cars were set on fire.”


	“But those were isolated incidents not at all representative of the protest as a whole,” he continued. “And I'm not saying that those aren't striking visuals. I'm just saying setting a driverless car on fire is not the same thing as assaulting someone, unless we're somehow living in the Pixar Cars universe where burning one is murder, and you'd be condemned to hell by the car pope — a real character from Cars 2, by the way, implying there's car Catholicism, car Jesus and presumably a decades-long car cover-up of car sexual abuse.”


	Oliver opined that Trump's response to the protests “felt completely over-the-top, especially when you consider troops will apparently be there for 60 days at a cost to taxpayers of roughly $134 million. And usually when that much is spent on something completely pointless, we at least get to see one of the Avengers in it,” he joked.

Pope Leo XIV met Al Pacino and film producer Andrea Iervolino to talk about their film 'Maserati: The Brothers,' according to Iervolino.


							By 

	Lily Ford



	Hollywood A-lister Al Pacino became the first movie star to meet with Pope Leo XIV.


	The 85-year-old had an audience with the new American pope, elected after the death of Pope Francis, at the Vatican on Monday. According to reports in Italy, Pacino arrived in Rome by private jet from New York City over the weekend.




	“We are honored to announce that this morning His Holiness Pope Leo XIV received in a private audience at the Holy See a delegation from the film Maserati: The Brothers, including Oscar winner actor Al Pacino and the film's producer Andrea Iervolino,” Iervolino said in a statement given to The Hollywood Reporter.

	The meeting was “a moment of profound spiritual and cultural inspiration,” the producer continued, saying that the discussion centered around “shared values that lie at the heart of both the Catholic Church and the film: family unity, love, compassion and the importance of contributing to the common good.”


	He continued: “These values, which Pope Leo XIV has consistently emphasized in his recent messages to the world, resonate deeply with the story of the Maserati brothers: a family whose legacy was built not only on innovation and excellence but on profound mutual respect, solidarity and a shared vision.”


	Last month, it was confirmed that Pacino had joined the cast of Bobby Moresco's film in the role of Vincenzo Vaccaro, a businessman and early investor in the auto dynasty.


	Gina La Piana, Tatiana Luter, Anthony Hopkins, Andy Garcia, Jessica Alba, Michele Morrone and Salvatore Esposito round off the cast for the film, currently shooting in Italy.

The song is her second leader, and first to enter at the summit.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



Sabrina Carpenter's “Manchild” soars onto the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 1. The song is her second leader, and first to debut on top. Her “Please Please Please” spent a week atop the ranking in June 2024, rising from the runner-up spot in its second week on the chart.


	“Manchild,” also Carpenter's fourth Hot 100 top 10, introduces her next album, Man's Best Friend, due Aug. 29. “i can't wait for it to be yours x,” she wrote of the set on Instagram on June 11; it is scheduled to arrive just more than year since her prior LP, Short n' Sweet, which was released Aug. 23, 2024.


	Carpenter notched her first three Hot 100 top 10s from Short n' Sweet, with “Please Please Please” preceded by the No. 3-peaking “Espresso” and followed by “Taste,” which hit No. 2. As those three songs charted in the top five together upon the debut of “Taste,” she became the second act ever to chart her first three top five hits in the region simultaneously – joining only The Beatles for the feat.


	Meanwhile, Carpenter is the only woman artist with multiple Hot 100 No. 1s dating to the coronation of “Please Please Please.” She is also the only woman to reign with a nonseasonal song and with no billed collaborators in that span.


	“Manchild,” on Island Records/Republic, is the 1,182nd No. 1 in the Hot 100's 66-year history, and the 85th to debut at the summit – and the first No. 1 entrance for Island. Carpenter co-produced the song with Jack Antonoff and co-wrote it with Antonoff and Amy Allen. (The trio also co-wrote “Please Please Please,” which Antonoff produced.)


	Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated June 21, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, June 17. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.

Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.


Released late on June 5, “Manchild” tallied 27.1 million official streams, 14 million radio airplay audience impressions and 20,000 sold in the United States June 6-12.


	The track debuts at No. 1 on the Streaming Songs chart, where it's Carpenter's third leader, following “Taste” (three weeks on top) and “Please Please Please” (two). It opens at No. 3 on Digital Song Sales with 6,000 downloads sold; it also sold 14,000 copies on 7-inch vinyl, on which it was released with the exclusive instrumental B-side, “Inside of Your Head When You've Just Won an Argument with a Man.” (“Manchild” is the top-selling song of the week overall.) As it bubbles under the Radio Songs chart, “Manchild” launches at No. 22 on Pop Airplay and No. 24 on Adult Pop Airplay.


	“Manchild” is the 19th Hot 100 No. 1 with the word “man” (or a variation) in its title. Here's a look at all such man-ly hits:




	Notably, man-y more Hot 100 No. 1s have included “man” in their titles than “woman” – 19 vs. eight, with the versions of “When a Man Loves a Woman” above contributing to both sides.


	Meanwhile, Billboard's Keith Caulfield notes that funk band Manchild charted in 1977 with Power and Love (No. 29 peak on Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums). The group included musical renaissance man Babyface and accomplished writer and producer Daryl Simmons.


	“Manchild” is also the fourth Hot 100 No. 1 with “child” in its title, and the first since a rock classic 37 years ago:




	No kid-ding: Additionally, Childish Gambino ruled the Hot 100 with “This Is America” in 2018 and Destiny's Child scored four leaders in 1999-2001.


	Alex Warren's “Ordinary” drops to No. 2 on the Hot 100 following two weeks at No. 1. Still, it adds a seventh week at No. 1 on Digital Song Sales (7,000 sold) and gained by 12% to 54 million in airplay audience. It also claims a third week at No. 1 on the Songs of the Summer chart.


	Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, dips 2-3 on the Hot 100, three weeks after it roared in as Wallen's fourth No. 1 and McRae's first. It also tops the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart for a fourth week. Wallen follows on the Hot 100 with the No. 2-peaking “Just in Case” (3-4) and “I'm the Problem” (5-6), as I'm the Problem, the parent set of all three songs, posts a fourth week at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.


	Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” descends 4-5 after 13 weeks atop the Hot 100 beginning in March. It adds a 25th week at No. 1 on both the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts, extending the longest reign on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs (dating to October 1958, when the chart became the genre's all-encompassing songs ranking).


	Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” wobbles 6-7 on the Hot 100, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. 1 beginning last July, and Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” backtracks 7-8 after five weeks at No. 1 starting in January.


	Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and became the year's No. 1 song, falls 8-9. It logs a record-extending 65th week in the top 10 and a record-furthering 95th week on the chart overall.


	Rounding out the Hot 100's top 10, Benson Boone's No. 2-peaking “Beautiful Things” retreats 9-10.

The high court finally ends an unsuccessful legal battle over accusations that Sheeran's hit ""Thinking Out Loud"" infringed Gaye's iconic track.


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



Ed Sheeran's next tour isn't going to include a stop at the U.S. Supreme Court.


	In an order issued Monday, the high court refused to revive a long-running lawsuit that claimed Sheeran's 2014 hit “Thinking Out Loud” infringed Marvin Gaye‘s famed 1973 jam “Let's Get It On.”


	The star's legal accuser — a company that owns a partial stake in Gaye's 1973 song — had asked the justices to hear the case, which was dismissed in November by a lower court that ruled the two tracks share only basic “musical building blocks.”


	But the justices denied that request on Monday, allowing that earlier ruling to stand. As is typical, the Supreme Court did not offer any explanation for why it had refused to hear the case. The high court hears only a tiny fraction of the cases it receives.


	Sheeran has faced multiple lawsuits over “Thinking,” a 2014 track co-written with Amy Wadge that reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and ultimately spent 58 weeks on the chart.




			Trending on Billboard		







	He was first sued by the daughter of Ed Townsend, who co-wrote the famed 1973 tune with Gaye – a case that ended with a high-profile jury verdict clearing Sheeran. He was then hit with a separate case by Structured Asset Sales (SAS), an entity owned by industry executive David Pullman that controls a different stake in Townsend's copyrights to the legendary song.


	That suit was rejected in November by the federal Second Circuit appeals court, which said the lawsuit was essentially seeking “a monopoly over a combination of two fundamental musical building blocks.”


	“The four-chord progression at issue — ubiquitous in pop music — even coupled with a syncopated harmonic rhythm, is too well-explored to meet the originality threshold that copyright law demands,” the appeals court wrote. “Overprotecting such basic elements would threaten to stifle creativity and undermine the purpose of copyright law.”


	In a petition to the Supreme Court in March, SAS argued that the earlier ruling had unfairly restricted the case to written sheet music rather than Gaye's iconic recorded version. It claimed that problem would impact “the rights of thousands of legacy musical composers and artists, of many of the most beloved and enduring pieces of popular music.”


	But in a response filing last month, Sheeran's lawyers said SAS was using a “false premise” and “baseless assertions” to try to get the justices to revive the case: “The petition should be denied.”


	Monday's denial will finally end SAS's lawsuit against Sheeran, but the pop star not quite out of the legal woods just yet. Pullman's company later filed a second, more novel case in which it is seeking to sue Sheeran over the more detailed recorded version of Gaye's song; that case has been paused for years while the earlier lawsuit plays out.


	In a statement to Billboard on Monday, Pullman said that separate case “will now go forward” in federal court: “Defendants fear has always been the sound recording of ‘Let's Get It On',” Pullman said. “The U.S. Supreme Court was aware of this and understands that the case will go forward and may very well be back at the U.S. Supreme Court at a later date.”


	In his own statement Monday, Sheeran's attorney Donald Zakarin praised the justices for rejecting a “false narrative” aimed at reviving the case. And he strongly dismissed Pullman's statements about the remaining case against Sheeran, stressing that a jury found the star had independently created “Thinking.”


	“Pullman's completely unauthorized and improper purported registration of the Marvin Gaye recording of ‘Let's Get It On,' 50 years after it was created, will not change that fact,” Zakarin said. “If he truly believed that the second case he filed was so compelling – which it is not – he would not have spent the last two years pursuing his failed first case.”

The singer and songwriter whose family has a long tradition of service took time to thank military members for their service.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



OneRepublic singer and producer Ryan Tedder was not among the celebrities who joined in the protests against the Trump administration at the thousands of “No Kings” protests across the U.S. on Saturday. In fact, the songwriter who has worked with Beyoncé and Taylor Swift took to Instagram to protest against the protests, lamenting that they were taking away from the celebration of the nation's armed services.


	“I have around 20 family members & grandparents that all fought in wars from the revolutionary war (actually) through to WWII/Korea.. all politics & parties and righteous indignation aside it's a super bummer that instead of celebrating the 250th anniversary of the US Army and all those who have fought and died on our behalf… we're protesting,” Tedder wrote in a since-expired Instagram Story according to NME.

	











	“I haven't been a card carrying political member of either side for 20 years & think at this point everything is absurd 99% of the time…” Tedder added. “But I'd like to say THANKYOU to all of the Army service members active and retired and those who have given their lives to protect our freedom…to protest.”

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Tedder's comments came on the same weekend that President Trump oversaw his long-desired military parade on Washington, D.C. streets, during which 6,000 soldiers marched alongside 128 tanks in a show of force to celebrate the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary; the unusual display also coincided with Trump's 79th birthday. 


	To counter the Trump event, an estimated three to five million Americans flooded the streets as part of more than 2,100 “No Kings” protest events across the nation, waving often profane signs and listening to speeches decrying what critics call the nation's slip into authoritarianism under Trump.


	Earlier this year, former OneRepublic bassist Tim Myers announced a run for a California House seat held by longtime GOP Rep. Ken Calvert in what he said was an attempt to slow the Trump agenda. “The people in charge are screwing us over just to make a buck. Trump, Musk and these clowns in Washington are cutting cancer research, veterans health care and getting into trade wars, making everything we buy more expensive. All while giving billionaires another tax cut they don't need,” he said in the announcement of his run.

In Loud and Clear, journalist and Deadhead Brian Anderson chronicles how the legendary band's pursuit of high-quality sound forever changed concert production.


													By
												

	Eric Renner Brown



This August, Dead & Company will celebrate 60 years of Grateful Dead music with three massive concerts in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. Fans can reasonably assume – as they can with most major touring artists today – that the sound will be impeccable.


	But six decades ago, when the Grateful Dead began gigging around that very same park, quality sound was far from a given. Audiences routinely endured terrible audio, and bands also struggled to parse the noise and play together. Modern cornerstones of concert production, from monitors to digital delay towers, had yet to be invented.


	The Grateful Dead didn't just embrace new advancements in audio technology – as journalist and Deadhead Brian Anderson chronicles in his new book, Loud and Clear: The Grateful Dead's Wall of Sound and the Quest for Audio Perfection, the revered band actively drove concert sound forward, creating many of today's standards in the process.




			Trending on Billboard		







Loud and Clear specifically tackles the first decade of the band's history, from its Bay Area formation in 1965 to the Wall of Sound, the gargantuan sound system worth nearly $2 million in today's dollars that it took on the road in 1974. During those years, the band and the cast of characters in its orbit – from an audiophile LSD chemist to hard-nosed roadies – continually iterated its sound system, introducing numerous innovations in service of creating a deeper performer-listener connection through quality sound. The pinnacle was the Wall of Sound, a technological marvel that towered behind the band and allowed each musician to manipulate their individual mixes in real time.


	“I knew this was for a general audience,” says Anderson, who asked himself, “How do I make it digestible and explain this stuff in a way people are gonna understand?” The son of Deadheads – who saw the band repeatedly in this era and took him as a toddler to see the Dead at Alpine Valley in the late ‘80s – found the answer in those strong personalities within the Dead's organization. Loud and Clear is as much a story about the Dead's audio equipment as it is about the band's musical philosophy and the way money, fame, and excess challenged it. 


	“The wheels came very close to coming off,” Anderson says of the Dead in this era. The band took the Wall of Sound – which, when its almost 600 speakers were assembled, measured 60 feet long and more than three stories tall – on the road for nearly 40 shows in 1974, and the unprecedented production feat came close to bankrupting the Dead and tearing it apart. Plus, at a time with far fewer regulations, transporting, assembling, and disassembling the Wall came with plenty of risks for the (often inebriated) crew tasked with doing so; Loud and Clear's at-times harrowing narrative includes broken arms, nearly-severed toes, falling equipment, electrocutions and flipped trucks. “It's amazing that nobody bit it,” Anderson says.


	The Dead ultimately carried many of the lessons of the Wall of Sound into the proceeding years – but after taking a hiatus in 1975, returned without the advanced system in 1976. “They somehow kept it together,” Anderson says, “but there was a collective sigh of relief at the end of 1974 when they're like, ‘OK, you know what? Let's take a break here.'”


What inspired you to write a book not just about the Dead, but about such a specific topic and period?


	I am the child of early Deadheads who both started seeing the band in the late '60s and early '70s in Chicago and the tri-state area. I grew up hearing them talk about the Wall of Sound and this system's sonic clarity. They would talk about seeing the band perform with this massive assembly of gear behind them – and it's called the Wall of Sound, so it's just captivated me my entire life.


	As time went on, I grew to appreciate the scale of the Wall. When I was at VICE, I was the Features Editor [at science and tech vertical Motherboard], and I thought it would be cool to do a deep dive into the Wall of Sound. I embarked on writing that initial story because I knew that it had more than just the technology component – it's a story about obsession, obsessive people who came from all walks of life. After that story came out, it quickly dawned on me that there's so much more here – like, maybe I could do a full book on this one day.


How did the Dead's pursuit of quality sound differentiate themselves from their peers and ultimately help them amass the following that they did?


	Not long after the band had gotten going, [singer/guitarist] Jerry Garcia's mother, Ruth, purchased her son a pair of Klipsch speakers. That was, basically, the very first iteration of the Dead's sound system. No other bands at the time had their own rig like that, so immediately, they were elevated above most of their peers, at a time when musical PAs didn't exist. Most any club that they were playing at the time, if it did have a sound system, it was just a small little box to like each side of the stage. The famous example, on a bigger level, is the Beatles at Shea Stadium. Live sound presentation in the mid '60s was kind of terrible.


	Then they get hooked up with Owsley Stanley, who was their patron and their original sound man. He was using money that he was making from manufacturing LSD to bankroll the band. He was kitting them out with top-flight gear by early 1966 – and right around that time, the acid tests were getting going. The Dead were basically the in-house band at the acid tests, and the acid tests would be the model that they would follow, really, through the end of their career: During the acid tests, the band and the crowd were all the same organism, everyone was in the same sonic envelope.


	The whole point of putting [all the audio equipment] at the musicians' backs [in the Wall of Sound in 1974] was to ensure that the band and the crowd would all hear the same thing and be in the same sonic envelope together – and that harkened right back to the acid tests. There's also an ethic with the Dead that was there from the very early days: That ethic was to present the sound in such a way that the person in the very back row would experience the exact same thing as someone who was hanging right on the barrier. Part of their righteous approach to sound was to present the sound in such a way that everyone in the space together [would] experience the same high quality.


At its roots, the Dead almost had a punk-like, DIY ethos. What tensions did that introduce as the band's operation grew and professionalized?


	By the early '70s, the sound system that was growing into the Wall of Sound had become the center of the Dead's homegrown world-building project, which included their own record label, in-house travel and booking agencies, a publishing arm, and a whole cottage industry of boutique sound and audio companies that were building kit for the Dead. [The Dead wanted] to do everything their own way; it didn't necessarily make sense to do what they were doing, but they did it anyway. It was super, super punk, super DIY.


	From the very beginning, they would always funnel money back into their sound system – that's basically how the Wall of Sound was able to grow. As early as mid-1973, management was starting to be like, “Hey guys. We can't do things like we did in the very early days.” It became clear that they were hemorrhaging money through this sound system. By mid-'74, it was starting to get through to Garcia and some of the other band members that this was not sustainable. Despite their wanting to continue on in this very punk, DIY fashion where money would just always be funneled back into the sound system, the reality was such that they couldn't do that anymore.


As much as the book is about the band, it's also about the crew that surrounded it. Why emphasize those supporting characters?


	I knew that if I was gonna do this book, I had to push the story forward somehow. I didn't want to just tell this story through old sound bites from Jerry Garcia or Bob Weir or Phil Lesh. There were so many other people who were in the room in this era who helped put this thing together and who made it go on the road, setting it up and tearing it down. I was really interested in illuminating what the day-to-day was like of conceiving [the Wall of Sound] and building it and taking it on the road. I wanted stretches of the book to kind of feel like you're going on tour with them.


Your book outlines several audio innovations by the band, including pioneering the use of on-stage monitors, helping to invent digital delay towers, and using feedback-cancelling microphones to make the Wall of Sound work. What were the most significant lasting impacts the Dead had on modern concert audio?


	There's a number of them. A curved speaker, no one had done that before the Dead. The theory and the mathematics existed, so a curved speaker existed on paper, but the Dead were really the first to fly a curved speaker. Today, you go to see Metallica at a stadium or you go see a local punk band at the dive bar, you're gonna see versions of a curved speaker – and that's the Dead lineage.


	Delay towers, that's not the Wall of Sound, but an adjacent sonic first that the Dead and their crew and their technicians helped forge in that era. Kezar Stadium, RFK, Watkins Glen, those three [big outdoor concerts] in summer of '73 were crucial to figuring out digital delay. That's another convention of modern sound reinforcement at much bigger shows that anyone is familiar with.


	From a philosophical standpoint, a lasting impact of all the Dead's innovations in the audio realm in this era was an elevated presentation. The Dead instilled this awareness of pursuing the highest-quality sound that you can because you owe it to your audience, because these people are coming to see you perform.


And in turn, that reoriented what fans expected of concert audio, not just at the Dead's shows but at any show.


	By the time the Dead came back from their hiatus in 1976, the world of audio had kind of caught up to them. They realized, “We don't need to carry this massive equipment with us anymore, because the state of the art has advanced to a point where we can rent a sound system that sounds just as good, if not better, than the Wall of Sound for a fraction of the price.” A lot of that really owes to the ground that they broke through the Wall of Sound.


At a couple points in the book, you quote Garcia interviews from this period where, when lamenting the challenges of ensuring quality audio on tour, he says he wishes the band could have its own venue tailored to its own production standards. That never came to pass – but today, Dead & Company has played upwards of 40 shows at Sphere in Las Vegas. What would Jerry have thought of Sphere?


	Last year, the first time I went to the Sphere, walking in, I couldn't help but draw all of these connections. In the very early '70s, they were always having conversations about, “Gee, wouldn't it be great if we had our own spot where we could set up our sound system, just exactly perfect, and people can come see us perform?” They started to take some very serious steps to figure out, “OK, what would this space look like?” One of the ideas they were kicking around was a Buckminster Fuller-style geodesic dome – like a sphere. So, you walk into the Sphere to see Dead and Company, it's like, “Oh, here it is.” Inside of the Sphere is basically the Wall of Sound, but taken to an exponential degree. The Wall of Sound walked so the Sphere could run.


	I have to think Garcia would've been tickled to take the Sphere for a ride. There's the public perception of Garcia as this wooly, hippie-type guy, but he was always embracing the cutting edge, from the gear that he was playing and just experimenting with to getting really into computers in the late '80s and early '90s. He just loved, like, f—king around with the newest technology.


What's your favorite Wall of Sound show?


	June 16, 1974, at the Des Moines Fairgrounds, for sonic and setlist reasons as much as personal reasons – my mother was at that show. That show, to me, is the epitome of your outdoor Grateful Dead show in the sun in the summertime. An amazing show. [Editor's note: Selections from this show were officially released in 2009 as Road Trips Volume 2 Number 3, which is available on streaming platforms.]


Loud and Clear: The Grateful Dead's Wall of Sound and the Quest for Audio Perfection will be released by St. Martin's Press on June 17.

The singer said he's ""exhausted"" by thinking about himself all the time while posting what appeared to be text of a nasty break-up with a former friend.

Justin Bieber has heard all the comments from fans who are worried about his health and well-being, as well as those offering him advice on how to live his life. “People keep telling me to heal,” Bieber wrote on Monday morning (June 16) in a post cued to WizKid's “Blessed.” 


	“Don't you think if I could have fixed myself I would have already? I know I'm broken. I know I have anger issues,” the singer added. “I tried to do the work my whole life to be like the people who told me I needed to be fixed like them. And it just keeps making me more tired and more angry. The harder I try to grow, the more focussed on myself I am.” 

	











	The singer concluded by writing, “Jesus is the only person who keeps me wanting to make my life about others. Because honestly I'm exhausted with thinking about myself lately aren't you?” The post came just hours after the singer shared an image of what appeared to be his hand holding a burning blunt, as well as what appeared to be a back and forth with what appeared to be a now-former friend.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	“I will never suppress my emotions for someone. Conflict is a part of relationship. If you don't like my anger you don't like me,” he wrote. “My anger is a response To pain I have been thru. Asking a traumatized person not to be traumatized is simply mean.” 


	The conversation then got heated when the unidentified other person responded that they were “not used to someone lashing out at me. It's not hat I don't see and feel your anger.” Bieber was non-plussed, quickly calling an end to their relationship. “Ouch. This friendship is officially over,” he wrote. “I will never accept a man calling my anger lashing out. I enjoyed our short lived relationship. I wasn't kidding when I told u I didn't need u as a friend. I have good friends. Who will respect these boundaries.” 


	The singer then got testy, telling the person he always considered them a “p–sy… which is why I alway kept my distance but I was willing to give you the benifit [sic] of the doubt. This confirms u were the p–sy I always thought u were [middle finger emoji].”


	Speaking of the middle finger, Bieber also celebrated Father's Day on Sunday with a salty one-finger salute Instagram post that read, “I'm a dad that's not be be f–ked with [middle finger emoji].”


	He ended by asking the person to leave him alone, noting that he is now blocking them. At press time a spokesperson for Bieber had not returned Billboard‘s request for comment on the posts.


	Bieber has been on a posting spree lately, bouncing between cryptic images and close-up selfies, brief glimpses of the back of his and wife Hailey Biebers' infant son, Jack Blues, and serious posts in which he lashes out at unsolicited advice. “Telling other humans they deserve something is like raising someone else's kids,” he wrote on June 3. “Who are you to tell someone what someone should or shouldn't have. The audacity. That's not your place. God decides what we deserve.”

	











	Back in March, Bieber sparked concern when he told fans he felt like he was “drowning” in “hate” and struggling with feeling “unworthy.” Bieber has been largely off the music radar since canceling a tour in 2022 to deal with the effects of Ramsay Hunt syndrome, which included partial facial paralysis. He appears to be working on the follow-up to his 2021 album Justice, but at press time on additional information was available on that project.

The Rock Hall of Famer said the song is a ""powerful piece of music that was never intended for political use.""

	Gil Kaufman



Heart‘s Nancy Wilson and her bandmate and sister Ann Wilson are proud daughters of a Marine Corps major, but the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame guitarist said in a pointed Instagram post on Saturday (June 14) that their band's music is not meant for political purposes. “Earlier today, during a parade held in support of our nation's military and organized by President Donald Trump, the song ‘Barracuda' by Heart was played without permission or authorization from us,” she said of the playing of the group's Billboard Hot 100 No. 11 1977 hit during the military showcase.

	“‘Barracuda,' written and performed by Ann and I, is a powerful piece of music that was never intended for political use,” continued Wilson, who drove home her point by wearing a “No Kings But Us” hat on a day when a historic number of Americans took to the streets from coast to coast to protest against what they called the creeping authoritarianism of the second Trump administration in a series of “No Kings” protests. 


	“As daughters of a U.S. Marine Corps major, we hold a deep and abiding respect for the men and women who serve in our Armed Forces,” wrote Wilson. “On a day meant to honor that service, it's important that music used in such settings reflects not only the tone of the event but also the wishes of the artists who created it.🤘🏻”

	











	According to reports. instrumental versions of Heart's “Barracuda” and Journey's “Separate Ways (World's Apart)” were among the songs played at the event that appeared to draw modest crowds at a reported price of $25-$45 million, while the ACLU said that an estimated five million people took part in more than 2,100 “No Kings” rallies across the nation, making it the largest protest in the nation's history.


	Trump's military parade, which was intended to celebrate the U.S. Army's 250th birthday, also fell on the president's 79th birthday. The parading of military hardware through the streets of the nation's capital is an unusual site in the U.S., though Trump has long mused out loud about wanting to hold such an event. The D.C. event came amidst a day of dramatic news, including Iran and Israel battering each other with missiles in what is ramping up to be a major escalation of hostilities between the two nations. In addition, officials in Minnesota launched a massive manhunt for the suspected shooter who assassinated a Democratic state legislator in that state and attempted assassination of another; the now-captured 57-year-old man, Vance Boelter, allegedly had a list of 70 other potential targets in his car.


	Nancy Wilson has long objected to politicians using her band's music at their rallies, and earlier this year she said she feels “embarrassed” to call herself an American at this time. “We were kind of embarrassed at that time to call ourselves American because of the dirty politics of the Vietnam War,” Wilson said of the period that inspired some of the band's most beloved hits, including the anti-Vietnam war single “Crazy On You,” whose lyrics she added are relevant again. “To be as subtle as possible, it's more embarrassing now.”

	











	She noted that “Barracuda” was initially written about a sleazy industry figure at the time, though Wilson twisted it to fit the current commander in chief, saying the song is “even more relevant in the salacious billionaire culture with the grab-them-by-the-(expletive) mentality,” the latter phrase a reference to an infamous sexist comment from Trump.


	The Wilsons were also peeved when Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin played “Barracuda” at the 2008 Republican National Convention, sending a cease and desist order to the former Alaska governor demanding she stop using the track as her unofficial theme song. In 2018, singer Ann Wilson told The Hill that any politician was free to use “Barracuda” on the campaign trail in 2020. “I think anybody but Trump,” she added.

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: In a competitive situation, Amazon MGM Studios has secured film rights to “Code Black,” a new short story by Harrison Query, for seven figures guaranteed, sources tell Deadline. The deal is believed to be one of the biggest of all time for a short story.


Scott Glassgold of 12:01 Films brought the package into Jake Gyllenhaal‘s Nine Stories, which will develop the political thriller as a starring vehicle for the Oscar nominee, under its first-look deal with the studio.


	In Code Black, the country's top heart surgeon is flown to D.C. to perform a high-stakes operation, finding himself led into a trap where his guile and genius become the only way to stop a plot that threatens both his family and the nation.

	In addition to Gyllenhaal and Josh McLaughlin for Nine Stories, producers in talks include Lynn Harris and Matt Reeves for 6th & Idaho, and Glassgold for 12:01. Query will adapt the screenplay.




			Watch on Deadline		







Code Black marks the second high-profile sale for Query in just two months. In May, he set up his drama series spec Trigger Point in A24 after six-way bidding, with Rebel Ridge‘s Jeremy Saulnier coming on to direct and exec produce alongside former Fifth Season Head of TV Joe Hipps. Query also wrote Amazon MGM's action-comedy Heads of State, starring John Cena and Idris Elba, which is out July 2, and teamed with Tommy Wallach to set up the forthcoming limited series on JonBenét Ramsey at Paramount+.


	After exec producing and starring in Apple's Presumed Innocent and seeing the critically acclaimed series break out as one of Apple's most-watched dramas of all time, Gyllenhaal is back on board to exec produce a second season. Previously, his Nine Stories has produced lauded titles like The Guilty, Wildlife and Stronger, among others. Upcoming, he also has the Guy Ritchie-directed sequel to his hit Road House remake for Amazon MGM, where he's both starring and producing. The first film had a record-breaking debut on Prime Video with over 50 million viewers in its first two weekends on the service.

	











	The “Code Black” deal marks the fifth short story sale of the year for Glassgold, who last month went to Skydance with Drift, based on an unpublished work of science fiction by Ben Queen & Jason Shuman, securing a $2M+ deal following a heated auction. A master at selling the short story, he prior to that saw 20th preemptively acquire Ripped, a feature adaptation of the short story by Joe Ballarini, which his 12:01 Films will produce alongside Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks. Glassgold also bagged the first big sale of 2025 with After Shock, a Lionsgate adaptation of the earthquake-themed short story by Aaron Jayh, to star Brandon Sklenar. Other upcoming projects include Caretaker at Universal with Sydney Sweeney, The Dwelling at Amazon MGM with Michael B Jordan, and Occupant at New Line with Zach Cregger producing.


	Gyllenhaal is represented by WME and Carlos Goodman; Query by CAA, Ground Control and Jeff Frankel; Reeves by CAA, 3 Arts, and attorneys Karl R. Austen and Peter C. Sample; and Glassgold's 12:01 by Verve and McKuin Frankel Whitehead. CAA and Verve oversaw the auction.

EXCLUSIVE: Eight-time Oscar nominee Glenn Close and three-time Tony winner Billy Porter are the latest additions to the cast of Lionsgate's anticipated The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping.


	Close will play Drusilla Sickle, the cruel escort to the District 12 Tributes,  while Porter is Magno Stift, her estranged husband and the Tributes' uninspired designer.


	Close and Porter join Joseph Zada, Whitney Peak, Mckenna Grace, Jesse Plemons, Kelvin Harrison Jr., Maya Hawke, Lili Taylor, Ben Wang, Ralph Fiennes, Elle Fanning and Kieran Culkin in the Francis Lawrence-directed adaptation of the bestselling book by Suzanne Collins.

	The casting news was made official during Lionsgate's presentation here at CineEurope.




			Watch on Deadline		







Sunrise on the Reaping will be released on November 20, 2026. Lawrence is directing from a screenplay adaptation by Billy Ray. Color Force's Nina Jacobson and Brad Simpson will produce. Cameron MacConomy will executive produce. The five films in the franchise have taken in over $3.3 billion at the global box office.


	Producer Nina Jacobson said, “Glenn Close is a dream Drusilla. She brings so much of her intellect and imagination to each role, creating characters who are unforgettable and iconic. I think Glenn and Francis will have a ball bringing Drusilla from the page to the screen.”


	Regarding Porter, Jacobson added, “Billy is one of those rare performers who can dazzle and devastate in equal measure on stage and screen. He made an indelible impression on me when we worked together on Pose, both as an actor and a human being. Casting this show has felt like winning the lottery every time one of our idols said yes to us. To be able to announce Glenn Close and Billy Porter together is an embarrassment of riches that we can all celebrate.” 


	Published on March 18, Sunrise on the Reaping revisits the world of Panem 24 years before the events of The Hunger Games, starting on the morning of the reaping of the Fiftieth Hunger Games, also known as the Second Quarter Quell.

	











Sunrise on the Reaping sold 1.5 million copies in its first week on sale in the U.S., UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The 1.2 million copies sold in the U.S. are twice the first week sales of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes and three times the first week sales of Mockingjay.


	Along with her eight Oscar noms, Close is a three-time Emmy winner, three-time Tony winner, and three-time Golden Globe winner. Her screen credits include Fatal Attraction, Dangerous Liaisons, Albert Nobbs, The Wife, 101 Dalmatians and the acclaimed series Damages, for which she won two Emmys.


	She recently starred in Netflix's Back in Action, Lee Daniels The Deliverance and Apple TV+'s international thriller Tehran. Upcoming projects include Rian Johnson's Knives Out mystery Wake Up Dead Man for Netflix, the Hulu legal drama All's Fair and The Summer Book from Music Box Films. Close is repped by CAA, MGMT Entertainment and Loeb & Loeb.


	Porter won a Tony and a Grammy for Kinky Boots and Tonys for his production of the Best Musical winner A Strange Loop, and the Isabelle Stevenson Award for his humanitarian efforts. Porter just made his West End debut as the Emcee in Cabaret, and is making his London directorial debut with the play This Bitter Earth at Soho Theatre. He won the Emmy Award for Lead Actor in a Drama Series for his role on Pose. Upcoming, he will star for director Gurinder Chandha in Christmas Karma. He is represented by CAA, Amplified and Felker Toczek Suddleson McGinnis Ryan LLP.  


	Meredith Wieck and Scott O'Brien are overseeing the project for Lionsgate. Robert Melnik negotiated the deal for the studio.

Executive Editor, Television


EXCLUSIVE: Stanley Tucci is heading back to Italy after Nat Geo renewed his docuseries Tucci In Italy for a second season.


	The series, which premiered last month, has been picked up for another five episodes.


	In the first season, Tucci explored regions including Tuscany, Lombardy, Abruzzo, Trentino-Alto Adige and Lazio. In the second season he will venture for the first time to Le Marche, while revisiting Sicily, Veneto, Campania and Sardinia.


	He will meet local chefs, historians, farmers, winemakers, and artisans to uncover the lesser-known culinary rituals that define each region.

	











	Tucci is evidently game for an unusual meal, having eaten tripe, lard and salad served in a vase in Season 1.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Last month, Tucci In Italy won at the Critics Choice Real TV Awards for Best Limited Series, beating series including Nat Geo's Cult Massacre: One Day in Jonestown and Erased: WW2's Heroes of Color, Netflix's Gone Girls: The Long Island Serial Killer and Simone Biles Rising and MGM+'s The Wonderland Massacre & The Secret History of Hollywood.


	The series is produced by Salt Productions, which was founded by Tucci and Lottie Birmingham in 2023, and BBC Studios. Tucci and Birmingham exec produce alongside BBCS' Amanda Lyon, with Ben Jessop as co-executive producer.


Tucci in Italy was initially handed a 10-episode order when it was commissioned by the Disney-owned factual broadcaster, but that turned into five episodes during production with another five set for Season 2.


	Tucci is no stranger to visiting Italy, having hosted CNN's Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy, which won two Emmys for Outstanding Hosted Nonfiction Series or Special over two seasons.

Robin Wright has recalled how she needed to receive multiple pay checks to hit pay parity with Kevin Spacey on House of Cards. 


	Wright was speaking at the Monte-Carlo TV Festival and recollected her battle for equal pay on the Netflix hit. She explained that she was told she couldn't have equal pay as an actor, but the workaround was doling out three paychecks and having her act, direct and produce.


	“They literally said: ‘Well, we can't pay you the same as an actor, so we're going to divvy it up to make it equal [and] make you executive producer, and then you can direct, and then we'll give you three different paychecks.' I said: ‘Why can't you pay me the same as an actor?' And they said: “Because you didn't win an Academy Award.”

	Elsewhere, Wright revealed that David Fincher foresaw the streaming revolution as House of Cards came together. “He said: ‘You know, this is going to be our future. We're going to launch streaming… and I think it'll be revolutionary.' And look at where we are today.”

AI Fears


	Robin Wright also talked about her fears that AI will take industry jobs. Responding to a question from Deadline about AI, she said: “It frightens me for our industry and it's such a dichotomy. It's tough, because I know it's going to help in the medical world tremendously. But everywhere else, people are going to lose jobs.”


	Not necessarily acting jobs, though, she added: “People say: 'Well, don't you think that it'll take over acting?' I don't think it ever can because I don't think it will ever get the emotion in the eyes. You'll never feel the resonance coming from that actor.”

	











	Wright was taking part in a solo press conference. Separately, she was in a session on stage with Rola Bauer, the former Amazon MGM exec with whom she collaborated on Prime Video's The Girlfriend. She stars in the show as well as directing and exec-producing.


	She shared an exclusive clip of the show at the Festival. In it, she is chatting to her on-screen son in a sauna, and gently but firmly quizzing him about his new love interest.


Wright is being feted with the Festival's highest honor, the Crystal Nymph Award, which is bestowed for career achievements and creating a lasting impact on the industry.

EXCLUSIVE: Tommy and Tuppence, Agatha Christie‘s crime-fighting couple, are returning to the screen.


BritBox has greenlit a six-part series that will reimagine Tommy and Tuppence Beresford in the modern world, more than a century after they first appeared together in Christie's The Secret Adversary.


	The series will be made by Lookout Point, the UK producer behind Happy Valley. Phoebe Eclair-Powell (The Road Trip) has penned the drama, her first series commission for television.


	Casting for Tommy & Tuppence, which is produced in association with Agatha Christie Limited, is yet to be confirmed. Filming gets underway later this year.

	Tapping into the cosy crime phenomenon, the series will be set in Hampstead, a leafy and affluent corner of north London, which will become the scene of murder and mystery.


	Tommy and Tuppence have appeared in numerous adaptations over the years, most recently being played by David Walliams and Jessica Raine in Partners in Crime, the 2015 BBC series.


	A 1983 series, titled Agatha Christie's Partners in Crime, aired on ITV, starring James Warwick and Francesca Annis in the title roles. The series won an Emmy for Outstanding Graphic and Title Design.


Tommy & Tuppence was greenlit by Robert Schildhouse, Jon Farrar, and Stephen Nye for BritBox. They executive produce alongside Laura Lankester, Katie Draper, and Louise Mutter for Lookout Point. James Prichard executive produces for Agatha Christie Limited. BBC Studios, which owns Lookout Point, handles global sales.


	Draper said: “Phoebe's wonderful scripts combine screwball comedy, playful romance and thrilling murder to bring an exhilarating modern-day twist to Christie's iconic detective duo.”


	Schildhouse added that the series promises to deliver a “fun blend of romance and mystery.” Eclair-Powell said writing the drama was a “dream come true” for a Christie superfan. “Christie's detective duo are witty, sharp and raring to solve lots and lots of murders whilst asking if they should really be more than just partners in crime,” she added.

	











Tommy & Tuppence joins BritBox's collection of Agatha Christie adaptations, including Towards Zero, Why Didn't They Ask Evans?, and Poirot. BritBox has carried Partners in Crime in the past.

Meghan Markle celebrated Father's Day with a rare glimpse into her private family life. On Sunday, June 15, the Duchess of Sussex shared a heartfelt Instagram video tribute to Prince Harry featuring never-before-seen footage of him with their two children, 6-year-old Prince Archie and 4-year-old Princess Lilibet.

A post shared by Meghan, Duchess of Sussex (@meghan)

Set to Jason Mraz's song “Have It All,” the video captures moments of Harry laughing with his kids, following Archie on a bike ride, and holding both children during their younger years. The tribute marked one of Meghan's most personal posts since returning to social media earlier this year.

“The best,” she wrote in the caption. “Happy Father's Day to our favorite guy 💕.”

The post quickly drew attention, offering a rare look at the family's life in Montecito, California, where Harry and Meghan have lived since stepping back from their royal roles in 2020.

A post shared by Meghan, Duchess of Sussex (@meghan)

Since their royal exit, Harry and Meghan have raised Archie and Lilibet away from the public eye. Both children share their father's red hair, which Harry has credited to his late mother's family.

“The Spencer gene is very, very strong,” Harry said during a 2023 appearance on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.” He added, “I actually really, genuinely thought at the beginning of my relationship [with Meghan] that should this go the distance and we have kids, that there's no way the ginger gene will stand up to my wife's genes, but I was wrong! Go gingers.”

The Father's Day post also comes amid ongoing tension between Harry and his father, King Charles III. In a BBC interview on May 2, Harry said, “He won't speak to me because of this security stuff,” referring to his legal battle to reinstate U.K. protection for his family.

“I would love reconciliation with my family,” he continued. “There's no point in continuing to fight anymore. Life is precious. I don't know how much longer my father has.”

As reported by People, the palace has denied that King Charles has the power to restore the high-level security Harry is seeking. Since moving to the U.S., the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have returned to the U.K. only once with their children, for Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee in 2022.

As Meghan continues to use her Instagram handle @meghan to spotlight personal moments and professional projects, the Father's Day tribute stood out for its emotional tone and family-first focus.

Justin Timberlake gushed about being a dad in a heartfelt post on Father's Day!

The “SexyBack” singer expressed his happiness at being a father in a touching Instagram post on Sunday, June 15.

“There's no bigger reward or responsibility that I have ever felt in my life above being a father,” he wrote. “To teach and to learn at the same time… I feel beyond blessed.”

A post shared by Justin Timberlake (@justintimberlake)

The 44-year-old shared a trio of images with his two sons Silas, 10, and Phineas, 4. He shares the two with his wife Jessica Biel.

Timberlake expressed his gratefulness for both his dad and his stepdad.

He continued, “I see my two dads, my grandfathers, my uncles more and more clearly every year that I get to experience this life with them. And I see myself more and more clearly in every moment I have with my sons, watching who they continue to become.”

“The Social Network” actor added his warmest wishes to all fathers. “You can't put a price tag on that type of generational wealth! Here's to all the Dads out there! Cheers! Happy Father's Day!” he concluded.

In 2024, Timberlake penned an equally heartwarming tribute, expressing his happiness at being a father to his two sons.

“My 2 greatest gifts. I learn more about myself everyday just because you both chose me to be your Dad,” he began. 

A post shared by Justin Timberlake (@justintimberlake)

He added, “I will always be there for you through your peaks and valleys… to lift you up and show you how high you can take this life and to pick you up when you fall.”

Timberlake noted there will be plenty of dad jokes.

“And, of course, to flood you with insufferable Dad-jokes all along the way. I love you both so much. Thank you for giving me my biggest purpose,” he concluded.

Biel took to her Instagram story to wish her husband a happy Father's Day.

“Happy Father's Day to the best dad out there. We love you so much,” she wrote with a red heart emoji.

“Celebrating you today and forever,” she added alongside an image of Timberlake holding one of their kids.

The two married in October 2012 after years of dating.

Biel previously spoke on raising kids when speaking with InStyle in May.

 “It really takes a village to raise any kid, let alone in a wild business like this where parents are traveling for long times for work,” she said.

Alexis Bellino, known for her role on “The Real Housewives of Orange County,” is entering a new chapter both personally and financially. As she gears up to marry fiancé John Janssen, Bellino has listed her home in San Juan Capistrano for $2.95 million—about $1.65 million more than she originally paid for the property in 2018, per The Daily Dish.

According to Reality Blurb, the listing reflects Bellino's ongoing transition as she prepares to wed Janssen, whom she got engaged to in August 2024 after nine months of dating. The timing aligns with her recent public statements about “more changes” coming to her life.

A post shared by Alexis Bellino (@alexis_bellino)

According to the property listing, the four-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bathroom residence sits inside the exclusive Marbella Country Club, a guard-gated community known for its luxurious amenities. Spanning 3,952 square feet, the home boasts high-end features such as cathedral ceilings, a wine cellar, and a three-car garage. The in-law floor plan and open kitchen-living area add to the home's flexible layout.

Outside, the estate features a heated in-ground pool and spa, an outdoor bar with a built-in barbecue and refrigerator, and a cozy seating area with a fireplace.

A post shared by Alexis Bellino (@alexis_bellino)

Bellino, a mother of three, purchased the home during her divorce from ex-husband Jim Bellino. 

Although the Bravo star has not disclosed where she and Janssen plan to live after the sale, she previously hinted at their current arrangement in a 2024 interview with The Daily Dish. “I mean, we pretty much live together right now, anyway. We bounce back between both homes,” she said. “We decided we're going to keep both homes. I have twins (Mackenna Bellino and Miles Bellino) in high school still. We don't want to uproot anybody from their normal, so we're gonna keep both homes for a while.”

Bellino has also shared that she and Janssen plan to reassess their real estate situation once her twins graduate in 2026. “We'll decide then,” she added. “Of course, we're gonna buy a home together when we decide to not have both homes, but, until then, we're just back and forth.”

The upcoming wedding is expected to take place later this summer, and Bellino has revealed that it will be “very unconventional.” 

In an April interview with People, she teased ceremony and dress details, saying, “The gown is actually complementing exactly what we want the wedding to be. It is unconventional, head to toe.” She added, “I am this bride that did not want conventional and did not want an ordinary dress.”

A new “Harry Potter” TV series is coming to HBO, and 12 cast members have officially been confirmed. After casting directors watched “tens of thousands of children” audition for the Golden Trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, we now know who will be taking on those beloved roles. Here's a look at the entire cast of the latest adaptation of J.K. Rowling's books.

A fresh-faced young actor named Dominic McLaughlin has been cast as Harry Potter in the HBO series, succeeding Daniel Radcliffe. Despite having zero released credits on IMDb, McLaughlin is slated to star in the upcoming comedy “Grow” alongside Golda Rosheuvel and Nick Frost.

Another young actor without prior acting credits, Alastair Stout has landed the role of Harry's best friend at Hogwarts Ron Weasley. Stout and his red hair looks nearly identical to a young Rupert Grint, who originated the role in the movies.

A post shared by Max (@streamonmax)

Inheriting the role of one of Hogwarts' smartest students, Hermione Granger, from Emma Watson is Arabella Stanton. She made her acting debut in London's West End starring as Matilda in “Matilda: The Musical.”

The Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was played by two actors in the “Harry Potter” film series: Richard Harris and Michael Gambon. In the new HBO series, the role of Albus Dumbledore, the powerful wizard and most senior professor, goes to acting legend John Lithgow. 

Paapa Essiedu has been cast as potions professor Severus Snape, a role originated by the late Alan Rickman. Essiedu is known for “I May Destroy You” and “The Outrun.” Snape was a childhood enemy of Harry's dad, James, and loved his mom, Lily. He's also an early adversary of Harry and his classmates.

A post shared by Max (@streamonmax)

Taking over the role of Minerva McGonagall — the head of the Gryffindor House at Hogwarts — from the late Maggie Smith is Janet McTeer. Known for “Tumbleweeds” and “Albert Nobbs,” McTeer will play the transfiguration professor who is one of Harry, Ron, and Hermione's earliest allies.

Taking over the role of Hogwarts gamekeeper and half-giant Hagrid from the late Robbie Coltrane is Nick Frost. Appearing in films like “Shaun of the Dead” and “Paul,” Frost is also co-starring with McLaughlin in the upcoming comedy “Grow.”

Paul Whitehouse has been cast as Hogwarts caretaker Argus Filch, while the role of Quirinus Quirrell goes to Luke Thallon. Taking over the role of Draco Malfoy, which was originated by Tom Felton, is Lox Pratt.

Bel Powley and Daniel Rigby have been confirmed as cast members of the “Harry Potter” series, taking on the roles of Petunia and Vernon Dursley, respectively. Katherine Parkinson will star as Molly Weasley, Alessia Leoni takes on the role of Parvati Patil, and Leo Earley will play the part of Seamus Finnigan. Rounding out the list of confirmed cast members is Bertie Carvel as Cornelius Fudge.

The new “Harry Potter” series is expected to premiere on HBO in 2027.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","As Jane Seymour Returns to Hallmark, She's Hoping to Reboot Her Hit TV Series","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/jane-seymour-dr-quinn-medicine-reboot/?adt_ei=[email]","Mon, 16 Jun 2025 12:31:00 GMT","

Hallmark fans were thrilled when the network announced in March 2025 that legendary actress Jane Seymour was filming a new holiday series in Ireland, with a working title of “The Twelve Dates of Christmas.” 

When the series, which also stars “Parenthood” alum Mae Whitman and two-time Oscar nominee Mary McDonnell, premieres during Hallmark Channel's Countdown to Christmas programming in late 2025, it will mark Seymour's first new project with Hallmark since she co-starred with Lacey Chabert in 2014's “A Royal Christmas.” 

But she certainly hasn't been missing from Hallmark. Reruns of Seymour's hit 90s series “Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman” air regularly on Hallmark Family and are available to stream on Hallmark+. On June 14, 2025, the actress told Swooon she'd love to revisit the show with her fprmer co-star, Joe Lando. Could Hallmark be the right home for a reboot?

A post shared by Dr.Quinn, Medicine Woman (@dr.quinn_medicine_woman)

The period romance series “Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman” aired on CBS from 1993 to 1997, with Seymour as Dr. Michaela Quinn, a.k.a. Dr. Mike, and Joe Lando as her romantic interest, Byron Sully. The setting was 1860 in Colorado Springs. 

In the nearly 30 years since the show went off the air, Seymour and Lando have remained close friends. So close, in fact, that in January, she welcomed him and his family into her house for several weeks, per Variety, after his home burned to the ground in the Los Angeles wildfires. According to Los Angeles Magazine, she took in Lando, six other members of his family, including his wife, two German Shepherds, and two pet birds.

Telling Swooon they would both love to work together again, Seymour said it could be on “literally anything,” but that no networks have picked up on the idea of a “Dr. Quinn” reboot yet. She noted that she'd jump at the chance “if somebody wanted to, but we haven't found anyone that wants to, which I find astounding since they brought every show that's ever been made back.” 

“Somebody has to put Joe and I together in something,” she continued, noting that her posts often go viral when she features him in them. ”I mean, even looking it up, apparently we don't have to really do anything terribly interesting. It's like seeing us together.” 

The duo did film a Christmas movie called “A Christmas Spark” for Lifetime “a few years ago” she said, but added that “Joe and I are actively looking for something to do just because we love working together, but also because we know the fan base would really be hungry for it.”

In December 2023, Seymour told The Messenger blog — according to Deadline — that despite the popularity of shows like “Yellowstone,” no networks had wanted to pick up her new idea for a reboot of “Dr. Quinn.”

“We've actually got one written, and we've got the whole series planned out,” Seymour said. “We just took it to one of the networks, and they said that they weren't interested in Westerns.”

“I think it's really crazy,” she continued. “There seems to be a lot of very successful Westerns, so I didn't get that at all.”

Hallmark did try a modern-day, Western-infused production with “RIDE” in 2023, but it lasted only one season despite its star-studded cast including Nancy Travis and Marcus Rosner.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Luann de Lesseps Dishes on That New Sparkly Ring","https://entertainmentnow.com/bravo/luann-de-lesseps-engagement-rumor-update/?adt_ei=[email]","Mon, 16 Jun 2025 14:33:52 GMT","

Engagement rumors are swirling after the June 15, 2025, finale of Bravo's “Love Hotel.” Luann de Lesseps is now sharing some details on her love life after checking out of the hotel with suitor James Quine.

Just a few weeks ago, Luann was spotted out with a sparkly diamond on her wedding finger, and she explained everything on the June 15, 2025, episode of “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen.” 

When Luann popped up in the Hamptons, packing on the PDA with a new man, while wearing the new ring, engagement rumors followed. At the time, Luann told Us Weekly, “I will say that I got a brand new ring, and I'm a very happy girl, and that's all I can say about that for now.”

Thankfully, Luann gave more details about her new ring to Andy Cohen. “It is an aquamarine [ring]. It was a gift from one of my admirers, that's all I'm gonna say,” she said, confirming that the man who gave her the ring is not her “Love Hotel” costar.  When asked why she was wearing the ring on her wedding finger, the “Real Housewives of New York City” alum said that “it doesn't fit this one,” referring to her right hand.

Luann then pointed out the gold key that she wears on a necklace, a gift from her “Love Hotel” choice, James Quine.

James Quine may have left “Love Hotel” with Luann, but she says that he doesn't mind her still seeing other people.

She shared with Andy Cohen, “You know what I love about James. He said to me, ‘You know, Lu, I live in Hawaii, I can't be there with you all the time. It is totally OK if you date, and when we see each other, we see each other, because I love you.”

The two clicked because of their aristocratic backgrounds. On the show, James said that his stepmother was a close friend of Princess of Monaco Grace Kelly, while Luann was previously married to Count Alexandre de Lesseps.

“My father-in-law was the ambassador of Monaco for 40 years, and his stepmother was the best friend of Grace Kelly. They were both at the wedding of Rainier to Princess Grace. So we connected that way,” explained Lu on “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen.”

Do movie stars still exist? Film journalists, cinephiles, and producers have been debating this point for over a decade, declaring the movie star extinct.

But throughout the 2010s, Hollywood leaned into intellectual properties and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, while original films starring A-list talents like Jennifer Lawrence (“Passengers”), Johnny Depp (“The Lone Ranger”), and Will Smith (“Gemini Man”) flopped, and gradually everybody seemed to be lining up to pay their respects at the grave of the movie star. 

They've blamed the death on Hollywood's hunger for IP, the erasure of the mid-budget movie, and the rise of television. But many of these arguments miss the forest for the trees: We not only still have movie stars today, but stardom today is very similar to what it was in the Golden Age of Hollywood. The film industry is not post-movie stars, and big-name actors still influence audiences' viewing habits and films' financial success.

Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, whose films “Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning” and “F1” are in theaters this summer, are widely considered the last “true” movie stars, the few aged movie veterans still capable of reliably opening a film. But contrary to popular belief, stardom is not dependent on watertight box office potential — Katharine Hepburn, for instance, was considered box office poison for years. From 1935's “Break of Hearts” until at least “The Philadelphia Story” in 1940, her films consistently earned great reviews but poor attendance. 

 










Cary Grant also made many commercial failures while still a leading man, including George Cukor's “Holiday” and “Bringing Up Baby” (in which he co-starred with Hepburn). Cruise and Pitt might be movie stars, but they still have off days, like “Rock of Ages” or “Wolfs,” respectively. These actors certainly elevate the profile of their films and increase the likelihood that they'll make money, but financial security doesn't automatically determine who's a movie star.

What makes an actor a movie star is their persona. When you watch Cruise hug the door of an airplane as it takes off in “Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation,” you forget you're watching the character of Ethan Hunt. Instead, you're watching the carefully crafted screen persona of Tom Cruise, action hero, who will risk certain death if it means delivering cinema to his adoring fans.

In 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported that Jason Statham, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, and Vin Diesel had unique contracts for their collaborations in the “Fast and Furious” franchise that basically meant they couldn't lose fights. Statham's contract reportedly protected him from getting beaten up too much on screen, while Johnson and Diesel had people on set to monitor how many licks they got.

 










Such contracts are nothing new in Hollywood, and many scholars of classic Hollywood will likely recollect the strict contracts studios had for their stars in that era.

In the old days, stars — especially female stars — were put on strict diets, their names often changed, and they were usually given voice lessons to learn that classic Transatlantic diction. Control over a star's image went even further than that, though. Jean Harlow was forbidden by studio mandate from marrying, since producers at MGM didn't want to complicate her image as a sex symbol. Actors like Ava Gardner, Judy Garland, Jean Harlow, Marilyn Monroe, and Fay Wray were all contractually prevented from having children — some, according to lore, were forced to have abortions.

Now, Hollywood studios no longer own their stars' images; they haven't since the early 1960s. Instead, actors control their own images, and they have teams of agents, publicists, and, sometimes, personal stylists on hand to do it. When Emily Blunt and Penélope Cruz became pregnant while making “Into the Woods” and “Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,” respectively, they weren't dropped from the films — instead, the costume departments, stunt teams, and directors accommodated the actors and their pregnancies, reimagining complex sequences and altering costumes as needed.

 










Actors today still rely on contracts, creative control over their productions, and agreements with producers to build and maintain consistent images. The 21st-century definition of brand image means that some movie stars get typecast — unless, like Emma Stone, Kristen Stewart, Anna Kendrick, and Jennifer Lawrence, an actor leverages their mainstream success to break the mold and make independent films.

Some naysayers allege that the decline of film stars is due to social media, that having the increased exposure of celebrities' personal lives has made them seem less alluring. But these stars still have agents and publicists, and as such, major actors like Jennifer Lawrence, Zendaya, Tom Hanks, and Ryan Reynolds still have carefully cultivated images, the same way that Jimmy Stewart, Charlie Chaplin, Veronica Lake, and Rita Hayworth did. Some actors preserve the illusion (and their own privacy) by not being on social media at all, including Lawrence, Pitt, and Johansson, but they still engage with viral marketing, which includes everything from GQ and Vanity Fair's career breakdowns to eating spicy wings on “Hot Ones.” The stars might be on TikTok now, but they're still stars.

At Comic-Con 2017, “Captain America: Brave New World” star Anthony Mackie famously said that there are no movie stars anymore. “Anthony Mackie isn't a movie star,” he said. “The Falcon is a movie star.” And Mackie is right that, increasingly, Hollywood has hitched its wagon to intellectual property over original ideas — and the stars have, too. Quentin Tarantino echoed these words in 2022, saying, “It's these franchise characters that become a star,” rather than the actors playing them.

 










In 2024, out of the 50 highest-grossing domestic films in the U.S. according to BoxOfficeMojo, 32 were IP-driven movies (i.e., remakes, reboots, or sequels) with huge stars in them, like “Bad Boys: Ride or Die” starring Will Smith. Six films, like “Wicked” and “The Fall Guy,” adapted successful IP for the screen. Only 13 films in the top 50 were star-driven projects that didn't rely on IP, and even among that group, you can identify some, like “Red One” or “Argylle,” that seem like they're trying to astroturf a franchise. Others, like “Anyone But You” and “Bob Marley: One Love,” adapt material many are familiar with — William Shakespeare and the life of Bob Marley, respectively — which helps with brand recognition but means they're not wholly original works.

Simply headlining a film these days does not make someone a movie star. But it's always been that way. Chris Evans, Brie Larson, and Chadwick Boseman all headlined movies that grossed a billion dollars worldwide, but those films were built around the brands, characters, and stories rather than the actors. It's telling that Marvel has recast both Captain America and Black Panther (passing the mantle onto Letitia Wright's Shuri) and still found box office success, but rather than recast a new Iron Man and replace its biggest star, Robert Downey Jr., the studio invited him back in a completely different role for “Avengers: Doomsday.” Marvel didn't kill the movie star; they know the value of one as much as anyone else.

 










The difference between a movie star and an A-list actor is a fine line. Timothée Chalamet, for example, straddles the line between movie star and character actor, choosing complex roles that require him to inhabit radically different characters and show off his range and acting chops. Yet when you watch “A Complete Unknown,” you're not seeing Chalamet disappear into Bob Dylan. You're seeing Chalamet pretending to be Bob Dylan — the performance is as much about the actor as it is about the character.

His character actor contemporaries like Tilda Swinton, Gary Oldman, Lakeith Stanfield, Paul Giamatti, and Toni Collette become whatever their roles require them to be. But Chalamet is still Chalamet, regardless of what costume or affectation he's wearing. He has a brand and an identity that shows through in all of his roles and that he carries with him to every single film, just like Meryl Streep or Tom Cruise. His films might not always make their money back, and he might not be hanging on the wing of a biplane, but his persona is what makes him a star.

Movies in the first half of the 2020s have been largely defined by disruption — not the abstract and self-serving kind that the tech industry has been trying to sell us for much of the 21st century, but the all too real kind that a global pandemic and several overlapping strikes have imposed on a medium that was already engaged in an existential crisis when the decade first began. Yet despite all those headaches and several others (e.g., live-action remakes, people taking pictures of the screen with their phones, “Morbius”), cinema basically just continued to do what it has since its first invention: die and be reborn before our eyes. 

From galvanizing pleasures like “Top Gun: Maverick” to formal gambits like “The Zone of Interest,” from movies that pointedly reflected on the history of image-making (“Nickel Boys,” “All Light Everywhere”) to movies that dared to imagine its future (“Megalopolis,” “We're All Going to the World's Fair”), and from bracing late-career works from established masters (“EO,” “Benediction”) to vital offerings from new voices (“Eephus,” “A Thousand and One”), the best features we've seen over the last five years have reminded us that film is forever precisely because it's always in a state of flux. 

To take stock of the decade to date, and to encourage readers to map their own connections between the movies that have resonated with us from that stretch, IndieWire's staff has assembled our list of the 100 best films of the 2020s. To emphasize relevance, we've included recent Cannes and Sundance premieres that have not yet been theatrically released in the U.S.; by the same token, we chose not to include titles that premiered on the festival circuit in 2019, even if they didn't make it stateside until 2020 (hence the absence of “Beanpole,” “Vitalina Varela,” et al.). And if any of our choices make you mad, well, take solace in the fact that it could all look completely different in another five years.

The following writers contributed to this list: Samantha Bergeson, Christian Blauvelt, Ben Croll, Robert Daniels, Jude Dry, David Ehrlich, Kate Erbland, David Katz, Sophie Monks Kaufman, Proma Khosla, Eric Kohn, Ryan Lattanzio, David Opie, Adam Solomons, and Christian Zilko.

As personal and egoless as you could ever hope to expect from an $120 million self-portrait that doubles as a fable about the fall of Ancient Rome, Francis Ford Coppola's “Megalopolis” is the story of an ingenious eccentric who dares to stake his fortune on a more optimistic vision for the future — not because he thinks he can single-handedly bring that vision to bear, but rather because history has taught him that questioning a civilization's present condition is the only reliable hope for preventing its ruin. Needless to say, the movie didn't arrive a minute too soon. 

After more than 40 years of idly fantasizing about the project (and more than 20 years of actively trying to finance it), Coppola brought “Megalopolis” to screens at a moment when his chosen medium was — and continues to be — struggling to find a way forward, and the world around it seems teetering on the brink of collapse. Just as in 63 B.C., when an evil patrician named Catiline appealed to a coalition of malcontents in a bid to overthrow the Republic, we are choked by the grip of delusional aristocrats and vertically integrated conglomerates whose lust for power and profit is only matched by their lack of foresight. Even with the past as our guide, we are at imminent risk of allowing the now to destroy the forever. 

“Megalopolis” was labeled a folly long before its “what the fuck was that?” Cannes premiere and disastrous theatrical run, but the constant madness of its folly — and the occasional disaster of its design — serve as conduits for its writer/director/producer/financier's entire creative ethos. Coppola might lack the imagination required to invent the new cinema that his new movie so desperately wishes it could will into being, but he's always seen the need for it better and more urgently than any of his contemporaries.

With “Megalopolis,” he crams 85 years worth of artistic reverence and romantic love into a clunky, garish, and transcendently sincere manifesto about the role of an artist at the end of an empire. It doesn't just speak to Coppola's philosophy, it embodies it to its bones. To quote one of the sharper non-sequiturs from a script that's swimming in them: “When we leap into the unknown, we prove that we are free.” —DE

Spanish filmmaker Victor Erice has only made three films since debuting with his extraordinary “The Spirit of the Beehive” in 1973, and while all of them have argued for — and served to remind audiences of — cinema's unique power as a medium, none have done so more powerfully or more plaintively than “Close Your Eyes.” Erice's latest stunner tells the story of a retired director who becomes re-obsessed with the unfinished movie that ruined his career, and determines to solve the mystery of why his lead actor disappeared in the middle of the shoot. From that simple premise Erice unravels the most nakedly personal film he's ever made. At times, it feels like the only film he's ever made. Or maybe all of them at once. 

Sedate but ultimately shattering by dint of its simplicity (and its absolute slam-dunk of a final scene), “Close Your Eyes” is neither an autobiographical cine-memoir à la “The Fabelmans” nor a teary-eyed tribute to the magic of the movies in the vein of “Cinema Paradiso.” Yet, as if by accident and divine purpose all at once, it also manages to become both of those things by the end. Set at the dawn of the streaming age and shot with the funereal sterility that came with it, “Close Your Eyes” openly laments the loss of a more tactile film experience (the kind that included actual film), but only so that it can honor the way certain images take root inside us when seen under the right circumstances.

As he nears the end of a career that has always been fascinated by the liminal space between artifice and reality, however, Erice is somehow able to fulfill cinema's miraculous promise as a vehicle of eternal return; as a magic trick capable of keeping the past alive long after it's already died within us. The movies are real, “Close Your Eyes” insists with the intensity of an old master seizing what might be his last chance to say it. How much of ourselves will we lose if we forget how to project them properly? —DE

Rungano Nyoni's lucid and incandescently furious “On Becoming a Guinea Fowl” is a stiff middle finger to wishful thinking. Set in a middle-class Zambian suburb that's located at a well-trafficked but poorly maintained intersection between global influences and Bemba mores, the “I Am Not a Witch” filmmaker's second feature tells the story of a Westernized young woman who's forced to hold her extended family tree together by its roots during a crisis that leaves her wanting to rip the whole thing out of the earth with her bare hands.

There are moments of beauty and resilience to be found amid the buried pain she uncovers along the way, but don't be fooled by the heroine's Zoom meetings with her British co-workers or her sad penchant for American life hack podcasts: The future might not have all the answers, but it's the past that she won't be able to forgive. Which leads us to another fascinating way that Nyoni manages to subvert one of recent cinema's most calcified sub-genres: The protagonist's family may be her greatest connection to her cultural memory, but their eagerness to forgive the past ultimately requires them to forget it. —DE

A dorky Caligulan ode to the early days of Hollywood, Damien Chazelle's sprawling “Babylon” may begin in 1926, but the movie is soon burdened with a clairvoyance that allows it to become unstuck in time. Several of the epic's characters are haunted by glimpses of a future they're powerless to prevent, a curse that its director brings to bear by drawing inspiration from across the entire spectrum of film history.

Burdened with the knowledge that this $80 million studio project could be the last of its kind, “Babylon” refracts Hollywood's first major identity crisis through the prism of its latest one. It reminds us the movies have been dying for more than 100 years, and then — through its heart-bursting, endearingly galaxy-brained prayer of a finale — interprets that as uplifting proof they'll actually live forever. It doesn't have any idea how the movies will do it, or where the hell they might go from here, but its mad conviction is strong enough make us share in that belief. —DE

Alain Guiraudie‘s extraordinary and wonderfully twisted queer noir begins on a long, snaking, winding drive and ends with a man and a woman, who are unrelated and unmarried, in bed, and a light turned out. With “Misericordia,” the director of “Stranger by the Lake” and “Staying Vertical” reunites with cinematographer Claire Mathon (“Portrait of a Lady on Fire”) for a bleakly funny tragicomedy about the unavoidability of our desires and their destructive power. The story of a man named Jérémie (Félix Kysyl) who travels to small-town France in order to pay his respects to his newly deceased old boss, “Misericordia” watches from a smirking remove as its protagonist begins to tug at the knotted psychosexual dynamics he shares with the dead man's widow (Catherine Trot) and her oafish bruiser of a son. 

Through all of its twists and turns, the film confirms Guiraudie as our keenest, canniest director to bring male longing and its fallouts and physical particulars back to movie screens. This masterful film doesn't represent quite the shock “Stranger by the Lake” was for many — with unsimulated sex scenes and a marrying of queer love to criminality — but there's something cozy about “Misericordia” that, even in its most profane moments, leaves you with a knowing grin shared by the movie itself. —RL

With “Dune: Part One” Denis Villeneuve accomplished a seemingly impossible task that had even evaded David Lynch: turn Frank Herbert's sandy, esoteric sci-fi mythology into mainstream blockbuster cinema without sacrificing what made it unique. But the second part of his adaptation posed an even harder challenge. The first “Dune” film largely followed the beats of a traditional sci-fi film, portraying a young hero (Timothee Chalamet's Paul Atreides) who gradually comes to accept his destiny. Faithful readers know that the series ultimately takes the character in a far different direction, and “Dune: Part Two” had to begin sewing the seeds of the evil that emerges at the intersection of religious fanaticism and charismatic leaders.

With “Part Two,” Villeneuve delivered a murkier, morally grayer sequel that took a deep dive into constant sacrificing of pawns and knights that's required to consolidate and maintain power. In the larger canon of cinema history, the film might always be reduced to its incredible sandworm riding sequence — undeniably the most impressive spectacle that the series has captured to date — but its biggest achievement is the way that Villeneuve and co-writer Spaihts make the backroom political and religious dealings seem even more riveting. —CZ

A true-life American tragedy that leverages the summery Texas idyll of “Dazed & Confused” into a larger than life — but heartbreakingly sincere — re-telling of “King Lear,” “The Iron Claw” is a wrestling epic inspired by a legend so sad that writer-director Sean Durkin felt like he had to sand it down in order for it to seem believable on screen. Inverting the fake it so real ethos of a sport that's long been enjoyed as a form of steroidal theater (its operatic melodrama sustained by the exaggerated nature of its spectacle and vice-versa), Durkin's film dials back the body count so that the scale of its loss doesn't make it impossible for audiences to accept that it actually happened, or to exalt in the love that it ultimately left behind. 

Scholars of wrestling's pre-WWF history might see “The Iron Claw” as an act of erasure, but Durkin's choice to streamline the Von Erich family saga befits the ecstasy of a sport where the line between truth and fiction is body-slammed from the top rope a dozen times every match. It certainly plays into the powerful kayfabe of a movie about four brothers — there were five in real life, or six if you really want to pour salt in the wound — whose father conditioned them to be so focused on winning that they couldn't see how he rigged their biggest fights against them. 

Besides, just as a “fake” wrestling punch could probably knock you unconscious, even this “watered down” story about the curse that Fritz Von Erich passed down to his sons like a self-fulfilling prophecy is still powerful enough to pile-drive you with the force of a WWE World Champion. You can call it “‘The Virgin Suicides' for boys,” you can call it “Louisa May Alcott's ‘Little He-Men,'” you can even call it an insult to Chris Von Erich's memory if you want. However you choose to think of it, “The Iron Claw” deserves at least one title that simply cannot be contested: This is one of the heavyweight tear-jerkers of the decade. —DE

“Evil Does Not Exist” would have been a bold statement for someone to make in the year 2024, but — as it turns out in Ryûsuke Hamaguchi's eerie and elusive ecological tone poem about man, nature, and man's nature — the statement is not necessarily something the Japanese filmmaker believes. At first, this gently lilting film even seems like a call for compassion; set in a bucolic village on the outskirts of Tokyo it centers on how the village's inhabitants tangle with a corporation trying to set up a glamping site in their forest, only for the two opposing sides to eventually find common ground. But that entente proves a foil for a much darker twist Hamaguchi pulls in the film's last act.

“Evil Does Not Exist” is a slow-moving film with little in the way of epiphanies or answers. Hamaguchi's reverence for nature is reflected in his unhurried views of the village's flora and fauna, and in the plaintive tones of Eiko Ishibashi's jazz-inflected score — which, like the film itself, is prone to shockingly unexpected paroxysms of violence. In this case, they convey the underlying dissonance of our world with a clarity that leaves the film's peaceful surface of fir trees and council meetings feeling like a sinister cover-up. —RL

Chile, 1893. A wealthy landowner who's bought up most of Tierra del Fuego recruits the Scotsman who manages his security to exterminate the Indigenous Selk'nam people on his land. The Scot only wants one man to accompany him, a mixed-race mestizo of Indigenous descent who's barely out of his teenage years, but the landowner insists that MacLennan also take along a wily Texan with a strong drawl and a big rep. 

So begins one of the most chilling art-Westerns to come along in some time, as provocative for its ideas, dialogue, and characterizations, as for the beauty of its empty landscapes. Felipe Galvez's “The Settlers” may remind some viewers of a Budd Boetticher film when they're watching it: following three men on horseback on a cross-country journey, it dramatizes questions of identity and belonging, and how these things can be written in violence. Most Boetticher-like, in a tight 98 minutes “The Settlers” says more than a lot of films double its length. It's also a deeply felt work of activism with a message that needs to be heard in Chile. Just as nothing about the Pinochet coup in 1973 or the resulting dictatorship is taught in Chilean schools today, so is nothing about the genocide of the Selk'nam, a culture that is considered extinct, with only one living person today able to speak their language. This is a film that shows that, as easy as it is to forget about the past, it's easier still when it was never taught in the first place. —CB

An immensely, unstoppably, ecstatically demented fairy tale about female self-hatred, Coralie Fargeat's “The Substance” will stop at nothing — and we mean nothing — to explode the ruthless beauty standards that society has inflicted upon women for thousands of years, a burden this camp-adjacent instant classic aspires to cast off with some of the most spectacularly disgusting body horror this side of “The Fly.”

If the “Revenge” director's immaculately crafted debut tried to dismantle male toxicity with a shotgun blast square to the balls, Fargeat's riotous follow-up turns that same attention inwards, allowing her to take aim at both the pointlessness she's been conditioned to feel as a forty-something woman, and also at the resentment she's been conditioned to feel toward her younger self. Squelching with fury at how a woman's “fuckability'”is used as the ultimate measure of her worth, the result of Fargeat's mad experiment is equal parts “Freaky Friday,” “All About Eve,” and Andrzej Żuławski's “Possession” — simple enough for a child to understand, but gross enough to make squeamish adults spew out their lunch. Those with the stomach to stick it out were rewarded with the most sickly entertaining theatrical experience of the decade, one carried by the kind of go-for-broke performance that Hollywood stars only tend to give after they reach a certain age and start running out of options. —DE

In his 2023 essay film “Pictures of Ghosts,” a haunted cine-memoir that uses Recife's once-glorious movie palaces as a lens through which to examine — and to mourn — the cultural amnesia of a country so determined to forget itself, Brazilian auteur Kleber Mendonça Filho somewhat counterintuitively observes that “Fiction films are the best documentaries.” If Mendonça had to make a documentary in order to illustrate that idea, the sober but gripping thriller that it inspired him to shoot next proves the point with gusto.

The focused but sprawling story of a wanted man named Marcelo (Wagner Moura) who travels to Recife in the hopes of collecting his son and escaping the country, the director's 1977-set period piece is absolutely teeming with the music, color, and style of the “Brazilian Miracle” that marked the height of the country's military dictatorship. Far from the high-octane spy picture that might be suggested by its title (a title that's easy to imagine written in giant letters across the marquee of Recife's São Luiz Cinema), “The Secret Agent” only bumps into espionage tropes as if by accident, and its protagonist seems to be as confused by them as we are. On the contrary, Mendonça's movie operates at the pace and tenor of a drama in exile, albeit one that's fringed with B-movie fun and stalked by a pair of unscrupulous hitmen.

“The Secret Agent” is ultimately a tale of “mischief” more than anything else. That's the word Mendonça uses to identify the time period in the film's opening title card, and it accurately sets the scene for a story less rooted in the terror of Walter Salles' “I'm Still Here” than in the wistful barbarity of Wes Anderson's “The Grand Budapest Hotel.” The joy it takes in exhuming a semi-erased time allows Mendonça to argue that movies can manufacture a meaningful history of their own — one powerful enough to cut through the erosion of truth, and the official record of a country that might be too ashamed of its own reflection to honestly look itself in the mirror. With “The Secret Agent,” Mendonça exhumes the past as the basis for a purely fictional story, and in doing so articulates how fiction can be even more valuable as a vehicle for truth than it is as a tool for covering it up. —DE

There is a lot of joy in the Jewish tradition (most of which stems from the shared recognition that it's somehow managed to survive), but happiness… well, there's a feeling that happiness might be for other people. God didn't choose us for that. If we had happiness, it wouldn't be happiness. At the same time, however, we can't help but want all the bliss in the world for our loved ones, even if I fear we might lose our ability to recognize them if they actually managed to find it. 

No film this side of “A Serious Man” has confronted that specific fear as directly as Nathan Silver's “Between the Temples,” a spiky, hilarious, and thoroughly unorthodox screwball comedy about a grief-stricken cantor (a note-perfect Jason Schwartzman) who loses his voice, only to find that he's surrounded by a chorus of well-intentioned people who are happy to speak for him — most crucially, his grade school music teacher, Carla (Carol Kane). Its punny title pointing towards the kind of latitude that Ben and Carla are begging for in order to find their bliss, “Between the Temples” ultimately isn't sure if happiness is viable in the long-term. But in focusing less on the happiness we imagine for other people than on the happiness we get to share with them instead, its characters find enough joy in each other to make being alive feel like its own eternal reward. —DE

Emma Stone is a woman who gets to start from scratch in Yorgos Lanthimos' unbound and astonishing new feature, “Poor Things.” For most of us, life is comprised of knowledge and circumstance that take decades to accumulate until we die.  

For Stone's Bella Baxter, that process happens in very fast motion, thanks to a reanimating procedure that finds her, once a dead woman floating in a river, now alive again with her unborn child's brain inside her head. Bella, née Victoria, is a living breathing tabula rasa unfettered by societal pressures, propriety, or niceties. And Stone, in her most brazenly weird performance to date, plays her like a toddler taking its first steps and saying its first words — until by the end of “Poor Things” she's speaking fluent French and studying anatomy, her eyes and ears full of worldliness.  

Boldly realized with taffy-colored production design, brain-bending sets stuffed with enough easter egg unrealities to fill the most difficult 5,000-piece jigsaw puzzle, and wildly over-the-top Victorian costumes that look as if made by a schizoid seamstress on too many tabs of acid, “Poor Things” is also hysterically funny. Lanthimos makes a sexually graphic picaresque that's part Terry Gilliam, part Ken Russell, about Bella's pursuit of pleasure but also her selfhood in a patriarchal world. Mark Ruffalo, Willem Dafoe, and Ramy Youssef each provide overwhelmingly hilarious turns as the men in Bella's life — her ridiculous lover, her creator, and her potential husband, respectively.  

“Poor Things” is the best film of Lanthimos' career and already feels like an instant classic, mordantly funny, whimsical and wacky, unprecious and unpretentious, filled with so much to adore that to try and parse it all here feels like a pitiful response to the film's ambitions. It's proof that whatever weird alchemy Stone and Lanthimos are vibing on after “The Favourite” is the real deal. —RL

The self-reflexive cinema of Robert Greene has covered a wide variety of different subjects and styles over the last decade, but his most resonant films — from the séance-like portraiture of “Kate Plays Christine” to the collective historical requiem of “Bisbee '17” — are bound together by a shared understanding of the camera as a conduit to the past. “Bisbee,” in which an entire Arizona mining town is provoked to re-stage the darkest chapter in its history, offers a particularly harrowing example of how Greene's lens often functions as a portal of sorts. It's as if his filmmaking process itself collapses space-time through the re-enactments that it compels, transposing now onto then in a way that leaves the two feeling as inextricable as fact and fiction. It meshes them together into a two-way street, or reveals all the ways in which they already are. In “Procession,” that street is revamped into an escape route.Here, Greene delivers a(nother) sober, powerful, and even disarmingly playful film that hinges on performance as a kind of therapy. The difference is that the subjects of “Procession” — six middle-aged survivors of childhood sexual abuse at the hands of Catholic priests and clergy in the Midwestern United States — see the camera less as a way to commune with the past than a way to shake loose from the traumatic grip its held on them since they were children. At Greene's invitation, it becomes a tool to dramatize (and even direct) their memories of abuse in a way that might allow them to physically relocate where the trauma is stored in their brains.

In some ways, Greene's film evokes Hirokazu Kore-eda's “After Life,” in which the newly deceased re-enact a favorite memory from their time on Earth in order to live inside of it for all eternity. “Procession” is effectively the negative image of that process, as these men are choosing the most cursed memory from their childhood and re-enacting it in order to escape from it. As one of the survivors puts it, referencing another movie with which all of them are assuredly familiar: “‘Spotlight' was about trying to get in from the outside. In our film, we're trying to get out.” It's not for us to say whether they do here, or will some day in the future, but cinema is a collaborative medium, and watching these men crew for each other is more than just a counterbalance to the Church's unforgivable betrayal — it's a beautiful work of art unto itself. —DE

Told with the rugged tenderness of a Flannery O'Connor novel but aptly named for a resilient Korean herb that can grow wherever it's planted, Lee Isaac Chung's semi-autobiographical “Minari” is a raw and vividly remembered story of two simultaneous assimilations; it's the story of a family — headed by Steven Yeun's Jacob — assimilating into a country, but also the story of a man assimilating into his family.

Gentle as the stream that flows through the Arkansas land where Jacob parks his trailer, and yet powerful enough to reverberate for generations to come, Chung's loving — and immensely lovable — immigrant drama interrogates the American Dream with the hard-edged hope of a family that needs to believe in something before they lose all faith in each other. Jacob is too proud to settle for somebody else's terms; he'll do anything to prove that he's leading his family to the promised land, even if no one else shares his vision of success.

From the opening notes of Emile Mosseri's ethereal piano score to the way that Monica keeps tugging Jacob back to reality, Chung's immaculate memory play is always poignantly in flux between shared recollections of the past and conflicting visions of the future. This beautiful film posits family as the ultimate journey, only to explore how difficult it can be to agree on a shared destination. —DE

Carson Lund's directorial debut shares its name with a slow-moving pitch that has largely been forgotten by modern baseball players — and it's a fitting title for a film that embraces the leisurely pacing of America's national pastime.

Almost too big to even be considered an ensemble film, “Eephus” plays out like a vast tableau of the way the game has shaped multiple generations of men. Lund introduces us to two dozen players of varying ages and ethnicities spread across the two teams, but none of the individual characters are particularly memorable on their own terms. That's not an indictment of anyone's writing or acting, but a reality necessitated by the film's larger point: These men are only showing us the parts of themselves that they bring to the field, and years of playing baseball together has shaped their little platoon into a coherent social organism with its own language, jokes, and rules of both the spoken and unspoken varieties. That's why the loss of this specific baseball league on this specific field feels so profoundly tragic to everyone. 

One of the most admirable artistic choices that “Eephus” makes is the decision not to blame anyone for the social decay that it portrays. The field is being destroyed to build a school, not some parking monstrosity or shopping mall owned by an evil corporation. An unbiased observer might even conclude that educating kids is a better use of this land than giving grown men a space to get hammered together. The film's only villain is the passage of time, and its protagonists are simply facing the unpleasant realization that their era is ending sooner than their lifespans. It's the fate that awaits most of us in one capacity or another, but nobody wants to think about that. So we play those extra innings in pitch darkness, just to say that we did it. —CZ

Arguably the first slow cinema heist movie, Rodrigo Moreno's dreamy and discursive “The Delinquents” might kick off with one of the most low-key bank robberies anyone has ever attempted, but it's hard to overstate how thrilling it feels once the thief finally tells us about what he stole. 

A middle-aged employee at a musty Buenos Aires bank that seems to have gotten stuck in the 1970s, Morán (Daniel Eliás) decides to walk out of the vault one day with a few dozen bricks of American cash in his backpack — the exact amount he would have earned before retirement if he worked every day for the next quarter of a century, and he plans to hide the money before doing jail time for his crime. It's just basic math: For the same payout, Morán could either spend three years in prison, or 25 years at the bank. He doesn't want to be rich, he just wants to be free. Free from capitalism, free from its lopsided farce of a work-life balance, and free from the strictures of conventional thinking, which don't just affect our schedules but also how we see the world itself. That might seem a foolish goal in a film less creatively unbound than the one Moreno has made here, but this playful three-hour reverie is so happily unmoored from the expectations of everyday storytelling that it's tempting to think Morán might not be tilting at windmills after all.  

Short by the standards of some recent Argentinian cinema, but still breezy and unhurried in a way that invites your mind to wander around without being leashed to the usual obligations of plot, “The Delinquents” is less interested in the details (or dramatic consequences) of Morán's theft than it is in how the very idea behind it begins to remap Román's entire worldview. The gym bag full of money that he stuffs into his bedroom closet doesn't provoke his greed so much as his imagination. When we're first introduced to Morán, he's determined to escape the rat race in which the first thing people ask each other is invariably some variation on “what do you do for work?,” as if that were the only meaningful way of assessing someone's value. So much as “The Delinquents” can be strictly defined as a film about anything, it's a film about the search for a better question. Answers are off the table here, all the way through the movie's wide, wide, wide open ending, but our frame of reference expands a bit further with every passing scene. —DE

An enormously poignant melodrama told at the volume of a broken whisper, Kōji Fukada's “Love Life” represents a major breakthrough for a filmmaker (“A Girl Missing,” “The Real Thing”) who's found the perfect story for his probing but distant style. In that light, it doesn't seem incidental that “Love Life” is a story about distance — specifically the distance between people who reach for each other in the wake of a tragedy that strands them far away from themselves. Inspired by the plaintive 1991 Akiko Yano song of the same name (in which the Japanese singer croons, “Whatever the distance between us, nothing can stop me from loving you”), “Love Life” introduces us to a domestic idyll that it disrupts with a deceptive casualness typical of Fukada's work. The bloom comes off the rose slowly at first, and then all at once in a single moment of everyday awfulness. While “Love Life” has its fair share of sharply written heart-to-hearts, many of its most touching moments (and all of its most telling ones) hinge on a certain kind of emotional geography. It's the way that Park, once unhoused, begins sleeping in the empty apartment across from Taeko and Jiro once the latter's parents move out of town. It's the reflections of sunlight that cut across Jiro's eye-line from across the courtyard, and the way that Taeko is seen speaking to someone just out of frame as the messiness of her feelings spills over the clear borders we're supposed to dig around them. –DE

A sickly picaresque guilt trip that stretches a single Jewish man's swollen neuroses into a three-hour nightmare so queasy and personal that sitting through it feels like being a guest at your own bris (in a fun way!), Ari Aster's seriocomic “Beau Is Afraid” may not fit the horror mold as neatly as his “Hereditary” or “Midsommar,” but this unmoored epic about a zeta male's journey to reunite with his overbearing mother eventually stiffens into what might be the most terrifying film he's made so far.

Mileage will vary on that score — the scares are typically less oh shit Toni Collette is spidering across the ceiling and more oy gevalt, Joaquin Phoenix's enormous prosthetic testicles are causing me to squirm under the weight of my own emotional baggage — but anyone who would sooner die for their mom than answer the phone when she calls should probably mix a few Zoloft into their popcorn just to be safe. Those people should brace for a movie that triggers the same cognitive dissonance from the moment it starts, often relying on that friction to propel its plot forward in lieu of dramatic conflict. Most of all, they should brace for a movie they'll love in an all too familiar way: unconditionally, but with a nagging exasperation over why it feels so hard. —DE

Before “Annette” dives into 140-odd minutes of moody songs and swooning tragicomic twists, director Leos Carax takes charge. In a grumbling voiceover, he advises his viewers to “hold you breath until the very end of the show.”  It's exactly the sort of impossible request that makes sense for this mind-blowing musical fantasia: “Annette” doesn't just take your breath away; it keeps your breath hostage until the credits roll.

Combining the energizing compositions of Sparks with Carax's ever-enigmatic creativity, “Annette” powers through its expressive rock opera conceit with a propulsive Adam Driver at its center. He sings through virtually every scene as if the world depended on it. And for the purposes of this movie, it does: Carax's first directorial effort that he didn't write, “Annette” turns on the peculiar balance of the Sparks' compositions, Carax's operatic style, and Driver's deranged performance as a comedian doomed to fail. Sure, there's also a wooden baby that sings and the occasional cutaway to a melancholic gorilla, but they all exist to support the larger cause.As a pure experimental ride expressed entirely through song, “Annette” delivers the same surreal blend of haunting beauty and dry, absurdist humor that Carax brought to “Holy Motors.” At times, it trades that movie's cosmic mystery for a blunter narrative arc. Sparks has apparently been trying to apply their winsome songwriting talent to film for decades, at one point even plotting with the late Jacques Tati, but their musical bonafides don't equate to a cogent script. Still, marvel at these flaws and the appeal of “Annette” comes to life: With a story less enthralling than the spectacular way it unfolds, the movie often exists in conflict with itself, and the messiness is its greatest asset as Carax and his musical companions map out the trajectory of a man marred by the exact same condition. —EK

Jane Schoenbrun understands the internet. The filmmaker behind such projects as “A Self-Induced Hallucination” (a 2018 doc “about the internet”), the tech-tinged “Eyeslicer” series, and the dreamy “collective: unconscious” had always found the space to explore the worldwide web with respect, reverence, and a hearty dose of fear. For their narrative feature debut, Schoenbrun expanded their obsessions to craft an intimate tale about the impact of modern internet culture — one that's part coming-of-age story, part horror film, and also the greatest argument yet for the beauty that “Creepypasta” can inspire.

Both Schoenbrun and their wonderful star, Anna Cobb bring profound empathy to both the film and Cobb's Casey. We first meet Casey alone in her attic room, as she stares headlong into a computer screen in which Schoenbrun has tucked their camera. Today, Casey is taking the World's Fair Challenge. For an internet wonk like her, that's a big deal, and one she hopes might loop her into a wider internet role-playing world. It's no wonder Casey would go looking for connection and expression online, there's certainly not much of it to be found in either her suburban sprawl hometown or her unhappy home, neither of which ever appear to be populated by anyone else. So what's the challenge? Just you wait.

Schoenbrun never traffics in easy explanations of what's happening, and even mentioning that things grow stranger as the film unfolds isn't precisely true. The circumstances Casey finds herself in are unsettling, but they're also human: She's looking for connection, and the potential cost of that quest hovers inside every frame of Schoenbrun's fascinating feature. Even the more shocking twists of “We're All Going to the World's Fair” are rooted in reality, both online and off. —KE

Following the cannibalistic “Raw” with another ravenous film that pushes her fascination with the hunger and malleability of human flesh to even further extremes, Julia Ducournau's Palme d'Or-winning “Titane” made good on the promise of her debut and then some. Whatever you're willing to take from it (and it feels like the internet has not been especially kind to this movie in the years since its debut), there's no denying that “Titane” is the work of a demented visionary in full command of her wild mind; a shimmering aria of fire and metal that introduces itself as the psychopathic lovechild of David Cronenberg's “Crash” and Shinya Tsukamoto's “Tetsuo: The Iron Man” before shapeshifting into a modern fable about how badly people just need someone to take care of them and vice-versa.

During the first half of the film, it's hard to tell if you're watching the most fucked up movie ever made about the idea of found family, or the sweetest movie ever made about a serial killer who has sex with a car, poses as the adult version of a local boy who went missing a decade earlier, and then promptly moves in with the kid's still-grieving father. During the second half, it becomes obvious that it's both — that somehow it couldn't be one without the other. —DE

Dick Johnson dies many times in his daughter Kirsten's poignant and personal documentary, starting with the opening credits. But of course he's alive the whole time, playacting through an elaborate form of cinematic therapy with his filmmaker offspring as she wrestles with the anxiety of losing him. That concept could easily devolve into a navel-gazing exercise, but Kirsten Johnson (the veteran nonfiction cinematographer who directed 2016's wondrous collage film “Cameraperson”) enacts a touching and funny meditation on embracing life and fearing death at the same time. Oscillating from intimate father-daughter exchanges to surreal meta-fictional tangents, the movie lives within its riveting paradox, reflecting the queasy uncertainty surrounding its subject's fate — and, by extension, everyone's. Alternately hilarious, moving, and revelatory, “Dick Johnson Is Dead” manages to commune with a universal fear of death by transforming it into a celebration of life. —EK

Let's hear it for concise loglines. Consider the first film from Eva Victor, comedian and social media star, who makes an absolutely major debut with her “Sorry, Baby.” Per official press materials and Sundance releases, the film's synopsis is: “Something bad happened to Agnes. But life goes on… for everyone around her, at least.” Both simple and secretive, hinting at drama and revelations, and promising to root us firmly in Agnes' world.

That's certainly all true of “Sorry, Baby,” but no quick hit of words could ever accurately convey the power and potency of Victor's debut, a darkly funny and enormously tender film that, yes, is about what happens after the worst occurs, but with plenty of room to weave the light next to the dark. Something bad happens to Agnes, but Victor is a wise enough creator to understand that's only part of the story, because that's only part of life itself. And while Victor's film might be rooted specifically in Agnes' story and the bad thing at its center, in its specificity, there's still tremendous room for wider recognition and and revelation. —KE

It might seem too easy to observe that Brady Corbet's “The Brutalist” — a 215-minute slab of a film that spans 30 years in the life of Hungarian-Jewish architect and Holocaust survivor László Tóth (Adrien Brody), who flees to America in the hopes of building a better future — has been constructed to embody the aesthetics of its title character. Shot in VistaVision and projected on 300lbs.' worth of 70mm film stock, Corbet's epic draws a perfectly self-evident connection between the weight of its raw material and that of the concrete monolith Tóth creates over the course of the story, and the same could be said of its minimalistic framing, its bone-deep aversion to nostalgia, and, most of all, the movie's efforts to reveal the soul of its subject through the geometry of its design.

But anyone familiar with Corbet's previous features (“The Childhood of a Leader” and “Vox Lux”) will recognize that the seismic and shuddering obviousness of his style provides its own point. A deadly serious and fetishistically Euro-centric young auteur who's fascinated by the cyclical relationship between trauma and culture, Corbet delights in the violent cause-and-effect of the 20th century, which shook the Earth off its axis in a way that invited people to reimagine it in their own image.

Private lives were transmuted into public exteriors until it became impossible to ignore how we shape the world by moving through it, with personal experience revealed to be as inextricable from collective history as artists are from their work, as concrete is from a building, or — to put an even finer point on Corbet's latest greatest (and least hostile) accomplishment to date — as immigrants are from America. László Tóth is “The Brutalist,” and “The Brutalist” is László Tóth. Both of them are brilliant, broken, and immense. —DE

India's powerhouse film industry is now ubiquitous in the world of cinema, but nothing could have prepared anyone for the rousing success of S.S. Rajamouli's “RRR” (Rise, Roar, Revolt). The Telugu-language epic follows in the footsteps of Rajamouli's and Vijayendra Prasad's collaboration on the “Baahubali” films, packed — truly all but overflowing — with spectacular, outlandish action sequences (in the best way), allusion to the Hindu texts, and hypnotic songs.

N.T. Rama Rao Jr. and Ram Charan play two men who become fierce friends (maybe more, depending how you interpret that one montage) while deeply embroiled in India's simmering independence struggle in the 1920s. Unbeknownst to Bheem (N. T. Rama Rao Jr.), his new confidante is a double agent, dooming this relationship from the start.

In theory, so much of this film could be over-the-top and cheesy (and arguably is) — the terrible English accents, the visceral and graphic violence, the CGI animals, the dance battle to destroy imperialism — but it's also encased from start to finish in unrelenting sincerity from the writer, director, and performers. “RRR”s greatest revolution is against the award-bait movie archetype both in India and abroad — a spark that could ignite a whole movement. —PK

The first truly modern American Western, or at least the first one that has the nowness required to mention Pop Crave by name, Ari Aster's “Eddington” is also the first major Hollywood movie that's been willing to see the COVID pandemic for the hellacious paradigm shift that it was — as the moment when years of technologically engineered polarization tore a forever hole in the social fabric of a country that was already coming apart at the seams.

Few other filmmakers would have the chutzpah required to make a “No Country for Old Men” riff that hinges on mask mandates and the murder of George Floyd, and we should probably all be grateful that none of them have tried. But Aster, who's exclusively interested in making the kind of films that should be reviewed straight onto a prescription pad, is too beholden to his neuroses for his latest movie to play like a cheap provocation. This time, however, there's a good chance those are your neuroses, too.

Stemming from a collective sickness to the same degree that “Beau Is Afraid” was born from some very personal trauma, “Eddington” — the tagline for which reads: “Hindsight is 2020” — only wields its what's the opposite of nostalgia? specificity as a means to an end. It might set the scene with a little “remember how it felt to wait in line outside the pharmacy?” fun, but Aster's bleakly funny and brilliantly plotted assessment of how fucked we've become since then soon leverages those fun memories into a far more probing story about the difficulties of sharing a town between people who live in separate realities. —DE

There are two bruising lines that bookend first-time feature director A.V. Rockwell's “A Thousand and One,” a vivid portrait of Harlem life from the early 1990s to the mid-2000s.

“There's more to life than fucked-up beginnings,” Inez, a woman living life in New York on her own terms and brilliantly played by R&B super-artist/actress Teyana Taylor, tells her young son Terry (Aaron Kingsley Adetola). She has kidnapped him out of the foster care system, which has kept them separated after her stint in Rikers Island beginning in 1993, and now hopes to give him a better life. But at the end of the movie, after a decades-spanning, bittersweet bond forms and fizzles between them and shattering revelations are had, she tells the older Terry (Josiah Cross), “I fucked up. Life goes on. So what?”

A searing protest against the inhumanity of gentrification in a city whose policies and policing are already so punitive towards poor Black families, “A Thousand and One” serves as a sobering reminder of how fucked-up beginnings can hopefully bring about better endings. Cross is crucial to the success of the film's unforgettable final scenes, but it's Taylor who anchors Rockwell's direction and screenplay with her powerhouse performance. Taylor has worked with the likes of Tyler Perry in comedies, but her turn here — as fiercely committed to the character as Inez is to Terry — signals a major dramatic talent. —RL

The most resonant films about loss represent a wide variety of genres and modes, and yet they're all bound together by the shared understanding of a simple truth: Acceptance may be the last stage of grief, but it's invariably the longest as well. The acceptance of death is neither a respite nor an exit ramp — it's a purgatory as infinite and layered as the inferno itself, a maze so vast that most people eventually stop looking for a way out and instead start looking for ways to forget that they can't escape. The story of a man so lost in the labyrinth that he thinks he's managed to escape it, Michael Sarnoski's remarkable “Pig” is nothing if not one of those films.

In a sharp pivot away from the maximalism of his usual performances, Nicolas Cage delivers a career-best turn as Robin Chef, a revered Portland chef until personal tragedy inspired him to trade clout for snout and spend the rest of his days as a reclusive truffle forager in the woods at the edge of the city, where he lives with his beloved pig. People who decide to “Walden” themselves away from modern society always appear as though they understand something that the rest of us don't, and Robin seems to have found a way to rescue meaning from the clutches of loss. Then some meth addicts steal Robin's pig, the man goes haywire, and it shifts into focus that he hasn't accepted his wife's death at all. On the contrary, we realize that Robin found life without her so hard to stomach that he just left it behind and refused to look back. It's not denial so much as a slightly more extreme version of the way that most people learn to cope long-term. But that's exactly why this surprisingly gentle and endearingly mythic tale makes for such an essential addition to the rich history of movies about grief: “Pig” doesn't see acceptance as the end of one road, but rather the beginning of another — a road so long and winding that even its detours might lead you straight through hell and out the other side. —DE

History isn't fixed. It has a rhythm and a flow that shifts according to who's telling the story, who's listening, and the medium via which that story is being told. True consensus is ever elusive, yet documentary filmmaker Johan Grimonprez has built a career on interrogating history in a bid to find truth amidst the chaos wrought by time and bias. With “Soundtrack to a Coup d'Etat,” a vibrant film essay that marries jazz and politics to unravel colonial machinations of power in the Congo circa 1960, the Belgian director made use of that rhythm to dizzying effect. 

There's a lot of ground to cover, but in 150 minutes, Grimonprez forges through huge swathes of time and space to chart how the Belgian monarchy, the U.S. government, and various corporations colluded to assassinate Congo's premiere prime minister, Patrice Lumumba. As it turns out, they mostly did it with jazz. Legendary African-American musicians like Dizzy Gillespie and Nina Simone were sent as decoys to deflect attention from America's first African post-colonial coup, unbeknownst to the actual artists of course. As the film notes, “America's secret weapon is a blue note in a minor key,” and in the same New York Times article, Louis Armstrong was quoted as “its most effective ambassador.” Yet music isn't just a tool for subterfuge. Drummer Max Roach and singer Abbey Lincoln directly drew inspiration from the independence movement in Africa to later crash the Security Council in protest, and “Soundtrack to a Coup d'Etat” effectively does the same thing by using jazz to reframe the history books that Grimonprez and other Belgians grew up reading.

Cutting between home movies, official texts, historical footage, and Lumumba's speeches (which were once thought lost forever prior to the making of this film), “Soundtrack to a Coup d'Etat” uses an endless rhythm of rumba and jazz to weave this all together. Without any omniscient narration to speak of, the music becomes a character in of itself, connecting all the various media and many different perspectives into one cohesive whole. —DO

Horrified by the country of his birth and heavy with the weight of its sins, Nadav Lapid has created modern cinema's most splenetic filmography by fighting his Israeliness as if it were an incurable virus infecting his body of work. That trend seems to have reached its apogee with the deliriously provocative “Yes,” a veritable orgy of self-loathing surrender that reaffirms Lapid as the world's most visceral director on a shot-by-shot basis.

In a movie that unfolds like an Ecstasy-addled cross between Pier Paolo Pasolini's “Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom” and the Jim Carrey comedy “Yes Man,” Lapid doubles down on the frenzied violence of his filmmaking at the same time as he fully embraces his growing appetite for submission. The story of a struggling jazz musician and his dancer wife who afford a life for their newborn by acquiescing to every demand made of their talent and bodies by Tel Aviv's militaristic ruling class, Lapid's film doesn't rage against the worst monstrousness of the modern age by speaking truth to power, but rather by volunteering his characters to get crushed under the heel of its boot. And then — with a literalness no one else would dare — by forcing them to lick that boot so clean the whole world can see the dehumanizing nature of Israel's crimes reflected in its leather. Needless to say, the underside of its sole leaves a memorable impression. —DE

As coldly drawn as an atlas yet no less capable of enflaming the imagination, Mona Fastvold's “The World to Come” is a hard and brittle period love story that thaws into something much warmer — what its hyper-literate heroine would call “astonishment and joy” — as a merciless 19th-century winter blushes into a most unexpected spring.

Tuesday, January 1, 1856. Abigail (Katherine Waterston) mourns the daughter who was taken by diphtheria a few months prior, and journals about a world that feels barren in the young girl's absence. “The water froze on the potatoes as soon as they were washed. With little pride, and less hope, we begin the new year.” And what a new year it will be for the ever-studious Abigail, who dares to remap herself after meeting her new neighbor Tallie (Vanessa Kirby). 

Has Tallie been with a woman before? Has any woman been with a woman before? Abigail doesn't know the answers to these questions, or even how to ask them. All she knows is that the house seems warmer after Tallie's visits. The swirling winds of Daniel Blumberg's incredible clarinet score — which can whip into a winter storm at a moment's notice — grow as warm and soothing as an orange hearth. And a story that opens with the grief-stricken chill of a rustic horror movie starts to pull focus away from its demons, eventually settling into a harsh but unforgettable love story that is sometimes painful to witness, but always transcendent to remember. —DE

Former porn star Mikey Saber (Simon Rex) might be “blessed,” at least according to the sore underage girl he's grooming during a post-coital chat in the flatbed of her pickup truck, but the reality of the situation is that the guy is nothing less than a living curse. He's a big-dicked, self-obsessed, hyper-opportunistic hex of a man whose puppy dog con artist schtick is so transparent that even naive teenagers can see right through it, which is exactly why people lower their guard and let him in. Into their houses; into their panties; into their dreams for the future that Mikey incepts into their heads for his own benefit. And he doesn't stop trying to weasel his way deeper into any of those things for a single minute of Sean Baker's utterly singular and weirdly lovable “Red Rocket,” a roman candle of a movie that wonders if America's pathological narcissism will ever burn itself out.

It begins with the blaring shriek of NSYNC's ear-piercing masterpiece “Bye Bye Bye” as a black-eyed Mikey suffers through the long bus ride of shame from California to Texas; from the “who am I here to fuck?” hedonism of the San Fernando Valley to the “why the fuck am I here?” industrial wasteland of Refinery Row. But Mikey isn't leaving anyone behind so much as he's coming back home with his tail between his legs (the words “red rocket” are never mentioned in the film, but it doesn't seem coincidental that the phrase is slang for a dog's erection).

Baker doesn't beat a similar retreat. Here, the “Florida Project” filmmaker Baker ditches the corporate utopia of Disney World in favor of a more rustic vision of the American Dream, exchanging the ultra-real harshness of his previous films in favor of a 16mm fuzz that combines the velvet touch of early Spielberg with the invasive eroticism of Italian exploitation. But “Red Rocket” becomes such a blisteringly raw and febrile character study because of how things fluctuate along the fixed orbit of its star. There's only so much bullshit people can take, and some of the women in Mikey's life aren't willing to be jerked around anymore. The film may not end with the fairy tale that Mikey promises his latest protégé, but it's nice to think that some people are still looking out for each other in a world where so many others will never see past the tip of their own dick. —DE

In 2008, Mike Leigh made a movie called “Happy-Go-Lucky,” in which Sally Hawkins played a school teacher named Poppy who was so irrepressibly buoyant and upbeat that her joy seemed like a taunting provocation to the discontent of the world around her. Sixteen years later, the filmmaker returned to similar territory with “Hard Truths,” a searing but indivisibly empathetic drama about a British Jamaican woman so wretched that it might as well be called “Misery-Go-Fuck-Yourself.” 

As played by an absolutely titanic Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Pansy might be the single most vituperatively unpleasant character the movies have ever produced. It would be impossible to overstate the raw spectacle of watching Pansy make her way through the world; a spectacle that Leigh exaggerates further by confining the character to a modest little film that's only a touch bigger than the working class London home she “shares” with her husband Curtley (David Webber) and their stunted 22-year-old son Moses (Tuwaine Barrett). Jean-Baptiste has stressed the importance of telling stories in which Black families aren't framed in response to external forces, but the call is no less difficult to answer when it's coming from inside the house. And while Pansy is obviously troubled (by afflictions both explained and not), her loved ones don't have the heart to treat her like a problem, as doing so would threaten to betray their unspoken pledge to suffer each other in the face of an insufferable world. 

Per its title, “Hard Truths” doesn't go in for easy fixes, and the film seems to end in much the same place as it starts. But it doesn't. Not quite. The earth might quake wherever Pansy goes, but the film's real power is in watching her family hold on to the shared history that she threatens to uproot. “I love you,” Chantelle tells her. “I don't understand you, but I love you.” It's a message that Leigh has been trying to convey to his characters for more than 40 years, and one that has seldom been so natural to accept for ourselves. —DE

Premiering on the heels of “Saint Omer” and “The Goldman Case,” Justine Triet's Palme d'Or-winning “Anatomy of a Fall” makes a compelling case that the courthouse has become the most fertile ground in contemporary French cinema, offering incisive auteurs both motive and opportunity to put social structures on trial. As it calls the institution of marriage to the stand, Triet's piercing film holds the ambient tensions and illogical loose ends of domestic life against the harsh and rational light of a legal system that searches for order in chaos.

Rounding out her own impressive hat trick, “Toni Erdmann” and “The Zone of Interest” star Sandra Hüller dazzles in a role clearly written with the performer in mind. She plays Sandra, a German-born, France-based bisexual novelist accused of killing her male partner in a way eerily foretold by one of her novels. And if that description calls to mind another icy-blond, the echo is both wholly intentional and entirely irrelevant. Indeed, “Anatomy of a Fall” is filled with such anti-portents –coincidences or clues, depending on who you ask, echoes or empty noise, depending on who's listening.

“Anatomy of a Fall” is never really about the trial that follows; at its searing best, the film tracks the destruction of a family with cold precision. If an artist relies on memories, why not also share nightmares? Why not build a polar vortex that crushes fact under fiction, that lifts from last night's argument, today's viewing of a '90s classic and tomorrow's worst fears? It's a cyclone that sends the mind soaring, and primes the heart for a hefty fall. —BC

A bloody, muscular, barrelhouse of a vampire movie that throbs like the neck of a blues guitar on fire, Ryan Coogler's “Sinners” is the first story the “Creed” director has ripped straight from his own guts. And yet, it thrillingly continues his post-“Fruitvale Station” tradition of filtering real and imagined Black histories through the prism of blockbuster entertainment, and in a way that recognizes genre as a living connection between the past and the future, as opposed to seeing it as a necessary evil of funding his art in the present.

“Sinners” is nothing if not a film about genre, and the distinctly American imperative of cross-pollinating between them to create something that feels new and old — high and low — at the same time. It's a heartfelt and viscerally well-researched historical drama that introduces the blues as the devil's music before fighting to reframe it as a kind of fourth-dimensional magic in its own right. It's also a ridiculous and horny-as-hell creature feature that leverages Coogler's enduring love for multiplex favorites like “The Faculty,” “The Thing,” and “From Dusk Till Dawn” in order to convey the hope, heartbreak, and humanity of Mississippi sharecroppers in the Jim Crow South. 

“Sinners” is a movie where the fact of the old Delta's Chinese-American population is affirmed by the fantasy of watching dozens of Black vampires perform a perfect Irish jig, and a movie in which the agonizing push-and-pull between safety and freedom — a tension familiar to any marginalized community — is perhaps best articulated by a shot of Hailee Steinfeld slowly dripping her spit into Michael B. Jordan's open mouth. Despite being confined to a small handful of hyper-expressive locations (and the awestriking 65mm cotton fields between them), “Sinners” feels like it had to be shot on IMAX cameras just to fit all the different ingredients that Coogler wanted to mix into the stew. The film he's made from them is inevitably too much at times, and not always in full command of its many competing flavors, but that too muchness is also the greatest strength of a visionary studio product that sticks its fangs deep into an eternal struggle: how to assimilate without losing your soul. —DE

An action film as only “Cure” and “Pulse” director Kiyoshi Kurosawa would think to make one, “Cloud” leverages the social disaffection at the heart of his analog horror masterpieces into a sterile — but eventually bullet-filled — morality tale about the dehumanizing nature of digital communication. The first hour is a slow accumulation of the petty crimes (and other various insults) that the internet allows people to commit against one another from a distance, and with the benefit of anonymity. The second hour observes what happens when those petty crimes reach a critical mass, and the animus that's been welling up on social media spills into the real world with the deadly force of a double-barreled shotgun. Not timely at all!

If Kurosawa's work has long displayed a morbid fascination with the relationship between diffuse psychic distress and localized physical violence, “Cloud” updates the filmmaker's signature focus for a modern world that's enmeshed in an infinite (but invisible) network of small cruelties and bitter grievances — a network so ubiquitous that even the better angels of our nature might drive us straight into hell. Almost too mundane to care about until it becomes impossible to stop watching for much the same reason, this riveting and highly unusual shoot-em-up finds Kurosawa returning to his roots, only to discover that psychological terror isn't quite as abstract as it used to be. —DE

A transcendently sweaty tennis love triangle so turned on by the heat of competition that its sex scenes feel like foreplay and its rallies feel like porn, Luca Guadagnino's “Challengers” is so much more than just the horniest story ever set in New Rochelle, which is where this movie's three main characters — two archrivals and the beautiful former player between them — all happen to cross paths during the final match of a dingy U.S. Open qualifier that's sponsored by a local tire store. They've been fucking each other on and off the court for more than a decade by the time “Challengers” unleashes its first serve, and yet, despite winning on every level of their chosen sport, these long-limbed athletes have lost their lust for life at some point along the way. At this point, their lust for each other might be the only force on Earth powerful enough to get their heads back in the game. 

That might sound like the set-up for a relatively straightforward — if refreshingly bi-curious — romantic comedy, but “Challengers” is a far cry from “Wimbledon,” and Guadagnino couldn't give less of a shit about who comes out on top at the end. On the contrary, the “Call Me by Your Name” director was likely turned on by the sensual backspin of Justin Kuritzkes' script, which subverts the typical stakes of each match in order to focus on the animating thrill of wanting something with every flooded sweat gland on your body. Watching Zendaya's Tashi Donaldson get exactly that was one of the most thrilling things we've seen this decade. —DE

For any millennial who ever pratfell in the face of their own indecision-making, “The Worst Person in the World” holds up a grimacing double-sided mirror that flips between a hard-to-stomach, piercing reality check, and a warm, inviting embrace of relatability for the very same reason. Renate Reinsve gives a full-stop stunning breakout performance (that also won her the Best Actress prize at Cannes) as Julie, a tormented approaching-30-something who waffles between busted professional aspirations and ineffectual lovers, with ultimately no one to come home to at the end of the day but herself.  

Joachim Trier's formally daring latest is an ode to the romantic dramas of yesteryear, when big-hearted movies could encapsulate the crescendos of a love affair without a necessarily political agenda. But “Worst Person” ultimately does have smart things to say about how economic circumstances and being set up on the idea of “following your dreams” (a pipe dream whose consequences we are all now imbibing) dictate the millennial plights of today. Trier ecstatically darts between rom-com, grief drama, and, at one point, tripped-out psychedelic horror movie, meaning his camera is possessed by the same easily distracted and restless spirit as Julie herself. 

While Reinsve is the obvious north star of this wonderful, touching, and wholly unpretentious feature, it must be said that Anders Danielsen Lie gives a heart-crushing performance whose inner core can't fully be explicated without experiencing the movie for yourself. This is a movie people will return to again and again for comfort for the rest of their days — as itchy and discomfiting as its enveloping offerings can sometimes be. —RL

How should we remember the dead? It's an ever-present question for the many Black folks living in Africatown, Alabama, where the last slave ship made landfall, as remembering is what they do best. Their shared memory stretches back to at least 1860 — more than five decades after the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves was signed into law — when two rich white men from Mobile made a bet.

Despite the law, these men believed they could sail to Africa, capture the people they found there, and bring them back as slaves without being caught. They ultimately returned with 100 captives and sank the ship, named the Clotilda, in an effort to destroy any evidence of the grave crime they committed. But people are not so easy to erase.

An unblinking documentary investigation that combines local stories with “Erin Brockovich” flair, Margaret Brown's imperative “Descendant” is compelled by Africatown's collective determination to rectify that attempt at erasure. The filmmaker's 2018 arrival in Africatown coincides with a first-of-its-kind, nationwide partnership to search the waters surrounding Mobile for the wreck of the Clotilda, but her focus extends far beyond the ship. The passionate descendants of those Africans still live in the area, and they've been itching not just to find the ship, but to seek justice for its final voyage. Is one possible without the other? Can history be reclaimed without a plank of soggy wood to pin it on? Brown's lucid and piercing film watches along as the people of Africatown look to their ancestors for answers, their search itself emerging as a revolutionary act. —RD

It's no secret that Tom Cruise cares more about the survival of the movie business — or at least the movie business as he's known it, and helped to shape in his own image — than anyone else has ever cared about anything else. Sure, we're talking about a guy who seems to care about everything more than anyone else cares about anything, but the fight against the future has grown increasingly personal for “modern” Hollywood's signature mega-star, whose first “Mission: Impossible” movie helped transmute him into a living emblem of the movies themselves. What others might see as a content-driven culture war, Cruise naturally regards as an existential threat, and the last few years have seen the actor-producer channel his singularly clenched intensity into a holy crusade against the standard-lowering forces of digital technology.

Anyone who saw “Top Gun: Maverick” knows that Cruise isn't shy about confronting these concerns on-screen, and since everyone saw (and believed) that Best Picture-nominated mega-hit despite the supposed death of cinema, it stands to reason that Cruise's next blockbuster — the goofy, romantic, and often transcendently committed “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” — escalated his beef with the machines to hilariously literal new heights. “Mission: Impossible” has always taken place in a shadow world where you can't believe your own two eyes, and so it feels natural for “Dead Reckoning Part One” to take such direct aim at the clear and present dangers posed by our digital future. By re-re-re-affirming how satisfying practical action setpieces can be, Cruise and returning director Christopher McQuarrie set the stage for a story about why technology shouldn't be fully entrusted with the things that require a human touch. 

Ridiculous from the start but also strangely fresh for yet another 21st century tentpole about a rogue A.I., “Dead Reckoning Part One” may not be the best movie in the “Mission: Impossible” franchise, but this extravagantly entertaining Dolby soap opera nails what the “Mission: Impossible” franchise does best: Weaponizing artifice and illusion in order to fight for a world that's still worth believing in. Also, Cruise rides a motorcycle off a cliff and then crash-lands his parachute into a moving train. It rules so hard. —DE

If the evolution of creativity in the 21st century means that Twitter feeds can fuel feature-length adaptations, “Zola” is a terrific place to start. Director Janicza Bravo's zany road trip comedy about a pair of strippers on a rambunctious 48-hour Florida adventure embodies its ludicrous source while jazzing it up with relentless cinematic beats. Bravo, who co-wrote the movie with “Slave Play” breakout Jeremy O. Harris, applies the surreal and edgy sensibilities of her unsettling dark comic short “Gregory Go Boom” and the similarly outré “Lemon” to another jittery look at anxious people driven to self-destructive extremes. Here, their antics result in a rambunctious crowdpleaser made all the more compelling because it's true.

Well, maybe. In October 2015, Detroit-based stripper A'ziah “Zola” King unleashed 144 tweets chronicling her madcap journey with new pal Jessica, who invited her on a quick jaunt down south to hit the clubs. In King's account, the impulsive odyssey took an oddball turn when Jessica picked her up with her boyfriend and pimp in tow, as the ensuing trip eventually involved prostitution, gunfights, and even a ridiculous suicide attempt. Though aspects of that drama were embellished, “Zola” embraces the opportunity to exist within their confines, beginning with its title character (a terrific Taylour Paige) gazing at a mirror as she recites the immortal tweet that kicked things off: “You wanna hear a story about why me & this bitch here fell out? It's kind of long but full of suspense.” And so it is. —EK

The intimate way that women move through a city sprawl gives Payal Kapadia's drama about two nurses in Mumbai a deeply romantic gauze. This romance has to do with the way that people occupy their space in this world, whether alone or sharing it with others. The younger nurse Anu (Divya Prabha) comes in from the rain and, although she is giving her roommate Prabha (Kani Kusruti) the silent treatment after an earlier insult, she is still comfortable stripping her top off in front of her, in order to change into something dry. All the while Prabha is trying to make good, saying that she has made Anu's favorite dish.

This casual everyday vignette is brimming with a sensuality (the rain, the clothes, the food, the women) that people don't tend to notice when caught up in the rhythm of life. Kapadia shows it to us. She focuses our attention on the tiniest details while interweaving a tight meshwork of stories about love and loneliness. Discrete episodes resonate with quietly infinite multitudes. 

Consider the secret rendezvous between Anu and her Muslim boyfriend. Rather than showing overt scenes of the Hindu nationalism that India's Prime Minister Modi has proudly brought to the mainstream, Kapadia lets its impact play out impressionistically via the furtive way that her star-crossed lovers meet. First and foremost, a master of image creation, she uses this secrecy as an opportunity to mount a compelling dialogue-free sequence of love hiding in plain sight. A busy traffic intersection is filmed with the long lens of a private detective. We see Anu first then glimpse a figure walking through the bustle until he — Shiaz! — is holding her hand. Without acknowledging each other, they keep walking together, touching but not speaking, until they are a safe distance from the hospital. In this scene, and others, Kapadia rescues her characters from the thrum of city life and invites us to co-exist with them in their dreams. —SMK

Not long into Ira Sachs' “Passages” — sometime all too shortly after a restless, self-involved filmmaker (Franz Rogowski) leaves his much softer husband (Ben Whishaw) for the earthy and new woman (Adèle Exarchopoulos) he meets at a dance club after a stressful day of shooting — Tomas launches into a post-coital chat by telling Agathe that he's fallen in love with her. “I bet you say that a lot,” she replies, bluntly sniffing out his bullshit in a way that suggests this Parisian school teacher doesn't understand how far most artists would go to convince their audience of an emotional truth. “I say it when I mean it,” Tomas counters. “You say it when it works for you,” Agathe volleys back. They're both right, but that's not the problem. The problem is that they're saying exactly the same thing. A signature new drama from a director whose best work (“Keep the Lights On,” “Love Is Strange”) is at once both generously tender in its brutality and unsparingly brutal in its tenderness, the raw and resonant “Passages” is the kind of fuck around and find out love triangle that rings true because we aspire to its sexier moments but see ourselves in its most selfish ones. –DE

Few movies have ever been more perfectly in tune with their protagonists than Davy Chou's jagged, restless, and rivetingly unpredictable “Return to Seoul,” a shark-like adoption drama that its 25-year-old heroine wears like an extra layer of skin or sharp cartilage. The film spans eight years over the course of two hours, but you can feel its bristly texture and self-possessed violence from the disorienting first scenes.

Played by plastic artist and first-time actress Park Ji-Min (who gives a towering performance worthy of the same attention that Cate Blanchett and Michelle Yeoh will receive for their work this fall), the French-raised Freddie arrives in Seoul without context, which leaves us the fool's errand of trying to “solve” her identity over a few too many glasses of soju with her new friends.

Some clues are easier to decipher than others. While Freddie may have been born in the country — and carry what some of her drinking buddies agree is “a typical Korean face” from “ancient, ancestral” times — it's clear that this is her first trip back since she was adopted as a child, and that she neither thinks of it as home nor speaks a word of the native tongue. Less obvious is the agenda behind Freddie's sudden return. Her flagrant disregard for local customs suggests that she isn't there to get in touch with her roots, and when someone suggests that she contact the local adoption agency, Freddie doesn't just change the subject, she completely transforms the energy of the film itself. 

Like Freddie, Chou's drama is vulnerable and dauntless all at once. Lovable and hostile. Earnest and absurd. It's the rare movie that can drop a long-take dance sequence into the middle of a pressing conversation without seeming the least bit mannered or aloof; the rare movie that only feels more honest as a result of its most flamboyant choices, and only makes its heroine more empathetic as a result of how she pushes other people away. That “Return to Seoul” ends on a note as wracked and ambivalent as the ones that crescendo towards it might frustrate anyone still waiting for a cleaner sense of catharsis, but Chou's plaintive coda feels like a resoundingly true finale to the story of a woman who's driving forwards in reverse, and won't know where she wants to go until she can see the full view of who she's always been. —DE

Dreamed up during quarantine, limited to a small clutch of studio sets and autumnal exteriors (including a the same woods in which Céline Sciamma played as a child), and running just 72 minutes, “Petite Maman” is a far cry from the kind of blank check that we've been conditioned to expect from someone hot off a popular favorite like “Portrait of a Lady on Fire,” and viewers who were expecting to have the wind knocked out of them by the same kind of emotional gut-punch might have been disappointed by a story that peaks with two slaphappy kids making pancakes.

But the joys of this lightly magical-realist story are boundless. It begins with eight-year-old Nelly (Joséphine Sanz) sitting in the backseat of her mother's car outside of the nursing home where her beloved grandmother has just died, and watching through the window as her young parents (Nina Meurisse and Stéphane Varupenne) share a tender embrace. She wonders what they mean to each other, and what it feels like to lose someone forever, and whether her mother ever sat alone in a car on a gray fall afternoon and watched as her mother was consoled over her mother's death. Nelly understands that her mom didn't become 31 without being eight along the way, but why is that so hard to imagine? It's like looking at a bird and trying to picture when it was a dinosaur.Nelly doesn't breathe a word of this, but she doesn't have to; we've only known the girl for a few short minutes, and yet the screen between us has already melted away as if we're sharing in her experience first-hand. This is at least part of what Sciamma does better than just about every other writer-director working today. Her characters open like pores soaked in hot water, and the hyper-real worlds around them reveal themselves with such an acute sense of discovery that even the most everyday moments assume a life-altering charge. In her hands, 72 minutes is enough to contain several lifetimes. —DE

At first it seemed that if J. Robert Oppenheimer didn't exist, Christopher Nolan would probably have been compelled to invent him. The exalted British filmmaker has long been fixated upon stories of haunted and potentially self-destructive men who sift through the source code of space-time in a desperate bid to understand the meaning of their own actions, and so the “father of the atomic bomb” — a theoretical physicist whose obsession with a twilight world hidden inside our own led to the birth of the modern age's most biblical horrors — would seem to represent an uncannily perfect subject for the “Tenet” director's next epic. And he is. In fact, Oppenheimer is so perversely well-suited to the Nolan treatment that I soon began to realize I had things backwards: Christopher Nolan only exists because men like J. Robert Oppenheimer invented him first. Which isn't to overstate the degree to which Nolan's first biopic feels like some kind of grandiose self-portrait (even if the Manhattan Project sequences can seem broadly analogous to the filmmaking process, as large swaths of “Inception” and “The Prestige” did before them), nor to suggest that the director sees himself in the same regard as the man he describes in the “Oppenheimer” press notes as “the most important person who ever lived.” It's also not to glibly conflate one of the most controversial figures of the 20th century with one of the most controversial figures on the r/Movies subreddit, even if the industry-changing success of “Batman Begins” surely inspired a “now I am become death” moment of Nolan's very own. Paced like it was designed for interstellar travel, scripted with a degree of density that scientists once thought purely theoretical in nature, and shot with such large-format bombast that repetitive scenes (or at least Nolan-esque slices) of old politicians yelling at each other about expired security clearances hit with the same visceral impact as the 747 explosion in “Tenet,” “Oppenheimer” is nothing if not a biopic as only Christopher Nolan could make one. Indeed, it would seem like the ideal vehicle for Nolan's career-long exploration into the black holes of the human condition — the last riddles of a terrifyingly understandable world. –DE

There isn't a horror director alive who wouldn't kill to create frames as tense, ominous, and viscerally captivating as those of Georgian filmmaker Dea Kulumbegashvili, who applies her talents toward elemental character studies about rural women suffering under the yoke of patriarchy at the foot of the Caucasus Mountains. 

Her debut feature, 2020's masterful “Beginning,” tells the story of a disillusioned Jehovah's Witness who starts to unravel after her church is firebombed by extremists in the very first shot, a static tableau held for several minutes before its Haneke-like remove is shattered with a molotov cocktail. Kulumbegashvili's even more accomplished and terrifying follow-up “April” — which concerns a hospital obstetrician (Ia Sukhitashvili as Nina) whose career is put at risk when a rare stillbirth threatens to expose her unsanctioned night job as an abortion provider — requires even less time to crush your entire being in its brace. It opens on the sight of a faceless (but visibly female) skin monster slouching through a void as Matthew Herbert's asynchronous score breathes down your neck, and it only grows more arresting from there in a film where life and death are braided together in the tension of each moment, and Nina is suspended in the air between them like a songbird flying headlong into a window. —DE

Has any divorce had a more profound impact on the American imagination than the one between Steven Spielberg's parents? It was the breakup that launched a million blockbusters. That made daddy issues into a spectacle all their own. That led directly to “E.T.,” “Catch Me if You Can,” and the last scene of “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” while also paving the way toward any number of iconic films about the meltdown of the nuclear family — which any multiplex would tell you was the middle class' defining crisis of the 20th century.

And so it stands to reason that “The Fabelmans,” in which Spielberg finally addresses his parents' divorce head-on through the eyes of his stand-in Sammy Fabelman, would feel like our story as much as it does his own. I'd say this playful yet nakedly personal coming-of-auteur epic was trying to split the difference between memoir and crowd-pleaser, but it seems even more determined to reconcile the two: What else would Steven Spielberg's ultimate divorce movie be about if not the hope for some kind of reconciliation?

Eventually — after the Fabelmans have moved from New Jersey to Arizona, from Arizona to Northern California, and from happy-go-lucky Shabbat dinners to the classic American discord of forcing your mom to admit that she's fallen in love with Seth Rogen — someone will turn to Sammy in a difficult moment and say: “Life is nothing like the movies, Fabelman.” By that point, however, we know that's not entirely true. Not only because Spielberg spent the last 50 years making all sorts of extraordinary films that sting us with a profound sense of personal recognition, but also because “The Fabelmans” so delicately blurs the line between life and the movies that it becomes impossible to tell the difference between Spielberg's memories and the film he's finally made about them. That too is a kind of reconciliation, and one that not even Judd Hirsch's Uncle Boris could imagine being torn apart. —DE

A caustically funny cosmic joke of a film about an insecure actor who finds a miracle cure for his facial disfigurement, only to be upstaged by a stranger who oozes self-confidence despite (still) having the exact same condition the main character had once allowed to hold him back, Aaron Schimberg's ruthless and Escher-like “A Different Man” might have felt cruel if not for how cleverly it complicates its punchline. 

Are we supposed to be laughing at someone — someone who's been treated like a monster for his entire adult life — just because they couldn't resist the opportunity to shed their skin? Anyone familiar with Schimberg's “Chained for Life,” which similarly defenestrated the notion of disabilities as “God's mistakes,” already knows the answer to that question. Besides, who among us would pass up the chance to look like Sebastian Stan? 

In that light, it's more tempting to interpret “A Different Man” as a dark and damning satire of our social conditioning, which has convinced us to see asymmetry as ugliness, and internalize ugliness as inhuman. But while that might be a more accurate distillation of what Schimberg is doing here, leaving it there would fail to convey the full ambition of a deliriously surreal psycho-thriller that complicates its own identity at every turn. By refracting Brian De Palma's self-reflexiveness and the Coen brothers' mordant fatalism through the prism of his most personal obsessions, Schimberg creates a house of mirrors so brilliant and complex that it becomes impossible to match any of his characters to their own reflections, and absolutely useless to reduce the movie around them to the stuff of moral instruction. —DE

From painting working-class portraits to sketching urbane artistic figures like Emily Dickinson, the late English filmmaker Terence Davies was always public about his discomfort with being gay and his feelings of banality toward life in general. He wasn't an especially hopeful storyteller, but his pessimism and insatiable hunger for redemption found their purest expression in “Benediction,” the last feature he completed before his death.

This riotously funny and deeply despairing portrait of World War I-era English poet Siegfried Sassoon follows him from the fringes of the Bright Young Things, into middle age, and up until his death in 1967, Catholic and bereft. He outlived many of his peers but left a legacy in words and in lovers — including the poet Wilfred Owen, socialite flaneur Stephen Tennant, Welsh musician Ivor Novello, and actor Glen Byam Shaw.  

Anchored by an elegant performance from Jack Lowden as Siegfried, “Benediction” is not a biopic so much as a melancholy what-might-have-been-but-never-will-be melodrama that freely plucks incidents from the poet's life and plays around with them in time — and it's filled with silver-tongued zingers and maxims that only Davies could devise. The filmmaker's protagonists were almost always stand-ins for himself, but that doesn't mean he was necessarily working out his issues. As Sassoon says in this gorgeous, ruminative emotional epic: “The moment passes, but the hole remains.” —RL

It's fitting — maybe even fate — that “Spider-Man: No Way Home” was the biggest and virtually only movie in the world on the week that “The Matrix Resurrections” was released. Both are mega-budget, meta sequels that feed on our collective familiarity with their respective franchises. One is a poison, the other its antidote.

One is a safe plastic monument to the solipsism of today's studio cinema; an orgiastic celebration of how studio filmmaking has created a feedback loop so powerful that it's programmed audiences to reject anything that threatens its perfection (and to clap like seals for anything that reaffirms it, even if that means cheering for the “unexpected” return of heroes and villains they were once eager to leave behind). The other is a jagged little red pill of a blockbuster that exhumes its intellectual property with such a pronounced sense of déjà vu that the comforts of its memory start to feel like the bars of a cage, and the perfect circle of its feedback loop blurs into a particle accelerator spinning faster and faster in order to create something new and romantic. One is a crowd-pleasing testament to the idea that even (or especially) the biggest fictions can shrink our imaginations. The other is a fun, ultra-sincere, galaxy brain reminder that we can only break free of the stories that make our lives smaller by seeing through the binaries that hold them in place — us vs. them, real vs. fake, corporate product vs. personal art, reboot vs. rebirth, etc. vs. etc.If “No Way Home” is the snake eating its tail with such reckless abandon that it fools itself into thinking it's full, “The Matrix Resurrections” is the rare blockbuster that dares to ask what else might be on the menu. It remains the boldest and most vividly human franchise sequel since “The Last Jedi” (if also messier and more postmodern than Rian Johnson's miraculous addition to the “Star Wars” canon), and continues to be the most divisive as well. Doubling down on the “Alice in Wonderland” spirit of its franchise, this is a movie for people interested in seeing how deep the rabbit hole goes; anyone simply looking for more “Matrix” wasn't just shit out of luck, they were in for an experience that toyed with their expectations for more than two hours without fulfilling a single one of them. And thank God for that. —DE

When Europe's great powers raced to colonize a continent in the so-called “Scramble for Africa” just before the First World War, the tiny coastal Kingdom of Dahomey in the south of modern-day Benin was high on France's shopping list. Only 85 French soldiers were killed when it was taken in 1894, while as many as 4,000 Dahomeans lost their lives. Nearly 300 years of culture and history were extinguished, and thousands of the nation's most valuable treasures shipped to Paris.

Running just 67 minutes long, this dense and remarkable documentary isn't about the theft itself, but rather the 2021 return of 26 Dahomean treasures to Benin from the Musée du Quai Branly in Paris — a journey that director Mati Diop brings to life with new urgency by restoring these statues their stolen voices. They speak in monologues written by the Haitian author Makenzy Orcel, the artifacts reflecting on their trip home with a mix of pride, horror, and confusion between long scenes in which modern university students debate the meaning of their country's pilfered heirlooms. The artifacts may be a living expression of Benin's past, but this memorably bold meditation on history is all the more powerful for how it puts them into conversation with the present. —AS

For decades, “Au Hasard Balthazar” has been the preeminent movie about the perils of being a donkey. Along comes octogenarian Polish auteur Jerzy Skolimowski to prove that two can play this game. Without ripping off Robert Bresson's 1966 classic, Skolimowski finds his own modern approach to chronicling his titular animal hero as he journeys through a human landscape generally disinterested in his well-being.

From his circus origins to various other forms of servitude and the occasional bursts of freedom, the innocent EO gazes on a world with a subtle gaze that grows more poignant and tragic as the story goes on. Paired with other recent cinematic contemplations of animal intelligence, “Cow” and “Gunda,” Skolimowski's movie is the latest evidence that simply watching the world through another species' eyes can be illuminating enough to change the way we see the world. But “EO” isn't some kind of bland veganist plea; it's a wondrous plunge into the nature of consciousness itself, and with its remarkable audiovisual design, shows how only the movies can take us there. —EK

Greta Gerwig's zeitgeist-changing smash hit opens, of course, with an homage to Stanley Kubrick's “2001: A Space Odyssey.” A dazzling sunrise stretches over a barren desert, populated exclusively with sad-eyed Dust Bowl-era girls and their unblinking baby dolls, as Helen Mirren (!!) narrates us through what life was like pre-Barbie. It wasn't just boring (though it was certainly boring), but it was limited (oh, was it limited). For so many little girls, dolls were only ever baby dolls, which meant that their playtime could only ever revolve around motherhood, servitude, and no fun whatsoever.

But just as Kubrick's apes eventually met by an alien monolith that utterly changed their world and worldview, Gerwig's little girls are about to be descended upon by a world-altering and brain-breaking new entity: a giant, one might even say monolithic, Barbie doll, in the form of a smiling Margot Robbie, kitted out like the very first Barbie doll ever made. And thus spake Barbie. That's where Gerwig's funny, feminist, and wildly original “Barbie” begins. It will only get bigger, weirder, smarter, and better from there.

“Barbie” is a lovingly crafted blockbuster with a lot on its mind, the kind of feature that will surely benefit from repeat viewings (there is so much to see, so many jokes to catch) and is still purely entertaining even in a single watch. It's Barbie's world, and we're all just living in it. How fantastic. –KE

A mystical and enthralling medieval coming-of-age story in which King Arthur's overeager adult nephew learns that the world is weirder and more complicated than he ever thought possible, “The Green Knight” is an intimate epic told with the self-conviction that its hero struggles to find at every turn. Stoned out of its mind and shot with a genre-tweaking mastery that should make John Boorman proud, it's also the rare movie that knows exactly what it is, which is an even rarer movie that's perfectly comfortable not knowing exactly what it is.

The surreal genius of David Lowery's “filmed adaptation of the chivalric romance by anonymous” (to quote the on-screen text) is that it fully embraces the unresolved nature of its 14th century source material, contradictory interpretations of which have coexisted in relative harmony for more than half a millennium. Is it a paganistic tale about the fall of man, or is it a Christ-like quest about the hope for salvation? Does it bow to chivalry as a noble bulwark against man's true nature, or does it laugh at the idea that a knight's code would ever be a sound defense against his deeper urges? Is it a misogynistic poem about manipulative witches, or a proto-feminist ode to women's power over men?

To all these questions and more, Lowery rousingly answers “yes!” And yet what makes “The Green Knight” grow in your mind (like moss; like rot) for days after watching it is that Lowery never equivocates at any point along Sir Gawain's journey from the Round Table to the forest citadel where his fate awaits. Instead, he pulls tight on the tangled knots that have bound this saga to our collective imagination for so many centuries, and braids them all into a timeless fantasy about the struggle to make sense of an irreconcilable world. Hypnotic from its fiery start to its gut-punch of a finale and polished with a hint of heavy metal that makes the whole thing shimmer in the darkness like a black light poster in the basement of your friend's parents' house.  —DE

It's right there in the title: Claire Simon's stunningly personal documentary “Our Body” might generally be about her own health journey, but it's really fixated on the communal experience of occupying a female body. Our body. While academics have tried to uncover the mystique behind women's physiques, and narrative filmmakers have grappled with the “male gaze” permeating the female form, Simon's “Our Body” positions the body in its strictly anatomical purposes, ranging from reproduction to even death.

Simon uses the film as both a personal journey through her own cancer diagnosis, and as a general observation of the everyday operations of a gynecological ward in a public hospital in Paris. Eventually, she becomes inextricable from the fabric of the documentary she's making, and that conflation provides the root of its inestimable power. “I shared my subjects' destinies as a patient,” she narrates. “This is the reason why it appeared essential to me to be filmed naked, just like the others. … It's important to see the others, to not be a woman left all alone to face the questions raised by her body, the confrontation with the doctors and the hospital as an institution — to know that there are others, that there's a large, and strong, community of us out there.” “Our Body” makes that all but impossible to forget. —SB

In his first project since the Iranian regime ostensibly lifted its restrictions on his art, filmmaker Jafar Panahi draws from his different experiences as a dissident prisoner for a raw and blistering moral thriller about a hard-working Azeri man whose most tormented memories come rushing to the surface when he hears someone walk into his place of business with the same haunting squeak of his former torturer's prosthetic right leg. Played by Vahid Mobasser, a TV station programmer and part-time cab driver, Vahid impulsively abducts the man (Ebrahim Azizi, the only professional actor in this extraordinary cast), drags him into the middle of the desert, and digs a hole big enough to bury his pain alive.

But — as he begins to suffocate the hostage under a small mountain of dry earth — Vahid is confronted with a stab of doubt. And so, however cathartic it might be to simply commit murder and call it vengeance, Vahid feels as though he has no choice but to stuff the man into a wooden crate, load him into his minivan, and drive around Tehran in search of other ex-prisoners who might be able to help verify the captive's identity.

So begins a gripping and tightly scripted misadventure that unfolds like something of a cross between Park Chan-wook's “Lady Vengeance” and Panahi's own “Taxi” (with a little “Waiting for Godot” thrown in for good measure), as Vahid's one-man truth and reconciliation commission grows to include a handful of other people whose skin carries the scars of “Peg Leg's” violence. From the plot description alone, it's obvious that “It Was Just an Accident” finds Panahi working in a very different register than he had to while “banned” from making films. This one still had to be shot in secret in order to skirt government approval, but it takes great pleasure in replacing the self-reflexivity of Panahi's illegal work with a slightly more formal sense of composition, even if it remains impossible to separate the final product from the personal experience that informed it.

Truth and fiction exist side-by-side in this movie to much the same degree, as Vahid and his team are made to live among the men who so brutally dehumanized them as enemies of the state. Panahi's tense and woundingly distressed new film draws so much of its climactic power from the sense that hell will always follow Vahid like a whistle ringing in his ears, no matter what becomes of the man he's abducted. And even more of it from the implication that heaven must therefore be hiding somewhere close by. —DE

A young Parisian filmmaker whose delicately personal work (“Eden,” “Things to Come,” “Goodbye, First Love,” et al.) illuminates the unbearable lightness of being with the soft touch of a late summer breeze, Mia Hansen-Løve may not be the first 21st-century auteur who comes to mind when people consider the portentous legacy of Ingmar Bergman, a man whose cinema stared into the void in the hopes of seeing its own reflection, and shouted down God's silence with such howling rage that even his comedies are probably still echoing in eternity. And yet, “Bergman Island” — a triple-layered meta-romance about a filmmaker (Vicky Krieps) who flies to Sweden with her partner (Tim Roth) and pitches him a screenplay about her first love — is such a rare and remarkable movie for the very same reason that you wouldn't expect it to exist in the first place.

Set on the remote skerry in the Baltic Sea that Bergman adopted as his home and began to terraform with his artistic persona after making “Through a Glass Darkly” there in 1961, Hansen-Løve's zephyr-calm story of loss, love, and artistic reclamation draws such an extreme contrast to the scorched Earth films that have become synonymous with Fårö that even its nighttime scenes reveal the shadows that fiction has the power to cast across reality. No simple homage to Bergman, Hansen-Løve's film is simply enraptured by the immaterial yet utterly transformative effect that Bergman's cinema has had on the quiet ocean rock where so much of it was made. Through the disconnect between the physical fact of Fårö's existence and the imagined fog that has settled over it in her mind's eye, she discovers a perfect nexus for the personal and creative universes that have long overlapped in her semi-autobiographical — or perhaps more than semi-autobiographical — fiction. The result is a heart-stoppingly poignant movie that beats from deep inside a body of work that has always been seasick with the bittersweet vertigo that comes from looking at the past through the smudged lens of memory and imagination. —DE

A family road trip movie in which we never quite know where the film is heading (and are often lied to about why), “Hit the Road” may be set amid the winding desert highways and gorgeous emerald valleys of northwestern Iran, but Panah Panahi's miraculous debut is fueled by the growing suspicion that its characters have taken a major detour away from our mortal coil at some point along the way. “Where are we?” the gray-haired mom (Pantea Panahiha) asks into the camera upon waking up from a restless catnap inside the SUV in which so much of this film takes place. “We're dead,” squeaks the youngest of her two sons (Rayan Sarlak) from the back seat, the six-year-old boy already exuding some of the most anarchic movie kid energy this side of “The Tin Drum.”They aren't dead — at least not literally, even if the adorable stray dog who's come along for the ride seems to be on its last legs — but the further Panahi's foursome drives away from the lives they've left behind in Tehran, the more it begins to seem as if they've left behind life itself. A purgatorial fog rolls in as they climb towards the Turkish border, and with it comes a series of semi-competent guides (one amusingly trying to steer a motorbike from behind a sheepskin balaclava) who show up to give the family vague directions as if they were clueless interns for the ferryman on the river Styx. We may never know why Khosro (Hassan Madjooni) and his wife so urgently fled their home in order to smuggle 20-year-old Farid (Amin Simiar) out of the country and away from the autocratic government their introverted first-born kid must have offended somehow, but it's clear that this family is speeding down a one-way street. 

So it goes in a beautifully tender comedy that tears your heart in half with a featherlight touch — a film that swerves between tragedy and gallows humor with the expert control of a stunt driver, and knowingly sabotages all of its most crushing moments with a deadpan joke in order to keep Khosro's family from running out of gas. “Hit the Road” is a story about people who have to laugh in order to stop themselves from crying, and Panahi commits to that dynamic with the unwavering dedication of someone who knows that his characters don't have any other choice. —DE

Of all the writers retreats in all the summer towns in all of New York, he had to walk into hers. As the sun fades on a perfect Montauk night — setting the stage for a first kiss that, like so many of the most resonant moments in Celine Song's transcendent “Past Lives,” will ultimately be left to the imagination — Nora (an extraordinary Greta Lee) tells Arthur (John Magaro) about the Korean concept of In-Yun, which suggests that people are destined to meet one another if their souls have overlapped a certain number of times before. When Arthur asks Nora if she really believes in all that, the Seoul-born woman sitting across from him invitingly replies that it's just “something Korean people say to seduce someone.”

Needless to say, it works. But as this delicate yet crushingly beautiful film continues to ripple forward in time — the wet clay of Nora and Arthur's flirtation hardening into a marriage in the span of a single cut — the very real life they create together can't help but run parallel to the imagined one that Nora seemed fated to share with the childhood sweetheart she left back in her birth country. She and Hae Sung (“Leto” star Teo Yoo) haven't seen each other in the flesh since they were in grade school, but the ties between them have never entirely frayed apart.

On paper, “Past Lives” might sound like a diasporic riff on a Richard Linklater romance — one that condenses the entire “Before” trilogy into the span of a single film. In practice, however, this gossamer-soft love story almost entirely forgoes any sort of “Baby, you are gonna miss that plane” dramatics in favor of teasing out some more ineffable truths about the way that people find themselves with (and through) each other. Which isn't to suggest that Song's palpably autobiographical debut fails to generate any classic “who's she gonna choose?” suspense by the time it's over, but rather to stress how inevitable it feels that Nora's man crisis builds to a bittersweet quiver of recognition instead of a megaton punch to the gut. Here is an unforgettable romance that unfolds with the mournful resignation of the Leonard Cohen song that inspires Nora's English-language name; it's a movie less interested in tempting its heroine with “the one who got away” than it is in allowing her to reconcile with the version of herself she once left with him as a priceless souvenir. —DE

Inspired by the loss of the director's wife, “The Shrouds” is a grief story as only David Cronenberg would ever think to shoot one: Sardonic, unsentimental, and often so cadaverously stiff that the film itself appears to be suffering from rigor mortis, as if its images died at some point along their brief journey from the projector to the screen. And really, what else would you expect? I suppose it's possible that the story's deeply personal context might have spurred Cronenberg to push against the tender sterility of his recent features, or even dare to expose the soft underbelly that's always been hiding inside his tumorous body of work and its many layers of scary-beautiful new flesh. If so, it almost immediately becomes clear that he had zero interest in accepting that invitation.

A quintessentially late film from an artist who's always been ahead of his time, “The Shrouds” is Cronenberg at his most inhospitable; so far as the project's emotional availability and commercial appeal are concerned, it makes “Crimes of the Future” seem like “Barbie” by comparison. And yet, as with so many of Cronenberg's most resonant movies, its morgue-like coldness eventually reveals itself to be deeply comforting to some degree — if not while you're watching it, then perhaps as its big ideas begin to seep into your bone marrow during the days and weeks that follow.

Between its paranoid scramble of a plot and a protagonist who becomes increasingly difficult to see as anything more than an avatar for its auteur, “The Shrouds” lends itself to a sort of delayed appreciation; its story only makes sense with the detached perspective that might begin to develop in the time between the death of a loved one and the funeral service at which they're laid to rest. Body is reality, Cronenberg likes to say, but what becomes of that reality when the body in question is buried six feet under the ground? —DE

It takes real flair to concoct visual-gag-after-visual-gag within episodic riffs on the raw deals suffered by the gig-economy-classes in modern day Bucharest. Like a sharper Romanian riposte to Ruben Östlund, Radu Jude blends absurdist humor with keen social integrity, as the trials of a dangerously overworked production assistant named Ange (Ilinca Manolache, sensational) builds to a 40-minute final shot in which tragicomedy is heaped upon tragicomedy to unbearably brilliant effect.

Observing a nation's shortcomings is not typically this fun. Yet — unlike latter-day miserabilist works by the likes of Ken Loach — Jude's “Do Not Expect Too Much from the End of the World” and its barbs stick entirely because Jude trusts his audience to appreciate tonal scope. There are no arch-villains, but plenty of morons with too much power, and Jude's script is ripe with delicious character notes. This is a work by someone totally secure in their thinking, and able to afford punchlines to all kinds of ghoulish pen-pushers without fear of confusing the film's ideological clarity. —SMK

Laura Poitras is best-known for directing bracing profiles of Edward Snowden and Julian Assange, disruptive activists who challenged the systems around them. Swap the intelligence world for underground art and Nan Goldin fits right into that trend.

The acclaimed photographer and visual artist is the centerpiece of Poitras' remarkable storytelling achievement, which simultaneously revisits Goldin's career evolution and her more recent protests against the Sackler family and its Purdue Pharma, manufacturer of OxyContin. These efforts led to the creation of her nonprofit organization P.A.I.N., and several successful “die-ins” at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim, and other cultural institutions that had the Sackler family name on their walls. Most of them don't anymore thanks to Goldin's efforts.

The movie is a better superhero story than anything you'll find in the MCU, as Goldin — herself a survivor of an OxyContin overdose — faces down a powerful horde of billionaires and doesn't flinch. It's a riveting testament to the power of creativity to change the world, and she isn't done yet. —EK

“Everything Everywhere All at Once” is as overstuffed as its title implies, even more juvenile than its pedigree suggests, and so creatively unbound from the minute it starts that it makes Daniels' previous efforts seem like they were made with Bressonian restraint by comparison (for context, their last feature was a sweet fable starring Harry Potter as an explosively farting corpse).

It's a movie that I saw twice just to make sure I hadn't completely hallucinated it the first time around, and one that I will soon be seeing a third time for the same reason. I don't ever expect to understand how it was (or got) made, but I already know that it works. And I know that it works because my impulse to pick on its imperfections and wonder how it might've been different eventually forfeits to the utter miracle of its existence.

It's a movie… about a flustered Chinese-American woman trying to finish her taxes. Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh) is being audited — first by the IRS, and then by the other great evils of our multiverse. She and her stubbornly guileless husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan, a sublime revelation in one of his first major roles since the days of Short Round) immigrated to California in pursuit of happiness after Evelyn's overbearing father, Gong Gong (James Hong, 93 years old and yet still in his prime) forbid the marriage, but their dreams of a brighter future were soon quashed by the realities of running a small business and raising a child of their own. —DE

Paul Thomas Anderson's Licorice Pizza” is undeniably a coming-of-age movie — his first clear-cut contribution to a genre defined by the kind of pathological self-invention and animalistic need for acceptance that have also fueled each of his eight previous features — but it's not really about growing up. For one thing, both of its leads have already grown up (or at least aggressively sideways) to a certain extent, and just need someone to recognize the people they've become in the process. For another, there's always been a terminally childish quality to even Anderson's oldest characters.

Gary Valentine might be younger than the likes of Reynolds Woodcock, Doc Sportello, and Frank T.J. Mackey, but he isn't necessarily any less mature. A latchkey goofball who looks after his little brother like a step-son and starts no fewer than three separate businesses over the course of this film (some of them moderately successful!), Gary either understands how things work better than anyone. He's like the fish at the poker table who keeps winning hands because he doesn't know enough to fold. “Just say yes,” he advises his older crush Alana while prepping her for a meeting with a half-cranked talent agent played by “Phantom Thread” showstopper Harriet Sansom Harris, “you can always learn how to do something once you get the part.”

What these characters learn from each other will last a lifetime. “You're never going to remember me,” Alana tells Gary soon after they meet, and it's a testament to this film's immediate electricity that we can already tell that she's wrong. “Stop using time as an excuse,” Gary fires back. In “Licorice Pizza,” time isn't something that keeps people apart — it's the only thing that allows them to find each other in the first place. And this euphoric movie doesn't waste a minute of it. —DE

Anora — or “Ani,” as she prefers to be called — is a brassy, 23-year-old Russian-American stripper who shares a small house with her sister in Brighton Beach. Ivan — or “Vanya,” as he uses interchangeably — is the 21-year-old son of a Moscow billionaire who stays in his father's cocaine mansion on the far side of Brooklyn whenever he's in New York, which if it were up to him would be always. She works seven nights a week at the Manhattan strip club where she's the only Russian-speaker. Ivan, meanwhile, has clearly never worked a day in his life. She's the child of a mom who lives in Miami and a dad who doesn't exist, while he's a hyper-juvenile nepo baby who may never be mature enough to graduate into a large adult son. 

There's probably an effervescent rom-com to be made about these two wildly mismatched kids meeting over a lapdance and falling in love with each other after Ivan pays Ani $15,000 to be his “very horny girlfriend” for a week, but Sean Baker isn't the least bit interested in settling for that story. Splenetically hilarious for more than two hours before reality catches up with it in the film's unforgettable final scene, “Anora” has next to nothing to do with romance, and almost everything to do with the kind of working-class heartache that a modern Hollywood studio would never even try to get right. 

It's a heartache that Mikey Madison's towering lead performance allows to hide in plain sight, even — or perhaps especially — when she isn't wearing anything that might help to disguise it. By the end of the movie, even her character's name feels like an open wound, its ethnic origins preventing her from reaching the full potential of her fantasy, and/or the fantasy of her full potential. At one point someone googles the meaning of “Anora” so that he can explain it to her, but our heroine isn't interested. “We don't care about names in America,” she replies. In this country, who we are runs a distant second to the promise of who we might become. And that promise is growing emptier by the day. —DE

There is something to be said for a simple dish made with the best ingredients by a trusted hand. Just as a perfect omelet made by a lover is more satisfying than an eight-hour feast laid on by a Prince, so it follows that a film like “The Taste of Things works, not in spite of, but because it focuses on executing its basic premise with enrapturing attention to detail. This is a story about love and food, which it presents as the same thing.

Sight unseen, it was always a mouth-watering prospect: two delicious French actors – Juliette Binoche as a cook and Benoît Magimel as her long-time lover and food-obsessed employer – feeding each other in Tran Anh Hung's adaptation of a 2014 graphic novel reputed to be food porn. The promise of this set-up is delivered with gusto as the kitchen of a 19th century French manor house becomes the stage for the most elaborate foreplay you've ever seen. What “Call Me By Your Name” did for peaches “The Taste of Things” does for syrup pears. Belonging to a fine tradition of intoxicating food films such as “Babette's Feast”, “Julie & Julia”, and “Like Water For Chocolate,” “The Taste of Things” pushes the notion of bonding through vittles a step further. Certain dishes are so inscribed by their creators that they act as memory itself, says the film, a sentiment that leaves a beautiful after-taste. —SMK

“Saint Omer,” named after the northern French town where it's largely set, creates a suffocating atmosphere to reflect the degree to which its central figures are trapped. Laurence (Guslagie Mulanga) is a Senegalese immigrant accused of murdering her 15-month-old daughter. Covering her trial is Rama (Kayije Kagame), a novelist, who sits in the gallery each day for the grim proceedings as Laurence and others stand in the witness box to recount what led up to the death.

The women never exchange words, but first-time narrative feature director Diop creates a kind of dialogue in close-ups between them as Rama tries to process Laurence's life and experiences. Rama clearly recognizes, and empathizes with, much of Laurence's struggle as a Black woman in a (far from) post-colonial present day France, and understands the difficulty of, like Laurence, being in an interracial relationship. But she also finds Laurence's murder of her child incomprehensible: just as two seemingly conflicting things can be true at the same time, so is it that you can understand someone and also be absolutely mystified by them.

Alice Diop, who previously made documentaries before this, brings exacting rigor to austere long-takes of Laurence in the witness box recounting her story. Bresson's “The Trial of Joan of Arc” will come to mind. But Laurence is no martyr, and Diop is not interested in snap judgments but the close observation of ambiguity. A formalist work that never shies away from messiness as humanity's default state. —CB

Honeyed Grecian sunshine has nothing on the icy pragmatism of Leda Caruso, a steely careerist on a solo beach holiday in Maggie Gyllenhaal's impressive directorial debut. Based on the novella by the mysterious Italian novelist Elena Ferrante, whose true identity is one of the literary world's greatest mysteries, “The Lost Daughter” is as elusive as its author. As an actress, Gyllenhaal's inspired casting choices were her first boon, and she doesn't hem her actors in with time constraints. Like the days on vacation, time washes away as Gyllenhaal peppers the film with lingering shots of weighted pensive moments. Oliva Colman is engrossing and ferocious as the complicated Leda — as her interest in Dakota Johnson's restless young mother simmers over into a scorched folly, Leda challenges even the most malleable allegiances. It's hard to take your eyes off of Jessie Buckley as young Leda, whose failed juggling of motherhood and ambition explains — but can't quite soften — the older woman's motives. The sacrifices of womanhood, embodied wrenchingly in three very different performances, can never be fully forgotten, even in the most beautiful landscape. —JD



“All Light Everywhere” winds its way through fragmentary observations about modern surveillance society, unearthing a wide range of amorphous connections about its subject. However, Theo Anthony's ambitious documentary unearths one brilliant connection — a fascinating lineage between the camera and the gun — and roots it in historical fact.

For that reason alone, the filmmaker's strange and alluring rumination on the ways technology exerts control over human life is a worthy follow-up to his 2016 debut “Rat Film,” which used Baltimore's rodent infestation as a savvy metaphor for gentrification.

“All Light Everywhere” investigates how little we see about the way the world looks back at us, careening from a warehouse that develops tasers and police body cameras, to training sessions for officers who wear the devices, the machinations of a spy plane entrepreneur, and the history of camera pigeons in WWI.

In the most compelling passages, Anthony journeys back to the late 19th century, unearthing the little-known history of astrophotography and mug shots, finding a remarkable set of connections between camera technology and weapons of war. All of that comes full circle in a climactic confrontation about the nature of privacy in a world governed by corporate power, as the film coheres into a compelling riff on the ominous forces governing everyday life that's both alarming and awe-inspiring at once. —EK

Martin Scorsese may like to think of “Killers of the Flower Moon” as the Western that he always wanted to make, but this frequently spectacular American epic about the genocidal conspiracy that was visited upon the Osage Nation during the 1920s is more potent and self-possessed when it sticks a finger in one of the other genres that bubble up to the surface over the course of its three-and-a-half-hour runtime.

The first and most obvious of those is a gangster drama in the grand tradition of the director's previous work; just when it seemed like “The Irishman” might've been Scorsese's final word on his signature genre, they've pulled him back in for another movie full of brutal killings, bitter voiceovers, and biting conclusions about the corruptive spirit of American capitalism. But if the “Reign of Terror” sometimes proves to be an uncomfortably vast backdrop for Scorsese's  more intimate brand of crime saga, “Killers of the Flower Moon” excels as a compellingly multi-faceted character study about the men behind the massacre. Over time, it becomes the most interesting of the many different movies that comprise it: A twisted love story about the marriage between an Osage woman (the indomitable Lily Gladstone) and the white man who — unbeknownst to her — helped murder her entire family so that he could inherit the headrights for their oil fortune (Leonardo DiCaprio, giving the best performance of his career as the dumbest and most vile character he's ever played). 

Finding the right balance in this story is a challenge for a filmmaker as gifted and operatic as Scorsese, whose ability to tell any story rubs up against his ultimate admission that this might not be his story to tell. And so, for better or worse, Scorsese turns “Killers of the Flower Moon” into the kind of story that he can still tell better than anyone else: A story about greed, corruption, and the mottled soul of a country that was born from the belief that it belonged to anyone callous enough to take it. —DE

Sinister and liberating in equal measure (and often at the same time), Jane Schoenbrun's ultra-lo-fi “We're All Going to the World's Fair” leveraged the inherent loneliness of webcams and the performative danger of online creepypasta into a haunting portrait of the potentially dysphoric relationship between screens and identity in the internet age. The kind of sui generis shot in the dark that feels like it could only have been made by someone who wasn't sure if anyone would see it, Schoenbrun's first movie is one of the rare coming-of-age films that manages to embody the full dread and possibility of self-recognition, and for that reason it almost immediately resonated with an audience of people — trans people in particular — who'd been waiting for something like “We're All Going to the World's Fair” since before they had the language to know how much they needed it. 

Another, more explicitly trans meditation on the role that media can play in revealing people to themselves, Jane Schoenbrun's astonishing follow-up manages to retain the seductive fear of their micro-budget debut and deepen its thrilling wounds of discovery even while examining them at a much larger scale. If “We're All Going to the World's Fair” was a 360p snapshot of dysphoria in motion, “I Saw the TV Glow” is an intimate landscape shot with the ultra-vivid resolution of a recurring dream; it marries the queer radicality of a Gregg Araki film with the lush intoxication of a Gregory Crewdson photo, and finds Schoenbrun holding on to every inch of their vision as they make the leap from outsider artist to A24-stamped auteur. Anchored by some of the most arresting scenes in recent memory (including a Brigette Lundy-Paine monologue that burns with singular intensity), this is a movie that knows it will be seen, and yet, to an even greater degree than Schoenbrun's debut, it's also a movie about how the things people watch can have the power to see them in return. Even the parts of themselves they might be hiding from. Even the parts of themselves they aren't ready to name yet. —DE

The joyous fourth movie in a death-defying franchise that continues to find the sweet spot between “Magic Mike XXL” and “Salò, the 120 Days of Sodom,” Jeff Tremaine's “Jackass Forever” opens with a sequence that accurately sets the tone for the motion picture magic to come. As with all of the sketches that compose this plotless clip reel of brilliant American idiocy, you know that something foul and/or unfathomably painful is about to go down in the cheesy “Godzilla” parody that kicks things off — longtime “Jackass” fans might even be able to guess what it will be — but it still hits with a childlike wave of wonder and revulsion when you see it unfold. It's no wonder that the film's biggest laugh comes when someone reacts to a wildly elaborate prank by shouting, in all sincerity, “I knew that was gonna happen!”

In this case, the gag is that the kaiju terrorizing downtown New York is actually Chris Pontius' flaccid penis (painted green and puppeteered on strings with on-screen help from “Being John Malkovich” director Spike Jonze), and the monster's legs are played by his wrinkled balls, which groan in response to the miniature rockets fired at them by ringleader Johnny Knoxville and other members of the cast. This will not be the strangest torture inflicted upon Pontius' junk during the film — a film in which it's actually Steve-O who suffers the worst of the genital hijinx, thanks to a stunt that I memorialized in my notes as “Candyman's dick” — but it anticipates a work of art in which nostalgia and shock go as well together as old friends and pig ejaculate. Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it. —DE

There's a moment near the end of Gints Zilbalodis' “Flow” that powerfully tugs at the heartstrings. It's when the film‘s central character, a black cat who you've come to have a profound emotional connection with, rediscovers a lost ball that he and his animal friends had been playing with earlier in the movie. He thought he'd never see it again. And suddenly he does. Sometimes, lost things can be found again.

If you thought that emotion elicited without cloying manipulation was something lost in animation, it is found again in “Flow” as well. A movie brimming with sentiment but not sentimentality, this is one of the most moving animated films in recent memory — evocative, beguiling, and majestic in its fable-like story about a motley crew of animals trying to survive in a flooded world. They speak volumes without ever having to say a single word. —CB

Filmmaker Oliver Laxe brings a kind of humbling brilliance to “Sirât,” a sui generis work that evades any classification and emanates from a wholly personal vision of cinema. Born in France to Galician parents, and shooting the majority of his work to date in Morocco, Laxe's work operates in the interstices of borders and cultures, but wholly bypasses appropriation. It's always visually transportive and grimly sublime, focusing on simple plots and conflicts that provide ample space for philosophical and existential contemplation. And “Sirât” is undoubtedly his most fully realized work in his regard, notable too for folding in the visceral pleasures of contemporary genre and even blockbuster cinema.

The world Laxe creates is finely rendered in both the fore- and background, revealing much greater scope than its initial set-up lets on. Luis (Sergi López, in another powerful performance) is another variety of a recurrent character in cinema and television now: the stricken father, forced to bring his emotions further to the surface than he's typically comfortable with, and responding in disbelief to his offspring's opposing values. —DK

You can't unkill the world. Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa learned that lesson the hard way when she commandeered a rig full of Immortan Joe's precious war brides and sped across the desert towards the matriarchal eden from which she was stolen as a child. She and her motley crew of reluctant allies drove as far as the highways of Valhalla would take them, only to discover that the Green Place of Many Mothers wasn't beyond the uninhabitable swampland they had passed to get there — it was the uninhabitable swampland they had to passed to get there. There is no going back, but sometimes you can only find the path forward by looking in the rear-view mirror.

And so it stands to reason that inveterate madman George Miller has followed the most spectacular action movie of the 21st century not with a sequel that continues where “Mad Max: Fury Road” left off, but rather with a prequel that paves the way to where it began. Instead of trying to outdo the orgiastic mayhem that brought his Ozploitation franchise screaming into the 21st century all shiny and chrome, Miller has chosen to do something even crazier and more rewarding: He's created a symphonic, five-part, decades-spanning revenge saga so immense and self-possessed that it refuses to be seen as the mere extension of another movie.

Avoiding the same traps that have made too many recent franchise offshoots feel like just less of the same (in part because it was fully written before a frame of “Fury Road” had ever been shot), “Furiosa” doesn't try to reverse-engineer one of the most propulsive cinematic experiences ever conceived so much as it scours the Wasteland for the emotion that will be required to fuel it. Whereas “Fury Road” was driven by the search for hope, “Furiosa” is an even more glorious film about why people need it in the first place. —DE

An extraordinary work of meta-fiction which continues where the previous film left off, and subverts the fastidiousness of its construction to illuminate why Hogg felt the need to make it in the first place. As vulnerable as its predecessor and textured with the same velvet sense of becoming, “Part II” adds new layers of depth and distance to the looking glass of Hogg's self-reflection, as it follows Julie through the fraught process of making her graduation film… a short which just so happens to be the tragic story of a 25-year-old London girl's relationship with an older heroic addict.

Not only is the set in Julie's film virtually identical to the apartment from “The Souvenir,” it is the apartment from “The Souvenir,” only this time the camera pulls back to reveal the airplane hanger that surrounds it. In essence, Hogg is making a movie about her younger self making a movie about her younger self's worst heartbreak, which is effectively a remake of the previous movie that Hogg made (the press notes adroitly refer to “Part II” as “a deconstruction of a reconstruction”). And while the view through that infinity mirror of romantic dramas isn't nearly as confusing as it might sound on paper, or at all, it also further complicates itself in dazzling fashion by the end, as slavish re-creation gives way to a richer synthesis of memory and imagination. —DE

“You can't fake a thought.” Those words appear twice in the opening paragraphs of Iain Reid's 2016 novel “I'm Thinking of Ending Things,” and so you don't even have to turn the first page before it's clear why Charlie Kaufman was so drawn to the book. The filmmaker's career has always been shaped by a fascination with the tortured — if tragicomic — relationship between the life of the mind and the world that's filtered through it; Kaufman is obsessed with the cracked echo chamber of human consciousness; with the feeling that everyone is talking to each other through a two-way mirror; with the perverse irony that our inescapable ego-centrism is the one thing we all have in common.

From “Adaptation” and “Anomalisa” to his recent novel “Antkind” and all points in between, Kaufman's work hinges on characters who are (often literally) trying to break free of their own brains and/or bodies and bridge the divide that isolates us from each other. Some of them succeed, some of them make peace with that gap, and some of them swan dive into it under the delusion they might eventually crawl out the other side. But at the end of the day, every Charlie Kaufman story effectively unpacks a different attempt to bust out of the same prison. As Millicent Weems put it in “Synecdoche, New York”: “This is everyone's experience. Every single one. The specifics hardly matter. Everyone is everyone.” Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich.

If “I'm Thinking of Ending Things” feels like both an act of self-parody for its director and also a radical departure from his previous work, that's because it takes Kaufman's usual fixations and turns them inside out. While this leaky snow globe of a breakup movie is yet another bizarre and ruefully hilarious trip into the rift between people, it's not — for the first time — about someone who's trying to cross it. On the contrary, Kaufman is now telling a story about the rift itself. The result is a surreal, erratic, and strangely moving experience that circles around a realization it dances around until the bitter end. —DE

“It's hard to love someone without mercy.”

Sitting across the dinner table from his actress daughter after sweeping back into her life with a high-concept plan for reconciliation, acclaimed filmmaker and absent father Gustav Borg (Stellan Skarsgård) offers that wisdom to Nora (Renate Reinsve) as if directing her on how to forgive him. And in the wake of his ex-wife's death, that's precisely what Gustav intends to do — not by apologizing for his decision to leave their family when Nora was still just a child, but rather by casting her in an autobiographical Netflix drama about his own life.

Exploitative as that sounds, Gustav isn't just hoping to make Nora say the words he's always longed to hear from his firstborn daughter in exchange for a cut of Ted Sarandos' money. On the contrary, his plan — like everything else in the transcendently moving “Sentimental Value,” the masterpiece that “The Worst Person in the World” director Joachim Trier has been working toward for his entire career — is layered with a delicate sense of personal history. Because the (once) great auteur Borg doesn't intend for Nora to play a version of herself in his movie. No, he insists on using her as a stand-in for his mother, who committed suicide in the sun-bathed Oslo house that has belonged to their family since at least the start of World War II.

From that premise, Trier spins the richest and most emotionally overflowing film that he's made so far — one that comes to involve a bit of “Vertigo” when Nora rejects her father's offer, only to watch him cast an American starlet (Elle Fanning) to play the role Gustav had written for her. Few recent movies have more elegantly literalized how the love that parents are able to share with their children — and vice versa — can be limited by their ability to express it. And by the time that “Sentimental Value” arrives at its soul-melting final sequence, almost none have more beautifully explored the role that making art can play in facilitating that process. —DE

With the third film of her career, Eliza Hittman cemented herself as one of contemporary cinema's most empathetic and skilled chroniclers of American youth. Hittman's trio of features — “It Felt Like Love,” “Beach Rats,” and “Never Rarely Sometimes Always,” her first studio effort — have all zoomed in on blue-collar teens on the edge of sexual awakening, often of the dangerous variety. Hittman's ability to write and direct such tender films has long been bolstered by her interest in casting them with fresh new talents, all the better to sell the veracity of her stories and introduce moviegoers to emerging actors worthy of big attention. 

With “Never Rarely Sometimes Always,” Hittman continued her traditions with her most vivid work yet, one all the more impressive for its studio pedigree. Newbies Sidney Flanigan and Talia Ryder star as a pair of close cousins who are forced to deal with an unexpected pregnancy and a small town not at all interested in offering up any alternatives beyond having the baby. Despite its subject matter, the film isn't just the wrenching drama many might expect. Yes, it's a searing examination of the current state of this country's finicky abortion laws and the medical professionals tasked with enforcing them (from the small-minded to the big-hearted), and if art can have any impact on its consumers, the film will stick with many of its viewers, perhaps even changing long-held beliefs. But it's also a singular look at what it means to be a teenage girl today, and with all the joy and pain that comes with it. —KE

It would be a severe understatement to say that Albert Serra's Polynesia-set “Pacifiction” avoids the touristic travel-porn clichés of most films about foreigners in a tropical locale. A drifting and rigorously introspective study of colonialism at the edge of apocalypse, “Pacifiction” stars Benoît Magimel as De Roller, dispatched from Paris to serve as the High Commissioner of a country that's still controlled as a vestige of the French empire. Over the course of the film's droning 163-minute running time, De Roller's rudderless existence is capsized — gently at first, and then with soul-crushing force — by rumors that France is preparing to resume nuclear testing near his adopted island nation.

Serra has invoked the '70s conspiracy thrillers of Alan J. Pakula when talking about “Pacifiction,” but the specter of nuclear weapons testing isn't what the film is “about” as much as it contributes to an atmosphere of uncertainty and fragility. It's a narrative throughline on which Serra hangs other issues and ideas in this very episodic movie. Think of a Frederick Wiseman documentary but as a narrative feature; Serra almost made it like a documentary, filming 180 hours of footage (via three cameras at once for each scene, so really 540 hours of footage), and with the script revised and improvised on the fly.

“Pacifiction” is far too oblique to be fully an heir to the Pakula conspiracy thriller tradition. After all, it's possible weapons testing will never resume here. But isn't it disturbing enough that it's considered at all? “Pacifiction” is vital because it's a movie for a culture constantly patting itself on the back but in desperate risk of repeating all its previous mistakes. Where every little bit of progress is imperiled. We delude ourselves into thinking colonial exploitation was left behind in the 20th century (along with nuclear tests). Or maybe we choose to ignore what's right in front of us. —CB

The third and most romantic installment in Rohrwacher's informal trilogy exploring the relationship between Italy's past and present, “La Chimera” finds the Tuscan filmmaker returning to the rustic charm and eternal regret of “The Wonders” and “Happy as Lazzaro” in order to stretch them across a richly textured canvas that spans from ancient Etruria to “The Crown.” 

It begins with a man played by Josh O'Connor (never better) as he dreams of the woman he loved and lost. His name is Arthur, her name was Beniamina, and there is no hope of them reuniting on this mortal coil. But Arthur isn't one to give up. Legend tells of a buried door that connects this world to the next, and this surly archaeologist is so hellbent on finding it that he's become the leader of a ragtag gang of tombarolis — lovable grave-robbers, essentially — in the small village where his Beniamina once lived. He offers the group his sorcerer-like ability to dowse the location of ancient treasures, and in return they do the digging for him. What he ultimately turns up is a lush and lived-in adventure that beats Indiana Jones at his own game while posing the question that Rohrwacher has been circling for so long: Does the past belong to everyone, or does it belong to no one? —DE

Only a true Francis Ford Coppola fetishist like “Ad Astra” director James Gray would saddle a modest self-portrait about his memories of sixth grade with a title that makes it sound more like “Apocalypse Now” than any other film ever has (a reference to candidate Reagan's nuclear hawkishness, “Armageddon Time” borrows its name from a 1979 Willie Williams reggae jam famously covered by The Clash).

Pivoting away from the biggest production of his career with a melancholy return to the kind of small-scale New York stories that first put him on the map, Gray revisits his childhood years in Queens and all of their related ghosts with this unsparingly well-remembered coming-of-age story about a pre-pubescent Jewish boy named Paul Graff (Banks Repeta), his loving relationship with his maternal grandfather (a heartbreaking Anthony Hopkins), and his friendship with the slightly older Black kid (Jaylin Webb) he meets on the first day of school in September 1980. Bolstered by difficult, unflinching performances from Anne Hathaway and Jeremy Strong as Paul's hyper-assimilative parents — in addition to one very pointed cameo from Jessica Chastain — “Armageddon Time” weaves a painfully honest memoir about conditional whiteness and the moral compromises demanded by the American Dream. It's all the more impressive in the context of a movie that could easily have become the Jewish-American “Belfast” if not for its Talmudic moral streak and fierce aversion to sentimentality. —DE

Like any movie by Wes Anderson, “Asteroid City” is the epitome of a Wes Anderson movie. A film about a television program about a play within a play “about infinity and I don't know what else” (as one character describes it), this delightfully profound desert charmer — by far the director's best effort since “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” and in some respects the most poignant thing he's ever made — boasts all of his usual hallmarks and then some.

A multi-tiered framing device, diorama-esque shot design, and Tilda Swinton affectlessly saying things like “I never had children, but sometimes I wonder if I wish I should have” are just some of the many signature flourishes that you might recognize from Anderson's previous work and/or the endless parade of A.I.-generated TikToks that imitate his style.

Let's just say that all of the people in Asteroid City will be more directly confronted with the unknown than anyone in a Wes Anderson film has been before. Imagine if Mr. Fox's encounter with the wolf on the hill came at the end of the first act instead of the end of the third, or if Steve Zissou came face-to-face with the jaguar shark that ate his friend just a few minutes after the jaguar shark ate his friend. Imagine if any of Anderson's most resolute yet vulnerable characters — all of whom have devised intricate systems of living in order to impose some degree of control over a chaotic universe — were forced to reckon with their own helplessness right from the start. —DE

Compelling evidence that every major arthouse director should be required to make their own “Cloud Atlas” before they die, Bertrand Bonello's sweeping, romantic, and ravishingly strange “The Beast” finds the French director broadening — and in some cases challenging — the core obsessions of his previous films into a sci-fi epic about the fear of falling in love. 

Split into three lightly intercut parts that trace the connection between two star-crossed souls (embodied by Léa Seydoux and George MacKay) from 1910 to 2044, Bonello's latest and most accessible movie begins by literalizing the same basic premise that has undergirded previous work like “House of Tolerance” and “Zombi Child”: The past is always present (a dialectic explored here with the help of a machine that encourages people to purify their DNA by purging themselves of any emotion left over from their past lives). 

The genre elements at play here allow Bonello to take for granted what his earlier films had to earn, and “The Beast” makes the most of that head start by knotting its overlapping temporalities into a story that's suspended between the baggage we have from yesterday and the anxiety we have for tomorrow. As its title might imply, “The Beast” is a fairy tale of sorts — one whose moral instructs us to live in the moment, lest we not live at all. —DE

In 2021, long-dormant auteur Jane Campion returned with a poison-tipped dagger of a Western drama wrapped in rawhide and old rope; a brilliant, murderous fable about masculine strength that's so diamond-toothed its victims are already half dead by the time they see the first drop of their own blood.

The shiv-like stealthiness of Campion's approach may stem from the 1967 Thomas Savage novel on which “The Power of the Dog” is based, but it perfectly suits a filmmaker who's long been fascinated by how weakness can be force's most effective sheath. The Wellington-born filmmaker is drawn to characters — artists, but not always — who make beautiful homes for themselves in the middle, even if the rest of the world simply assumes they must be lost. To that end, perhaps the most basic (and least harrowing) of her latest film's razor-fanged pleasures is how “The Power of the Dog” proves that no one is better at finding these people, or at recognizing how their supposed defects often provide the perfect disguise for their unique potential.

Set on a Montana cattle ranch in 1925, Campion's sinewy adaptation depicts a four-sided death waltz between a tortured cowboy (Benedict Cumberbatch), his softhearted brother (Jesse Plemons), the widow he marries (Kirsten Dunst), and the delicate-seeming teenage son who comes with her (Kodi Smit-McPhee). The story that unfolds from that scenario is equal parts wish fulfillment and cautionary tale, and since it's told without a dominant point-of-view — in a way that feels almost anthropological — it's able to be each of those things for different characters at the same time.

For all of the film's biblical grandeur, “The Power of the Dog” never insists upon itself. There isn't a moment in the movie that lacks vision, but the whole thing exudes a tremblingly quiet strength. Just as Savage's plainspoken novel found the author flexing the invisible muscles he developed over a lifetime of fighting his own desire, Campion's equally poignant film leverages repressed passion into an unexpected show of strength. “The Power of the Dog” sticks its teeth into you so fast and furtively that you may not feel the sting on your skin until after the credits roll, but the delayed bite of the film's ending doesn't stop it from leaving behind a well-earned scar. —DE

Born in the small Palestinian community of Masafer Yatta, 28-year-old Basel Adra has never known a life that wasn't under threat of forced removal — or worse. But the freshness of his memory can also be attributed to the fact that Adra has never known a life that wasn't being documented for his own protection. The most dehumanizing episodes of his existence have all been captured on camera by his family and their fellow villagers, the footage preserved and shared in the hopes that the world might witness their suffering and prevail upon Israel to let Palestinians live in peace (“I started filming when we started to end,” Adra intones, perhaps repeating the same words his father said the first time he picked up his own camera).

Against all odds, that hope continues to persevere — not only among the survivors of Masafer Yatta, but also through “No Other Land,” the lucidly enraging documentary that Adra has co-directed about Israel's decades-long attempt to erase them from the earth as completely as it erased them from its maps. The first major film about the occupation of Palestine since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October of 2023, this intimate and harrowing portrait of endurance is all the more powerful for its focus on the decades of colonial degradation that paved the way for the current nightmare.

Eligible for a spot on this list thanks to the film's brief qualifying run at a single New York City theater, “No Other Land” is still without permanent U.S. distribution. There's a profound shame in that, but also a rea; sadness as well. Witnessing is the most effective defense people have against occupation, as occupiers — like all thieves — wilt in the face of being watched. The footage is out there, and it's rarely or never been assembled into a more concise, powerful, and damning argument than it is here. Now it only needs to be seen. —DE

How do we live with some of the shit that we've been forced to watch on a daily basis? Why are we so eager to immortalize the worst images that our world is capable of producing, and what kind of awful power do we lend such tragedies by sanctifying them into spectacles that can play out over and over again?

While Jordan Peele has fast become one of the most relevant and profitable of modern American filmmakers, “Nope” is the first time that he's been afforded a budget fit for a true blockbuster spectacle, and that's exactly what he's created with it. But if this smart, muscular, and massively entertaining flying saucer freak-out is such an old school delight that it starts with a shout-out to early cinema pioneer Eadweard Muybridge (before paying homage to more direct influences like “Close Encounters of the Third Kind”), it's also a thoroughly modern popcorn movie for and about viewers who've been inundated with — and addicted to — 21st century visions of real-life terror.

The only sci-fi movie that might scare and delight Guy Debord and Ed Wood to the same degree, “Nope” offers a giddy throwback to the days of little green men and hubcap U.F.O.s that hopes to revitalize those classic tropes for audiences who've seen too much bloodshed on their own screens to believe in Hollywood's “bad miracles.” It's a tractor beam of a movie pointed at people who've watched 9/11 happen so many times on network TV that it's lost any literal meaning; who've scrolled past body cam snuff films in between Dril tweets; who've become accustomed to rubbernecking at American life from inside the wreckage. —DE

“Memoria” begins with the first jump scare in Apichatpong Weerasethakul's career, but the sudden impact isn't as relevant as the way it resonates in the silence that follows. Anyone familiar with the slow-burn lyricism at the center of the Thai director's work knows how he adheres to a dreamlike logic that takes its time to settle in. The Colombia-set “Memoria,” his first movie made outside his native country, does that as well as anything in “Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives” or “Cemetery of Splendour.” But this time around, there's a profound existential anxiety creeping in.

With Tilda Swinton's puzzled gaze as its guide, “Memoria” amounts to a haunting, introspective look at one woman's attempts to uncover the roots of a mysterious sound that only she can hear. More than that, it's a masterful and engrossing response to the rush of modern times and the collective amnesia it creates — one that builds to a last-minute reveal for the ages. Anyone frustrated by its patience only serves to prove the point —EK

One of the most romantic movies of the decade is… a police procedural? That's just how it goes when “Oldboy” director Park Chan-wook — whose operatic revenge melodramas have given way to a series of ravishingly baroque Hitchcockian love stories about the various “perversities” that might bind two wayward souls together — decides to make a detective thriller. 

Which isn't to suggest that “Decision to Leave” is some kind of whodunnit. On the contrary, Park's funny, playful, and increasingly poignant crime thriller is less interested in what Hae-joon (Park Hae-il) knows about his suspect than in how he feels about her. By the same token, widowed caretaker Seo-rae (played with deliciously uncertain purpose by Chinese “Lust, Caution” star Tang Wei) seems less troubled by the idea that Hae-joon might discover some damning evidence about her late husband's death than she is by the fear that he might stop investigating her. 

And so the stage is set for Park to orchestrate a psychologically complex procedural about a proud detective brought to life by a crime he doesn't want to solve, and a rootless murder suspect who's mastered the art of leaving things behind. What starts as a rather open-and-shut case, however, soon evolves into something much richer, as Park leverages the killings (plural!) into a gripping investigation of a mystery that no police department could ever hope to solve: How does a romance survive between two people whose only hope for a future together depends upon them leaving the past unresolved? It's a mystery that Park unpacks with uncharacteristic restraint, if only because its ultimate payoff — more of a sinking realization than the kind of sudden bombshell that often detonated at the end of his earlier films — requires these characters to remain firmly lodged in the real world, where their adult longings might face adult consequences. 

On the other hand, “Decision to Leave” is only able to stir up such unexpectedly immense emotions during its final moments because of the complications that Park creates for his characters along the way, which sink into Hae-joon and Seo-rae with the same visible weight that a wave of ocean water saturates into the dry sand it finds onshore. If “Decision to Leave” initially seems to be investigating how their feelings for each other can survive despite being so unresolved, a different picture emerges at high tide — one that suggests there's no other way for them to stay alive. Love can last a lifetime, but longing never dies. —DE

When's the last time you saw a three-hour movie you wished could be longer? Drive My Car” not only inspires that wish, it grants it: even though the credits roll around the 180-minute mark, the world of Ryusuke Hamaguchi's film, and its wayward characters, keeps unspooling in your head. That's fitting because “Drive My Car” is filled with characters who can't let things go in their own lives either: Hidetoshi Nishijima plays the acclaimed theater director Kafuku, who accepts a residency to direct a new, multilingual adaptation of “Uncle Vanya.” Recently widowed, he's obsessed over why, before her death, his wife had an affair with a young matinee idol, whose intellectual capacity seemed, well, beneath her. Kafuku casts the scandal-ridden stud as the title character in his “Vanya,” which seems an ill portent. Keeping the director grounded, though, is his 23-year-old driver Misaki (Toko Miura), whose employment is a liability precondition of Kafuku accepting the residency. She's stoic enough to suggest early on she's haunted by something.

In “Drive My Car,” everyone else is too. And Hamaguchi's approach isn't so much to tell a story, but to let you find it in the midst of his trademark lengthy conversation scenes, in this case built around rehearsals of the play, long stints at the wheel, and energy-sapped bar visits. Based on a Haruki Murakami story, “Drive My Car” shows why more filmmakers should lean on the long-take — Hamaguchi lets his characters breathe, with enough quiet moments to allow you to fill in what isn't said, just the way you'd put down a book to sit and think for a moment. As arresting a literary adaptation it is — and this is one of the young century's finest literary adaptations to date — it's the images that'll stick with you just as much: two hands thrust through a Saab's moon roof clutching cigarettes, two figures perched atop a cliff-like snowdrift, a young woman hanging back, rapt, as actors rehearse in a park. So many works of art emphasize our disconnection, but “Drive My Car,” its title a quiet invitation, suggests a path back to one another. —CB

On its surface, Garrett Bradley's “Time” asks a simple question: How can you convey the full length of 21 years in the span of a single film, let alone a documentary that runs just 81 minutes? And from its degraded opening images — borrowed from the first of a thousand video messages that a Black Louisiana woman named Sibil Fox Richardson (aka “Fox Rich”) recorded for her husband as she waited for him to be released from the State Penitentiary — offers a similarly simple answer: You don't measure it in length, but rather in loss.

You measure time in absence. In the undertows of anger that swirl under the water and threaten to sweep you out to sea. In the punitive aftertaste of forcing six boys to grow up without a father. In the way that their mother, a determined but soft-spoken 27-year-old when she made that initial tape, has hardened into a social justice warrior of such indomitable strength that she could single-handedly restore that term to the power it implies. You don't think of time as a bridge that stretches between past and future, but as the boundless present that flows below; infinite along one axis, but so narrow along the other that you can barely see the distance between shores.Swirled together from 18 years' worth of MiniDV tapes (in addition to the newer, more pristine footage the filmmaker shot of Fox and her family before that incredible treasure trove of home video was dumped in her lap), Bradley's monumental and enormously moving “Time” doesn't juxtapose the pain of yesterday against the hope of tomorrow so much as it insists upon a perpetual now. And while the documentary never reduces its subjects to mere symbols of the oppression they represent — the film couldn't be more personal, and it builds to a moment of such unvarnished intimacy that you can hardly believe what you're watching — Bradley's Tralfamadorian editing flattens time in a way that contextualizes mass incarceration on the largest of continuums. “Time” in name and timeless in style, this liquid history streams centuries of subjugation into a single confluence of dehumanization until slavery and the prison-industrial complex become two separate brooks that feed into the same river. —DE

Hollywood may still be in trouble, the box office might still be a mess, and the definition of “blockbuster” in the year 2025 might still be very much in flux, but no one can deny the raw power of Joseph Kosinski's bonafide mega smash hit, “Top Gun: Maverick.” No, really, no one, as the long- (long-, looooong-) gestating sequel to Tony Scott's raucous 1986 extended music video about abs and Naval aviators managed to charm both critics and audiences alike. The third time this writer saw the film in theaters it was like being at a Broadway show on opening night, the entire crowd abuzz, atwitter, basically beaming, and that was while they were simply buying their popcorn and buckets of soda. Such glee is contagious, and by the time “Danger Zone” pumped through the massive IMAX speakers, it was clear that everyone was there for a damn good time.

Even more thrilling: Kosinski's film delivers that good time, over and over and over again. How do you make a good sequel? It's a question that has plagued Hollywood for decades, and one that Kosinski's film deftly answers. By making a good movie. There, formula complete.

While a previous affection for Scott's movie certainly helps in enjoying “Maverick” – if nothing else, understanding the fraught and profound emotional bonds between Tom Cruise, Val Kilmer, and Anthony Edwards' characters and how they carry over to this new entry, is good – viewers could still walk in cold and appreciate the level of bombastic “wow, that's a fucking movie!” on display in the feature. By now, Cruise's obsession with cranking up the dial on each and every of his action outings is well-documented, and he's joined on that quest by a wily group of flyboys (and girls!) as he returns to Top Gun to right some wrongs, kick some ass, and take some names. High-flying aerial stunts literally soar, emotion runs high, and Lady Gaga is there to sing along to all of it. Now this? This is a movie. This is a blockbuster. We miss them, but they rarely were any better than this one. —KE

In 68 minutes, Steve McQueen made the most intricate, joyful movie of his career, dance-party salute to Black joy and teen energy that doubles as a meditation on hidden history. In the year's most exciting, audacious use of music onscreen, teenager Martha (Amarah-Jae St. Aubyn) and her peers hit the dance floor for a soulful rendition of Janet Kay's 1979 single “Silly Games.” But when then the tune stops and their a cappella rendition takes over — for five mesmerizing minutes! — one woman's high-pitch wail resolves on the same bluesy note, the feet stamping coalesces into a mighty beat, and the collective performance transforms into a dazzling, hypnotic representation of cultural solidarity. Martha's wild night out in the Notting Hill neighborhood circa 1980 hits a few hard times, but it builds to a giddy, romantic finish that lets her get away with the excitement of discovering herself in piecemeal.

Stitched into the broader tapestry of McQueen's five-film “Small Axe” miniseries about the experiences of West Indian Londoners across the decades, “Lovers Rock” certainly feels like a concise puzzle piece in some vast tapestry designed to make up for years of underexplored territory. At the same time, the movie — and there's no point in questioning whether it deserves that designation — stands on its own as a poetic snapshot of life as vivid as anything in “Roma” or “Boyhood.” McQueen has told many rich, unsettling stories over the years. But with “Lovers Rock,” he funnels those same lyrical powers into a celebration of living in the moment, and we're right there with him. —EK

How does someone follow one of the greatest and most profoundly summative farewells the movies have ever seen? By definition, they don't. They retire, or they die. Or they retire and then they die. In some rare cases, it even seems like they die because they retired. And then there's 82-year-old filmmaker and Studio Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki, always in a category of his own, who's formally or informally quit the business no fewer than seven times of the course of his illustrious career, most recently after the 2013 release of his magnum opus “The Wind Rises.” That film — a fictionalized biopic about aeronautical engineer Jiro Horikoshi — ended with someone concluding “we must live,” in spite of all things. Miyazaki's new last film (for now) asks how, and then offers its own kind of answer.

The story of an angry and grieving child named Mahito who loses his mother in a 1943 hospital fire and then moves to the Japanese countryside so that his father can marry the boy's aunt, “The Boy and the Heron” kicks into high gear once an Iago-like bird lures Mahito into a parallel universe with promises of reuniting with his mother. Already one of the most beautiful movies ever drawn, Miyazaki's film becomes transcendent from that point on, resolving into a dream-like adventure that finds its creator nakedly reflecting on his legacy. And while this dream-like warble of a swan song may be too pitchy and scattered to hit with the gale-force power that made “The Wind Rises” feel like such a definitive farewell, “The Boy and the Heron” finds Miyazaki so nakedly bidding adieu — to us, and to the crumbling kingdom of dreams and madness that he'll soon leave behind — that it somehow resolves into an even more fitting goodbye, one graced with the divine awe and heart-stopping wistfulness of watching a true immortal make peace with their own death. —DE

Lydia Tár may not be real (despite a worrying number of deeply unfunny essays that unfurled in the wake of the release of Todd Field's masterpiece), but she will indeed endure. It's nearly impossible to explain why “Tár” works so well — explaining the film's plot involves lots of buzzwords that seem to, if not entirely miss the point, at least miss great chunks of it — but let's try. First, there's Cate Blanchett, who stars as the titular Lydia Tár, the world's foremost classical composer-conductor (and she's a woman!) on the cusp of yet another major professional milestone. Sound snoozy? Hardly. Blanchett's kind of intensity, both warm and repellant, is on full display here; hell, it's at its full glory.

Lydia (or “Linda” if you're in the know) has ruthlessly shaped every aspect of her life and work. The composing and conducting? Just part of the overall performance of being Lydia Tár, and what an electric performance it is. But what happens when the cracks start to show? Field thrillingly opens the film during a long-form interview with Lydia that drills down into her many accomplishments and what's next for her, and her face can't help but betray every thought and feeling she's got associated with them. And that's all before she gets, in contemporary parlance, “canceled” for trading professional favors for sex.

At best, Lydia doesn't have scruples; at worst, she's an actual abuser, and how she — and we — attempt to navigate that line carries us through the rest of the film. Despite seemingly heavy subject matter, this is a film that flies right by, dark humor at every turn, immersive sensibilities plunging us into her world, and a sort of inevitability that lands Lydia at a hilarious and horrible crossroads.

Field and Blanchett often get surreal and even silly, but what's more surreal and more silly than watching your life be destroyed — the life you built — because of who you are, the person who created it, the person who could end up absolutely nowhere else? That's a question that will endure. —KE

A stunning debut that develops with the gradual poignancy of a Polaroid, Charlotte Wells' “Aftersun” isn't just an honest movie about the way that we remember the people we've lost — fragmented, elusive, nowhere and everywhere all at once — it's also a heart-stopping act of remembering unto itself. Here, in the span of an oblique but tender father-daughter story that feels small enough to fit on an instant photo (or squeeze into the LCD screen of an old camcorder), Wells creates a film that gradually echoes far beyond its frames. By the time it reaches fever pitch with the greatest Freddie Mercury needle drop this side of “Wayne's World,” “Aftersun” has begun to shudder with the crushing weight of all that we can't leave behind, and all that we may not have known to take with us in the first place.

When Sophie (remarkable newcomer Frankie Corio) thinks of her father, she thinks of the Turkish holiday they went on together in the late '90s. That was the trip when she turned 11, and Calum — played by “Normal People” breakout Paul Mescal, who makes an indelible leap into dad roles with tremendous poise and a triggering sense of parental mystery — turned 32. We get the impression that she may never have seen him again. Now they would be about the same age, which might be why adult Sophie feels compelled to rewatch the MiniDV footage that she and her father recorded on that vacation, eagerly scanning the standard-definition video in search of the clues that a child might have missed at the time. 

The eerily static home videos and the semi-imagined 35mm scenes that “Aftersun” wraps around them both suggest that Calum was struggling with a demon of one stripe or another, and that he was doing his best to hide that struggle from his daughter during their too-rare time together. Whatever the case, Wells denies us the details. Like Sophie, all we can do is sift for meaning amidst the rubble and hope to fill in the haunted spaces between the man she knew and the man she lost. 

“Aftersun” is able to follow its characters through the strobe light of lost time because Mescal and Corio make it so tempting for us to complete their performances for them — to bridge the gaps of Sophie's understanding with the same urgency that we might want to bridge our own. Few movies have ever ended with a more tempting invitation to do the impossible, but even fewer have found so much truth and tenderness in the futile act of trying. —DE

Holocaust cinema has so implicitly existed in the shadow of a single question that it would no longer seem worth asking if not for the fact that it's never been answered: How do you depict an atrocity? Is seeing necessary for believing, or are some things too unfathomable to adequately capture on camera? 

A Holocaust drama that's defined by its rigorous compartmentalization and steadfast refusal to show any hint of explicit violence, Jonathan Glazer's profoundly chilling “The Zone of Interest” stands out for how formally the film splits the difference between the two opposite modes of its solemn genre — a genre that may now be impossible to consider without it. No Holocaust movie has ever been more committed to illustrating the banality of evil, and that's because no Holocaust movie has ever been more hell-bent upon ignoring evil altogether. There is a literal concrete wall that separates Glazer's characters from the horrors next door (those characters being the commandant of Auschwitz and his family), and not once does his camera dare to peek over it for a better look.

The authorless quality of Glazer's images frees the characters within them from the emptiness of moral judgment. The evil on display is never the least bit in doubt, but its failure to recognize itself as such is only so able to take shape in the absence of its limiting obviousness. By the end, “The Zone of Interest” insists that all of history's most abominable moments have been permitted by people who didn't have to see them, and while the film's ultimate staying power has yet to be determined, its vision of normality is — as Hannah Arendt once described that phenomenon — “more terrifying than all the atrocities put together.” —DE

A leaf twirls through a pair of fingers. A deck of playing cards is bridged together in extreme close-up. A dry-cleaned suit hangs out the window of a parked car like it's waiting for its body to come back. A boy named Elwood studies his reflection in his grandmother's steaming iron, and later in the window display of the local Tallahassee electronic shop whose TVs are broadcasting a speech by Martin Luther King, Jr. The year is 1962, Jim Crow laws are still in full effect across the South, and young Elwood Curtis (Ethan Herisse) can't help but see himself in the world around him — he can't help but think he can change it. 

In the news, Elwood sees men shooting themselves into outer space. At home, Elwood sees his defiantly ebullient Nana (Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor) dance around the kitchen as if nothing here on Earth could take the song out of her step. At school, Elwood sees pencils stuck in the ceiling of his classroom, where his teacher has the students cross out the most damaging lies from their history textbooks, and encourages Elwood to attend a free college for high-achieving Black kids. While hitchhiking there on the kindness of strangers, Elwood sees the man behind the wheel begin to panic when a cop pulls them over. The car was stolen. “Look down,” the driver tells him, but Elwood doesn't. He needs to see this too. And that means we do as well, because in RaMell Ross' faithful but visionary adaptation of Colson Whitehead's “The Nickel Boys,” a novel about the bond that forms between two teenagers at a barbaric Florida reform school, the story is almost exclusively told through the eyes of its two lead characters. 

One still believes in America's potential. The other is convinced that our country is already — and has always been — fulfilling the original promise of its cruelty. Ross' formal approach (don't call it a “conceit”) quite literally forces us to see both of their perspectives, but the epic banality of his pointillism denies any trace of didacticism between them. Pure sense and subjectivity in a way that evokes the same visual magic of Ross' documentary work, “Nickel Boys” so viscerally and fundamentally centers the experience of its young Black characters that even the most racist brand of revisionist history could never hope to deny their truth. 

In its way, and in the context of a mainstream film that Amazon MGM Studios released into hundreds or thousands of theaters across the United States, Ross' aesthetic is as radical as Whitehead's reimagining of the Underground Railroad as an actual train line. It's also every inch as successful. Collaborating with the brilliant cinematographer Jomo Fray (“All Dirt Roads Taste of Salt”), who shares his prismatic attention to detail, Ross has devised an astoundingly effective way to express the relationship between how we see things and what we glean from them. The result is a rare testament to the transformative potential of cinematic adaptation (Ross co-wrote the script with Joslyn Barnes), and a staggeringly poignant reminder that America's most enduring narratives are only subject to change when people are invited to look at them in a different light. “Nickel Boys” extends that invitation to the world with an open hand. It's among the most extraordinary films of this young century. —DE

From the files of the Police Squad, “The Naked Gun” is back on August 1 in theaters everywhere — the rebooted Liam Neeson version that is. Paramount Pictures has released the theatrical trailer for the continuation of the series from which the similarly-named Leslie Nielsen mined box office gold. 

In the new film, Neeson plays Lt. Frank Drebin, Jr., son of Nielsen's Frank Drebin character. Along for the sure-to-be-wacky ride are Pamela Anderson, Paul Walter Hauser, CCH Pounder, Kevin Durand, Cody Rhodes, Liza Koshy, Eddie Yu, and Danny Huston. Written by Dan Gregor, Doug Maud, and Akiva Schaffer, the movie was directed by Schaffer and produced by Seth MacFarlane and Erica Huggins.

Neeson is not known for playing comedy — although Nielsen wasn't either prior to his straight-faced “Don't Call Me Shirley” turn in 1980's “Airplane!” Neeson told ComingSoon.com last year that he needed to prove his comedic chops.

“I'm slightly nervous of it. A little Stephen Colbert sketch or Ricky Gervais, I'm OK because it's short. But a whole film, we'll see. We'll see,” the action star said. In 2022, after it was announced the movie was in development, Neeson cracked, “It'll either finish my career or bring it in another direction. I honestly don't know.”

 










The last “Naked Gun” entry was released in 1994, just months before co-star O.J. Simpson's became embroiled in controversy after Simpson faced trial — something the first teaser trailer for the reboot cheekily referenced. The original trilogy was based off a failed ABC TV series titled “Police Squad,” also starring Nielsen.

Anderson makes her first big screen appearance since her much-heralded movie comeback “The Last Showgirl,” which netted her SAG and Golden Globes nominations. She told Seth Meyers in January that the “high comedy” of “The Naked Gun” was something she'd “always wanted to do.”

“And Liam is such a gentleman. He's such a sweetheart, such a love, and we just had a great connection. And Akiva is a wonderful director,” Anderson said. “But what a difference, going from an indie film to a Paramount ‘Naked Gun.'”

Anderson added that the “Saturday Night Live” crew was on the set, throwing out new jokes throughout the shoot. “Some were funny, some weren't, but some were — most of them were funny. Liam is hysterical. You're not going to see it coming. That's how good he is.”

“The Naked Gun” blasts into theaters on August 1. Check out the trailer below.

[Editor's note: The following article contains spoilers for Celine Song‘s “Materialists,” which is now in theaters.]

“Materialists” has all the goods: An Oscar-nominated auteur, a rom-com heartthrob, a “Fifty Shades of Grey” alum who happens to be Hollywood royalty, a viral babygirl of the internet who led a video game adaptation, and not one, but two MCU superheroes (well, three, if you don't count the Fox split). 

This, as Dakota Johnson‘s matchmaker Lucy would say, checks all the boxes of being a high concept hit. And yet, writer/director Celine Song subverts it all — and that's the point.

 










Song's sophomore feature “Materialists” isn't a takedown of the rom-com genre (although IndieWire's Kate Erbland makes a great case that it is). Rather, it's a hollowing out of the notion that all of the attributes and all of the statistics behind selling yourself on the dating market and selling a film to theatergoers, will lead to happiness, love, or audiences spending more at the box office.

 








Related Stories ‘The Naked Gun' Trailer: Liam Neeson Takes on Leslie Nielsen's Deadpan Legacy Andy Serkis Says ‘Animal Farm' Had to Be Animated: ‘You're Freed of Reality' 

Lucy (who will assuredly go down as one of Johnson's most iconic characters) tells us this herself onscreen: Being a matchmaker to the elite is like being something as practical as a mortician or as pragmatic as being an insurance claims adjuster. Being a filmmaker within modern Hollywood, especially at big studios where “art is made by committee,” as Johnson herself has often said, is no different. 




			Popular on IndieWire		






Non-independent films are made within an algorithm calculated to appeal to wide audiences; Lucy declares that if there is no wide appeal for a person, then they have to work in a “niche market.” The same can be said for movies today. Song, especially after her beloved feature directorial debut “Past Lives” thrust her into the festival circuit and awards machine, knows this. And Song is subverting this hard truth by way of wrapping the bow of the “shiny package” of the rom-com genre tight around audience throats.

The genre-bent marketing, thanks to A24's always-brilliant campaigns, wants people to think this film is akin to the latest Aline Brosh McKenna feature. A “leaked” list of cinematic references for the feature, which includes “Age of Innocence,” “Atonement,” “Phantom Thread,” “Emma.,” “Pride & Prejudice,” “Jerry Maguire,” and “Terms of Endearment,” reads like a Letterboxd top however many… and that's on purpose.

 










“Materialists” is not any of those films — not for lack of technique or loftiness or above and below the line talent, but rather for its tone. “Materialists” serves allusions to “Devil Wears Prada” (that opening montage), “You've Got Mail” (that needle drop), and yes, Jane Austen (which rom-com doesn't, to some degree?), but it's more Leslye Headland's “Bachelorette” than Robert Altman's “The Player” (also on that list).

“Materialists” isn't about love. It's about profit. It's about greed. It's about Lucy's — and in part, our own — inner monologue that nothing really matters in this facade of society — and Hollywood. “Materialists” takes a razor blade to the arm of cinema — and it's invigorating.

Just as “Past Lives” isn't a romance, “Materialists” is a comedy. And a very dark one at that. While Lucy is too busy telling both her “unicorn” perfect bachelor Harry (Pedro Pascal) and her struggling-actor ex John (Chris Evans) that neither of them actually really “want” her (the comedy is that, they do!), one of her clients, Sophie (Zoë Winters), has her life devastated by “romance” gone horribly wrong.

For Lucy, love is a game of numbers. For Sophie, it's hell. The contrast, and tonal shift in the moment in which the reveal of what has happened to Zoe is played, will probably shock audiences — not because it's unrealistic, but because it's too real. Reality doesn't belong in rom-coms; fairytales do. Good thing “Materialists” isn't a rom-com.

 










There is nothing funny about Sophie's assault and subsequent, rightful legal action against Lucy's matchmaking company. There is humor, however, in Lucy being surrounded by identical cheering women who are also in her sorority of peddling soulmates to the soulless as she is told the news. As Lucy's boss (Marin Ireland) reminds her, dating is a risk. Yet the only risk Lucy can fathom before this moment is the financial kind.

When Sophie (an absolutely brilliant Winters) later spits that Lucy is a “pimp,” we can't disagree. Lucy is. We all are. We are all complicit in the profiting off of pain and pleasure, especially in the Hollywood machine. It's a sad truth we already know and try to avoid confronting; Song is just singing it a little louder for us all to hear. “With this movie, I'm trying to do something different,” Song told IndieWire. “It's fun to play the game and objectify ourselves and each other. It's catty. But the end of that is going to be dehumanization.”

Is it dehumanizing or hilarious when Harry (Pascal) bends six inches lower to show his true height before his leg augmentation surgery? Is it cringe or funny when Lucy is told “no Black, no fatties” in all seriousness from a client as they name their demands for a mate? Are we supposed to be laughing when Lucy and John break up in front of the Times Square Applebees because he's too “poor”?

 










Song toys with broken hearts being as interchangeable as being literally financially broke. The ongoing discussion of dowries is part of Lucy's skewed perspective, and “Materialists” is told by her, through her. Instead of dating dealing solely in the currency of sex, it's about shelter, food, and yes, material goods.

Opening the film on cavepeople (another chuckle or WTF moment, depending on who you ask) reinforces that: Humans have always been shallow. Lucy and her clients are no different. It's easy to imagine “Materialists” set in a future where there are leaderboards with stock market asset evaluations for suitors (again, another real marketing technique by the studio). Or even today, when box office returns and lengths of standing ovations are still breathlessly reported every weekend.

“People are people are people are people,” Lucy says to her boss after complaining that all of her clients are acting like children. They are because she is, because we all are. Song has captured this circular cynicism with her subversive, pun-filled film. The only meaningful transaction here? Buying a ticket to go see it. 

An A24 release, “Materialists” is now in theaters.

Devo and the B-52's are hitting the road for a co-headline tour this autumn. Billed as a continuation of the farewell tours both bands announced earlier in the decade, the Cosmic De-Evolution Tour will take the bands from Toronto to Houston between late September and early November. Lene Lovich supports. Check out the itinerary below.

In a press release, several band members had something to say, starting with the B-52's' Fred Schneider: “In 2022, I swore I'd never get on a tour bus again,” he said. “But we were careful to say to our fans that we would still perform in special situations that don't require all of the awful tour travel. Our Vegas residency is going great, and when we were offered the chance to do a small run of shows with Devo, we all said this is an extraordinary opportunity we couldn't say no to.”

Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh said, “The B-52's had one of the best sounds of any of the bands out there in the late '70s early '80s—‘Rock Lobster' is one of my favorite songs—Devo used to sing it to Booji Boy after Devo shows. It was either fate or luck or the SNL anniversary that brought us all together to create this amazing chance to go out on tour. All I can say is Cosmic Devolution is REAL!”

Added the B-52's' Kate Pierson, “When we first came from Athens to New York City to perform, punk was in full force… and new wave was right on its tail! We loved all the new wave groups, including Patti Smith, Talking Heads, Blondie and the Ramones. We also really dug the far-out weirdness of Devo, which seemed very in tuned to our sensibilities. We remember one of our first shows—amazed that David Bowie, Brian Eno, Frank Zappa, Allen Ginsberg, Talking Heads, and Blondie all came to see us! When we opened the Mudd Club, we partied with Devo and really hit it off on the dance floor. Later, Brian Eno went onto to produce Devo's incredible first album… and now we will align again! So put on your wig hats and Devo bonnets and get ready to party! This is going to be wild.”

Said Cindy Wilson, “When both of our bands performed at the recent SNL 50 concert at Radio City, we started talking and agreed we had to do these shows. Believe or not, we've never done more than a festival or two together in all this time. This will be amazing and I can't wait for the B-52's to share these stages with Devo!”

And Devo's Gerry Casale added, “Devo and the B-52's on tour together! That it took almost 50 years to happen is rather mind-blowing. But better late than never. We each did something right in different ways that withstood the test of time. Now we're here to prove we can still ‘bring it' as they say!'

Jazz harpist Brandee Younger was gadding about herself when she discovered the word “gadabout” while on tour, traveling by day and reinventing compositions at shows with bassist-producer Rashaan Carter and drummer Allan Mednard by night. Dating to the early 19th century, the word describes one who goes from place to place in search of pleasure, prioritizing adventure and childlike delight. It was this relentless pursuit of professional and artistic satisfaction that inspired her newest record, Gadabout Season, a celebratory manifesto of self-adventure that blends New Age atmospheres with spiritual jazz spunk.

To be lauded as a successor to harp legends Dorothy Ashby and Alice Coltrane, as Younger has, is no easy feat; these women pushed the instrument into new territories, reframing how the harp can function in jazz ensembles and popular music at the height of the post-Bop era. Younger's previous albums were indebted to them, with Brand New Life, her most convincing, full of interpretations of Ashby's compositions. While Younger's inspirations remain undeniable on Gadabout Season—much of the album was recorded on Coltrane's instrument—the album seeks to put some separation between the harpists and allow Younger to come fully into a compositional voice of her own. She has writing credits on every track, as if seeking to establish her legacy alongside her idols.

Despite her expanded creative control as bandleader, Younger's ensemble takes fewer risks than on prior albums. Brand New Life was all about bringing Ashby's work into a contemporary context: “Livin' and Lovin' in My Own Way” featured boom-bap drums and record scratches for a unique blend of harp-driven hip-hop; “Dust,” with Meshell Ndegeocello, threaded Black diasporic music together, letting Younger's harp flourishes fill the space between the dubby Caribbean reggae drums and Ndegeocello's silky voice. Even if the hip-hop aspects felt slightly dated or the genre-blending a little heavy-handed, the question of what if Dorothy Ashby made these songs today? was weighty enough to propel Younger toward new frontiers with an instrument that hardly gets enough love in popular music.

Gadabout Season feels less ambitious in comparison, more concerned with meditative circularity than forward motion. Take the title track: It begins with a tasteful vamp, Younger's tinny plucks dancing around Carter's thick, inquisitive bassline. What seems like a perfect conduit for exploration is hindered by a rigid structure and brief runtime, leaving little room for unfamiliar ideas or virtuosic improvisation. Even the album's lulling melodies feel somehow rushed, as if the ensemble had hoped to use music to induce a trance state in the audience but hit a quota on track length. Though the way Younger's meticulous trills fade and reappear throughout the mellow “Reflection Eternal” is lovely, two minutes isn't nearly enough time to truly sink into the dreamy atmosphere.

Younger's dissection of the harp remains sharp as ever, showcasing immense variety through muted notes, staccato picks, and hefty block chords. Her light and airy style relies on these unexpected changes in soft, semi-transparent timbres that float around the other instruments. The tranquil restraint that flute heavyweight Shabaka Hutchings displays on “End Means” is perfectly aligned with Younger's laid-back, chiffon vision, though the straightforward melody lines stifle possibilities for interesting themes to materialize organically, the way they often do in Hutchings' rangey solo output. Gadabout Season has none of the unique genre interplay that made Younger's earlier work special, and little else to grasp onto other than satisfactory playing. Hutchings steals the show here, his notes stuttering and teetering at the edge of Younger's loose arpeggios as if his flute could set off a tornado.

“Breaking Point,” one of the faster tracks, features Younger's most exciting playing on the album. The intensity of Mednard's drumming pushes Younger out of her comfort zone, though his relatively light touch still allows her harp to hold sufficient ground. In the middle of the track, Younger's controlled glissandi erupt into turbulent strums, a level of dissonance she's rarely touched in the past. It's an unconventional approach to an instrument that's often described exclusively as angelic and beautiful. Moments like these are, unfortunately, few and far between. Younger's familiarity with her harp opens up many avenues, but Gadabout Season settles for following what's by now a familiar path: that of the skillful and charming contemporary spiritual jazz record content to linger in the background.

“Dream pop” has always been a slight misnomer. Elizabeth Fraser confronted new motherhood on Heaven or Las Vegas, Broadcast's Trish Keenan toed the line between this world and the next, Mazzy Star made a Magritte painting out of desire. Waking life was the concern in each case, and in each case the music obliged, warping to accommodate the surrealism of the everyday. To say “life itself is but a dream” is true in the most practical sense; light and color, the entire visual field, are simply what the brain hallucinates when photons ping your retina.

As New Zealand's Phoebe Rings expanded from the solo project of singer and keyboardist Crystal Choi to a proper four-piece, the nominal dream pop band quickly approached the outer orbit of that designation. For their debut album, Aseurai, guitarist Simeon Kavanagh-Vincent, bassist Benjamin Locke, and drummer Alex Freer may as well have come into the studio armed with mops and feather dusters; now the record's every surface glimmers and gleams. Together with Choi, they've taken the ingredients of Japanese city pop—disco, Brazilian jazz, ‘60s psychedelia—and layered them into airy trifles with stiff whipped peaks. “Aseurai means around you in the atmosphere, hard to reach, fading away,” Choi said of the album's Korean title in a press statement accompanying its release, and here the dream pop ethos persists. Phoebe Rings may have their heads in the clouds, but these songs render loss as tangible, even quotidian, and vividly true to life.

Inspired by the ‘90s K-ballad “샴푸의 요정 (Fairy of Shampoo),” Aseurai's opening and title track is the only one Choi opted to record in her mother tongue. The lyrics memorialize her grandmother, whose lingering spirit reappears in various guises—a blue butterfly, a shooting star—throughout the album: “May the falling light of faraway stars/Reach your fingertips and let you breathe.” Choi sings in Korean of “memories that bloom like the mist at dawn” and the band blooms in turn. Cinematic strings flirt with squelchy Moog synthesizers, and some impeccably arranged Bee Gees harmonies build up to a funky breakdown anchored by a classic Nile Rodgers riff. Dulcet and plainspoken, Choi's voice could get lost in the twinkly haze, but as with the Softies' Rose Melberg, that twee approachability is sugar for the pill of her nuanced and frequently shattering emotions.

While recording Aseurai, Phoebe Rings gathered once a week, every week, over the span of two years in what they came to call the “Sunday Sessions.” The band's individual performances are each pristinely rendered and in perfect lockstep with one another. Locke's dextrous, conversational bass playing on “Not a Necessity” and “Drifting,” earns the album its cheeky allusions to mirrorballs and “stains on suede.” “Static!”, his duet with Choi, is a wallflower's anthem (“I can walk alone with you,” goes the song's hook) and showcase for Choi's classically trained jazz piano chops. Locke's solo turn at the mic on “Get Up” is a rare leaden moment, his deadpan affect poorly suited for a call to “Just get up/Stop thinking where you should be/Let your body take the lead.” Even at its most danceable, Aseurai is foremost for anyone liable to show up with a book at the discothèque.

Unlike the finality of death, to give up on a relationship or personal aspiration is to never quite know when the mourning should begin. The stunning “Mandarin Tree” is Choi's elegy for a certain millennial dream of domesticity, a “house up the street” surrounded by pink and white cherry blossoms. Color is the constant point of return in her songwriting; on “Not a Necessity” she sings of “motions of blue” and “the splash of rain turning everything deep green,” while the weightless jazz waltz “Playground Song” floats suspended in a perpetual orange sunset. Every hue on Choi's celestial painter's palette is as saturated with feeling and rich with association as anything this side of “Cherry Colored Funk.” “I see memories in one star/And love in another/And loneliness,” reads a Korean poem by Yun Dong-ju that Choi has cited as an inspiration. Aseurai is nearly blinding with starlight, but choose any lyric, any note, and chances are it still shines on its own.

Genre:

Pop/R&B

Label:

Reviewed:

June 16, 2025

In the first moments of Maiya Blaney's new album A Room With a Door That Closes, a shivering, sped-up vocal sample threatens to fold in on itself entirely. “You're my world/And I'm living for you,” it confesses in an unsettling tone, like a demented radio transmission from some distant past. Then the New York-based singer-songwriter collapses the song into clattering breakbeats, sending it into a chaotic, uninhibited groove. Blaney continually pulls off this move on her serpentine, exceptional second album: combining discordant sounds into a tense emulsion until the mixture suddenly ruptures. A mood piece focusing on self-worth in love and life, it reveals Blaney as a perceptive, forward-thinking songwriter, impelling folk, electronic, and alt-rock through hairpin turns.

A Room With a Door That Closes finds Blaney changing direction. The earthy neo-soul and silky smooth production of her 2021 debut, 3, linger in a few of her new album's more languorous moments. But A Room With a Door That Closes also draws from the same mercurial, scuffed sounds as artists like Tirzah or Yves Tumor; here, Blaney casts a flickering light over a dark night of the soul, lifting every jagged rock along the way to see what's lurking beneath each turbulent emotion. “There are days I'm not alright/Is that okay with you?” she admits on “Could You,” voice dripping with melancholy over a gently rippling guitar. One of several of the album's quietly crushing ballads, it comes freighted with emotional weight: “I'll try to make it better,” she assures during the song's bridge, a promise that grows more insistent and more disillusioned with each climbing octave. On “Honey I,” Blaney conveys a similarly acute sense of loneliness across a delicately curving vocal melody, breakbeats, and electric guitar. It's a stunning moment of clarity amid the album's whirling storm.

Blaney has an all-consuming voice, whether dipped down to an intimate, close-mic'd whisper or blown out into an emphatic howl. Over a waterlogged piano on “Left,” she sounds despondent, slowly building toward the song's crescendo of squealing electric guitar solos that could have been pulled out of a forgotten '80s glam-rock gem. “Carmen Electra” is the album's brashest track, whose nervy grunge-rock sound captures a potent sense of angst. “I don't relate to fucking them anyway/I don't relate to, ‘I was just lonely,'” she screeches over blown-out feedback and thrashing drums, giving voice to anger as easily as the sadness she explicated earlier. “Fumbled,” meanwhile, invokes X-Ray Spex at their most electric. The song's perfectly bratty chorus (“They fumbled the bag!”), shouted over a revving synth, quickly turns into a jittery schoolyard taunt you can't help repeating right along with her.

Blaney's small but meaningful production choices gild the edges of her music in darkened, oxidized colors. The watery cello that circles her voice during “And,” the squall of feedback that rips open “‘Affirmatively' (Part II),” or the frenetic, synth-heavy outro on the atmospheric “IDR” give movement and cohesion to the album, uniting its disparate threads with a deft touch. On “Recognize Me” a full band backs her for a wobbly indie-rock track about wanting to reboot your life. “When spring hits/You won't even recognize me,” she sings as the arrangement quickly morphs toward its rafters-reaching bridge: “Don't want you to recognize me/Not after all this healing.” Like the best moments on A Room With a Door That Closes, the admission leaves you woozily off-balance. But in Blaney's capable hands, there's softness to the blow.

							By 

	Nikki McCann Ramirez



	President Donald Trump's family has launched yet another unscrupulous cash grab attempting to profit off the current president's name and public image: Trump Mobile, a wireless phone service. 


	If the crypto companies, branded bibles, social media platforms, colognes, sneakers, and other grifty products branded with the face of President Donald Trump weren't enough of an indication that the Trump family is attempting to milk the presidency for every cent they can, the announcement of Trump Mobile was timed specifically to coincide with “the 10-year anniversary of their father's launch of his historic presidential campaign,” according to a press release issued by the Trump Organization. 


	The Trump Organization is currently in the custody of President Trump's two eldest sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, whose familial ties to the president have led to a surely coincidental explosion of business under the second Trump presidency, one that tests every known ethics and anti-corruption law in the books. Trump Mobile is essentially another licensing deal, and features a disclaimer indicating that “Trump Mobile, its products and services are not designed, developed, manufactured, distributed or sold by The Trump Organization or any of their respective affiliates or principals. T1 Mobile LLC uses the ‘Trump' name and trademark pursuant to the terms of a limited license agreement which may be terminated or revoked according to its terms.”  

	











	Trump Mobile's initial launch features plenty of branding and special offers stacked with indirect references to President Trump without featuring an outright product endorsement by the commander in chief. 

	











	The company will sell a golden “T1” smartphone (set to launch in August) and “the 47 plan,” a cell service plan priced at $47.45 a month – a reference to Trump's two presidential terms. One could assume that the decision to reverse the term numbers out of the correct 45-47 order reflects the money-minded family's desire to ensure that the nod to their patriarch nets them an extra $1.98 from their customers every month. 


	So confident are the Trump's that the president's legions of supporters will fork over cash at any opportunity, that they didn't even bother with producing their own images, instead using shoddily edited stock photography to fill out their website.

	“Trump Mobile is going to revolutionize cell phones,” Eric Trump told Fox Business on Monday morning. 


	Given that the product is a licensing agreement covered in Trump branded gold-plating, it's unlikely that this new venture will produce any industry-wide revolutions, except hopefully eventually a stricter revision of the nation's anti-corruption laws.

	The sixth week of Sean Combs' sex trafficking and racketeering trial started with a dramatic moment Monday when the judge dismissed a juror whose credibility was contested after he gave inconsistent statements about where he lives.


	The juror, a 41-year-old corrections officer, initially said he lived in the Bronx but then casually mentioned to court staff during trial that he recently moved to New Jersey to live with his finacée and child. When the issue was brought to the court's attention, the man he said the move to New Jersey “may not be permanent” and that he still had a New York driver's license and received his mail in the Bronx.


	On Friday, U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian said he was concerned the man was “shading answers or trying to provide an explanation in an attempt to stay on the jury.” (According to CNN, the man said during jury selection that he was a fan of 1990s hip-hop but that he didn't know much about the case.)


	“There is nothing the juror can do at this point to put the genie back in the bottle and restore his credibility,” Subramanian said Monday as he issued his ruling.

	











	Combs sighed after the final decision on the juror, but his reaction was muted compared to last Friday, when he was visibly angry and writing notes to his legal team. On Monday, the defense contested another juror, though Subramanian said there was no connection between that juror and the one already dismissed.


	Combs' camp vigorously fought the juror's removal. On Friday, Combs' attorney Xavier Donaldson said it would be a “step backwards” to remove the Black man. In a letter to the court filed Sunday, the defense team said Combs wanted a mistrial if the juror was excused. The lawyers accused prosecutors of using seven of their nine peremptory strikes to remove Black jurors from the prospective panel before the final jury was selected. They argued that removing the seated juror over his residency issue five weeks after the trial started would be “discriminatory.”

	“The fairness of the trial depends in part on having jurors with backgrounds similar to Mr. Combs share their perspectives on the evidence with other jurors from diverse backgrounds during deliberations,” the 14-page letter, authored by Alexandra Shapiro, said. “Removing this particular juror will deprive Mr. Combs of that important perspective and it is no answer to simply say that there are other Black jurors, or other males, on the jury.”


	On Monday, Judge Subramanian said it would be “improper” to consider the race of the juror in making a decision to excuse the man. The judge said he took the weekend to consider the issue and that he was comfortable with his decision considering the alternate jurors were selected in a fair process agreed to by both sides.


	The alternate juror who replaced the dismissed man is a 57-year-old male who appears to be white and lives with his wife and kids in Westchester County, according to NBC News.


	Combs, 55, was arrested in September and has pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking, transportation to engage in prostitution and racketeering conspiracy. If convicted as charged, he could spend the rest of his life in prison.


	Combs' lawyers deny the billionaire music mogul was the head of a criminal enterprise designed to fulfill his sexual desires and protect his reputation. Instead, they've described Combs as a “swinger” who indulged his “kinky” proclivities with other his longtime girlfriends. Combs has acknowledged he kicked and dragged Casandra “Cassie” Ventura in the hallway of the InterContinental hotel in 2016, but he denies he coerced her or another ex-girlfriend into sex trafficking.

	Prosecutors, meanwhile, allege Combs use force, fraud or coercion to manipulate the women into drug-fueled, highly orchestrated sex marathons with male escorts that Combs directed and recorded. The encounters were known as “freak-offs,” “hotel nights” and “king nights,” according to testimony.


	Prosecutors say Combs and his co-conspirators kept the alleged enterprise going with crimes including physical assault, threats, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice.


	The first witness called when the trial resumed Monday was Ananya Sankar, a paralegal with the U.S. Attorney's Office. Sankar walked jurors through a lengthy chart showing texts and communications between Combs' former chief of staff, Kristina Khorram, and other staffers or even Combs himself.

	











	In the messages, extracted from seized devices, Khorram and others allegedly discussed prepping hotel rooms for freak-offs and dropping off supplies, including drugs and large sums of cash to pay male escorts. Khorram has been described as a “co-conspirator” but has not been called to testify. 


	In one exchange shown to jurors Monday, Combs' former assistant Ryan Lopez texted Khorram, “Lol think I saw one of the cowboys today. You can spot them in a lobby like an escort.” Khorram texted back with laughing face emojis. Prosecutors positioned the December 2019 exchange as clear evidence Khorram knew Combs used an escort service called Cowboys and Angels to hire paid male sex workers for his freak-offs with Ventura and his other ex-girlfriend, who previously testified under the pseudonym Jane.


	In another exchange, Khorram texted Combs on Nov. 14, 2021, that the “hotel called, Paul coming up.” Jane previously told jurors that Paul was the name of an escort they used for “hotel nights.” In a subsequent exchange on March 3, 2022, a travel assistant sent Khorram flight information for Paul.


	In a May 2, 2017 text, Ventura was clear with Khorram that Combs allegedly attacked her. “No one deserves being dragged by their hair,” Ventura wrote. In April 2018, Ventura texted Khorram, “I can't do the violent, scary, kick me out of my own house stuff anymore.”


	Jurors also saw photos dated December 2023 that showed a text exchange on another device. The pics, which would have been snapped a month after Ventura filed her bombshell sex trafficking and rape lawsuit against Combs, allegedly show Jane telling Combs she felt “extremely exploited, heartbroken and manipulated” by the music mogul.  


	Shortly after the photos were taken, Jane texted Khorram directly, jurors heard. “He just threatened me about my sex tapes that he has of me on two phones. He said that he would expose me and send them to my child's father,” Jane wrote.

	After Khorram was named as a co-defendant in multiple civil lawsuits, she released a statement in March.


	“For months, horrific accusations have been made about me in various lawsuits regarding my former boss,” she said. “These false allegations of my involvement are causing irreparable and incalculable damage to my reputation and the emotional well-being of myself and my family. I have never condoned or aided and abetted the sexual assault of anyone. Nor have I ever drugged anyone. The idea that I could be accused of playing a role in – or even being a bystander to – the rape of anyone is beyond upsetting, disturbing, and unthinkable. That is not who I am and my heart goes out to all victims of sexual assault. I am confident that the allegations against me will be proven to be untrue.”

I Know I Have Anger Issues'","https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/justin-bieber-broken-anger-issues-instagram-post-1235365317/","Mon, 16 Jun 2025 15:08:41 GMT","

Justin Bieber has been documenting what appears to be an intense period of self-reflection through a series of Instagram posts for more than three months. In his latest upload, the 31-year-old responded to the people who “keep telling me to heal,” writing: “Don't you think if I could have fixed myself I would have already? I know I'm broken. I know I have anger issues.”


	Bieber added: “I tried to do the work my whole life to be like the people who told me I needed to be fixed like them. And it just keeps making me more tired and more angry. The harder I try to grow, the more focussed on myself I am. Jesus is the only person who keeps me wanting to make my life about others. Because honestly I'm exhausted with thinking about myself lately aren't you?”


	Over the past few weeks, Bieber has found himself at the center of increasingly tense run-ins with paparazzi. Viral footage shows the musician pleading with the swarms of photographers around him, urging them to see him as a human being and respect his privacy. This weekend, one clip surfaced showing him telling paparazzi that he is “not afraid to set boundaries,” adding: “I don't know you. You don't go to people you don't know and say shit out of nowhere with a camera in their face. It doesn't matter if I'm a celebrity or not. It doesn't matter if I'm a public figure.”

	











	These interactions come as Bieber continues to open up online about struggles within his interpersonal relationships and internal battles stemming from fame. A recent Instagram post from the singer shared screenshots of a conversation with an unnamed person who told him, “I'm not used to someone lashing out at me. It's not that I don't see and feel your anger.” Bieber responded with a declaration that his friendship with this person “is officially over.”

	“I will never suppress my emotions for someone. Conflict is a part of relationship. If you don't like my anger you don't like me. My anger is a response to pain I have been thru. Asking a traumatized person not to be traumatized is simply mean,” he wrote in the messages. “I will never accept a man calling my anger lashing out. I enjoyed our short lived relationship. I wasn't kidding when I told u I didn't need u as a friend. I have good friends. Who will respect these boundaries.”

	Bieber's posts from earlier this year found him interrogating the weight of growing up in the public eye. “I was always told when I was a kid not to hate,” he wrote in March. “But it made me feel like I wasn't allowed to hate it and so I didn't tell anyone I've had it. Which made me feel like I have been drowning feeling unsafe to acknowledge it. I think we can only let hate go by first acknowledging it's there. How couldn't we feel hate from all of the hurt we have experienced?”


	Bieber recently split from his longtime manager Scooter Braun, who acknowledged that their relationship is “not the same that it was,” and other members of his team. Representatives for the singer have denied reports that the singer is in “alleged financial distress” and slammed public obsession over the singer's mental and physical health as being “exhausting and pitiful.”

	Two titans of New Wave, the B-52's and Devo, will team up this fall for the co-headlining Cosmic De-Evolution Tour.


	Although the B-52's embarked on a farewell tour three years ago — they've since confined themselves to a Las Vegas residency — the idea of joining the “Whip It” troupe on the road proved too enticing to ignore. The two bands recently linked up (alongside Fred Armisen) at the all-star SNL 50 concert and discussed the venture.


	“In 2022, I swore I'd never get on a tour bus again, but we were careful to say to our fans that we would still perform in special situations that don't require all of the awful tour travel,” the B-52's Fred Schneider said in a statement. “Our Vegas residency is going great, and when we were offered the chance to do a small run of shows with Devo, we all said this is an extraordinary opportunity we couldn't say no to.”


	The B-52's Cindy Wilson added, “When both of our bands performed at the recent SNL 50 concert at Radio City, we started talking and agreed we had to do these shows. Believe or not, we've never done more than a festival or two together in all this time. This will be amazing and I can't wait for The B-52s to share these stages with Devo!”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The 11-date Cosmic De-Evolution Tour kicks off September 24 in Toronto and runs through November 2 in Houston. Fellow New Waver Lene Lovich will serve as the trek's opening act before the two headliners take the stage. Tickets for the tour go on sale to the public on June 20 at Live Nation, with pre-sales beginning June 16.

	











	As both bands said in statements, the two acts have long shared a mutual admiration for each other's music.


	“The B-52s had one of the best sounds of any of the bands out there in the late seventies and early eighties – ‘Rock Lobster' is one of my favorite songs – Devo used to sing it to Booji Boy after Devo shows,” Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh said in a statement. “It was either fate or luck or the SNL anniversary that brought us all together to create this amazing chance to go out on tour. All I can say is Cosmic Devolution is REAL!”

	The B-52's Kate Pierson added, “When we first came from Athens to New York City to perform, punk was in full force…and New Wave was right on its tail! We loved all the New Wave groups, including Patti Smith, Talking Heads, Blondie and the Ramones. We also really dug the far-out weirdness of Devo, which seemed very in tuned to our sensibilities. We remember one of our first shows — amazed that David Bowie, Brian Eno, Frank Zappa, Allen Ginsberg, Talking Heads and Blondie all came to see us!  When we opened the Mudd Club, we partied with Devo and really hit it off on the dance floor. Later, Brian Eno went onto to produce Devo's incredible first album…and now we will align again! So put on your wig hats and Devo bonnets and get ready to party! This is going to be wild.”

	Vance Boelter, the man suspected of assassinating a Minnesota Democratic representative and her husband, was taken into custody Sunday after a two-day search.


	As The New York Times reports, Boelter surrendered to police officers after he was found in the woods near his home outside of Green Isle, Minnesota. Boelter was reportedly armed when police confronted him, but no force was used during the arrest. As of Monday morning, June 16, Boelter was being held at the Hennepin County Jail in downtown Minneapolis.


	Boelter was charged with two counts of second-degree murder for allegedly killing Democratic Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark in what Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said “appears to be a politically motivated assassination.” Boelter is also facing two counts of attempted second-degree murder for shooting and wounding Democratic State Senator John A. Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. (Boelter has yet to enter a plea in court.)


	Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said on social media that Boelter would also face first-degree murder charges, but those require a grand jury indictment first. The FBI and federal prosecutors are also discussing whether to bring federal charges against Boelter, too.

	Authorities said Boelter disguised himself as a police officer during the attacks, wearing a rubber mask and fake badge. Boelter allegedly attacked the Hoffmans first early Saturday morning, June 14, with their daughter calling the police about the shooting not long after 2 a.m. local time. 

	











	After learning that a politician was targeted, authorities sent officers to the nearby home of the Hortmans. Police said they arrived in time to see Boelter shoot Mark Hortman. They then exchanged gunfire with the suspect before he was able to flee. When officers entered the house, they found Melissa Hortman dead.

	Upon finding and searching Boelter's car, police recovered a stash of papers and a notebook that reportedly lists about 70 potential targets. These included numerous prominent Democratic politicians in Minnesota, including U.S. Senator Tina Smith and Representatives Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison, and Angie Craig. Other targets included politicians from neighboring states, civic and business leaders, and Planned Parenthood centers. Police also said some of the documents indicated that Boelter may have been planning to target the anti-Trump “No Kings” protests that took place on Saturday.


	Boelter and his wife, Jenny, appeared to run a private security company. They also appeared to lead a Christian nonprofit called Revoformation Ministries, as well as a company called Red Lion Group that claimed to create jobs for people in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A friend of Boelter's told the Times he voted for Donald Trump in the 2024 election and was particularly opposed to abortion.

	In April, Eric Dane revealed his amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) diagnosis. During a recent appearance on Good Morning America, the actor detailed the progression of the rare degenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. “My left side is functioning, my right side has completely stopped working,” Dane said. “I feel like maybe a couple more months and I won't have my left hand either. It's sobering.”


	Dane first began experiencing symptoms more than a year ago. He initially noticed that his right hand was weak, but contributed the change to other factors. “I didn't really think anything of it at the time,” he said. “I thought maybe I'd been texting too much or my hand was fatigued, but a few weeks later I noticed it got a little worse.” His first visit to a specialist to address the development kicked off a testing process that lasted nine months. 


	“I went and saw a hand specialist, who sent me to another hand specialist. I went and saw a neurologist and the neurologist sent me to another neurologist and said, ‘This is way above my pay grade,'” Dane said. Now, with only “one functioning arm,” the Euphoria actor is concerned that the disease might target his legs next.

	His worry mounted during a recent outing with his daughter during which he needed to be rescued from the water. “She dragged me back to the boat,” Dane said, recalling the moment when it became clear he didn't have enough energy to continue swimming. “I was like, breaking down in tears. I made sure she got back to the water with her friend and continued on with the snorkeling. I was just heartbroken.”

	











	Growing emotional, Dane also expressed concern about the possibility that he won't be able to continue watching his two teenage daughters grow up. “I'm angry because my father was taken from me when I was young, and now there's a very good chance I'm going to be taken from my girls when they're very young,” he said.

	ALS has not fully physically consumed Dane, but the reality of the condition, which does not yet have a cure, has taken root mentally. “I will never forget those three letters,” he said about how his life changed when his diagnosis was issued. “It's on me the second I wake up. It's not a dream.” Still, he is committed to persevering. The actor recently returned to the set of Euphoria and will appear in the Prime Video series Countdown, out June 25.


	“In my heart, I don't feel like this is the end for me,” Dane said. “I'm fighting as much as I can. There's so much about it that's out of my control.”

The search for alien life remains inconclusive, but sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) continue to stir public interest - often without verifiable evidence. Now, a former US Air Force pilot has shared what he calls his ""wildest experience"" involving two mysterious objects during his time in service.

Ryan Bodenheimer, who served with the elite Thunderbirds aerobatic team, recounted the sightings in a video on his YouTube channel. He said the stigma around UFO sightings among pilots has faded over the years.

In one incident, while returning from a training exercise near the highly classified Area 51, Bodenheimer claimed an object zipped past his jet at 400 knots (approximately 740 km/h) at 30,000 feet. He described it as ""a silver, unpainted, shiny, reflective"" craft shaped like a 3D triangle with wing-like structures underneath and a vertical tail.

""It looked like a futuristic fighter jet - too advanced, almost machine-welded,"" he said, adding that neither he nor his superiors picked up anything on radar.

The second incident, he said, occurred at a similar altitude when a rectangular object slowly approached from the front left. ""Its edges were so bright they were pulsing,"" he said. ""The centre was clear and slightly coloured.""

Bodenheimer reported the sighting to Air Traffic Control, though no radar confirmation followed.



According to the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), there were 757 new UFO reports between May 2023 and June 2024. Most occurred in controlled airspace, with no underwater sightings.

Roughly 300 cases have been explained, while the rest remain unresolved.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}","other"

Rushall, Norfolk: It's not an uncommon insect to find in your trap, but its design – and place in the world – is worthy of close consideration

As I sat with my friend at dusk in his garden, it came to me as a revelation. Perhaps he'd like to see who lived here once we've closed the door and gone to bed? So, I set my moth trap, which happened to be in the car and, post-breakfast, we went to meet the locals.

I've long likened opening every moth trap to Christmas morning: a moment when you have no idea what joy will be there. Nowadays there is as much fulfilment in seeing first responses from friends as there is in the magic of the insects themselves. I was engrossed by a lozenge of sunlit straw called a delicate (Mythimna vitellina), which is a scarce migrant from continental Europe. How extraordinary, I thought, that it may have been in Belgium or Holland the week before. It's a journey that vastly expands our idea of what an insect might be.

My friend, however, was more taken with an everyday miracle: the poplar hawk-moth, which is expected in most springtime moth traps. Yet every one is a thing of wonder, with hindwings that look like burgundy-splashed scimitars and a body shaped like a grey-furred corrugated banana. It is, in truth, more extraterrestrial than earthling, and most moth novices respond accordingly.

I logged 34 macro-moth species, which is a fraction of our 880 British list and nothing compared with the wider community of 1,400 micro-moths. The latter are often no more than 5mm in size (and far less inspiring to our gross human senses), but in total our entire moth fauna is at the heart of most British landscapes.

Their four-stage life cycle – egg, caterpillar, pupa, imago – also means that moths are perfect to convey the idea that nature is essentially a fabric of complex interrelationships. The living world cannot be understood only as a collection of separate “things” – birds, plants, moths and so on; it is an indivisible whole.

So, a few days later at the South Downs food and nature festival at Westerlands, West Sussex, my moth trap was a perfect prop to celebrate the 14 bat species living at this nature-friendly farm. Think of bats, I suggested, as little more than moths further along the living web.

The Red Sox, somehow, had the best and worst weekend at the same time.

While Boston swept the rival Yankees, it was moments after Sunday's matinee game that the joy was ripped away when it was shockingly announced the Red Sox had traded star Rafael Devers to the Giants.

Red Sox fans were not prepared for this rollercoaster of emotions and lambasted the franchise for being  cheap once again.

“Baseball is Dead” podcast host Jared Carrabis took to X to air his feelings about the deal.

“How the f–k do you trade Rafael Devers?” Carrabis said. “For A: That return and B: the moment in which you did it.”

Ringer founder Bill Simmons presented a theory on X about a possible reason for the trade.

The owner of the Red Sox, John Henry, also owns the Premier League-winning soccer team Liverpool.

Simmons hinted on X that the possible motive behind the trade was to help finance the newest transfer to Liverpool, Florian Wirtz. Liverpool reportedly paid his former club $100 million for the midfielder.

Devers is in the third season of a 10-year, $313 million contract and had been at odds with the team this spring training, after he was moved from third base to DH for the newly signed Alex Bregman.

It is not the first time ownership has traded one of its star players, much to the frustration of its fan base.

Mookie Betts was traded to the Dodgers before the 2020 season for three players who did not pan out. 

Betts was in the final year of his contract and would sign a 12-year, $365 million deal with Los Angeles — and he has since helped the franchise win two World Series.

“I woke up still mad [about] the Devers trade,” Barstool founder Dave Portnoy wrote on X. “If you are trying to win you just don't trade your best hitter for nothing in the middle of the season. John Henry and (minority owner) LeBron [James] have turned the Red Sox into the Oakland A's with fancy hubcaps.”

It seems like history has repeated itself yet again in Boston. Hopefully, this time, it will work out better.

The British VarEVolt battery has been granted the certification needed so it can be manufactured on a large scale, meaning more EV makers can use them in their cars.

A British firm has received approval to mass-produce an ultra-high-power-density electric vehicle (EV) battery that can be fully recharged in just 18 seconds.

The RML Group was granted Conformity of Production certification for its VarEVolt battery on June 2. This government approval signifies that the firm can mass-produce the powerful batteries for EV manufacturers.

The certification ""underlines our readiness to move from prototyping and niche volumes to supporting larger production contracts,"" James Arkell, the head of powertrain at RML Group, said in a statement.

RML's battery can deliver lots of power in a short span. The VarEVolt battery can supply 6 kilowatts per kilogram, and it's capable of ""dumping all its power really, really quickly,"" RML board member Michael Mallock told Autocar. The battery has a C rating of 200, meaning it's capable of fully charging or discharging in about 18 seconds.

In comparison, the fully electric Porsche Taycan's battery has a C rating of around 4 to 5, so it takes 12 to 15 minutes to charge or discharge.

The VarEVolt's modular design lets manufacturers tune it for different applications. ""We can focus on range, we can focus on power, or we can balance the two,"" depending on the type of vehicle it will be deployed in, RML Group CEO Paul Dickinson told Autocar.

Some small-scale manufacturers are already using the VarEVolt battery; it helps power the futuristic Czinger 21C hybrid hypercar, which relies on a combination of an electric motor that uses energy stored in the battery and an internal combustion engine that burns gasoline.

—'Springy' solid-state battery is twice the width of a white blood cell and could drastically increase EV range

—Honda promises solid-state batteries that could double EV range to 620 miles by 2030

Right now, the RML group is producing just a few of the VarEVolt batteries at a time, but future large-scale output wouldn't necessarily be confined to exclusive products like the 21C. (Czinger produced just 80 of the luxury sports cars in the first run.)

The firm is developing a kit to convert the battery packs in older hypercars, such as the LaFerrari or the McLaren P1, to updated versions, according to Mallock.

""For those types of cars, we can do a replacement pack that will significantly increase the range, and if the rest of the hardware within the car would allow it, you could have a version that was eight times the power output,"" Mallock told Autocar.

Look at any world map and you'll see that the Pacific is the largest ocean. But how did it get so big?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The Pacific Ocean is by far the world's largest ocean, more than five times wider than our moon. But why is the Pacific so big?

Covering about 63 million square miles (163 million square kilometers) — more than 30% of Earth's surface — all of the world's continents could fit inside the Pacific basin, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The Pacific, which holds more than half of the free water on Earth, is also our planet's deepest water body, extending to a depth of more than 36,000 feet (11,000 meters) at Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, NOAA noted.

The predecessor of the Pacific Ocean was Panthalassa, or the Panthalassic Ocean, which was once Earth's only ocean. This world-spanning superocean existed when all of Earth's continental land was united in the supercontinent Pangaea.

""Panthalassa was the proto-Pacific,"" Susanne Neuer, founding director of the School of Ocean Futures at Arizona State University in Tempe, told Live Science. ""The Pacific is essentially what remains of Panthalassa.""

Oceans and continents past and present rest on top of tectonic plates, the giant slabs of rock that make up Earth's rigid outer shell. These plates are regularly on the move, sometimes colliding into each other, sometimes pulling apart from one another. About 230 million years ago, such motions led Pangaea to start breaking up.

""What became North America and Eurasia began to pull apart from what became South America and Africa and Antarctica and Australia,"" Adriane Lam, an assistant professor of Earth sciences at Binghamton University in New York, told Live Science.

Related: Do the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean mix?

Eventually, Pangaea split apart. In the gap that emerged between the continents, the Atlantic Ocean was born. ""The Atlantic is growing about two to three centimeters each year, or about an inch,"" Neuer said. ""That doesn't sound like much, but when you multiply that by millions of years, it's a lot.""



As the continents making up Pangaea were pushed apart, Panthalassa shrunk. At the ""subduction zones"" where these continental plates slid over Panthalassa's oceanic plates, the ""Ring of Fire"" emerged, a zone infamous for volcanoes and earthquakes surrounding what is now the Pacific Ocean, Neuer explained.

A 2016 study in the journal Science Advances revealed that about 200 million years ago, the Pacific Plate, the tectonic plate that now underlies the Pacific Ocean, was born at the junction of three tectonic plates under Panthalassa, dubbed Farallon, Phoenix and Izanagi.

""The most modern analogy with what happened with the Pacific can be found today with the Afar triple junction in East Africa, where you have three plates meeting together — the Nubian, Somali and Arabian,"" Lam said. ""But at the Afar triple junction, those plates ultimately failed to pull apart. With the Pacific triple junction, those three plates succeeded, forming the Pacific Plate.""

—What are the deepest spots in Earth's oceans?

—Is Africa splitting into two continents?

—Which is the largest continent? The smallest?

As the Pacific Plate expanded, it displaced these three older plates. The Izanagi Plate was pushed under Asia. Nearly all of the Farallon Plate was driven beneath North America, although remnants of it remain off North America's west coast. And ""the Phoenix Plate is nothing but a small piece between the southern tip of South America and the Antarctic Peninsula, the area of ocean called the Drake Passage,"" Lam said.

Although the Pacific is currently the world's largest ocean, ""it's getting smaller"" as the Atlantic gets bigger, Lam noted. However, at 41 million square miles (106 million square kilometers), the Atlantic is still much smaller than the Pacific. And a 2024 modeling study predicts that the Atlantic will start shrinking in about 20 million years.

For Lam, the Pacific Ocean is one of a kind, she said, noting its size, geological history and geological complexity. ""The Pacific is the most amazing ocean basin of all.""

The ETF market has hit a symbolic turning point: active funds now outnumber passive ones for the first time, marking a sharp break from the industry's index-tracking origins — even if actively managed assets still account for just a tenth of assets.

Roughly 51% of the nearly 4,300 US-listed exchange-traded funds are ones overseen by fund managers who have more discretion to pick stocks or other securities, eclipsing index-following products for the first time, Bloomberg Intelligence data show. The number of active ETFs has more than doubled in the past five years, from just 23% in 2020. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

An Israeli strike hit Iran's state broadcaster on Monday as Iran called on U.S. President Donald Trump to force a ceasefire in the four-day-old aerial war, while Israel's Prime Minister said his country was on the “path to victory.”

Israeli forces stepped up their bombardment of Iranian cities, while Iran proved capable of piercing Israeli air defences with one of its most successful volleys yet of retaliatory missile strikes.

“If President Trump is genuine about diplomacy and interested in stopping this war, next steps are consequential,” Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on X.

“Israel must halt its aggression, and absent a total cessation of military aggression against us, our responses will continue. It takes one phone call from Washington to muzzle someone like Netanyahu. That may pave the way for a return to diplomacy.”

Sources told Reuters that Tehran had asked Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Oman to press Trump to use his influence on Israel to push for an immediate ceasefire. In return, Iran would show flexibility in nuclear negotiations, said the two Iranian and three regional sources.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told troops at an air base that Israel was on its way to achieving its two main aims: wiping out Iran's nuclear program and destroying its missiles.

“We are on the path to victory,” he said. “We are telling the citizens of Tehran: ‘Evacuate' – and we are taking action.”

Late on Monday, Israel said it had hit Iran's broadcasting authority, and footage showed a newsreader hurrying from her seat as a blast struck. Iran's State News Agency also reported the strike.

Israel's Defence Minister said Israel had attacked the broadcaster after the evacuation of local residents.

Meanwhile, Iranian state media reported that Iran was preparing for the “largest and most intense missile attack” yet against Israel. 

Israel launched its air war on Friday with a surprise attack that killed nearly the entire top echelon of Iran's military commanders and its leading nuclear scientists. It says it now has control of Iranian airspace and intends to escalate the campaign in coming days.

Tehran's retaliation is the first time in decades of shadow war and proxy conflict that missiles fired from Iran have pierced Israeli defences in significant numbers and killed Israelis in their homes.

A timeline of the Israel-Iran conflict and tensions between the two countries

Iran says more than 224 Iranians have been killed, most of them civilians. Media published images of wounded children, women, and the elderly from cities across the country.

State TV broadcast scenes of collapsed presidential buildings, burned-out cars, and shattered streets in Tehran. Many residents were trying to flee the capital, describing queues for petrol and bank machines that were out of cash.

“I am desperate. My two children are scared and cannot sleep at night because of the sound of air defence and attacks, explosions. But we have nowhere to go. We hid under our dining table,” Gholamreza Mohammadi, 48, a civil servant, told Reuters by phone from Tehran.

In Israel, 24 people have been killed so far in Iran's missile attacks, all of them civilians. Round-the-clock television images showed rescuers working in ruins of flattened homes.

“It's terrifying because it's so unknown,” said Guydo Tetelbaum, 31, a chef in Tel Aviv who was in his apartment when the alerts came in shortly after 4 a.m. (9 p.m. ET). He tried to reach a shelter but his door was blown in.

Trump has consistently said the Israeli assault could end quickly if Iran agrees to U.S. demands that it accept strict curbs to its nuclear program.

Talks between the United States and Iran, hosted by Oman, had been scheduled for Sunday but were scrapped, with Tehran saying it could not negotiate while under attack.

On Monday, Iranian lawmakers floated the idea of quitting the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, a move bound to be seen as a setback for any negotiations.

Before dawn on Monday, Iranian missiles struck Tel Aviv and Haifa, killing at least eight people and destroying homes. Israeli authorities said seven of the missiles fired overnight had landed in Israel. At least 100 people were wounded.

Iran's Revolutionary Guards said the latest attack employed a new method that caused Israel's multi-layered defence systems to target each other so missiles could get through.

“The arrogant dictator of Tehran has become a cowardly murderer who targets the civilian home front in Israel to deter the IDF,” Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said.

“The residents of Tehran will pay the price, and soon.”

Global oil prices shot up on Friday at the prospect of conflict disrupting supplies from the Gulf. Prices eased on Monday, suggesting traders think exports could be spared despite Israeli attacks that hit domestic Iranian oil and gas targets.

The sudden killing of so many Iranian military commanders and the apparent loss of control of airspace could prove to be the biggest test of the stability of Iran's system of clerical rule since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

Iran fired a new wave of missile attacks on Israel early Monday, killing at least eight people, while Israel said it had gained 'aerial superiority' over Iran's capital.

The Associated Press

Iran's network of regional allies who could once have been expected to rain rockets on Israel – Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon – have been decimated by Israeli forces since the start of the Gaza war.

Netanyahu has said that, while toppling the Iranian government is not Israel's primary aim, it believes that could be the outcome.

Iran's currency has lost at least 10 per cent of its value against the U.S. dollar since the start of Israel's attack.
