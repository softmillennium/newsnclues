                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>JPMorgan Chase is making fresh moves in the digital asset space with a newly filed trademark for “JPMD”, according to a June 15 submission to the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The application, submitted by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., covers a broad spectrum of digital asset and blockchain-related services, including digital currency issuance, electronic payment processing, and financial custody services, and it may signal the bank's next evolution in stablecoin offerings. This isn't JPMorgan's first foray into blockchain-based finance. The bank already operates JPM Coin, a dollar-backed stablecoin used to facilitate instantaneous payments between institutional clients. The token operates on the Quorum blockchain, a private blockchain network developed by JPMorgan based on Ethereum technology. The move comes as JPMorgan Chase and other US banking giants are reportedly considering a collaborative stablecoin project through their jointly owned entities, Early Warning Services and The Clearing House. The initiative aims to compete with the rapid growth of digital asset platforms. The project's progress depends on regulatory acceptance and market demand, influenced by ongoing legislative developments such as the GENIUS Act, which is heading to a final vote this week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cantor initiated coverage of the three largest solana SOL$157.79 treasury companies DeFi Development (DFDV), Upexi (UPXI) and Sol Strategies (HODL) with an overweight rating, the Wall Street firm said in a research report Monday. The broker has a $45 price target for DeFi Development, a C$54 objective for Sol Strategies, and a $16 price target for Upexi. "We believe SOL treasury companies are betting the future of finance will be on-chain and that the chain of choice will be Solana," analysts led by Thomas Shinske wrote. Solana's biggest competitor is the Ethereum blockchain, Cantor noted, but its technology is meaningfully better than its larger peer on every metric. "Developer growth on SOL has far exceeded that on ETH recently, and we expect this to continue," the authors wrote. Therefore, using solana as a treasury asset makes more sense than using ether ETH$2,667.79, the report said. The report added that companies that have adopted solana as a treasury asset believe that the crypto can overtake ether, which currently has a market cap 2.5 times larger than SOL.

He owns more than $1,000 of SOL.</p>

On June 16, 2025, the UK Information Commissioner's Office (the “ICO”) published its draft guidance on Internet of Things (“IOT”) products and services (the “Guidance”).  Through the Guidance, the ICO aims to provide clarity to manufacturers and developers of smart products, such as smart speakers and Wi-Fi fridges, to ensure they create products that comply with data protection law. The Guidance covers key areas such as:

The ICO's intention behind the Guidance is to empower organizations to consider responsible use of information and compliance with data protection laws. However, the ICO has warned manufacturers and developers that it is “closely monitoring compliance” and will be “ready to act” where it believes “corners are being cut or personal information is being collected recklessly.”

The ICO has asked for manufacturers, developers and the wider tech industry to share their views on the draft Guidance, which will be open for consultation until September 7, 2025.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump Media & Technology Group wants to launch an exchange-traded fund to invest in the two biggest cryptocurrencies. Donald Trump's media company filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission seeking approval of a new bitcoin and ether ETF on Monday, with the fund aiming to invest 75% of its assets in bitcoin and 25% in ethereum. Trump Media has already partnered with Crypto.com in a deal that offers retail investors access to crypto investments on Truth Social, Trump's social media platform. In May, Trump Media announced it would raise $2.5 billion to create a "Bitcoin treasury," which the firm said was to "expand its reach throughout the America First economy." "We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets," Devin Nunes, the CEO of Trump Media, said in a statement at the time. Meanwhile, World Liberty Financial, a digital assets firm backed by Trump and his sons, issued a new dollar-backed stablecoin earlier this year dubbed USD1. The flurry of crypto maneuvers has solidified a reputation Trump was aiming to cultivate while he campaigned for president. He secured the support of crypto investors on the campaign trail with promises of more favorable regulation and the creation of a national bitcoin stockpile. He's even dabbled in meme coins. In the days leading up to his inauguration, the president released a $TRUMP meme coin and promoted the crypto on his Truth Social account.</p>

The Community Day was ‘open to residents interested in learning about or exploring a career in the digital finance sector', the government explained, adding that while a technical background was not required, ‘applicants should, however, possess a willingness to learn, explore new career opportunities, and actively engage with leaders in Bermuda's expanding digital asset sector.' Penrose Partners said that Coinbase and Circle, as event sponsors, had ‘helped onboard 250 Bermudians' during the Community Day. ‘The initiative showcased Bermuda as a live testbed for inclusive, secure and accessible digital finance, demonstrating how stablecoins can integrate into everyday commerce,' the company said. RELATED ARTICLE(S) Bermuda Monetary Authority chief fintech officer Moah Fahmi spoke at Global Government Fintech Lab 2024 and 2023 panel sessions (click the links for our session reports) Burt took part in a fireside chat with Circle president Heath Tarbert during the event. Through events like this, the partnerships have onboarded our residents and local businesses into digital wallets so that they can accept and transact in digital dollars,” Burt said, according to a government press release published during the event (7 May). Burt also noted that the Economic Development Department, in partnership with the Bermuda Economic Development Corporation (BEDC), has been running annual fintech training programmes to build local capacity. “These programmes ensure that not only our students but also our working professionals in the industry are equipped with what they need to evolve and take on new digital finance opportunities coming to Bermuda,” he said. The stablecoin airdrop gained further airtime one week later during a fireside chat at a cryptoaassets conference, ‘Consensus 2025', held in the Canadian city of Toronto. This session saw Burt speaking to John Darsie, a partner at US-headquartered asset management firm SkyBridge Capital, about the Bermuda Digital Finance Forum and government authorities' strategies to support innovative financial technology companies. Eight digital asset business licences were issued in Bermuda during 2024, bringing the total number of licensed entities on Bermuda's register to 53 (comprising 39 digital asset companies and 14 innovative insurer general businesses), according a government press release about Burt's Consensus 2025 appearance. “It is our hope that this growing momentum encourages other digital finance businesses to consider Bermuda as their jurisdiction of choice, where our advanced regulations provide a foundation for business growth,” Burt said.</p>

Even so, just today, Trump Media and Technology Group has furnished additional details on its upcoming crypto ETF, and Trump Mobile, a venture between Don Jr. and Eric Trump, has started accepting pre-orders for an upcoming smartphone. To wit, Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent entity of the Truth Social platform and a host of ancillary offerings, has now filed a registration statement with the SEC for its Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, which will hold the two cryptocurrencies in a 75:25 ratio, respectively. This follows a similar registration statement that Trump Media and Technology Group had filed with NYSE Arca in early June for its Truth Social Bitcoin ETF. Recently, Trump Media also managed to raise $2.3 billion - via 29 million shares of underlying convertible notes and an equity offering consisting of 56 million common shares - for a dedicated Bitcoin Treasury. However, he has transferred the custody of his gigantic stake to a trust headed by Donald Trump Junior. Trump Mobile's 47 plan, available for $47.45 per month, offers: As for the T1 Mobile, it is expected to go on sale in August, and feature "a sleek, gold smartphone engineered for performance and proudly designed and built in the United States for customers."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is one of the most undervalued financial stocks to buy, according to analysts. While operating in the Ethereum and Solana blockchain, PayPal will expand to the stellar network to explore new areas like payment financing. The expansion should allow small and medium-sized businesses that face delayed receivables or pre-funding requirements to access new sources of real-time working capital. By expanding its stablecoin into the Stellar Network, PayPal plans to leverage its high speed, low transaction costs, and ease of integration to enhance the utility of real-world payments commerce and microfinancing. The expansion will also offer PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) stablecoin holders access to a vast network of on and off-ramps. They will also enjoy access to digital wallets and connection to payment systems and vast payment networks. The stablecoin on the stellar network should also enhance liquidity and financing opportunities through payment financing. While we acknowledge the potential of PYPL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

FRANKLIN, NJ / ACCESS Newswire / June 16, 2025 / Silver Scott Mines, Inc. (OTC PINK:SILS), a diversified digital technology company focused on healthcare, blockchain, and real-world asset tokenization, proudly announces that its healthcare division, Silver Scott Health, Inc., has launched the Health Trust NFT , a groundbreaking blockchain-based solution designed to empower patients with full control over their medical and genetic data. This innovative platform directly addresses growing privacy concerns sparked by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' reported $600 million bid to acquire 23andMe's genetic data assets, highlighting the risks of corporate exploitation of sensitive personal information without explicit patient consent. The Health Trust NFT leverages Silver Scott Health's proprietary TrustNFT.io blockchain technology to create a secure, decentralized ecosystem where patients own and manage access to their medical records, including genetic data, through non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Unlike traditional systems where institutions control and monetize patient data, the Health Trust NFT ensures that individuals decide who accesses their information, when, and for what purpose-putting privacy and consent back in the hands of patients. "Regeneron's bid for 23andMe's data underscores a critical issue: the unauthorized use of personal genetic information for corporate gain," said Stuart Fine, CEO of Silver Scott Mines, Inc. "With the Health Trust NFT, Silver Scott Health is redefining the healthcare landscape by giving patients unprecedented control over their data. Patient-Controlled Access : Patients use their Health Trust NFT to grant or revoke access to their medical and genetic data instantly, ensuring no institution or corporation can use it without explicit permission. HIPAA-Compliant Security : Built on a private blockchain with advanced encryption, the platform ensures compliance with HIPAA regulations while providing tamper-resistant data storage. Permissioned Data Sharing : Patients can selectively share specific data with healthcare providers, researchers, or other parties, fostering transparency and trust. The launch comes at a pivotal moment, as public scrutiny intensifies over 23andMe's data privacy practices following a 2023 data breach and subsequent bankruptcy proceedings. The platform is currently in beta, with early access available at TrustNFT.io. "Silver Scott Health is committed to transforming healthcare into a system that prioritizes patient autonomy and trust," said a spokesperson for the division. Silver Scott Mines, Inc. (OTC PINK: SILS) is a forward-focused company driving innovation across healthcare, blockchain, and real-world asset tokenization. Through its Silver Scott Health, Inc. division, the company is pioneering AI- and blockchain-powered solutions to modernize healthcare delivery, enhance data security, and empower patients. Silver Scott Health, Inc., a division of Silver Scott Mines, Inc., is dedicated to revolutionizing digital healthcare through cutting-edge AI and blockchain technologies. With initiatives like the Health Trust NFT and Affordable Telehealth Plan, the division aims to improve accessibility, security, and patient outcomes nationwide.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The European Central Bank (ECB) is boosting its efforts to introduce the digital euro, a central bank digital currency (CBDC) designed to improve Europe's financial sovereignty. For users who are concerned about centralized risks, anonymous crypto wallets will be indispensable as adoption of digital currencies grows. Such solutions, like Best Wallet, offer a freedom-first alternative that puts you in control of your privacy and digital assets. The digital euro is being developed with an ambitious goal in mind: to boost Europe's independence from foreign payment giants (Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal). Europe is fighting back with the digital euro, as part of its ploy to safeguard its economic future and minimize dependency on external forces. Still the CBDC isn't without its challenges: privacy concerns, security risks, and system integration woes. This is why Best Wallet and other similar emerging solutions have become increasingly popular. In the face of privacy and centralization concerns, Best Wallet provides a decentralized solution that allows you to manage your digital assets securely and independently. It offers a compelling alternative to centralized systems (like the forthcoming digital euro), as it gives you complete control over your digital assets. The app already offers direct support for top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ($BTC) and Ethereum ($ETH), as well as pegged coins like Tether ($USDT), making it a good option for users interested in the biggest crypto assets today. It will soon be expanding its support to over 1,000 cryptocurrencies and 60 blockchain networks, allowing you to seamlessly manage, buy, and swap a wide range of digital assets securely – all in one place. The app's proprietary cryptocurrency, $BEST, also brings many in-app perks. Having a say in the project's future trajectory is a major boon, as you can vote on key developments, such as which new cryptocurrencies, blockchains, or features should be added. Here, you can explore the best crypto presales directly within the mobile app and invest in tokens at their lowest-ever prices before they attract mainstream demand. As the digital euro moves closer to reality, it's clear that Europe is taking proactive measures to reshape its financial landscape amid heightened geopolitical instability. Thankfully, Best Wallet offers a decentralized solution that puts you in control of your digital assets – free from government oversight and centralization risks. Partly driven by new app developments, the token could hit $0.072 this year, making now a prime time to buy for potential 185%+ returns. Do your research before investing in $BEST or other crypto assets. Crypto is highly volatile, and prices can fluctuate rapidly based on market sentiment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crypto market's appetite for risk assets returned with force on Monday, with altcoins including Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) surging as traders rotated out of Bitcoin (BTC) following its successful test of the $106,000 level. Ethereum "came back into favour after 2.5 years of underperformance" following recent network upgrades, with the narrative shifting toward institutional adoption on Ethereum-based platforms, Sygnum analysts told Decrypt. The token has overtaken Dogecoin (DOGE)  to become the fifth-largest crypto by futures open interest, with traders placing $2.06 billion in active bets on HYPE contracts, per CoinGlass data. Vadim Taszycki, Head of Growth at StealthEX, told Decrypt institutional interest was a primary driver, noting that "nearly $1.9 billion has flowed into crypto funds" over recent days, according to Farside Investors data. He also pointed to regulatory momentum, mentioning "the wave of updated SEC filings from major asset managers aiming to launch spot Solana ETFs with staking capabilities" as evidence of shifting sentiment. The latest gains come despite last Friday's sharp selloff triggered by Israeli airstrikes on Iranian targets, which sent Bitcoin tumbling 4% below $104,000. “As Bitcoin's positive demand trends continue, driven by the steady progress in institutional adoption and its increased use as a safe haven asset, Bitcoin's fast-shrinking liquid supply is creating the conditions for demand shocks and upside volatility,” Sygnum analysts pointed out. Marcin Kazmierczak, Co-founder & COO at RedStone, told Decrypt the recent altcoin rally is "being driven by Bitcoin's push past $100,000, with BTC dominance at 61.4%," pointing to strong ETF inflows and technical breakouts as key drivers. He added that "stablecoin supply held by whales (over $5M) has risen 5% in the past 30 days,” indicating increased buying pressure. The expert expects a major altcoin surge between September and December, based on historical patterns. The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cryptocurrencies are broadly recovering on Monday, extending gains from the weekend, which followed instability and heightened volatility on Friday as geopolitical tensions exploded in the Middle East. Bitcoin (BTC) hovers above $107,000, up over 4% from its Friday low of $102,664. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) have shown signs of a steadying recovery, bolstered by rising risk-on sentiment, particularly from institutional investors. After sustaining a wide-scale strike on nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories and military commanders, Iran retaliated by launching drones and missile attacks on Israel. Reuters reports that Iran has rejected calls for a ceasefire, while Israel has vowed to make Tehran pay for Monday's dawn attacks on Tel Aviv and Haifa. The world remains on edge amid looming escalation. Despite the recovery observed in major digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, the total market capitalization remains close to last week's lows, around $3.40 trillion. Volatility will likely be one of the main concerns for traders this week. This was the smart contracts token's strongest week since February. Ethereum assets under management (AUM) surged to $14.9 billion, while XRP stood out among altcoins, boasting over $11.8 million in weekly inflows. Sui experienced renewed investor interest, with last week's inflows reaching $3.5 million. "Bitcoin's resilient price action appears underpinned by continued institutional accumulation," QCP Capital states in the latest market update. "Notably, Metaplanet and Strategy have persisted in buying the dip, while spot BTC Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) recorded their seventh consecutive week of inflows," the update added. OI represents the number of active futures and options contracts that have yet to be settled or closed. In other words, traders are willing to bet on Bitcoin's price recovering despite the tensions in the Middle East. Traders should consider a potential correction below $107,000, especially if the uptrend toward $110,000 loses steam. Traders may anticipate a buy signal if the blue MACD line crosses above the red signal line in upcoming sessions. Token launches influence demand and adoption among market participants. This is typically bullish for a digital asset. A hack is an event in which an attacker captures a large volume of the asset from a DeFi bridge or hot wallet of an exchange or any other crypto platform via exploits, bugs or other methods. Such events often involve an en masse panic triggering a sell-off in the affected assets. If the US Dollar index declines, risk assets and associated leverage for trading gets cheaper, in turn driving crypto prices higher.

Dogecoin holds at critical support, ticking up after five consecutive days of losses. Shiba Inu begins the week regaining strength and targeting a key resistance trendline. Pepe's trend reversal gains momentum in the 4-hour chart. Bitcoin increases to around $107,000 on Monday after a slight decline in the previous week. Bitcoin (BTC) tumbled to a low of $101,095 on Friday amid volatility in the market. The effect of the tussle between United States (US) President Donald Trump and Tesla Chief Elon Musk negatively influenced the NASDAQ and Tesla's stock price on Thursday, although both are recovering on Friday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Dogecoin and Shiba Inu capture the spotlight, a new set of digital currencies is quietly gaining traction. This article delves into five such tokens that might shape the future of digital wealth creation. During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Active contributors aren't just spectators—they're rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It's a game where the most passionate players win big. Airdrops, Rewards, and More – Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Imagine a world where you can trace your favorite fashion item or dinner ingredients back to their origins with ease. Founded in 2015 by Sunny Lu, former CIO at Louis Vuitton China, VeChain uses blockchain technology to assign unique IDs and sensors to physical products. This means every step of a product's journey—from creation to delivery—is recorded and transparent. VeChain's native token, VET, ranks among the top 40 cryptocurrencies by market cap, highlighting its growing adoption. This setup helps in value transfer and covers transaction fees, making the system more efficient. With partnerships involving big names like Walmart China, BMW, and PricewaterhouseCoopers, VeChain is demonstrating real-world utility. As businesses increasingly look for secure and transparent solutions, VeChain stands out as a promising option in the current market landscape. By turning stable, income-generating real-world assets into digital tokens, Ondo makes high-quality financial products accessible to more people. It has two main parts: one creates these tokenized products, and the other builds technology to support them. This helps their offerings work better and reach more users. In a market where trust and security are big concerns, Ondo stands out. They partner with reputable firms like BlackRock and use Coinbase for asset custody. Their product USDY offers stablecoin accessibility with added yield, backed by US Treasuries and bank deposits. For non-US investors seeking regulated and transparent products, USDY is attractive. Compared to other coins, Ondo's focus on real-world assets and compliance makes it appealing in a market looking for stability. Their approach could set a new trend in blending traditional finance with crypto. These platforms let users create and manage DAI, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. MKR tokens give holders a say in how DAI is run. In today's market, MKR stands out because it offers real utility and community control. As one of the first projects in decentralized finance (DeFi), it has a proven track record. With more people seeking stable investments in crypto, DAI's use could rise, boosting MKR's value. Compared to other coins that promise big gains but lack substance, MKR provides a solid foundation. Its role in DeFi makes it an attractive option now. In the quirky world of cryptocurrency, FARTCOIN is making a loud entrance. Built on the Solana blockchain, it's a memecoin that mixes internet humor with digital money. Users can earn tokens by sharing fart-themed memes, jokes, or short posts. This turns ordinary transfers into funny moments, nodding to both blockchain terms and meme culture. The “Terminal of Truth” is an AI-powered tool that helps create new content and boosts community fun. By blending user-made jokes with artificial intelligence, FARTCOIN turns viral humor into a shared movement. Its mix of humor, technology, and community spirit could make it a hit. While the crypto market is always changing, coins that engage users in new ways have a chance to shine. VET, ONDO, MKR, and FART are promising altcoins, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out by uniting sports fans and aiming for massive growth within its community-driven ecosystem.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The lean green Pepe machine with a flair for crypto trading that would put Jordan Belfort's calls to shame is proving exactly why they call him Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE). Since launching in February, the $WEPE token has surged 233% in June alone – powered by the rise of its Alpha Chat community, a private trading hub that's delivered serious gains for its members. Because when retail bands together, no whale can rig the tide. And if you're done watching them eat, it's time to eat with the WEPE Army – the side that keeps choosing rich. Of course, Wall Street Pepe wouldn't be strutting down the digital temple of capitalism, phone in hand and smug in a suit, if he couldn't back it up with trades that would've put Stratton Oakmont to shame in its heyday. Since launching its Alpha Chat on March 17, the group has grown to over 1,200 active members – each gaining access to exclusive trading signals, market insights, and educational content. But even before the presale ended, $WEPE had already earned a reputation for serious trading alpha.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Edoardo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy and a vocal supporter of XRP, boldly claims that owning at least 1,000 XRP could be life-changing. He supports this view with geopolitical and financial developments, arguing that XRP will play a significant role in the future of global finance. Farina's thesis centers on a key upcoming milestone: the official launch of the European Central Bank's (ECB) digital euro, slated for October 2025. Farina argues that the XRP Ledger isn't just theoretically capable; the Central Bank of France may have already tested it for digital payments. Furthermore, Palau's digital currency, which uses the euro and is built on XRPL, may serve as a testbed for broader use in the Eurozone. This move, Farina argues, could position Ripple to dominate the regulated stablecoin market and cement its infrastructure within the EU's financial system. He speculates that XRP could experience a similar, if not greater, rally if the digital euro is confirmed to run on the XRP Ledger. Based on these speculative scenarios, Farina insists that holding 1,000 XRP is essential for those serious about their financial positioning. At today's price of around $2.18, accumulating 1,000 XRP would cost approximately $2,180. He frames this as a “non-negotiable” goal for those aiming to future-proof their portfolios. However, this remains highly speculative, as it could take several decades for XRP to reach those lofty heights. Yet, Farina warns that once institutions start FOMOing in, retail investors may find themselves priced out. “Ignoring XRP or not holding at least 1,000 would be the definition of insanity,” he concludes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A widely followed trader believes that a layer-1 decentralized exchange (DEX) altcoin is gearing up for rallies to new all-time highs. Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 248,500 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks Hyperliquid (HYPE) looks very strong despite the recent marketwide correction. The trader sees HYPE consolidating close to the highs for now before igniting a fresh leg up en route to a new record high. “HYPE has insane strength right now, this one got bought up quickly. wouldn't be surprised to see a bit more chop around here but $50+ is destined, even in these crazy times.” The trader notes that dogwifhat (WIF) and Popcat (POPCAT) are both in the midst of a downtrend and may drop to much lower levels if BTC fails to print new all-time highs. It's all going to be dependent on BTC. At time of writing, WIF is trading for $0.839. Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
