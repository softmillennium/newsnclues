The U.S. Navy Exchange store seems to be a treasure trove of MSRP RTX 50 graphics cards. As the site snappily says, "You Serve, You Save," meaning it is for active and retired military families, but many readers might have a close friend or relative who can shop there. Additionally, every branch of the US armed forces has its own equivalent shop, although it is unclear how widespread deals on GPUs would be (if at all). If you don't have experience with the NEX store, Redditor Accomplished-Feed123 sums it up as “like a Target or Walmart mixed with a Best Buy and Marshall's that also sells snacks and beer but no groceries.” That might not sound like an ideal hunting ground for the best graphics cards, but the Redditor had experience finding prior bargains like open-box electronics and/or computer gaming products at the store. Drawn by spider-senses towards the locked Apple cage of goods, Accomplished-Feed123 spotted some “largeish brown boxes.” At this point, they didn't know they would be stuffed with green GPU gold. But, it soon became apparent that this was a bounty of “several 5070s, 5080s, and one single 5090,” wrote the Redditor. Googling the part number on the nondescript RTX 5090 package, it was discovered that inside was an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 FE model. These are sometimes sought after for their brand status, build quality, and relatively compact design. If your case is large enough, you might prefer a bigger, quieter, and better-cooled model, though. To conclude their tale of bargains at NEX, it was interesting to hear that the Redditor previously owned a capable but now last-gen Radeon RX 7900 XTX. They haven't been in the green team since owning an RTX 3060 Ti (launched Dec 2020). We are happy for Accomplished-Feed123, and hope others with access to NEX can grab similar MSRP-beating bargains. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. At the time of writing, we are starting to see more MSRP-and-under graphics cards become available. Sometimes they might not be obvious, requiring a special code or promo voucher, but a patient price sniper can do OK right now. We've also reported on sub-MSRP RTX 5090s in the UK. If you don't need a top-end flagship GPU, we are also happy to report that recently launched cards like the AMD Radeon RX 9600 XT didn't sell out, and thus they haven't been subject to the inevitable pricing inflation from slim stock levels. I've also been able to snag an RX 9070 at below MSRP in the UK using various discount codes. It is always hard to know whether prices will continue to slide as demand cools, or there will be some tech movement (crypto, AI, etc.) that will inflate prices, or even some kind of supply-side calamity (wars, earthquakes) to cause fresh price spikes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If there's one thing we've learned over the years, it's that President Donald J. Trump loves two things: gold furniture and using his status as U.S. president to make money. And now, to everyone's detriment, Trump is apparently combining those two passions into a mobile device that you can buy with real American tender. Mobile plans will offer a flagship "47 Plan," which costs $47.45 per month. Trump is also claiming the T1 will be “made in the USA,” though I have doubts there's much truth to that. There's a reason why Apple—with all of its resources—can't just make iPhones in America overnight or even within a few years. Our company is based right here in the United States because we know it's what our customers want and deserve.” This isn't Trump's first attempt at a cash grab that leverages his status and fame as POTUS—he's already peddled gaudy gold sneakers, crypto, and NFTs—but for me, the T1 is by far the most egregious. Phones aren't just another product; they're a gateway into everything you do, say, and think. While Trump's team unsurprisingly doesn't mention privacy one single time in its announcement of the T1, there are lots of inherent concerns there. The good news is that this phone is so bad I don't really think most people, outside of Trump's diehard supporters, will be tempted to buy it, let alone use it every day. Here's a list of quick facts about the $500 T1: It has a below-average 5,000mAh battery that Trump's team accidentally calls a “long life camera” and there are no details on the processor, though if it's as quick as the person who wrote the press materials, I'm going to assume that it's not great. There's a tri-camera system with no ultrawide, though it does have a 50-megapixel main sensor and what can only be garbage 2-megapixel depth and macro cameras. There's no mention of what apps are pre-installed, but if I were to guess… it's probably Truth Social. I'll grant you one free silent cry today in remembrance of a time before blatant conflicts of interest in the White House. The phone, if it wasn't a depressing reminder that our country has no standards anymore, would be fine, but for obvious reasons, it's not that, so I've gone ahead and made a list of all the things I'd sooner buy over the Trump phone: I don't think anyone should buy this phone for lots of reasons, but one of the main reasons is it just doesn't seem like a good deal. There are tons of nice mid-range phones out there that are doing a lot more, and there's no reason for you to buy a stunt phone that will probably end up unsupported and underserved faster than you can misspell “coverage” as “covfefe.” That being said, if you suck, you can pre-order this device right now.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Americans' air is teeming with all sorts of known toxin pollutants—now scientists have found a new one to add to the list. Researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder detailed their discovery in a study published earlier this month. They sampled agricultural sites in Oklahoma and found clear traces of medium-chain chlorinated paraffins (MCCPs) in the surrounding air. The health effects of MCCPs on people are still being studied, though countries are already planning to debate whether these chemicals should be regulated. “It's very exciting as a scientist to find something unexpected like this that we weren't looking for,” said lead author Daniel Katz, a chemistry PhD student at CU Boulder, in a statement from the university. While environmental regulations in recent decades have greatly reduced levels of certain pollutants in the air and environment, such as lead, there are still many other lingering airborne toxins out there. Scientists have detected compounds like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) phenylcyclohexene (PCH), and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in the air, for instance—many of which have the potential to disturb our hormones. MCCPs and other chlorinated paraffins are common industrial chemicals. They're regularly used as flame retardants and plasticizers (substances that improve flexibility and softness) in a variety of applications. But research has started to suggest that much like short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs), MCCPs aren't without their risks. They might also persist in the environment and our bodies for a very long time, similar to so-called forever chemicals like per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). To their surprise, they came across compounds with different patterns than expected, which they eventually determined were actually MCCPs. MCCPs have been regularly found in wastewater, which can be recycled into biosolid fertilizer. “When sewage sludges are spread across the fields, those toxic compounds could be released into the air,” Katz said. Sewage sludge fertilizers have been shown to release similar compounds.” SCCPs have been regulated in the U.S. and other countries for several years now. But experts argue that this regulation has spurred manufacturing industries to rely more on MCCPs as an alternative, leading to increased pollution. Members of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, a UN-led international treaty that meets biannually to address potential threats to the environment and human health, are set to discuss this year whether MCCPs should be added to the list of organic chemicals that warrant regulation. “I think it's important that we continue to have governmental agencies that are capable of evaluating the science and regulating these chemicals as necessary for public health and safety.” Unfortunately, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency may not be up to such a task currently. The renewed Trump administration has started to defang the EPA in all sorts of ways, from telling staffers to ease up on the fossil fuel industry to repealing already-created regulations on greenhouse emissions. MCCPs may be a real public health threat, but there's little indication that U.S. regulators will be interested in tackling them, at least under President Donald Trump.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Food distribution giant United Natural Foods (UNFI) said it is making “significant progress” in recovering from a cyberattack that occurred almost two weeks ago, as grocery stores across North America reliant on the distributor continue to report food shortages. UNFI said in an update on Sunday that it was restoring its electronic ordering systems, which its customers use to place orders for their grocery stores and supermarkets. One of the largest grocers affected is Whole Foods, which relies on UNFI as its “primary distributor.” Several Whole Foods stores, including one visited by TechCrunch last week and others in the New York area, are experiencing shelf shortages amid the UNFI outages. One employee at a Whole Foods in California told TechCrunch described supply issues at their store, saying they had not seen some products for days. Whole Foods previously told TechCrunch that it was working to restore its shelves “as quickly as possible,” but did not say when shipments would return to normal. People working at local grocery stores and big-chain supermarkets alike have told TechCrunch that they continue to experience disruption of varying degrees.

Tons of them are bulky, charge too slowly, or just can't hold up under repeated use. If you want a good one that you can actually count on right now, you're going to want to head to Amazon for one from the brand INIU. Check out Amazon to get an INIU Portable Charger for just $21, down from its usual price of $27. This portable charger is easily one of the best compact options out there. It's lightweight enough to toss in a purse, carry-on, or glove box without thinking twice, yet powerful enough to recharge most smartphones at least two full times. And it's got a digital readout so you don't have to guess how much juice is left in it. It includes dual USB-A ports and a USB-C port that handles both input and output, so you can charge multiple devices at once. That means your phone, wireless earbuds, and maybe even a friend's phone can all get a power boost at the same time. The USB-C support also means faster charging overall, both when you're charging the power bank itself and when you're using it to top off your devices.

The scope of 3D printing has gotten much bigger over the years, so much so that 3D-printed buildings are on track to become less of a novelty. A team of scientists from the UK, more specifically professors from the University of Bristol, have thankfully been hard at work developing a giant simulator capable of testing these 3D printed buildings for safety in the event of natural disasters like earthquakes by shaking them. The simulator is essentially a huge table with mounting brackets to hold 3D-printed structures in place. The team can program a handful of movements, particularly horizontal motions, which can provide a look at how the structure will behave during sudden seismic activity. This work is being handled in the University of Bristol's Soil Foundation Structure Interaction Laboratory (SoFSI) and has been showcased by the BBC, which claims this project is the first of its kind. Anastasios Sextos is a professor of earthquake engineering and confirmed that a major goal of this project is to help find a crossroads between affordability and safety when it comes to the future of 3D printed housing. Tests like these are crucial in helping designers create stable 3D designs that can be replicated safely for consumers who may not have the means to ensure the design integrity on their own. Professor Sextos hopes that this work can help designers create safe and reliable building designs for people worldwide. Some countries are more likely to encounter earthquakes than others, and these tests make a huge difference for the people who rely on housing options like 3D-printed buildings.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>She has tried to build such a product numerous times in the past, “but the AI technology was not yet mature enough,” she told TechCrunch. That's changed, so a few months ago she announced the launch of her dream company, Alta, followed by the announcement today of an $11 million seed round led by Menlo Ventures. The product, which feels straight out of the movie “Clueless,” is indeed an AI stylist and personal shopper that makes outfit recommendations and lets users try on those looks with their personalized virtual avatar. For example, a person can ask Alta what the best outfit might be for, say, TechCrunch Disrupt, and the AI will offer suggestions and present a lookbook of outfits. Users upload their closet by either taking photos, forwarding purchase receipts, or searching what is already in the Alta database. There are others playing around in the AI styling space, such as Whering and Cladwell, all trying to recreate the magic of that iconic scene in “Clueless,” where Cher plans an outfit from her closet using computer technology. “But the experiences that consumers will crave and use in the future will need to be built with new technical architectures and new user interfaces.” The product is backed by some heavy names, including Michelle Obama's stylist Meredith Koop, who Wang said helped train Alta's AI. Other investors in the company include Benchstrength; Algaé Ventures, the investment firm backed by fashion's prestigious Arnault family of LVMH; Phenomenal Ventures, the firm founded by Kamala Harris' niece Meena; Anthropic's VC arm Anthology fund; and a slew of angel investors including DoorDash CEO and co-founder Tony Xu, super models Jasmine Tookes and Karlie Kloss, Rent the Runway co-founder Jenny Fleiss, and Poshmark CEO and co-founder Manish Chandra. Wang used the word “aligned” to describe her fundraising process and leaned heavily on the network she amassed while working in various tech roles throughout her career. She's a Harvard engineer by training and has invested in numerous companies, served as a technical advisor to brands, and also held roles at investment firms. Years ago, for example, she was an intern at DoorDash, and previously volunteered on Karlie Kloss' podcast “Kode With Klossy.” Alta has already struck a partnership with the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) to offer Alta to its membership base. “NYC is also a closer flight to Paris than SF,” she said, adding that LVMH and one of her angel investors, tech influencer Zita d'Hautville, are helping the company expand throughout Europe. The plan is to next look at partnering with retailers worldwide. “Many of the most exciting consumer AI companies are being started in NYC,” Wang continued, adding that she's assembled a highly technical but also fashion-obsessed team.

I'm not especially in the market for a GPU upgrade right now (especially if my Wife is listening), but I've just come across a pretty excellent deal at Amazon that's making me itch for a new GPU. Right now at Amazon UK, you can score the MSI GeForce RTX 5070 12G Ventus 3X OC edition fully 17% off, now just £545. MSI GeForce RTX 5070 12G VENTUS 3X OC: (was £654.99) now £545.70 at Amazon The lowest-ever price we've seen on this card, and just £20 shy of the MSRP Founder's Edition, despite its heftier clock and performant triple fan cooling. A 1440p card that easily outstrips the RTX 4070, the RTX 5070 is our number one pick in our best GPU roundup for a reason. With a decent jump over the previous gen, it's a great overall pick thanks to the combination of price and performance. Over the RTX 3070 sat in my gaming PC under this desk, it's certainly an enticing upgrade. Not only are you getting more cooling for your money, but the MSI Ventus comes with a 2.54 GHz boost clock (compared to 2.51 GHz on the FE), as well as the MSI Extreme Performance option, which dials it up to 2.55 GHz. Sporting one fewer fan than the 3X, this is also another lowest-ever price on MSI's range, and, crucially, is cheaper than MSRP.

Australian law enforcement has charged four people who were allegedly behind an “elaborate and calculated” large scale money laundering operation. Over an 18-month period, investigators allege AUD$190 million ($124 million) was channeled through a “complex network of bank accounts, businesses, couriers and cryptocurrency accounts,” to avoid the attention of the authorities. As the purported money laundering operation was so complex, uncovering it meant significant work for multiple agencies and more than 70 staff over the last year and a half. Other parties involved in uncovering this apparent web of deceit include the Queensland Police Service, Australian Border Force, the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, AUSTRAC, and Australian Taxation Office – under the auspices of the Queensland Joint Organized Crime Taskforce (QJOCTF). Some are now in custody, others on bail. Clearly, some of those businesses were chosen for their ease of mixing legitimate money with illicit income, in order to launder it. For the four people now formally charged, the next big event on their calendars will be upcoming appearances in court through July and August. We'd expect investigators to use the results of their searches and seizures to firm up their cases in the meantime. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Some of those charged face multiple counts. “Many Australians are feeling the financial pinch but remain law-abiding and honest citizens,” said AFP Detective Superintendent Adrian Telfer, in an official statement. “Criminals always choose greed over decency and will constantly find opportunities to increase their wealth at the expense of others.” It was also underlined that money laundering isn't a victimless crime, as it fuels serious organized crime like drug trafficking, exploitation, and violence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The bank projects that figure will reach $160 billion in 2029. This means there is an increasing market for digitalized banking experiences for non-resident Indians (NRIs), ranging from remittances to investing in different assets back home. Aspora (formerly Vance) is trying to build a verticalized financial experience for the Indian diaspora by keeping convenience at the center. While a lot of financial products are in its future roadmap, the company currently focuses largely on remittances. “While multiple financial products for non-resident Indians exist, they don't know about them because there is no digital journey for them. They possibly use the same banking app as residents, which makes it harder for them to discover products catered towards them,” founder Parth Garg said. With this growth, the company has attracted a lot of investor interest. It raised $35 million in Series A funding last December — which was previously unreported — led by Sequoia, with participation from Greylock, Y Combinator, Hummingbird Ventures, and Global Founders Capital. The company announced today it has raised $50 million in Series B funding, co-led by Sequoia and Greylock, with Hummingbird, Quantum Light Ventures, and Y Combinator also contributing to the round. The startup has raised over $99 million in funding to date. After pivoting from being Pipe.com for India, the company started by offering remittance for NRIs in the U.K. in 2023 and has expanded its presence in other markets, including Europe and the United Arab Emirates. Plus, it plans to open up shop in Canada, Singapore, and Australia by the fourth quarter of this year. “We want to use remittances as a wedge and build all the financial solutions that the diaspora needs, including banking, investing, insurance, lending in the home country, and products that help them take care of their parents,” he told TechCrunch. The startup said that 80% of its users are sending money to their own accounts back home. Next month, it plans to launch fixed deposit accounts for non-resident Indians that allow them to park money in foreign currency. By the end of the year, it plans to launch a full-stack banking account for NRIs that typically takes days for users to open. While these accounts can help the diaspora maintain their tax status in India, a lot of people use a family member's account because of the cumbersome process, and Aspora wants to simplify this. Apart from banking, the company also plans to launch a product that would help NRIs take care of their parents back home by offering regular medical checkups, emergency care coverage, and concierge services for other assistance. Besides global competitors like Remitly and Wise, the company also has India-based rivals like Abound, which was spun off from Times Internet. Sequoia's Luciana Lixandru is confident that Aspora's execution speed and verticalized solution will give it an edge. “Aspora moves fast, but it is also very deliberate in building corridor by corridor, which is very important in financial services.” Google reportedly plans to cut ties with Scale AI Google Cloud outage brings down a lot of the internet Waymo rides cost more than Uber or Lyft — and people are paying anyway OpenAI releases o3-pro, a souped-up version of its o3 AI reasoning model</p>
