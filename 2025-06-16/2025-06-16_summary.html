            If there was a telling recent moment when it comes to how ugly our political discourse has become, it might well have been the brutal 2022 hammer attack on Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul.
    


            Soon after the attack on the then-82-year-old man, misinformation flowed about Paul Pelosi and the attacker, David DePape. But it wasn't just right-wing influencers leading the charge; it was also the likes of then-former President Donald Trump, Elon Musk and a coterie of prominent Republicans.
    


            These theories generally held or winked at the idea that the attack was a “false flag,” and/or that Paul Pelosi had been engaged in a gay lover's quarrel – even as he was recovering from nearly being killed.
    


            These claims were baseless and highly suspect at the time, and they were ultimately disproven by audio and video evidence. Musk even offered a brief apology.
    


            But that episode did nothing to dissuade some observers from doing it again. And again.
    


            The lure of quickly politicizing a violent attack with misinformation and speculation has proven more tempting than being circumspect and sensitive about a tragedy.
    


            Some on the modern right apparently can't allow that someone on their side could be responsible for such violence, so they've again leapt to link the attacker to the other side with innuendo and falsehoods.
    


            Today's example deals with the shootings of two Democratic Minnesota state lawmakers. State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband were killed, while state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife are recovering at a hospital.
    


            Authorities are still piecing together evidence on a possible motive, but Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has said the attack was a “politically motivated assassination.” The suspect who has now been detained after a manhunt, Vance Boelter, had an apparent hit list of nearly 70 targets. The names on the list, which CNN obtained, are largely Democrats or figures with ties to Planned Parenthood or the abortion rights movement. A longtime friend, David Carlson, said Boelter is a conservative who supported Trump and opposed abortion rights.
    


            So much remains to be learned about what spurred the attack, and it's important to wait for more information before drawing definitive conclusions. These incidents are often carried out by disturbed individuals with no neat and tidy political motivation.
    


            But many on the right weren't about to wait for all that; they tried to attach the shooter to the left – and quick.
    


            They pointed to the fact that Walz in 2019 had appointed Boelter to the state's Workforce Development Board – a group of business owners who consult lawmakers. (The New York Post described Boelter in a headline as a “former appointee of Tim Walz.”) But such boards, which are numerous in Minnesota, are not particularly high-profile and generally feature a bipartisan cast of characters.
    


            Others suggested Hortman had been targeted because she in May spearheaded a compromise with Republicans under which undocumented adults would no longer be eligible for a state health care program. Hortman last week tearfully recounted voting for that compromise. But the other lawmaker victim this weekend, Hoffman, didn't vote for it.
    


            Still others pointed to flyers for the anti-Trump “No Kings” protests this weekend that were allegedly found in Boelter's car, as if he supported those protests. Protest organizers canceled their events out of fear the protesters could be targeted.
    


            Despite the tenuousness of the evidence linking the attack to left-wing politics – and the more-compelling evidence suggesting the opposite – many prominent right-wing figures have quickly cast Boelter as an angry left-winger.
    


            Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah repeatedly suggested Boelter is not just a leftist but a “Marxist” and linked him to Walz in an X post: “Nightmare on Waltz Street.” Lee also wrote: “This is what happens when Marxists don't get their way.”
    


            Musk, apparently unchastened by the Paul Pelosi situation, also promoted a post linking the shooter to the left, writing, “The far left is murderously violent.”
    


            Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio added in his own X post about the flyers: “The degree to which the extreme left has become radical, violent, and intolerant is both stunning and terrifying.”
    


            Donald Trump Jr. on Monday wagered that that shooter “went after someone that didn't just blindly follow Democrat radical leftist dogma.” He added: “It's scary stuff, but it seems to all be coming from the left.”
    


            Influencers went even further, with some of the most prominent and recognizable ones suggesting without any evidence that Walz was somehow involved in the attack. “Did Tim Walz have her executed to send a message?,” asked right-wing figure Mike Cernovich on X.
    


            While these claims have been much more prevalent and firm on the right, Republicans weren't the only ones leaping to conclusions. Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said Sunday that the shooter “appears to be a hate-filled right winger” and urged his side not to dance around “MAGA's legitimization of political violence.”
    


            As noted, there is more evidence for this view than the inverse, but we still don't know a lot. Murphy has previously cautioned his side about the political perils of being too apolitical soon after school shootings, arguing it cedes the debate and allows people to move on from tragedy without addressing the problem.
    


            To be clear, these Republican lawmakers and conservative influencers aren't just suggestively raising questions – as their ilk often did with Paul Pelosi's attackers – they're suggesting this is a settled issue.
    


            The situation carries echoes of not just the Pelosi attack, but also other recent major acts of political violence in which the right, especially, has leapt to blame others using incomplete or bogus information.
    


            After the assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year, Republicans including Trump suggested a link to Democrats' rhetoric, despite the still-opaque picture of Thomas Matthew Crooks' politics and motivations. Some congressional Republicans suggested law enforcement deliberately jeopardized Trump – something that would be a massive scandal – without evidence.
    


            Many noted Crooks had once donated a small amount to a Democratic-leaning group, but that group has been criticized for misleading fundraising appeals. And Crooks later registered as a Republican and, according to CBS News, unsubscribed from the group's email list.
    


            After the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters, many on the right leapt to claim the attacks were somehow the result of provocateurs or even FBI agents. (Lee himself tweeted about a claim that one rioter was flashing a badge, when in actuality it appeared to be a vape.)
    


            There remains no evidence for these theories. A report by the Justice Department's inspector general last year found no undercover FBI employees were present on January 6 and that none of the FBI's confidential human sources present had been “directed by the FBI to encourage others to commit illegal acts on January 6.”
    


            There's a real question here about how much of this leaping to conclusions is about prominent people getting caught up in fast-spreading misinformation, or whether there's a deliberate political strategy. Sharing such misinformation is a great way to win engagement and followers – and it also muddies the waters.
    


            Should we one day learn Boelter was indeed a MAGA supporter who targeted Democrats for political reasons, the seeds of doubt about that conclusion will have been planted and fertilized on the right at a crucial, very early stage.
    


            And the price of that is that incidents of political violence could serve to radicalize yet more people against their opponents – and often, the illusion of those opponents' violent tendencies. And there is evidence that Americans are viewing these incidents more through the lens of politics.
    


            When then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, a Democrat from Arizona, was shot in 2011, 71% of people in an NBC News poll said the attack was mostly about a “disturbed person” rather than political “rhetoric.”
    


            That number dropped to 46% for the shooting of Republican congressmen at a baseball practice in 2017, to 40% for the attack on Paul Pelosi, then to 37% after the Trump assassination attempt.
    


            Each of these circumstances were different. But the total picture is one of a country that instantly searches for political answers. And at this moment, one side of the aisle is particularly anxious to provide them – no matter how true they are.

Kyiv on June 13 expressed concern over the security situation in the Middle East after Israeli air strikes against Iran, but stressed that Tehran remains a "source of problems" in the region "and beyond."

The statement follows what Israel called a "preemptive" strike against Iran overnight on June 13, targeting the country's nuclear program and reportedly killing top military officials.

"We would like to remind you that the Iranian regime supports Russia in its illegal war of aggression against Ukraine and provides Moscow with weapons to kill Ukrainians," the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

Along with North Korea, Iran has been a key ally to Russia during its full-scale war against Ukraine, providing thousands of Shahed strike drones and short-range ballistic missiles.

Ukraine has called upon the international community "to take joint and decisive action" and deter a "group of aggressive regimes — Russia, Iran, and North Korea."

Kyiv nevertheless also warned that further hostilities could destabilize the region with "negative consequences for international security and global financial stability, especially in oil markets."

Israeli strikes were quickly followed by a surge in oil prices, Russia's key export commodity, with Brent and Nymex crude prices jumping by more than 10%.

"We are convinced that restoring peace and stability in the Middle East will serve the interests not only of the region but also of the entire international community," the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said.

Iran has pledged a response to Israeli air strikes and accused the United States of "also being responsible for the dangerous consequences of this reckless escalation." The Trump administration has acknowledged it knew about the operation in advance but denied any involvement.

According to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Tehran has already launched over 100 drones against Israel in response.

The attacks took place amid escalating tensions in the Middle East and U.S. President Donald Trump's push to find a diplomatic solution to Iran's nuclear aspirations. A round of indirect U.S.-Iranian negotiations in Oman was scheduled for June 15.

Russia has condemned Israel's attacks as "unprovoked aggression" and a violation of the U.N. Charter.

This comes a day after Trump floated the possibility of deeper US involvement in the intensifying war.

Warning against “another endless conflict” in the Middle East, Democratic U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine on Monday introduced a war powers resolution aimed at preventing President Donald Trump from attacking Iran without congressional debate and authorization.

Given its status as a privileged resolution, the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate will be forced to swiftly consider and vote on the measure, which would require “any hostilities with Iran” to be “explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for use of military force.”

“It is not in our national security interest to get into a war with Iran unless that war is absolutely necessary to defend the United States,” Kaine said in a statement. “I am deeply concerned that the recent escalation of hostilities between Israel and Iran could quickly pull the United States into another endless conflict.”

“The American people have no interest in sending servicemembers to fight another forever war in the Middle East,” said Kaine. “This resolution will ensure that if we decide to place our nation's men and women in uniform into harm's way, we will have a debate and vote on it in Congress.”

Erik Sperling, executive director of Just Foreign Policy, welcomed the Democratic senator's resolution, writing on social media that “American voters can thank Tim Kaine for forcing every Senator to have to choose a side: diplomacy or more endless war.”

Kaine unveiled his resolution a day after Trump floated the possibility of deeper U.S. involvement in the intensifying war, which has killed hundreds of Iranians and dozens of Israelis and sparked warnings of prolonged conflict with disastrous global implications. The Israeli government, led by far-right Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is reportedly urging Trump to wade into the war to help Israel destroy Iran's nuclear energy infrastructure.

U.S. lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle have warned Trump against involving U.S. troops in the Israel-Iran war, indicating that Kaine's resolution and its expected companion bill in the House will likely gain bipartisan support.

“Israel doesn't need U.S. taxpayers' money for defense if it already has enough to start offensive wars,” Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) wrote on social media last Friday. “I vote not to fund this war of aggression.”

Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) said in a statement after Israel launched its illegal attack on Iran that “the president cannot circumvent congressional war powers and unilaterally send U.S. troops to war with Iran.”

“This is a violation of Article I of the Constitution, which requires congressional approval to declare war,” she added. “The American people do not want another endless war in the Middle East that will cost lives and tear their families apart.”

In 2020, Kaine led a virtually identical Iran war powers resolution that passed both the House and Senate with bipartisan support. Trump ultimately vetoed the measure, and the Senate failed to override the president's veto.

“A key question is how many Senate Dems will still oppose unauthorized U.S. war on Iran, and how many will betray Americans and support Netanyahu,” Just Foreign Policy said Monday.

            Terry Moran has no regrets.
    


            The now-former ABC News correspondent sat down for a pair of interviews on Monday, speaking out for the first time about losing his job at the network after he posted a social media missive last week against President Donald Trump and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller.
    


            “I don't think you should ever regret telling the truth. And I don't,” Moran told The New York Times. He echoed that sentiment during a live-streamed interview with The Bulwark's Tim Miller. “I wrote it because I thought it was true,” Moran said.
    


            Moran, who interviewed Trump in the Oval Office in late April, wrote in the now-deleted X post that Miller, a “world-class hater,” is “richly endowed with the capacity for hatred” and that “hatreds are his spiritual nourishment.”
    


            For Trump, he added, hatred is “only a means to an end, and that end is his own glorification. That's his spiritual nourishment.”
    


            The post shocked Moran's own ABC News colleagues and drew public outrage from White House officials, including Miller, Vice President JD Vance and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. The network initially suspended Moran and, two days later, announced it would not renew his contract.
    


            Moran, 65, a long-time news correspondent for ABC who has never been one to publicly share his opinions, styled himself as a “proud centrist” in his interview with The Bulwark. Since first joining the network in 1997, Moran has served as chief foreign correspondent, chief White House correspondent, “Nightline” co-anchor and, most recently, senior national correspondent.
    


            “It wasn't a drunk tweet,” Moran told the Times on Monday about his late-night posting on X. “I used very strong language deliberately,” he told The Bulwark, admitting the post was “very hot” but nevertheless “accurate and true.”
    


            The offending post, he said, “was something that was in my heart and mind.”
    


            Regarding his ABC ouster, Moran told the Bulwark, “From my perspective, it looked like a business decision. I became bad business, it feels like.”
    


            In his Times interview, Moran pushed back against the ABC News framing that he was let go ahead of his contract's expiration, instead alleging the outlet was “bailing” on an “oral agreement” to renew his contract for three years. “We had a deal,” he said.
    


            ABC News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

            Moran also resisted the notion that journalists should strive to be objective. He told The Bulwark that “there is no Mount Olympus of objectivity where a mandarin class of wise people have no feelings about their society.”
    


            “What you have to be is fair and accurate,” Moran said. “I would refer to the interview with the president that I did, or a lot of my work.”
    


            Shortly after being dropped by ABC News, Moran launched a Substack newsletter, joining the growing ranks of TV news stars going independent with their reporting and analysis. The Times reported that Moran has thus far drawn more than 90,000 subscribers on the platform.
    


            Moran seemed assured in his move, telling the Bulwark, a fellow Substack-hosted publication, “We are free to speak our minds here.”

The government is using “transparent delay tactics” to continue detaining Khalil, his legal team said.

A federal judge has refused to order pro-Palestine activist Mahmoud Khalil's release after a last-minute response from Trump administration officials arguing for his continued imprisonment based on “false and pretextual allegations,” the activists' legal team has said.

U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz in New Jersey sided with the government's argument that it can continue holding Khalil based on a charge that Khalil committed fraud when he applied for his green card. The same judge, however, in an order last week had acknowledged that it would be a stretch for the government to apply this charge to his detainment.

Khalil and his legal team had been hoping that the activist would be released on Friday after Farbiarz had said that the government couldn't hold him on their primary charge.

Last week, Farbiarz ruled that the government cannot hold Khalil based on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's claims that Khalil's continued presence in the U.S. threatens U.S. foreign policy interests. Farbiarz gave the government until Friday to appeal, seemingly nudging the government to make the argument that it was detaining Khalil based on his green card application. 

The government failed to appeal on time, and Khalil's legal team submitted a letter asking for his immediate release. The judge then gave the government several hours to respond to that letter, when the government said that their interpretation of the ruling was that Farbiarz had, in fact, only narrowly ruled that Khalil couldn't be held on foreign policy grounds.

Farbiarz said that interpretation is correct, and Khalil continues to be imprisoned, missing his first Father's Day with his wife and newborn baby.

Khalil's lawyers have slammed the decision, saying that his detention is “arbitrary” and that the green card application allegations are “false and pretextual,” meaning that they were effectively put forth to justify Khalil's detainment separately from the government's primary charges against him. 

Indeed, when the administration was initially pressed for their reasoning for seeking Khalil's detention and deportation in April, the administration only provided a two-page memo from Rubio citing his beliefs — and admitting that Khalil's participation in Columbia University student protests were “otherwise lawful.”

“Mahmoud Khalil was detained in retaliation for his advocacy for Palestinian rights. The government is now using cruel, transparent delay tactics to keep him away from his wife and newborn son ahead of their first Father's Day as a family,” said Amy Greer, one of Khalil's lawyers, in a statement. 

“Instead of celebrating together, he is languishing in ICE detention as punishment for his advocacy on behalf of his fellow Palestinians. It is unjust, it is shocking, and it is disgraceful,” Greer said.

The ACLU, which is part of the team representing Khalil, said the ruling makes it clear that the Trump administration is “doing everything in their power to punish Mahmoud for his advocacy for Palestinian rights.” 

The ACLU shared a letter that Khalil wrote to his son, Deen, ahead of Mother's Day, when the baby was two weeks old. The letter shows the pain that Khalil has experienced by being separated from his family and missing the birth of his son, the group said, after Farbiarz had concluded in his initial ruling last week that Khalil would suffer irreparable harm by continuing to be detained.

“Deen, it was not a gap in the law that made me a political prisoner in Louisiana. It was my firm belief that our people deserve to be free, that their lives are worth more than the televised massacre we are witnessing in Gaza, and that the displacement that began in 1948 and culminated in the current genocide must finally end,” Khalil wrote. 

“Deen, my love for you is deeper than anything I have ever known,” Khalil went on. “Loving you is not separate from the struggle for liberation. It is liberation itself.”

The intense heat is compounded as swarms of flies and mosquitoes infest the tents due to an absence of sewage services.

Before the war began, summer in Gaza was a season of joy. Families thrived on creating small moments of happiness, even amid daily electricity cuts and the suffocating siege. Many loved to flock to the beach or spend time at the water chalets, hoping to find some refreshing relief from the scorching sun.

They would sit beneath wide umbrellas, spread blankets across the golden beach sand, and share ice cream along with slices of mango and watermelon, all while watching their children swim and splash in the sea. These simple gatherings brought beauty to the season and made it something to look forward to each year.

However, the latest Israeli war on Gaza has turned even these modest pleasures into distant memories. It has erased any sense of joy from summer, transforming it into another season of suffering — marked by starvation, displacement, thirst, and daily killings.

Thousands of Gazans are now living in tents after losing their homes or being forcibly displaced following the expansion of Israeli military operations on April 3, 2025. Many describe summer in these tents as “hell,” as they lack even the simplest means to cope with the intense heat amid a complete electricity blackout.

Most of the tents are made of nylon, offering no protection from the blazing sun. Instead, they trap heat and turn into unbearable ovens. Areej Alkataib, 40, shared that the intense heat has turned her tent into a suffocating grave. “I try to spray water over the nylon from time to time to reduce the heat, but all my efforts are in vain. I always seek refuge outside despite the harsh conditions, as I cannot endure the heat inside,” she told me.

The intense heat inside the tents is only part of the crisis, as swarms of flies and mosquitoes infest these tents as a result of the complete absence of sewage services and the decomposition of accumulated waste, making daily life unbearable. Alkataib described how the insects constantly bother her and bite her children, often keeping them from sleeping. She added that the flies spoil both the food and water. “It's hard to store anything — I always find insects in the food, no matter how tightly I try to cover it,” she said.

The overcrowded nature of the camps, deprived of even the most basic necessities of life, has intensified the suffering of Gazans during the summer. Most tents are set up with no space between them, leaving people, especially women, with no sense of privacy or personal freedom.

Alkataib shared that she has to keep her hijab on most of the time, which makes her feel hot and uncomfortable — especially when she lights a fire to cook for the children. “The smoke mixed with ash fills the air, and the scorching sun presses down on me,” she said. “Sometimes I feel like I can't breathe. The heat is overwhelming, and there's no place to cool down or even catch a breeze.”

Adding to this suffering is the lack of clean water — especially after the Israeli occupation cut off the supply and destroyed the infrastructure used to pump water from wells. Many people are forced to walk long distances and wait for hours under the scorching sun to access water for drinking and daily use. The water they collect often comes from unreliable sources and is stored in unsanitary containers, which leads to the spread of various illnesses, including diarrhea and hepatitis.

The severe water shortage has drastically limited people's ability to bathe, stay cool, or stay hydrated amid the relentless heat, forcing them to ration every drop carefully. Meanwhile, hygiene supplies — including soap and shampoo — have become increasingly scarce and prohibitively expensive due to the Israeli blockade. A single bar of soap can cost up to $5, while a bottle of shampoo may reach $20. These high prices are particularly frustrating as most of these products are locally made with low-quality ingredients that often cause skin irritations, especially among children.

“The intense heat leaves us drenched in sweat, but with the severe water shortage, we're only able to bathe once a week — sometimes using seawater,” Alkataib said. “The poor-quality soap we have doesn't clean or deodorize the body properly. As a result, my children and I have developed skin allergies and inflammations.”

Amid the struggle for water and the intense heat, people in Gaza long for anything cold that might ease their suffering and offer a moment of relief. Treats like ice cream, juice, fruits, or even a glass of iced water have become luxuries we can no longer afford — especially when we can't even find enough water to quench our thirst or basic food to soothe our hungry stomachs.

 The sight of people — including women and children — standing in long lines under the blazing sun, clutching their bowls as they wait for a small portion of food from the few remaining charity kitchens in Gaza, is heart-breaking. Some are pushed and kicked as they struggle to stay on their feet amid the chaos, which, for a moment, resembles a desperate battle for survival.

People in Gaza are exhausted from living this humiliating life that has stripped us of dignity and turned each season into a new chapter of relentless suffering that we cannot endure or cope with. What we ask for is not too much — only the right to live in peace, to feel safe, to provide for our children, and to experience life's simplest joys. These are basic human needs that have been stolen from us. This cruelty must end.

EDITOR'S NOTE:  Sign up for CNN's Stress, But Less newsletter. Our six-part mindfulness guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it.



            Mothers bear much of the burden for a child's healthy development, from pregnancy through their teen years.
    


            But a large, new study adds to the growing body of evidence saying fathers, too, are responsible for the types of development that help children grow physically, emotionally and cognitively.
    


Fathers' mental distress is slightly associated with subpar child development, including cognitive, social-emotional, language and physical development, according to the study published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics. The researchers defined mental distress as symptoms or a diagnosis of depression, anxiety, a mix of both or stress. The findings were especially true in the perinatal period, which spans from conception to two years postpartum.
    


            During this time, the developing fetus, infant then toddler is particularly sensitive to any mental distress parents, especially the mother, experience, according to the study.
    


A key to happiness for dads? Being present with newborns



            “Men are at risk of increased mental distress during the transition to fatherhood, with prevalence rates among men during the perinatal period as high as 8% for clinical depression, 11% for anxiety, and 6% to 9% for elevated stress,” the authors wrote in the study.
    


            “This represents the most comprehensive global review to date on the association between fathers' perinatal mental health and offspring development,” said Dr. Delyse Hutchinson, senior author of the study and associate professor in the SEED Lifespan Research Centre at Deakin University in Australia, via email.



            “What stood out was the striking consistency in the trends observed in the results,” Hutchinson, a clinical psychologist, said. “This highlights the importance of supporting fathers if we want to see better outcomes for families.”
    


            While previous studies have linked fathers' poor mental health with potential harms on their children's development, the results were limited by the number of forms of development they investigated or the strength of their results.
    


            In addition to expanding this kind of research beyond mother-child pairs, the authors also wanted to fill those research gaps. They analyzed ties between paternal depression, anxiety or stress and six types of child development: social-emotional, adaptive, cognitive, language, physical and motor development from birth to age 18.



            Factors of social-emotional development included a child's ability to form positive relationships with peers, act in ways that benefit others, have healthy relational attachment, self-soothe and have a healthy temperament. Adaptability referred to a child's ability to respond to change and manage daily needs. Cognitive development included the health of a child's executive function skills, decision-making, memory, attention, learning, IQ and academic performance.
    


Worried about your parenting skills? There are dads way worse than you



            Physical development factors included preterm birth, gestational growth and childhood height, weight, stunting, abdominal pain and sleep health. Motor development referred to fine motor skills, which involve the use of small muscles for actions such as writing or buttoning, and gross motor skills. Those latter skills use larger muscles for movements including waving your arm, walking or chewing.
    


            The findings derive from 84 previous studies totaling thousands of father-child pairs. All studies had followed participants over time, with mental distress measured from pregnancy to two years post birth, Hutchinson said. The authors excluded studies with fathers who had a medical condition, took medication or consumed alcohol or other drugs.
    


            There was no evidence for links between paternal mental distress and adaptive and motor development, the study found. But there were negligible to small associations with the other developmental outcomes including social-emotional, cognitive, language and physical maturation. The largest impacts were in early childhood, then infancy, then middle childhood.
    


            The associations were also generally stronger for postnatal mental distress than preconception mental distress, “suggesting that a father's mental state may exert a more direct influence on the developing child after birth,” the authors said. A father's mental distress may affect his sensitivity and responsiveness in interactions with his child and disrupt attachment security, Hutchinson said.
    


            “The timing of this review is excellent,” wrote independent experts Dr. Craig Garfield, Dr. Clarissa Simon and Dr. John James Parker of Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital in a commentary on the study. “Fathers spend more time than ever on childcare and are increasingly recognized as important contributors to family health and well-being.”
    


How to be a dad to sons today, according to experts



            The results affirm well-established evidence of the importance of supportive parenting on the well-being of children, said Dr. Arwa Nasir, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska, via email. Nasir wasn't involved in the study.
    


            Research on the role that fathers play in the lives of their children is important,” Nasir added. “I hope future research will also clarify all the important and wonderful ways that fathers can enrich and support the health and development of their children.”



            Though the idea of a father's well-being influencing his child could be a natural conclusion, one drawback of the study is its partial reliance on gray literature — unpublished research that, in this case, included doctoral theses and interviews with authors of published studies that met criteria but hadn't reported relevant data. Of the 674 associations found, 286 were from unpublished work.
    


            However, the authors of the new study said when they compared their findings based on published research with their results reliant on unpublished studies, the new associations remained similar for most categories of development.
    


            Additionally, while the study is “well-designed,” it doesn't prove a causal relationship and lacks larger context, Nasir said.
    


            “It could simply be that both fathers and children's emotional wellbeing are impacted by the same larger psychosocial factors and socioeconomic pressures, such as poverty, structural racism and health disparities,” Nasir explained. “Presenting the association between fathers' mental health and children's health outcomes in isolation from the larger societal factors risks presenting the fathers as the cause of children's problems.”
    


            This interpretation can also be stigmatizing, Nasir added. “If the goal is supporting optimal health and development of children, I believe our focus in research and action should be exploring ways that society can support parents through economic security, equity, and justice.”
    


What women need most after giving birth, especially now



            The study emphasizes the importance of assessing and treating the well-being of both parents during health care visits in the perinatal period, experts said.
    


            “Borrowing from the decades-old strategy of perinatal maternal screening for (postpartum depression), clinicians, researchers, and policymakers can build on the existing maternal infrastructure to design father-tailored programs and policies that strive to improve the mental health of fathers and families,” Garfield, Simon and Parker wrote.
    


            Parents are the guardians of “society's future generations,” Nasir added. “Supporting the well-being of families should be a national priority.”
    


            But to receive help, fathers have to speak up and honestly answer questions about mental health concerns, they added.
    


            “It's important for fathers to be aware that becoming a parent can be a challenging period, and that many fathers go through ups and downs during this time,” Hutchinson said.
    


            Seeking support early can make a difference, she added, and it's a strength, not a weakness. Fathers can talk with general physicians, therapists or providers at specialized pregnancy or postpartum clinics about mental health symptoms, Hutchinson said. Peer group support and online apps that use mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy to help manage moods can also be effective, she added.
    


How to choose a therapist who will be the best fit for you



            Even if your children are older, it's still never too late to prioritize your health, Hutchinson said. Every age and stage across child development is important, not just one period in time.

When John Denton first visited Ukraine weeks into Russia's full-scale invasion, he knew that for the country to survive, businesses needed to stay alive. Denton is the secretary general of the world's largest business organization, the International Chamber of Commerce. Active in 170 countries, the organization enables $17.5 trillion worth of economic activity every year, accounting for 22% of the world's gross domestic product (GDP).Denton has been a vocal supporter of Ukraine's businesses and the country's economic recovery, which is crawling back from the massive 29.1% fall in 2022. The International Chamber of Commerce will attend the upcoming Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC) in Rome on July 10-11, alongside governments and major players in the global private sector. In a sit-down interview at the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) on June 12, Denton told the Kyiv Independent how the International Chamber of Commerce has supported businesses in Ukraine, how investors can mitigate risks, and why doing business in Ukraine is worth it despite the wartime challenges. “There needs to be a more nuanced understanding of risk in Ukraine. It's not one risk quota for the whole of the country. It helps people understand that there are investable opportunities,” Denton said. 

The International Chamber of Commerce has been active in supporting Ukraine's economic front in partnership with the Ukrainian Chambers of Commerce. This includes the Center of Entrepreneurship, which supports small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) as well as refugees. Denton believes Ukraine's recovery needs a strong private sector and access to global markets. To help build up trust and encourage foreign investors, he announced that the International Chamber of Commerce will cut arbitration costs for foreign investors involved in reconstruction-related disputes in Ukraine during his last trip to Ukraine in November 2024. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.Kyiv Independent: This is your fourth trip to Ukraine. What is your current assessment of Ukraine's business climate?

John Denton: The reality is challenging, but Ukraine is not a monolith. There are different opportunities. I drove from Warsaw through western Ukraine, and you can sense that there's a level of vibrancy in the economy there.

The more challenged regions need focus. It's hard to attract opportunities and to keep people. At the same time, people are there, paying taxes, keeping businesses running, even in complex places. They need support and want visibility. 

It's going to be much harder to rebuild Ukraine if the economy is not functioning. We've always seen the private sector and the functioning of the economy here as the economic front. One dimension is just keeping tax flows moving and businesses running. The other is morale. It's devastating if you have a collapsed economy plus military challenges.

The Kyiv Independent: What would you say to investors who are standing by on the sidelines, waiting for the war to end before putting their money into Ukraine? 

John Denton: They've got to make commercial decisions in the best interests. You have to make certain your risk appetite matches the risk that's available. 

There's a different level of risk for the allocation of capital in this place. Existing businesses here tend to understand that a little better. The investment you're seeing in Ukraine is coming from existing businesses that understand the terrain. They're reinvesting in the economy, and those investments are often very successful. 


You can't completely de-risk, but you can take away some of the extraordinary risks. 
    

The danger with waiting too long is do you then have the relationships in place to participate in the rebuild? That's going to be one of the challenges.

There's a lot more that can be done to facilitate de-risking. You can't completely de-risk, but you can take away some of the extraordinary risks. 

We can help export agencies understand that their participation is really important to allow companies to close deals here. Some of them can only provide coverage up to 97%. That (missing) 3% matters. At the URC, we're helping export agencies understand this and problem solve risk coverage.

Kyiv Independent: What are the barriers to foreign and domestic investment in Ukraine, and how are you helping break those down?

John Denton: There's just the reality that there's a war going on. It inhibits one's decision-making, but it doesn't mean you don't make the decision.The other is that there are issues with the application of the rule of law here. We've come up with a solution which I know the Ukrainian government is very happy with – if people are worried that that's an inhibitor, we will use the International Chamber of Commerce Court of Arbitration. You can be 100% sure of the independence. 

There's still a perception of corruption. Many say the country is different than five years ago or before the war. That's true. But sentiment clouds upfront decision-making.

The other thing is, do we actually have clear investment frameworks? Has the government articulated key priorities? Do you want to attract investment only into the most complex areas of Ukraine, or are you neutral as to where it is? There is a risk of mixed messages.I think the government and the private sector here are working on all those areas. We're seeing better presentation and understanding of projects capable of attracting capital.

Kyiv Independent: Have we seen any results yet from the decreased arbitration costs?

John Denton: It's too early to tell. There's certainly a lot of interest in it. It's creating an ecosystem of confidence around settling disputes. 

Kyiv Independent: The Ukraine Recovery Conference is taking place in Rome next month. Is reconstruction being taken seriously despite there being no end to the war in sight? What can we expect from the International Chamber of Commerce at the conference? 

John Denton: There is increasing interest from the private sector about how to manage the risks that will be involved in the reconstruction of Ukraine. And that's why we're involved.There is a particular challenge with export finance that needs to be thought through. We will be using the URC as a great convening space to do that. The other is more broadly around identifying the inhibitors to private sector engagement in this process and coming up with a roadmap to actually remove those barriers.The URC creates space for these discussions. We hope this starts more aggressively, not just on future reconstruction, but reconstruction now. To rebuild on a broken system is much harder than if we have a functioning private sector and economy now. 

Hi, it's Dominic, thank you for reading this story. Investment and the role of the private sector in rebuilding Ukraine is going to be a hot topic at the upcoming Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome this July. For now, many investors are holding back their money, but John Denton makes a good point that it's important to invest now to keep the economy alive.

Performer says Dodgers told her to sing in English

Protests have erupted across LA in response to raids

Singer Vanessa Hernández says she chose to sing the Spanish version of the US national anthem at Dodger Stadium on Saturday as a protest against recent immigration raids.

Hernández, who performs under the name Nezza, says she was warned by a member of the Dodgers staff before the team's game against the San Francisco Giants to perform the anthem in English.

After her performance Hernández posted a video to TikTok, with the caption “Watch the Dodgers tell me I can't sing the Spanish Star Spangled Banner that Roosevelt literally commissioned in 1945 – so I did it anyway.” The video shows an apparent conversation with the Dodgers staff member. “We are going to do the song in English today, so I don't know if that wasn't translated – er, communicated,” the employee says.

However, Hernández went on to sing El Pendón Estrellado, which the US government commissioned as the Spanish version of the Star-Spangled Banner in 1945. She explained her decision in another social media video.

“I didn't think I would be met with any sort of ‘No,' especially because we're in LA with everything happening,” said Hernández whose parents are from the Dominican Republic. “I've sang the national anthem many times in my life, but today I could not. I'm sorry ... I just could not believe, when she walked in and told me ‘No,' but I just felt like I needed to do it, para mi gente [for my people].

“My parents are immigrants. They've been citizens my whole life at this point, they got documented really early, but I just can't imagine them being ripped away from me, even at this age, let alone a little kid. Like, what are we doing?”

The Dodgers have yet to comment on the incident but The Athletic reports the club did not punish her for her decision.

Hernández was not the only person over the weekend to make a statement on the immigration raids in LA. Angel City, LA's NWSL team, wore shirts that proclaimed themselves “Immigrant City Football Club” before Saturday night's game against the North Carolina Courage.

Oil producer MEG Energy Corp. MEG-T on Monday urged its shareholders to reject a nearly $6-billion hostile takeover offer from Strathcona Resources Ltd. SCR-T, calling the bid inadequate and not in their best interest.

The board also launched a strategic review to explore alternatives that could lead to a better offer than MEG's current plan to be a standalone company.

In May, oil and gas producer Strathcona Resources said it planned to launch a hostile takeover bid for MEG Energy, valuing its rival's stock at $23.27 per share. MEG's last close was $25.71.

Later, MEG advised its shareholders to not take action on the unsolicited takeover bid.

Since 2020, Strathcona, owned by Calgary-based private equity firm Waterous Energy Fund, has become one of the fastest-growing oil companies in North America through a series of acquisitions.

If the takeover were to go through, WEF would own 51-per-cent stake in the combined company, making it a vehicle for WEF and its investors to sell their material ownership over time, MEG Energy said.

“This selling pressure, or even the perceived risk of such selling pressure, will place immediate and significant downward burden on the share price of the combined company for a prolonged period of time,” the company said in a statement.

Strathcona Resources did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.

Concerns raised that section 899 could backfire and also undermine dollar's safe haven status

Foreign investment into the US could be threatened by Donald Trump's new “revenge” taxes, analysts have warned.

A provision within the president's One Big Beautiful Bill Act will allow the US to apply higher taxes on foreign individuals, businesses and investors connected to jurisdictions that impose “unfair foreign taxes” on US individuals and companies.

Companies listed on the London Stock Exchange could choose to avoid the measure by redomiciling in New York.

Section 899, as it is called, classes digital service taxes and “diverted profits taxes” as unfair, along with any taxes that target US entities. It would allow US authorities to impose an additional tax starting at 5% and increasing by five percentage points annually, up to 20%.

Max Yoeli, a senior research fellow in the US and the Americas programme at Chatham House, says section 899 “threatens to further alienate foreign investors”.

It could chill investment into the US by calling into question its “fundamental openness”, he added in a comment piece.

The Italian bank UniCredit agrees that section 899 could further damage foreign investor sentiment towards US dollar-denominated assets. It could backfire on the US, it says, given the large amount of domestic assets held by foreigners.

“The list of countries that would fall into this category is long and encompasses most European countries, including Italy and Germany,” UniCredit told clients, saying that foreign investors had more than doubled their holdings of US assets over the past decade.

“Not only would this additional tax serve to finance corporate tax reductions, but it would also likely be used as a negotiating tool for the US in trade deals, especially as Republicans seem willing to withdraw from the global minimum tax framework.”

UniCredit also fears the dollar's safe haven status could be undermined if there are fresh tax disputes between the US and other countries.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act was passed by the US House of Representatives last month. The Senate is yet to approve the bill, with the White House setting a deadline of 4 July.

George Saravelos, the global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, warned last month that section 899 could allow the US administration to transform its trade war into a capital war by “explicitly using taxation on foreign holdings of US assets as leverage to further US economic goals”.

UK companies could certainly fall foul of section 899, as Britain operates a digital services tax aimed at tech multinationals, and a diverted profits tax designed to clamp down on tax avoidance by multinationals.

Goldman Sachs has calculated that UK corporates are “particularly exposed” to section 899, as roughly 30% of the revenues of companies listed on the FTSE 100 are generated in the US.

However, as companies that are majority-owned by US shareholders are exempt, City bosses may consider moving their stock market listing to New York, to dodge section 899.

“This ownership dynamic not only mitigates tax risk but also reinforces the strategic case for relisting in the US, where investor bases are deeper and more aligned with US revenue exposure,” the Goldman Sachs analysts said.

According to Goldman, the large UK companies with the most significant exposure to the US, and who are not majority-owned by US investors, are the media group Pearson, the business services group Experian, the pest control business Rentokil and the pharmaceuticals manufacturer Hikma.

Ashtead Group, Compass and Melrose also generate a large proportion of their sales stateside, but as they have majority US ownership they should be exempt from section 899.

French companies could also be at risk, as Paris operates a digital services tax on the revenues that large tech companies generate in France.

            A crystal-covered chair inspired by one of Vincent Van Gogh's most famous paintings was seriously damaged when a tourist sat on it while posing for a photograph, according to the Italian museum where the artwork is on display.
    


            Footage released by the Palazzo Maffei in Verona shows a man and woman taking turns to pose with the museum's “Van Gogh” chair, before the man sits on it, breaking its seat and two front legs.
    


            The woman then helps him up, before both hurry out of the room.
    


            Taking its name from the renowned Dutch painter, the work by Italian artist Nicola Bolla was inspired by Van Gogh's 1888 painting “Van Gogh's Chair,” which depicts a simple wooden chair positioned on a tile floor.
    


            Bolla's modern interpretation, which was made between 2006 and 2007, is covered with hundreds of Swarovski crystals.
    


            “They waited for the staff to leave the room,” Vanessa Carlon, the museum's director, said in a video posted on its social media. “And then… off they went, indifferent to what had happened.”

            Commenting on the CCTV footage, Carlon said: “What you just saw would be ridiculous if it hadn't, unfortunately, actually happened. The ultimate nightmare for any museum.”
    


            Initially, the museum was concerned that the chair would be unfixable because of its delicate design, but restorers did an “outstanding job,” Carlon said.
    


            “Fortunately, the piece is shining once again,” she added.
    


            The museum has reported the incident to the police, it told CNN Monday, adding that the identities of the people involved are not currently known.
    


            Palazzo Maffei released the CCTV footage of the incident, which happened in April, on Thursday, as a reminder to visitors of the importance of treating art with respect.
    


            “A special thanks to all of you who walk through the museum's rooms every day with care, attention and wonder,” it said in a statement. “Because art is not just to be seen. It is to be loved.”
    


            Other artworks have also fallen victim to gallery-goers in recent years.
    


            In April, a painting by Mark Rothko, thought to be worth tens of millions of dollars, was removed from display in a Dutch museum after it was damaged by a visiting child.
    


            Last year, a man shattered a sculpture by Chinese artist and activist Ai Weiwei during the opening of his exhibition at Palazzo Fava in the Italian city of Bologna.

MOSCOW, June 16. /TASS/. A reaction from the international community regarding Israel's attack on Iran that divided the global response into two camps was "a good lesson for everyone," Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday.

"We have certainly paid attention to this, and continue monitoring the situation in this regard," Peskov said at a news briefing in response to a question whether the Kremlin had noticed that the incident did not entail any sanctions against Israel and that only limited condemnation was voiced on behalf of the international community.

"We see that the international community in general is now split in terms of its assessments of the current developments into the camp of those who condemned the beginning of what is happening, and those who supported and tried to justify it," he continued.

"This is our statement. This is definitely a very good lesson for everyone," Peskov added.

Overnight into June 13, Israel kicked off Operation Rising Lion aimed against Iran's nuclear program. The Israel Defense Forces said that 200 fighter jets attacked more than 100 targets in Iran, including nuclear facilities.

On the evening of June 13, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps announced that Iran retaliated by attacking dozens of targets in Israel with missiles, including military facilities and air bases, striking, in particular, the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv. Israel said some targets were hit but most of the missiles were intercepted.

Order similar to those issued in Gaza a further sign Israeli campaign is evolving towards war of attrition

Middle East crisis – latest updates

Israeli forces issued an evacuation order to residents of a large part of Tehran on Monday, warning them of the imminent bombing of “military infrastructure” in the area in a social media post very similar to those regularly directed at Palestinians in Gaza over the past 20 months.

The post on X was from the account of the Israel Defense Forces' Arabic spokesperson, Col Avichay Adraee, and is a further sign of the evolving nature of the Israeli campaign against Iran, which began with attacks on air defences, nuclear sites and the military chain of command, but appears to have drifted towards a war of attrition focused on Iran's oil and gas industry and on the capital.

In another sign of the changing targets of the Israeli offensive, Iran's state TV announced on Monday evening that it was under attack, and had to cease live broadcasting.

The sound of an explosion could be heard in a live transmission, and the news presenter hurried off camera as dust and debris appeared in the studio. Cries of “Allahu Akbar” or “God is greatest” could be heard off-screen and the broadcast abruptly switched to pre-recorded programming.

Adraee's online post included a map depicting a significant area of the third district in northern Tehran shaded in red in the same manner he has presented evacuation orders for Palestinians.

“Dear citizens, for your safety, please leave the described area in the 3rd district of Tehran immediately,” the message said in Farsi.

“In the coming hours, the Israeli army will attack the military infrastructure of the Iranian regime in this area, as it has done in recent days in Tehran. Your presence in this area endangers your life.”

Speaking to personnel at Tel Nof air force base, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, confirmed the evacuation orders.

“The Israeli air force controls the skies over Tehran. This changes the entire campaign,” he said.

“When we control the skies over Tehran, we strike regime targets, as opposed to the criminal Iranian regime which targets our civilians and comes to kill women and children. We tell the people of Tehran to evacuate, and we act.”

Netanyahu later said killing Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Hosseini Khamenei, would “end the conflict” in what would be another ominous escalation.

After the surprise Israeli attack on Friday morning, Iran has carried out retaliatory missile strikes on Israeli cities, focusing on the most populated areas between Tel Aviv and the port of Haifa.

Both sides have targeted each other's oil and gas facilities, increasing the threat of environmental disaster, and explosions were reported on Monday near oil refineries in southern Tehran.

Earlier on Monday, Iran threatened to leave the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) as Israeli bombing raids entered a fourth day, underlining the conflict's potential to trigger a broader war and Tehran's race to construct a nuclear weapon.

The human cost of the war continued to escalate with both sides broadening their range of targets, as G7 leaders convened in the Canadian Rockies with no clear plan to end the conflict. There were reports on Monday that Donald Trump was refusing to sign a joint statement calling for the conflict to be scaled down.

“They should talk, and they should talk immediately,” Trump said of Tehran during the summit. “I'd say Iran is not winning this war.”

The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Iran was sending a message to Israel and the US through Arab intermediaries that it was seeking a cessation of hostilities and a resumption of talks on its nuclear programme.

The same report, however, said its stance was that it would only go back to the table if Israel halted its offensive. There was no sign on Monday of Israel contemplating a pause.

Iran's health ministry said 224 people in Iran had been killed by Israeli attacks, 90% of them civilian, and more than 1,400 had been injured. Israel's defence minister, meanwhile, threatened further bombing strikes on Tehran, where an exodus of residents has been reported, clogging roads out of the capital.

In Israel, at least 23 civilians have been killed in Iran's retaliatory missile strikes since Israel's initial surprise attack on Friday morning, and nearly 600 have been injured, according to official sources.

The Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson, Esmaeil Baghaei, announced on Monday that Iran's parliament, the Majlis, was preparing a bill that would withdraw the country from the 1968 NPT agreement, which obliges it to forego nuclear weapons and to undergo international inspections to verify compliance. Baghaei added that Tehran remained opposed to the development of weapons of mass destruction.

The country's president, Masoud Pezeshkian, also insisted that Iran did not intend to develop nuclear weapons but would pursue its right to nuclear energy and research. He pointed out that Ali Khamenei, had issued a religious edict against weapons of mass destruction.

Israel is the only Middle East state with nuclear weapons and did not sign the NPT, but has never formally acknowledged its arsenal.

It is seeking to maintain its monopoly with airstrikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, claiming that Tehran was close to building a bomb. Previous assessments by US intelligence and the UN nuclear watchdog found no evidence that Iran had begun work on assembling a nuclear weapon.

Israeli critics of the offensive say it cannot destroy Iran's reserve of nuclear knowhow – though Israel has targeted Iranian nuclear scientists, claiming to have killed 14 – and could push the leadership into ordering the assembly of nuclear warheads.

There were reports on Monday of Israeli strikes on the Tehran headquarters of the Revolutionary Guards al-Quds force, an expeditionary arm deployed in foreign wars.

Despite Israeli claims to have air superiority over much of Iran, Iranian forces have still been able to launch ballistic missiles from their territory and some continue to evade Israel's multi-layered air defences. Israel Defense Forces officials estimate that it is has been able to intercept 80-90% of Iran's missiles, with 5-10% hitting actual residential areas.

Eight more Israelis were killed overnight by Iranian missile strikes, including four in Petah Tikva where a missile hit an apartment block. Three people died from blasts in Haifa and an elderly man was killed when his home collapsed from the shockwave from an explosion in Bnei Brak, east of Tel Aviv.

Iran's Revolutionary Guards claimed to have begun “more powerful and deadly” strikes and to have found a way of causing confusion in Israeli air defence systems. There was no immediate way of independently verifying the claim.

US forces have so far helped Israel intercept Iranian missiles, but have not taken part, at least overtly, in offensive bombing operations. On Monday, however, Reuters quoted two unnamed US officials as saying the movement of more than 30 military refuelling aircraft to Europe was intended to give Trump more options in the Middle East. Such tankers allow warplanes to refuel in mid-air and enable more sorties a day in wartime.

As Tehran residents evacuated the capital in increasing numbers, Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, threatened to make Tehranis “pay the price” for Ali Khamenei's decision to keep firing missiles at Israel in retaliation for the Israeli attack.

The Iranian state-backed news agency Fars reported that the authorities had executed a man found guilty of spying for Israel's intelligence agency, the Mossad. It was the third execution of an alleged spy in recent weeks.

Moscow will insist that Ukraine dismantle and destroy all Western-supplied weapons as part of any ceasefire deal, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said in an interview with the state-run newspaper Izvestia published June 16. 

"All these surpluses must be destroyed. All international algorithms are known. They must be reduced, disposed of, and guaranteed," Grushko said, without offering specifics.

The remarks reflect Moscow's growing list of maximalist demands presented in its so-called "peace memorandum" during recent negotiations with Ukraine in Istanbul on June 2. 

The document calls for Ukraine to recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea and four partially occupied regions — Kherson, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Luhansk — and demands full Ukrainian troop withdrawal and demobilization. 

Grushko argued that Western weapons aid threatens not only Russia but also Europe, warning that arms could end up on black markets. 

"It's crazy how reckless some politicians are, still flooding the market with weapons," he said.

There is no credible evidence that Kyiv has diverted Western weapons or fueled arms trafficking — a narrative promoted by Russian propaganda to undermine support for Kyiv.

Independent oversight by partner states and institutions has consistently found that Ukraine uses Western weapons to defend itself against Russia's full-scale invasion.

Moscow's proposals would further prevent Ukraine from joining NATO or military alliances, prohibit its armed forces' redeployment, and stop all Western military aid and intelligence sharing.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has rejected Moscow's demands, saying the Russian delegation admitted in Istanbul that their "memorandum" is an ultimatum Ukraine cannot accept. 

"They even told our delegation: we know that our memorandum is an ultimatum, and you will not accept it," he said in a June 10 interview with Hungarian outlet Valasz Online.

In contrast, Ukraine's proposal focused on humanitarian measures, including a prisoner exchange, the return of abducted children, and securing the right to join the EU and NATO. 

Kyiv has also called for using frozen Russian assets to pay for reconstruction and linking any sanctions relief to a verified ceasefire. 

Despite two rounds of talks in May and June, no political breakthrough has been reached. Moscow continues to reject calls for an unconditional ceasefire, while Ukraine presses for an end to hostilities. 

U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly shown frustration over Russia's refusal to compromise, yet he has refrained from imposing new sanctions.

Iran called on U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday to force Israel to cease fire as the only way to end the four-day-old aerial war, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country was on the “path to victory.”

Israeli forces stepped up their bombardment of Iranian cities, while Iran proved capable of piercing Israeli air defences with one of its most successful volleys yet of retaliatory missile strikes.

“If President Trump is genuine about diplomacy and interested in stopping this war, next steps are consequential,” Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on X.

“Israel must halt its aggression, and absent a total cessation of military aggression against us, our responses will continue. It takes one phone call from Washington to muzzle someone like Netanyahu. That may pave the way for a return to diplomacy.”

Iran fired a new wave of missile attacks on Israel early Monday, killing at least eight people, while Israel said it had gained 'aerial superiority' over Iran's capital.

The Associated Press

Sources told Reuters that Tehran had asked Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Oman to press Trump to use his influence on Israel to agree to an immediate ceasefire. In return, Iran would show flexibility in nuclear negotiations, said the two Iranian and three regional sources.

Netanyahu told Israeli troops at an air base that Israel was on its way to achieving its two main aims: wiping out Iran's nuclear program and destroying its missiles.

“We are on the path to victory,” he said. “We are telling the citizens of Tehran: ‘Evacuate' – and we are taking action.”

An Iranian state television reporter had to stop a live broadcast Monday when an explosion occurred an hour after Israel issued a warning to evacuate the area of Tehran where the TV studios are located.

The reporter for the Islamic Republic of Iran News Network said the studio was filling with dust after “the sound of aggression against the homeland, the sound of aggression against truth and righteousness.”

Anchor Sahar Emami rushed off-camera as the screen behind her cut out, and people were heard saying “Allahu akbar,” the Arabic phrase for God is great.

The broadcast quickly switched to pre-recorded programs. Soon, Emami came back live from another studio and was seen speaking with another anchor. She said that “bodies of reporters” were at the site of the initial broadcast, and images showed smoke and flames in the sky.

Israel's defense minister took credit for the attack.

“The Iranian regime's propaganda and incitement broadcasting authority was attacked by the IDF after a widespread evacuation of the area's residents,” Israel Katz said in a statement. “We will strike the Iranian dictator everywhere.”

An hour earlier, the Israeli military had issued an evacuation warning affecting up to 330,000 people in a part of central Tehran that includes the country's state TV and police headquarters, as well as three large hospitals. The IDF has issued similar evacuation warnings for civilians in parts of Gaza and Lebanon ahead of strikes.

Israel launched its air war on Friday with a surprise attack that killed nearly the entire top echelon of Iran's military commanders and its leading nuclear scientists. It has said it now has control of Iranian airspace and intends to escalate its campaign in coming days.

Tehran's retaliation is the first time in decades of shadow war and proxy conflict that missiles fired from Iran have pierced Israeli defences in significant numbers and killed Israelis in their homes.

A timeline of the Israel-Iran conflict and tensions between the two countries

Iran says more than 224 Iranians have been killed, most of them civilians. Media published images of wounded children, women, and the elderly from cities across the country. State TV broadcast scenes of collapsed presidential buildings, burned-out cars, and shattered streets in Tehran. Many residents were trying to flee the capital, describing queues for petrol and bank machines that were out of cash.

“I am desperate. My two children are scared and cannot sleep at night because of the sound of air defence and attacks, explosions. But we have nowhere to go. We hid under our dining table,” Gholamreza Mohammadi, 48, a civil servant, told Reuters by phone from Tehran.

In Israel, 24 people have been killed so far in Iran's missile attacks, all of them civilians. Round the clock television images showed rescuers working in ruins of flattened homes.

“It's terrifying because it's so unknown,” said Guydo Tetelbaum, 31, a chef in Tel Aviv who was in his apartment when the alerts came in shortly after 4 a.m. (9 p.m. ET). He had tried to reach a shelter but his door was blown in.

“This could be the beginning of a long time like this. Or it could get worse, or hopefully better, but it's the unknown that's the scariest.”

Trump has consistently said that the Israeli assault could end quickly if Iran agrees to U.S. demands that it accept strict curbs to its nuclear program.

Talks between the United States and Iran, hosted by Oman, had been scheduled for Sunday but were scrapped, with Tehran saying it could not negotiate while under attack. On Monday, Iranian lawmakers floated the idea of quitting the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, a move bound to be seen as a setback for any negotiations.

Before dawn on Monday, Iranian missiles struck Tel Aviv and Haifa, killing at least eight people and destroying homes. Israeli authorities said a total of seven missiles fired overnight had landed in Israel. At least 100 people were wounded. Iran's Revolutionary Guards said the latest attack employed a new method that caused Israel's multi-layered defence systems to target each other so missiles could get through.

“The arrogant dictator of Tehran has become a cowardly murderer who targets the civilian home front in Israel to deter the IDF,” Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said.

“The residents of Tehran will pay the price, and soon.”

Global oil prices had shot up on Friday at the prospect of conflict disrupting supplies from the Gulf. Prices eased somewhat on Monday, suggesting traders think exports could be spared despite Israeli attacks that hit domestic Iranian oil and gas targets.

Still, the sudden killing of so many Iranian military commanders and the apparent loss of control of airspace could prove to the biggest test of the stability of Iran's system of clerical rule since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

Iran's network of regional allies who could once have been expected to rain rockets on Israel – Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon – have been decimated by Israeli forces since the start of the Gaza war.

Netanyahu has said that, while toppling the Iranian government is not Israel's primary aim, it believes that could be the outcome.

Iran's currency has lost at least 10 per cent of its value against the U.S. dollar since the start of Israel's attack.

CCTV footage captured the moment a missile struck in Israel's Petah Tikva killing at least three people and injuring dozens on Monday, according to police. Reuters was able to confirm the location of the video as Petah Tikva from the buildings, the fences and the road layout, which matched street view imagery of the area.

An Israeli strike hit Iran's state broadcaster on Monday as Iran called on U.S. President Donald Trump to force a ceasefire in the four-day-old aerial war, while Israel's Prime Minister said his country was on the “path to victory.”

Israeli forces stepped up their bombardment of Iranian cities, while Iran proved capable of piercing Israeli air defences with one of its most successful volleys yet of retaliatory missile strikes.

Late on Monday, Israel said it had hit Iran's broadcasting authority, and footage showed a newsreader hurrying from her seat as a blast struck. Iran's State News Agency also reported the strike.

Israel's Defence Minister said Israel had attacked the broadcaster after the evacuation of local residents.

Meanwhile, Iranian state media reported that Iran was preparing for the “largest and most intense missile attack” yet against Israel. 

Israel launched its air war on Friday with a surprise attack that killed nearly the entire top echelon of Iran's military commanders and its leading nuclear scientists. It says it now has control of Iranian airspace and intends to escalate the campaign in coming days.

President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed Russian claims of significant battlefield gains, calling them part of a disinformation campaign during an interview with Bild published on June 12.

Zelensky rejected claims of Russian advance as "a Russian narrative," insisting that Ukraine's forces have been holding off a renewed offensive for nearly three weeks.

"The Russians are not so successful, to say the least," Zelensky said.

His remarks come amid a surge in Russian military operations across Ukraine's eastern and northern regions, including Russian claims of territorial gains in Dnipropetrovsk and Sumy oblasts — assertions Kyiv denies.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the Russian state media on June 9 that the offensive in Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk Oblast aims to establish a so-called "buffer zone" on Ukrainian territory. 

The statement followed Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier announcement that Moscow intends to create security corridors along Ukraine's borders with Russia's Kursk, Bryansk, and Belgorod regions.

Ukrainian officials denied any Russian advances into Dnipropetrovsk. 

"As of the morning of June 9, all Russian information, including Peskov's statements, about an offensive in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast does not correspond to reality," said Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation.

Ukraine's Southern Operational Command described the situation as "tense" but said no breakthroughs had occurred. 

Despite the absence of confirmed ground incursions, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast has faced frequent missile and drone attacks. In April, the region initiated mandatory evacuations from four front-line villages as a precautionary measure.

Separately, open-source monitoring group DeepState showed some advances near the Russian border in Sumy Oblast. On June 8, DeepState confirmed that Russian troops had occupied the village of Loknia in Ukraine's Sumy Oblast.

Located about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of Sumy, the village lies close to the Russian border in an increasingly volatile region. The Ukrainian General Staff has not commented on the development.

According to an article by Ukrainska Pravda, Russian forces began advancing into northern Sumy Oblast in late February or early March, taking advantage of the withdrawal of Ukraine's most combat-capable units. These were reportedly replaced by newly formed, under-resourced brigades with minimal combat experience and limited equipment.

Since March, Russia has reportedly taken control of about 200 square kilometers (80 square miles) in northern Sumy Oblast, including roughly a dozen small villages. The advances have triggered civilian evacuations. As of May 31, regional authorities ordered the evacuation of 213 settlements.

TEHRAN, June 16. /TASS/. At least ten Iranian air defense personnel were killed while repelling Israeli strikes in the northwestern city of Urmia, the YJC news agency reported.

According to its information, the deceased were serving in the third division of the air defense forces, stationed in the province of West Azerbaijan.

Overnight into June 13, Israel kicked off Operation Rising Lion aimed against Iran's nuclear program. Less than 24 hours later, Iran launched a retaliatory attack. In the following days, Tel Aviv and Tehran exchanged strikes again. Both sides reported casualties resulting from these attacks and acknowledged hits on several targets within their territories, though they claimed the damage was limited.

Netflix's Trainwreck: Mayor of Mayhem is an hour-long documentary on Rob Ford.Netflix/Netflix

We're coming up on 10 years since Rob Ford's death – and the memories of his four-year rumble as Toronto's mayor have happily blurred into the middle distance of the past.

The post-Ford panic that led the city to play possum politically for a decade by electing John Tory over and over seems to have finally lifted. 

Torontonians ultimately decided to just move on – name an arena in Etobicoke after Ford last year to placate those who view him as a hero of Hogtown's hoi polloi, but otherwise pretend like that never happened. 

Alas, here comes Trainwreck: Mayor of Mayhem out on Netflix on Tuesday to rudely reopen old wounds and remind us of our world-class shame. 

There's that infamous “crack video” again – there were two, actually – and all those shots of Ford running, running, running, around city hall or smack into a city councillor, while the city itself stood still in what now seem like crucial years wasted.

Why make Canadians cringe anew at Ford struggling with his demons in public and emitting sordid soundbites about “drunken stupors” and how he had “more than enough to eat at home”? Did all that sound and fury signify something?

Trainwreck: Mayor of Mayhem treats Ford largely as the stand-alone story about an addict possessed of a certain chaotic charisma who ended up a leader of the fourth largest city in North American thanks to an electorate momentarily miffed by a garbage strike. 

Elbows (and bottoms) up: The down-low on the upfronts at Corus, Rogers, Bell Media and CBC

It has nothing to say about his legacy in burying the myth of Toronto as “New York run by the Swiss” – or the endurance and evolution of the Ford Nation phenomenon under his brother Doug Ford's mantle.

Indeed, the hour-long doc is designed to only have passing interest in its subject. It's part of an “anthology documentary series” produced for the streamer by Raw TV, a London-based film and television company, that revisits media circuses from the past quarter century. 

A brand that started in 2022 with the three-part Trainwreck: Woodstock '99 now has a shorter attention span; its first episode this season re-examined the fatal Astroworld Festival crowd crush in Houston in 2021, and the episode to come after its documentary on Ford will be on the so-called “poop cruise” disaster of 2013. 

That “remember that terrible thing?” focus, or lack thereof, makes Trainwreck feel like the flipside of those old VH1 I Love… nostalgia series. It's an approach no doubt in tune with our times – kind of an I Love to Hate... the 2010s.

While Torontonians may be frustrated by this framing, at least Mayor of Mayhem is not one of those docs that tries to come up with a contrarian pseudo-compassionate view on a maligned figure from the past. 

Ford is here exactly as you remembered before you blocked it out. “This, folks, reminds me of when Saddam attacked Kuwait,” he said, after city council finally stripped him of his powers. “You guys have just attacked Kuwait.”

Mayor of Mayhem interviews three groups of people who were immersed in the mayhem: The journalists who tried to expose its true extent; the municipal politicians who eventually stopped it; and the members of Ford's inner circle who say they tried to temper it.

Ford's chief of staff Mark Towhey, fired after he kept strongly suggesting his boss go to rehab, comes across a hero of sorts, while the mayor's receptionist Tom Beyers, whose wife left him during this period of overwork, paints himself as a true believer who felt duped when he learned that a crack video did exist. 

As for the journalists, Robyn Doolittle, who moved from the Toronto Star to The Globe and Mail newsroom during that period and literally wrote the book on Ford's time in office (Crazy Town), is interviewed, of course. 

So too is Katie Simpson, then with CP24 and now a Washington correspondent for CBC; she was star of a viral clip, where she turned to the camera and reacted in genuine shock to a sexually explicit soundbite that I heard unbleeped here for the first time and is, indeed, still stunning. 

But David Rider, who was then city hall bureau chief of the Toronto Star, makes clear that the Ford phenomenon was not actually good for the press, naming the post-Ford elephant in the room: “Rob Ford demonizing the media years before Donald Trump did the same thing was extremely effective.” 

Doolittle recounts death threats she received – and reminds viewers that though she had viewed the crack video first, if it weren't for the American site Gawker breaking the story, she might not have been able to report on it given Canada's plaintiff-friendly defamation laws.

What would have happened if Ford were mayor today – with Gawker since bankrupted by a lawsuit backed by an anti-democratic tech billionaire, and the proliferation of deepfakes making the bar for reporting on videos even higher? What would have happened if Ford hadn't got sick during his re-election campaign for that matter?

I feel that panic again. Thanks a lot, Trainwreck: Mayor of Mayhem, for pulling my head back out of the sand.

The Salt Lake City Police Department said on Sunday that a man they believe was an innocent bystander was shot and killed during a “No Kings” anti-Trump protest in the city.

Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, a 39-year-old resident of Utah, was fatally shot while attending protests against federal immigration enforcement raids in downtown Salt Lake City on June 14. Police said that Ah Loo was not the intended target of the gunfire.

On June 13, Israel initiated a series of airstrikes and covert operations against Iranian nuclear sites and military officials. Dubbed Operation Rising Lion, this sophisticated and multilayered campaign followed days of speculation about an impending assault. So far, the attacks have damaged Iran's Natanz and Isfahan nuclear facilities and killed a number of Iranian scientists. They have also claimed the lives of scores of civilians and injured dozens more, razed apartment buildings, and blown up parts of the country's energy infrastructure. Israelis, meanwhile, have found themselves rushing to shelters as their own cities come under attack.

Right now, there is no indication that the fighting will stop. Both Iran and Israel have signaled that they are willing to keep striking each other. Israel's defense minister even promised that “Tehran will burn” if the attacks don't end. The United States, meanwhile, has done little to stop the bloodshed. Instead, U.S. President Donald Trump has sent mixed signals about whether he wants the fighting to cease. His administration has positioned military assets in the area, and according to multiple news reports, U.S. forces are helping Israel shoot down Iranian drones and missiles.

Despite his equivocations, however, Trump has said he still wants to reach a nuclear deal with Iran, and Tehran has left the door open to talks—provided that Israel lets up. The U.S. administration, then, may still have space to forge an agreement.

If Trump wants to avoid a U.S. war with Iran, he should seize it. So far, Israel has inflicted significant but not total damage on Iran's nuclear program. Even if the fighting drags on, it is unlikely to succeed at wiping out all of it. Elements of Iran's nuclear program are deeply buried underground, including at the Fordow enrichment site, and the country's leadership may now have more of an incentive than ever to build the ultimate deterrent. That means if the fighting stops without a deal, Tehran could well make a run for a nuclear weapon that only heavy bunker-busting American bombs can seriously delay, at least in the near term. Even then, to truly assure that the threat has been curtailed, the United States would need either a presence on the ground or sustained rounds of military strikes carried out with exhaustive knowledge of Iran's nuclear operations.

A diplomatic settlement represents the best and most sustainable way for Trump to avoid both a nuclear Iran and a protracted military entanglement. In fact, it may be the only way to avert an unacceptable outcome.

Since returning to office in January 2025, Trump had suggested that he wanted to reach an agreement with Iran on its nuclear program. Israel has made clear its preference for a military solution, however, unless Iran completely capitulates over the program. Israel also made clear that it believed that now was the time to act. Tehran's defensive capabilities did not recover after a series of pinpoint strikes that Israel carried out last October. Iran's proxies, including Hezbollah, are still on their knees after months of Israeli attacks. The Israeli government thus saw a golden opportunity to debilitate its nemesis.

Israel's current campaign against Iran is far broader than its previous ones. Approximately 200 Israeli aircraft targeted around 100 sites, including nuclear facilities and military bases, in the initial wave of strikes last week. Covert operations by the Mossad targeted Iranian leaders, resulting in the deaths of key figures in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and prominent nuclear scientists. As the exchanges between the two countries have grown more severe, and Iran has retaliated with drones and missiles, both sides have broadened their targets.

Given the breadth of Israel's assault, Iranian leaders likely concluded that Israel wants to wipe out not just their nuclear program but also their regime itself. Although Iran lacks the capabilities of its enemy—its intelligence is no match for Israel's, and its airpower is nonexistent—Tehran felt it had no choice but to retaliate as forcefully as possible. So far, at least in the opening days, this has largely been confined to a bilateral conflict. But Iran may opt to externalize its costs—hitting U.S. bases in the region, striking energy infrastructure in the Gulf, and targeting shipping lanes in the Strait of Hormuz, for example—which would plunge the region into turmoil. By doing so, Iranian officials might hope they can get Washington to lean on Israel to stop.



But if the war expands, Iran and the United States might find themselves fighting directly, especially if American assets and interests come under fire. In repeated statements, U.S. officials have warned Tehran against such attacks, lest American forces, in the words of Trump, “come down on you at levels never seen before.” Should Iranian attacks or attacks by Iran's nonstate partners lead to American casualties, the pressure on the U.S. president to act decisively and enter the war would increase dramatically.

Even if the United States avoids fighting in this conflict, without a deal, it risks getting pulled into a future one. Israeli military operations over the past year have logged successes against Hezbollah and against Iran itself, degrading many of its enemies' air defenses. Still, most estimates suggest that Israel could set Iran's nuclear program back by only a few months, or a year at best. It would take intense American military might to destroy much of Tehran's capacity to build a nuclear weapon. And depending on how Iran has structured its program, stopping a bomb may require no less than a toppling of the Islamic Republic. That is why Israeli officials are more explicitly sounding the call for regime change. Yet they have paid little heed to what would actually replace the current system. In the absence of a viable, united, and organized alternative inside or outside Iran, the fall of the Islamic Republic might send the country into a period of civil strife—or lead to a military dictatorship determined to obtain nuclear deterrence.

For an American president who has sought to position himself as a peacemaker rather than a belligerent, the present situation ought to be ringing loud alarm bells. Many of Trump's constituents oppose renewed U.S. military involvement in the Middle East. A massive war would also cause oil prices to spike, further burdening American consumers struggling with inflation. In fact, oil prices are already rising. Trump will thus benefit if the fighting stops, and suffer if it expands.

Right now, Trump seems to hope that the combination of growing economic and military harm to Iran will force the government into agreeing to dismantle its nuclear program. But an all-or-nothing offer from the United States is unlikely to resonate with a regime that has rejected such terms for more than two decades—including in five rounds of negotiations with Trump's administration. The only thing Iranian leaders view as more perilous for their self-preservation than the suffering wreaked by Israeli bombs is surrendering to American terms. Instead, the current onslaught will probably prompt Iran to keep responding with aggression until it can have at least a semblance of an acceptable off-ramp.

To avoid the worst-case scenarios, Trump will therefore need to take a different approach. He must first persuade Iran that he is not just a front for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by pressing Israel to stop fighting. To do so, he could threaten to suspend weapons aid to Israel. This is the most crucial source of leverage that Washington has; it would be extremely difficult for Israel to carry out military campaigns without it. Previous U.S. presidents, including Joe Biden, have been reluctant to use it. (Biden refused to wield such threats to pressure Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza.) But now, American lives and Trump's legacy may be at stake. The president might diverge from his predecessor if he decides that U.S. interests require containing rather than fueling the deepening crisis.

Trump will also need to cajole Iran. Outgunned by Israel and, at least for now, with degraded nuclear leverage, Tehran is probably open to returning to the table to save its neck. More important, it needs to save face.The White House should warn Tehran that further escalation could result in American casualties and suck the United States into the conflict. Yet it should also offer Iran a reasonable nuclear deal that includes significant and sustainable sanctions relief. Trump could, for example, promise to roll back nuclear-related U.S. sanctions and end the primary U.S. trade embargo if Iran wraps its uranium enrichment program into a multinational consortium with Saudi Arabia for that purpose—as Tehran expressed an openness to doing before Israel's attacks. Such a consortium would provide fuel for nuclear reactors across the region while depriving Iran of the fissile material it could use for a weapon.

There is precedent for this kind of American pressure. In 1982, U.S. President Ronald Reagan twisted Israel's arm to end its bombing of Beirut. In 1988, he intervened in the Iran-Iraq War, playing an essential role in persuading Tehran to accept a cease-fire. Such a course will not be easy for Trump. It would require the president to commit to difficult diplomacy while staring down fierce opposition in Washington from politicians and interest groups who see Israel's campaign as an overdue comeuppance for one of the United States' most bitter adversaries.

But if Trump is committed to a nuclear-free Iran, his best bet is to get the Iranians and Israelis to stop the war and bring Tehran back to the negotiating table. Without a deal, Iran's frightened government seems more likely than not to sprint for nuclear weapons as conditions allow. Then Trump would have to either accept a nuclear Iran or join another Israeli assault on the country, risking precisely the kind of catastrophic Middle East entanglement he promised to avoid.

Rural landowners say America's farms have become dumping grounds for sludge from the wastewater treatment plants of larger cities. They complain of foul odors, contaminated soil, health problems, and stormwater runoff contaminating streams, lakes, and groundwater with possibly dangerous chemicals.

The treated sewage sludge—known as “biosolids”— is the solid matter left from the wastewater treatment process. The sludge is removed from the bottom of the sewage plant tanks then treated to reduce pathogens for use as a soil amendment or fertilizer.

President Volodymyr Zelensky on June 15 condemned Russia's latest mass attack against Ukraine, calling the strikes on energy infrastructure "a spit in the face of everything the international community is trying to do to stop this war."

Earlier in the day, Russia targeted the city of Kremenchuk in Poltava Oblast with a combined missile and drone attack, damaging energy and agricultural facilities. The strike involved nearly 200 drones and missiles, including both cruise and ballistic missiles. The attack came shortly after a phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. 

In his nightly address, Zelensky said the attack on Kremenchuk was "deliberately and treacherously planned to target our civilian infrastructure" and that Russia intended to damage energy facilities. 

"This is Russia's spit in the face of everything the international community is trying to do to stop this war," Zelensky said in his nightly address. 

"It happened right after Putin's conversation with Trump. After the Americans asked us not to strike Russian energy facilities. At the same time as Putin tries to portray himself as a mediator for the Middle East ... The level of cynicism is staggering."

Following his call with Putin, Trump claimed he would be "open" to the Russian president acting as a mediator in the rapidly escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Zelensky rejected the idea of Putin — who has waged war against Ukraine for over 10 years and has taken no steps towards a lasting ceasefire — playing the role of peacemaker.

Putin "is war itself," Zelensky said, urging the international community not to fall for "Russian manipulation and lies." 

Zelensky also warned that Russia may be planning additional attacks on Ukraine's energy sector, including nuclear power infrastructure. According to the president, Ukrainian intelligence agencies have obtained evidence of Russia's threat and shared the information with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Trump administration. 

"Russia is planning further attacks on our energy sector — attacks that may be less visible to the world right now because all eyes are on the situation in the Middle East," he said. 

Throughout the full-scale war, Russia has attempted to disrupt Ukraine's power grid through targeted attacks on energy infrastructure. After rejecting a U.S. proposal for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire in March, Moscow instead agreed to a month-long ceasefire on energy attacks. 

Russia subsequently violated the partial ceasefire, which ended in in April. The Kremlin continues to refuse calls for an unconditional truce.

The intelligence chief of Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has been killed in an Israeli strike.

Brigadier General Mohammad Kazemi, head of the IRGC's Intelligence Organization, was assassinated along with two other intelligence officers, Hassan Mohaghdeh and Mohsen Bagheri, the Guards confirmed in a statement on Sunday evening.

The IRGC said it responded by launching missiles at Israeli “intelligence centers” as part of the third wave of its ongoing barrage, dubbed Operation True Promise III.

The killing of Kazemi was first announced by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in an interview with Fox News on Sunday. “I think we've set them back quite a bit,” Netanyahu told journalist Bret Baier.

Open hostilities erupted on Friday morning when IDF jets bombed military and nuclear sites across Iran in what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described as an operation to prevent the Islamic Republic from acquiring nuclear weapons. Tehran responded with a barrage of missiles, some of which struck residential areas in Tel Aviv and Bat Yam.

Israel also carried out targeted assassinations of senior Iranian commanders and veteran nuclear scientists after reportedly smuggling kamikaze drones into the country.

Iranian security officials said they discovered Israeli drones and explosives hidden in Tehran following the attacks.

'Ruthless' podcast co-hosts each share their take on the 'infighting' in the Democratic Party on 'One Nation.'


Milwaukee Bucks head coach Doc Rivers spoke up about what Democrats need to do in order to take back the White House after President Donald Trump defeated Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.

Rivers, who is a staunch opponent of Trump going back to the president's first term in office, said Democrats need to make a change and try to get everyone on the same side of issues.

"Well, the first thing we have to point towards is getting out of our comfort zone and thinking if we keep doing the same thing we are going to get different results," Rivers told MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace on her podcast. "That doesn't happen, there needs to be change from the Democratic side. I don't know what that change is, but I know the norm has not worked. The norm worked on the popular vote, but there are states that haven't voted on the Democratic side in 50 years.

"We are a party of being [inclusive], everybody is included, right? But I remember Cory Booker, we are at a function, and I ask him why can't the Democrats all agree on something, because the Republicans do that well. You have to look at some of the things they do well. One of the things they do is they fall in line. They don't care. If you listen to some of the things these guys said about Trump and then when you hear them speak now, all they do is praise, they are falling in line. But he said something interesting. He said we have so many groups on our side, we don't just have the White male. We have everybody, and to get everybody to agree on one thing is very difficult, but we're going to have to start doing that if we want change."

Rivers said one of the things Democrats need to get away from is the "Trump won because" debate. He made an analogy to how he would go about coaching a game if the team was coming off a loss.

"I think we need to take the ‘because' out, and I am serious. Trump won and start there, not ‘because.' Trump won and what do we have to do differently? You have to take ownership of things. We do it in sports all the time," he told Wallace.

"Yeah, I come in after a game we lost ‘because.' But then I say we lost, but we have to do these things differently if we want to win. We can't just say we lost because ‘they just made a lot of shots.' Then we have to force them to miss more shots, we have to do something different. It is so strange we are blaming the people who voted for Trump for why he won. It makes no sense to me. It'd backwards."

Rivers said the bottom line was the Democrats didn't get enough people to actually go out and vote.

"We didn't get enough people out to vote," he said. "That is one thing. We have to figure out, first start with ourselves, how can we ignite ourselves, our side to vote more, because we have more people to vote. We have to make them excited, we have to connect to them. We're not connecting.

"We complain about Black men. You know, the majority of Black men did vote for Kamala, as it turns out. It is just that it wasn't a big majority. It wasn't enough people. Why is that? There is a feel of hopelessness in our community. I think a lot of Black men are saying now it does not matter, either side, we are not being helped, we are still being incarcerated. We still are struggling. So there has got to be an answer. And we have to figure out how we can answer that question if we are looking at that part of it for sure."

(The Center Square) – Legislative attorneys are meeting with the speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives to determine the next steps for a lawmaker who promoted a sign reflecting pursuit of the decapitation of President Donald Trump.

Speaker Destin Hall, R-Caldwell, spoke about the acts by Wake County Democratic Rep. Julie von Haefen in a statement Sunday evening. Members of Congress from coast to coast also weighed in as the news went viral.

“Her disgraceful behavior fails to meet the standards expected from House members and sets a dangerous precedent in an already volatile political climate,” Hall said in part. “I am examining next steps with our legislative attorneys to ensure this behavior does not continue.”

The state's first-term Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, the North Carolina Democratic Party and the Democratic National Committee remained silent Monday morning, about 48 hours since the post first appeared.

The Center Square reached out to von Haefen's office on Sunday at 2:51 p.m. At 3 p.m., she posted an explanation to her Facebook page. Increasing calls for her resignation followed, including the House speaker's statement about three hours later.

U.S. Rep. Dr. Greg Murphy, R-N.C., says von Haefen “calls for the beheading of the U.S. president. These libs have lost their mind. The nation is not behind them.”

Using his personal account and not that tied to his U.S. Senate seat, Republican Utah Sen. Mike Lee said, “Calling for the president of the United States to be beheaded is un-democratic. It should also be un-Democratic. Tragically, it seems increasingly on-brand for today's Democrats.”

The post by von Haefen was made Saturday morning. Her Facebook account remained active Sunday but her account on X was gone.

“Deleting your public profile isn't accountability – it's hiding,” said state Rep. Brenden Jones, R-Columbus. “North Carolinians deserve better.”

Monday morning, he added, “It has been over a day since Julie von Haefen posted a picture depicting the execution of the president and not a single North Carolina House Democrat has condemned her actions. Their silence speaks volumes.”

On social media, von Haefen is accused of posting an image of a woman holding signage with the image of a bloody, used guillotine; the words “In these difficult times, some cuts may be necessary”; and a prop on one end of the handle representing a beheaded Trump. The other end also had a head, a German Nazi Party swastika scrawled across it.

Minutes after The Center Square sought authentication from her office, she posted to Facebook, “Yesterday, I posted a video on social media containing crowd photos from the No Kings protest in Raleigh. One of the images of a protestor holding a sign was inappropriate, and I later edited the video to remove the photo.

“Let me be clear: I condemn political violence in all forms. My focus remains on bringing people together and fighting for the values that matter to North Carolinians. Like so many, I was horrified by the violence in Minnesota. There is no place for that kind of extremism in our democracy, no matter the target, no matter the party.”

Von Haefen did not offer an apology.

Her caption on Saturday morning said, “No Kings Protest in Raleigh. Amazing turnout all across the Triangle today, including this event at the Capitol hosted by Wake Democrats and North Carolina Democrats.” There were hashtags for an expletive, no kings and Raleigh.

The image, however, drew the criticism. Some was on von Haefen's act itself, others said it was the timing of the shootings in Minnesota which took the lives of a state representative and her husband, and injured a state senator and his wife.

State Rep. Mike Schietzelt, R-Wake, called von Haefen's actions “unconscionable.”

Trump survived an assassination attempt on July 13 of last year in Butler, Pa. On Sept. 15, he was golfing in Florida when a man with a rifle was found hiding adjacent to the property in what many believe was to be a second attempt on his life.

Former NFL star Joe Theismann will enter the 2025 American Century Championship as one of the veterans in the celebrity golf tournament.

Though the former Washington Redskins quarterback has only won the Korbel Hole-In-One Contest at Edgewood Tahe Golf Club, he told Fox News Digital he is as excited as ever to be a part of the tournament once again this year.

"I've played in 35 of 36 (tournaments)," he said. "I certainly circle those days. The American Century Championship has been unbelievable as far as competition goes, the people you get a chance to be around."

Theismann highlighted the charitable component of the American Century Championship as well. Millions of dollars are raised during the festivities to benefit the Stowers Institute for Medical Research and the Eat. Learn. Play. Foundation.

"American Century puts on a great week for their customers and for all of us. They have karaoke nights, and they have great dinners where you get a chance to interact and see people you haven't really seen," Theismann said. "My wife and I really look forward to it. You learn so much."

He said he got to talk to Buffalo Bills star Josh Allen about his 2023 season last year and delighted in speaking with actor Miles Teller.

"'Top Gun: Maverick' is one of my favorite movies in the world. So, I had a chance to see him last year. I was like a little kid," he said with a laugh. "He was on the range hitting balls. I didn't want to bother him, but I wanted to say hello."

Theismann was not embarrassed to admit he was a bit of a "fanboy" when it came to Teller.

"I'm not embarrassed," he told Fox News Digital. "There are certain people that I've met. I've been blessed to meet people, whether they're heads of state, heads of countries, many presidents, CEOs, some of the most incredible people in the world I've had a chance to meet and just to be able to continue to watch people and see them and really get to know what they're like, what makes them tick. That's what I enjoy – getting to know the person."

Theismann was tied with Joe Flacco and Jason Scheff last year and tied for 46th with A.J. Hawk and Seth Curry in 2023.

This year, he is hoping for some improvement, though he admitted his game is getting shorter and shorter as the years go on.

Theismann said fans can also get in on the action with a fantasy game that was developed for the tournament. He said fans can begin to register next week with the winner getting two tickets to next year's tournament and a $10,000 check to the charity of their choice.

The event is a 54-hole Stableford format in which golfers earn points for each hole based on the score to par. The golfer who achieves the most points wins.

Latin R&B singer Nezza made waves on Saturday at a Los Angeles Dodgers game after singing the “Star-Spangled Banner” in Spanish despite being told by the team to sing the national anthem in English. 

Nezza, whose full name is Vanessa Hernández, went on TikTok after the game, clipping together videos of a Dodgers representative telling her the song would be sung in English and her performing the anthem in Spanish. 

“Watch the Dodgers tell me I can't sing the Spanish ‘Star Spangled Banner' that Roosevelt literally commissioned in 1945,” showing her smile fading as the representative tells her, “We are going to be singing it in English today. I don't know if that was communicated.” 

The video then cuts to her singing the anthem in Spanish with the words, “So I did it anyway.”

In a follow-up post, she said she was “shaken up” and “emotional” and that she did not think she would be told not to sing it in Spanish, especially in Los Angeles. She got emotional and said that she could not sing it in English that day, “out of all days,” referring to the anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement riots that started in Los Angeles and the No Kings protests taking place nationwide.

i love you guys stay safe out there 

She ended the video by saying, “Safe to say I am never allowed in that stadium ever again.” However, a team official told the Los Angeles Times there were no consequences being perpetrated and that she is welcome back at the stadium. 

LOS ANGELES DODGERS ACCEPT INVITATION TO VISIT WHITE HOUSE

Nezza explained in her TikTok video that her parents are immigrants and longtime American citizens who, she said, she can't imagine being taken from her. She stated while crying that everything she does is “out of love” and “good energy” and that she was proud of herself for her actions. 

The Dodgers have largely been silent about the ICE raids and subsequent protests. Manager Dave Roberts said on Friday that he hasn't “dug enough and can't speak intelligently on it” but added last Monday that he hopes they are a “positive distraction” right now.Nezza is not the first singer to face backlash in performing the national anthem. Last October, Loomis dropped an F-bomb during her rendition at the Free & Equal Elections Presidential Debate. She apologized the next day.

Former NFL star Antonio Brown seemingly blamed the media as he faces an attempted murder charge stemming from a shooting in Miami outside a boxing event last month.

Brown made a scathing post about the media on Sunday and screenshotted an alleged conversation he had with ChatGPT, which he asked, "Is Antonio Brown being racial profile (sic)?"

"How TF you go from being victimized (into an) attempt to murder," he wrote in the post. "You see they control the media. Took a month to change the narrative. A year or 2 (of) them dragging the narrative. Attempt to murder.

"You see they only want 3 types of n----s. In America, in jail dead or dead broke."

He added the hashtagged words "Black man" and "takedown" at the end of the post.

The 36-year-old Super Bowl champion was accused of grabbing a handgun from a security staffer and firing two shots at a man he had gotten into a fistfight with earlier. The victim reportedly told officers one of the bullets grazed his neck.

A second-degree murder charge carries a maximum of 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine if Brown were to be convicted. The Washington Post first reported that Brown had a warrant out for his arrest last week.

Brown appeared to respond to the reports of a warrant in social media posts on Friday. He suggested he was in the Middle East in one clip and then posted a photo of himself in a boxing ring.

Kīlauea Volcano in Hawaii experienced dramatic lava fountaining over the weekend, with eruptions reaching 1,000 feet.

A tourist is lucky to be alive after plunging nearly 30 feet off a cliff and toward an erupting volcano while visiting a popular Hawaiian hot spot last week. 

In an attempt to get a better view of the Kīlauea volcanic eruption, the 30-year-old man from Boston wandered from the park's Byron Ledge Trail, but "got too close to the sheer cliff edge" on Wednesday, according to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. 

Luckily, a tree broke the man's fall, saving him from plunging "another hundred feet or so to the caldera floor, which could have resulted in his death."

Search and rescue teams that were already in the area to manage traffic began searching for the man at approximately 9 p.m., after receiving reports that an individual had plunged 30 feet below the cliff. 

The man – who was not carrying a flashlight or headlamp – was pulled to safety in a high-angle rescue by officials rappelling down the cliff and only suffered minor facial injuries, according to the park. 

The volcano is considered one of the world's most active and on the day of the accident, was erupting with lava fountains of more than 1,000 feet, according to the National Park Service.

Kīlauea began its latest activity in December 2024, "with eruptions separated by pauses lasting several days or more," Hawaii's National Park Service said. 

The incident comes after the park previously warned visitors to remain vigilant after a small child nearly plummeted into the active volcano just days after it began erupting.

"A toddler wandered off from his family and in a split second, ran straight toward the 400-foot cliff edge," the park said in a press release. "His mother, screaming, managed to grab him in the nick of time just a foot or so away from a fatal fall. Disaster was averted, and the shaken family departed." 

In addition to spewing hot lava, the volcano can also emit toxic gasses and "glassy volcanic particulates," called tephra, making close encounters with the natural phenomenon highly dangerous.

"The hazards that coincide with an eruption are dangerous, and we have safety measures in place including closed areas, barriers, closure signs, and traffic management," Park Superintendent Rhonda Loh previously said in a statement. "Your safety is our utmost concern, but we rely on everyone to recreate responsibility. National parks showcase nature's splendor but they are not playgrounds." 

The National Park Service did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

            President Donald Trump called for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to expand deportation efforts in Democratic cities and “do all in their power” to achieve mass deportations in a social media post Sunday.
    


            “ICE Officers are herewith ordered, by notice of this TRUTH, to do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History,” the president posted on Truth Social as he traveled on Air Force One to Canada for the G7 summit.
    


            The president's post comes as CNN has reported that ICE has been racing to meet White House arrest quotas and on the heels of Trump acknowledging that his immigration policies have impacted farmworkers and those in the hospitality industry.
    


            The White House has enlisted components across the federal government to achieve its goal of 3,000 immigration-related arrests per day. But while the Trump administration has publicly touted its enforcement efforts, officials have privately faced criticism for failing to meet that quota, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions.
    


            Trump also directed ICE in his social media post on Sunday to “expand efforts” in “the Democrat Power Center” while claiming without evidence that his political opponents are using “Illegal Aliens” to “cheat in Elections, and grow the Welfare State.”
    


            “We must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America's largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside,” Trump said.
    


            As long as quotas remain in place, ICE will likely have to ramp up arrests in communities, particularly if guardrails are set up around certain workplaces, according to multiple sources familiar with discussions.
    


            “We will follow the President's direction and continue to work to get the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens off of America's streets,” Homeland Security Department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN.
    


            An anticipated months long immigration enforcement operation has already been underway targeting around two dozen Democratic-led cities, according to a source familiar with the planning.
    


            Agents from various federal agencies, including from US Customs and Border Protection, have been assigned to fan out to those cities as the administration pushes to increase interior arrests, the source said.
    


            “We got to be more efficient. We put more teams out there. We've increased targeting, so we expect those numbers to increase,” White House border czar Tom Homan previously told CNN, referring to migrant arrests.

            The administration's immigration crackdown sparked protests in Los Angeles earlier this month, which prompted the president to mobilize both National Guard troops and Marines to deal with demonstrations over federal raids in the city.
    


            Protests have expanded across the country, culminating in scores of anti-Trump demonstrators taking to the streets in “No Kings” protests nationwide over the weekend.
    


            Since Trump took office, ICE, which had previously been operating with a set of guidelines focused on public safety and national security threats, has had to pivot as the key agency at the core of the president's campaign promise to carry out mass deportations. Recent arrests have taken place during routine immigration checks, and at immigration court and worksites.
    


            Immigration-enforcement operations have created a chilling effect on some industries heavily reliant on immigrant workforces, including farms and hotels, and as ICE races to fulfill Trump's goal to increase deportations. The president appeared to acknowledge Thursday that his immigration policies are straining those sectors.
    


            “Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,” Trump said on Truth Social. “We must protect our Farmers, but get the CRIMINALS OUT OF THE USA. Changes are coming!”

FOX NASCAR Insider Bob Pockrass joins Kevin Harvick's Happy Hour to explain the latest development in the NASCAR antitrust lawsuit. The U.S. Court of Appeals has vacated the injunction that previously protected 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsport...

Shane van Gisbergen picked up his first win of the NASCAR Cup Series season as the master of road-course racing drove to Victory Lane in Mexico City.

It was almost a disastrous Sunday for the New Zealand native. As he outpaced Christopher Bell by 16.567 seconds, he opened up about the "queasy" feeling that plagued him all day.

"I tried to treat it like when I go to Asia, just drink bottled water and be careful in the shower and brush your teeth with bottled water, but I just went downhill," he said. "Couldn't keep anything in. Everything just went straight through me. I felt really queasy, and my mind was there, but my body just had so much pressure in my stomach. Crazy weekend and everyone dug deep."

It appeared to be a tough week overall, which started with a mechanical issue on his team's charter flight that paused his initial trip to Mexico. He slept on the floor of his hauler before the race, unsure if he would be able to compete at Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez.

Regardless of the illness, van Gisbergen still managed to lead 60 of the 100 laps. The win gives him hope that he could earn a berth into the NASCAR Playoffs.

"It means everything to us, this is why I'm here," van Gisbergen said. "I am getting better and more competitive. We're really making a lot of progress."

The next race on the NASCAR Cup Series schedule is Pocono.

Van Gisbergen will enter the race 30th in the standings, but the victory in Mexico City will go a long way as long as 17 different drivers don't win races from here on out.

Iran's state-run news agency said Monday that its governmental television station abruptly stopped a live broadcast after an Israeli strike. During a live broadcast from the capital Tehran, the sound of an explosion could be heard as a the news presenter hurried off camera amid dust and debris wafting in the air. Afterwards, a fire could be seen at the state TV building.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Israeli strikes have set Iran's nuclear program back a “very, very long time.” He added that Israel is not attempting to topple the Iranian government, but said he would not be surprised if that happened as a result of the strikes.

“The regime is very weak,” Netanyahu said at a news conference. He added that he is in daily touch with U.S. President Donald Trump. As he spoke, large numbers of explosions were heard in Tehran.

What to know:



Rebuilding Iran's air defenses will be difficult due to both logistics and geopolitics, according to Hinz. He described Iran's air defenses as a “hodgepodge” of Russian, Chinese, Iranian and outdated American systems.

Russia, once a key supplier, is unlikely to sell Iran more systems amid its war in Ukraine and because Moscow doesn't want to hurt its “working relationship” with Israel, Hinz said. Any Russian air defense deliveries to Iran would likely be attacked by Israel, he said, and wouldn't offer an immediate fix because training and setup take time.

China has sold Iran short-range air defense systems, anti-drone lasers, and missile-related chemicals in the past, he said. But future sales are uncertain, since Beijing may be unwilling to risk diplomatic fallout with the West or Israel.

Iran has few viable options for striking back at Israel, largely because its key regional proxy Hezbollah has been “decapitated,” according to Fabian Hinz of the International Institute of Strategic Studies.

The Houthi rebels in Yemen, another of Iran's allies, depend on long-range Iranian missiles but supplies are limited, Hinz said. If Iran chose to strike using short-range missiles, he speculates it could transfer them to Shiite militias in Iraq, which are nearer to Israel.

Three Israeli mini-drones struck South Pars, the country's main gas production center, according to the state-run IRINN television channel. The report did not specify the extent of the damage.

Videos circulating on social media show the Iranian state TV building, known as “the glass building,” is still burning. 

Following the attack, live programs have been transferred to another studio that resembles those used for radio broadcasts.

During a live broadcast from the capital Tehran, the sound of an explosion could be heard as a the news presenter hurried off camera amid dust and debris wafting in the air. Afterwards, a fire could be seen at the state TV building.



The four European leaders met on the eve of the G7 summit Sunday night without President Donald Trump, who had yet to arrive at the venue in the Canadian Rockies.

It started when British Prime Minister Keir Starmer bumped into German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in a restaurant-bar area of the venue in the resort of Kananaskis. French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni dropped by and it became an hour-long informal meeting that discussed the conflict between Israel and Iran.

Efforts to de-escalate that conflict are a main focus of the two-day summit that officially started Monday.

The images captured Saturday by Planet Labs PBC show multiple buildings damaged or destroyed. The structures hit include buildings identified by experts as supplying power to the facility.

U.N. nuclear chief Rafael Grossi has said Iran's main underground enrichment site at Natanz was untouched by Israeli strikes.

Grossi told the U.N. Security Council on Friday that the above-ground section of the Natanz facility was destroyed. The main centrifuge facility underground didn't appear to be hit, but the loss of power could have damaged infrastructure there, he said.

Grossi said Monday that radiation levels outside the complex are presently normal.

He is the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency.

Journalists at the United Nations are pressing Israel's ambassador on why Iran's state television was attacked.

His reply: “Whoever is cooperating with this terror regime should be considering steps,” adding that Israel now has “very good control over the skies of Tehran.”

Ambassador Danny Dannon sidestepped questions about U.N. nuclear chief Rafael Grossi's claim that Iran's underground Natanz facility was untouched by Israeli strikes, but said Israel had “pushed back the nuclear program” and stressed the current operation is more complex than past strikes on reactors in Iraq or Syria.

As for peace talks, Danon said Iran must prove it's serious about dismantling its “machine of terror” before Israel would engage.

A significant number of explosions have been ringing out in Tehran for minutes on end.

It's unclear where the Israeli strikes may have hit in the Iranian capital, and there were no official announcements about the latest round of attacks.

Netanyahu added that Israel was not attempting to topple the Iranian government, but said he would not be surprised if that happened as a result of the strikes.

“The regime is very weak,” he said. Netanyahu also said he is in daily touch with U.S. President Donald Trump.

Roughly 24 hours before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu launched a blistering assault on Iran, Israel's opposition was scheming to bring down his government.

Now, just days into the ongoing operation against Iran, the opposition has closed ranks behind the effort, suspending months of bitter criticism against Netanyahu and his handling of the war in Gaza.

It's a sharp about-face for a constellation of parties that have criticized Netanyahu throughout the war for what they have charged is his politically motivated decision-making.

“It's not the right moment to do politics,” opposition leader and former Prime Minister Yair Lapid told The Associated Press on Monday in his first international media interview since the start of the operation against Iran.

The website for Iranian state TV, iribnews.ir, which was targeted by an Israeli strike hours ago, is currently inaccessible. 

The site displays a message saying: “The website server is temporarily unavailable.”

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesman, Tom Wells, told reporters that “significant destabilization in the region is in nobody's interests.” 

Speaking Monday on the sidelines of a G7 summit where conflict in the Middle East is the dominant issue, Wells said “this summit is an opportunity to try and press for de-escalation and that is the priority, certainly for the prime minister and I believe for other world leaders too.”

Still, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his country's ongoing strikes on Iran could result in the government's overthrow, and on Friday urged Iranians to rise up against their leaders.

Anchor Sahar Emami came back on-air from another studio soon after rushing off-camera when Israel struck the state-run Iranian TV station.

Speaking with another anchor, Emami said that “bodies of reporters” were at the site of the initial broadcast, and images showed smoke and flames in the sky. 

“The Iranian regime's propaganda and incitement broadcasting authority was attacked by the IDF after a widespread evacuation of the area's residents,” Israel Katz said in a statement. “We will strike the Iranian dictator everywhere.”

Human rights groups say deliberately targeting journalists is a war crime.



The German Foreign Office said Monday a charter flight from the Jordanian capital of Amman to Frankfurt is scheduled for Wednesday. Those who want to get on the flight must independently arrange their travel from Israel to Amman.

The spokesperson for the Iranian foreign minister condemned the Israeli strike on Iran's state TV broadcaster and called on the international community to demand justice for the attack on media.

“The world is watching: targeting Iran's news agency #IRIB‘s office during live broadcast is a wicked act of war crime,” Esmaeil Baqaei wrote on X.

After the strike, the Israeli military released a statement saying it struck “a communication center that was being used for military purposes by the Iranian Armed Forces.” It was not immediately clear if that referred to the state TV building. 

Throughout the war in Gaza, Israel has struck hospitals, U.N. facilities and schools, accusing Palestinian militants of operating from within civilian infrastructure, often without providing visual evidence.

Early Monday morning, Iranian missiles hit an oil refinery in the northern city of Haifa for the second night in a row. 

Now Israel's fire and rescue services are saying the strike killed three workers, ignited a significant fire and damaged a building.

The workers were sheltering in the building's safe room when the impact caused a stairwell to collapse, trapping them inside. Firefighters tried to extinguish the fire and rescue them, but were too late.

Lebanon's president and prime minister say any engagement would be detrimental to the small nation, which is already engulfed in an economic crisis and struggling to recover from the latest war between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.

Hezbollah, funded and armed by Iran, has long been considered Tehran's most powerful ally in the region but its latest war with Israel also saw much of Hezbollah's political and military leadership killed in Israeli airstrikes.

The remarks from Lebanese President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam during a Cabinet meeting Monday amounted to a message to Hezbollah to stay out of the fray.

Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul says Iran must make a “credible renunciation” of any military use of nuclear technology in order to bring its conflict with Israel to an end.

Wadephul said there's no justification for Iran to enrich uranium to such high levels for civilian use, as the international nuclear watchdog agency IAEA recently confirmed. He spoke during a brief stopover in Cyprus after a tour of the Middle East.

He added that Iran would be further marginalized if it withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and urged Tehran to “refrain from such ideas.”

Israel, which has an undeclared nuclear weapons program, has not signed the non-proliferation treaty.

The movements provide President Donald Trump additional options to defend U.S. bases and personnel in the region in wake of the ongoing ballistic missile attacks by Iran and Israel's continued air operations against Tehran, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press. 

The refueling tankers are vital to supporting any major U.S. air operation, whether it would be evacuations or a potential strike by U.S. fighter jets. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details not announced publicly.











At the Gurbulak-Bazargan border crossing from the Iranian city of Urmia into Turkey, observers noted an increase in arrivals since the Israel-Iran conflict started.

“About a week or 10 days ago, there would be between three and five people (Iranians) who would come for shopping or tourism,” said bus driver Ferit Aktas. “But now, I can say, that there are at least 30 Iranians in my vehicle per day.”

Shirin Talebi, who crossed with her family, said they are planning to stay for a month or two in Turkey.

“Hopefully, it is over in one or two months so we can return to our country,” she said.

Turkey, which shares a 569 kilometer-long (348 miles) border with Iran, has expressed deep concern over the escalating armed conflict, though Turkish officials have dismissed social media reports of a large-scale refugee influx. Turkey has not provided any official figures.

The conflict between Israel and Iran has wreaked considerable damage in both countries and caused casualties on both sides.

As Israel pummels Iran with airstrikes and Iran sends volleys of ballistic missiles towards Israel, here's a breakdown of the key sites struck so far and the casualties on both sides, as of Monday:

The U.S. president declined to answer what it would take for U.S. to be directly involved in the growing conflict between Israel and Iran, saying he did not want to talk about the issue.

Instead, he continued to press Iran on negotiations on its nuclear program.

“They should talk, and they should talk immediately,” Trump said during a bilateral meeting with the Canadian prime minister during the G7 summit.

Trump added: “I'd say Iran is not winning this war.”

Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araghchi appeared to make a veiled outreach Monday for the U.S. to step in and negotiate an end to dayslong hostilities between Israel and Iran.

In a post on X, the website formerly known as Twitter, Araghchi wrote that if Trump is “genuine about diplomacy and interested in stopping this war, next steps are consequential.”

“It takes one phone call from Washington to muzzle someone like Netanyahu,” Iran's top diplomat continued. “That may pave the way for a return to diplomacy.” 

The message to Washington comes as the most recent round of talks between U.S. and Iran was canceled over the weekend after Israel targeted key military and political officials in Tehran on Thursday.

During a live broadcast, an Iranian state television reporter said the studio was filling with dust after “the sound of aggression against the homeland, the sound of aggression against truth and righteousness.”

Suddenly, an explosion occurred, cutting out the screen behind her as she hurried off camera amid dust and debris wafting in the air, and sounds of “Allahu Akbar” (God is great) were heard from off-screen. The broadcast quickly switched to pre-recorded programs.

Israel had issued a warning the evacuate the area of Iran's capital where the TV studios are located an hour earlier.

Two American warships, the USS The Sullivans and the USS Arleigh Burke, were used to shoot down Iranian ballistic missiles over the weekend, according to a U.S. official.

The Sullivans and the USS Thomas Hudner are currently in the Mediterranean, while the Arleigh Burke has moved away from the area. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing operations.

The USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier is in the Arabian Sea with the four warships in its strike group. They are not participating in the defense of Israel. 

The USS Nimitz has been long scheduled to take over for the Carl Vinson and is heading west from the Indo-Pacific region. The official said it is slated to arrive in the region by the end of the month, and the two carriers would likely overlap in the Middle East at least for a short time before the Vinson heads home to San Diego.

As the conflict with Iran threatens to escalate, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Monday that “we're giving advice today to register their presence, so there will be a portal for that.”

The online portal is expected to be up and running later Monday. It would make it easier for British citizens to be evacuated if the situation worsens. The U.K. took similar actions for British citizens in Lebanon last year amid the Israel-Hezbollah fighting, and at other times as well.

Over the weekend, Britain changed its travel advice to urge U.K. nationals not to travel to Israel.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer says all G7 leaders agree that “have to find a way to de-escalate the situation” in the Middle East because the conflict between Israel and Iran risks inflaming the “tinderbox” of Gaza and hurting the global economy.

Starmer said he'd spoken to President Donald Trump “and to pretty well all of the G7 leaders yesterday, and I do think there's a consensus for de-escalation.

He spoke to reporters Monday at the G7 summit in Kananaskis, Alberta.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told reporters Monday ahead of the G7 summit in Canada that together with his European colleagues at the summit, Germany is planning to draw up a final communique proposal on the Israel-Iran conflict in which the European will stress that “Iran must under no circumstances be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons-capable material.”

The chancellor added the communique would also emphasize Israel's right to defend itself, and that he and the other European leaders would discuss possible further steps to reach a diplomatic solution.

Merz rejected the idea that Russian President Vladimir Putin could be involved in mediating a diplomatic solution for the hostilities between Israel and Iran and said that instead “it would be good if Russia ended its war in Ukraine.”

Israel's military issued the evacuation warning for a part of central Tehran that includes the country's state TV and police headquarters, as well as three large hospitals, including one owned by Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.

U.S. stocks are rallying Monday, while oil prices are giving back some of their initial spurts following Israel's attack on Iran at the end of last week. 

The S&P 500 climbed 1.1% and was on track to reclaim nearly all of its drop from Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 449 points, and the Nasdaq composite rose 1.4%. They joined a worldwide rise in stock prices, stretching from Asia to Europe. 

The price for a barrel of benchmark U.S. oil fell by more than 3%, while gold's price eased.

Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is filing a resolution to require that Congress authorize a declaration of war or any specific use of military force against Iran. Congress passed a similar resolution in 2020 during Trump's first term.

“It is not in our national security interest to get into a war with Iran unless that war is absolutely necessary to defend the United States. I am deeply concerned that the recent escalation of hostilities between Israel and Iran could quickly pull the United States into another endless conflict,” Kaine said.

The resolution requires that any hostilities with Iran must be explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for use of military force, but would not prevent the United States from defending itself from imminent attack.

The Trump administration revived efforts to negotiate limits on Iran's uranium enrichment in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. But the indirect talks between American and Iranian diplomats have hit a stalemate.

The latest round of talks between the U.S. and Iran on the future of Tehran's nuclear program had been scheduled Sunday in Oman but were canceled after Israel's attack.

Iran said last Thursday that it had built and would activate a third nuclear enrichment facility. The announcement came less than two weeks after the IAEA censured Iran for failing to comply with nonproliferation obligations meant to prevent it from developing a nuclear weapon. It was the first such censure in two decades.

Russia will not likely come to Iran's aid, said Lina Khatib, a Middle East expert at the Chatham House think tank in London.

She pointed out that Russia did not help Iran last year when Israel destroyed Russian-supplied air defenses or when Iran's ally, former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, was ousted.

Russia is likely to limit its support for Iran to “strongly worded statements” and will use the conflict to present itself as a mediator, Khatib told the AP.

Israel's blistering attack with warplanes and drones against Iran's nuclear and military structure has sparked an open conflict between the two long-time foes that threatens to spiral into a wider, more dangerous regional war.

Since Friday, Israeli strikes have killed more than 200 people in Iran, including top generals and scientists but also civilians. Iran has retaliated by launching hundreds of drones and missiles against Israel, some of which have penetrated Israel's vaunted aerial defense system, killing two dozen people so far.

The region is already on edge as Israel seeks to annihilate the Hamas militant group, an Iranian ally, in the Gaza Strip, where war still rages after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel.

The Israeli military has warned residents of part of Iran's capital to evacuate ahead of Israeli strikes.

Israel said Monday it planned to strike military sites in the city. The Israeli military has issued similar evacuation warnings for civilians in parts of Gaza and Lebanon ahead of strikes.

Iran's state-run news agency said Monday that its governmental television station abruptly stopped a live broadcast after an Israeli strike. During a live broadcast from the capital Tehran, the sound of an explosion could be heard as a the news presenter hurried off camera amid dust and debris wafting in the air. Afterwards, a fire could be seen at the state TV building.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Israeli strikes have set Iran's nuclear program back a “very, very long time.” He added that Israel is not attempting to topple the Iranian government, but said he would not be surprised if that happened as a result of the strikes.

“The regime is very weak,” Netanyahu said at a news conference. He added that he is in daily touch with U.S. President Donald Trump. As he spoke, large numbers of explosions were heard in Tehran.

What to know:



Videos circulating on social media show the Iranian state TV building, known as “the glass building,” is still burning. 

Following the attack, live programs have been transferred to another studio that resembles those used for radio broadcasts.

Iran's state-run news agency said Monday that its governmental television station abruptly stopped a live broadcast after an Israeli strike. During a live broadcast from the capital Tehran, the sound of an explosion could be heard as a the news presenter hurried off camera amid dust and debris wafting in the air. Afterwards, a fire could be seen at the state TV building.



The four European leaders met on the eve of the G7 summit Sunday night without President Donald Trump, who had yet to arrive at the venue in the Canadian Rockies.

It started when British Prime Minister Keir Starmer bumped into German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in a restaurant-bar area of the venue in the resort of Kananaskis. French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni dropped by and it became an hour-long informal meeting that discussed the conflict between Israel and Iran.

Efforts to de-escalate that conflict are a main focus of the two-day summit that officially started Monday.

The images captured Saturday by Planet Labs PBC show multiple buildings damaged or destroyed. The structures hit include buildings identified by experts as supplying power to the facility.

U.N. nuclear chief Rafael Grossi has said Iran's main underground enrichment site at Natanz was untouched by Israeli strikes.

Grossi told the U.N. Security Council on Friday that the above-ground section of the Natanz facility was destroyed. The main centrifuge facility underground didn't appear to be hit, but the loss of power could have damaged infrastructure there, he said.

Grossi said Monday that radiation levels outside the complex are presently normal.

He is the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency.

Journalists at the United Nations are pressing Israel's ambassador on why Iran's state television was attacked.

His reply: “Whoever is cooperating with this terror regime should be considering steps,” adding that Israel now has “very good control over the skies of Tehran.”

Ambassador Danny Dannon sidestepped questions about U.N. nuclear chief Rafael Grossi's claim that Iran's underground Natanz facility was untouched by Israeli strikes, but said Israel had “pushed back the nuclear program” and stressed the current operation is more complex than past strikes on reactors in Iraq or Syria.

As for peace talks, Danon said Iran must prove it's serious about dismantling its “machine of terror” before Israel would engage.

A significant number of explosions have been ringing out in Tehran for minutes on end.

It's unclear where the Israeli strikes may have hit in the Iranian capital, and there were no official announcements about the latest round of attacks.

Netanyahu added that Israel was not attempting to topple the Iranian government, but said he would not be surprised if that happened as a result of the strikes.

“The regime is very weak,” he said. Netanyahu also said he is in daily touch with U.S. President Donald Trump.

Roughly 24 hours before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu launched a blistering assault on Iran, Israel's opposition was scheming to bring down his government.

Now, just days into the ongoing operation against Iran, the opposition has closed ranks behind the effort, suspending months of bitter criticism against Netanyahu and his handling of the war in Gaza.

It's a sharp about-face for a constellation of parties that have criticized Netanyahu throughout the war for what they have charged is his politically motivated decision-making.

“It's not the right moment to do politics,” opposition leader and former Prime Minister Yair Lapid told The Associated Press on Monday in his first international media interview since the start of the operation against Iran.

The website for Iranian state TV, iribnews.ir, which was targeted by an Israeli strike hours ago, is currently inaccessible. 

The site displays a message saying: “The website server is temporarily unavailable.”

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesman, Tom Wells, told reporters that “significant destabilization in the region is in nobody's interests.” 

Speaking Monday on the sidelines of a G7 summit where conflict in the Middle East is the dominant issue, Wells said “this summit is an opportunity to try and press for de-escalation and that is the priority, certainly for the prime minister and I believe for other world leaders too.”

Still, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his country's ongoing strikes on Iran could result in the government's overthrow, and on Friday urged Iranians to rise up against their leaders.

Anchor Sahar Emami came back on-air from another studio soon after rushing off-camera when Israel struck the state-run Iranian TV station.

Speaking with another anchor, Emami said that “bodies of reporters” were at the site of the initial broadcast, and images showed smoke and flames in the sky. 

“The Iranian regime's propaganda and incitement broadcasting authority was attacked by the IDF after a widespread evacuation of the area's residents,” Israel Katz said in a statement. “We will strike the Iranian dictator everywhere.”

Human rights groups say deliberately targeting journalists is a war crime.



The German Foreign Office said Monday a charter flight from the Jordanian capital of Amman to Frankfurt is scheduled for Wednesday. Those who want to get on the flight must independently arrange their travel from Israel to Amman.

The spokesperson for the Iranian foreign minister condemned the Israeli strike on Iran's state TV broadcaster and called on the international community to demand justice for the attack on media.

“The world is watching: targeting Iran's news agency #IRIB‘s office during live broadcast is a wicked act of war crime,” Esmaeil Baqaei wrote on X.

After the strike, the Israeli military released a statement saying it struck “a communication center that was being used for military purposes by the Iranian Armed Forces.” It was not immediately clear if that referred to the state TV building. 

Throughout the war in Gaza, Israel has struck hospitals, U.N. facilities and schools, accusing Palestinian militants of operating from within civilian infrastructure, often without providing visual evidence.

Early Monday morning, Iranian missiles hit an oil refinery in the northern city of Haifa for the second night in a row. 

Now Israel's fire and rescue services are saying the strike killed three workers, ignited a significant fire and damaged a building.

The workers were sheltering in the building's safe room when the impact caused a stairwell to collapse, trapping them inside. Firefighters tried to extinguish the fire and rescue them, but were too late.

Lebanon's president and prime minister say any engagement would be detrimental to the small nation, which is already engulfed in an economic crisis and struggling to recover from the latest war between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.

Hezbollah, funded and armed by Iran, has long been considered Tehran's most powerful ally in the region but its latest war with Israel also saw much of Hezbollah's political and military leadership killed in Israeli airstrikes.

The remarks from Lebanese President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam during a Cabinet meeting Monday amounted to a message to Hezbollah to stay out of the fray.

Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul says Iran must make a “credible renunciation” of any military use of nuclear technology in order to bring its conflict with Israel to an end.

Wadephul said there's no justification for Iran to enrich uranium to such high levels for civilian use, as the international nuclear watchdog agency IAEA recently confirmed. He spoke during a brief stopover in Cyprus after a tour of the Middle East.

He added that Iran would be further marginalized if it withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and urged Tehran to “refrain from such ideas.”

Israel, which has an undeclared nuclear weapons program, has not signed the non-proliferation treaty.

The movements provide President Donald Trump additional options to defend U.S. bases and personnel in the region in wake of the ongoing ballistic missile attacks by Iran and Israel's continued air operations against Tehran, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press. 

The refueling tankers are vital to supporting any major U.S. air operation, whether it would be evacuations or a potential strike by U.S. fighter jets. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details not announced publicly.

“It is not in our national security interest to get into a war with Iran unless that war is absolutely necessary to defend the United States. I am deeply concerned that the recent escalation of hostilities between Israel and Iran could quickly pull the United States into another endless conflict,” Kaine said.

The resolution requires that any hostilities with Iran must be explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for use of military force, but would not prevent the United States from defending itself from imminent attack.

The Trump administration revived efforts to negotiate limits on Iran's uranium enrichment in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. But the indirect talks between American and Iranian diplomats have hit a stalemate.

The latest round of talks between the U.S. and Iran on the future of Tehran's nuclear program had been scheduled Sunday in Oman but were canceled after Israel's attack.

Iran said last Thursday that it had built and would activate a third nuclear enrichment facility. The announcement came less than two weeks after the IAEA censured Iran for failing to comply with nonproliferation obligations meant to prevent it from developing a nuclear weapon. It was the first such censure in two decades.

Russia will not likely come to Iran's aid, said Lina Khatib, a Middle East expert at the Chatham House think tank in London.

She pointed out that Russia did not help Iran last year when Israel destroyed Russian-supplied air defenses or when Iran's ally, former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, was ousted.

Russia is likely to limit its support for Iran to “strongly worded statements” and will use the conflict to present itself as a mediator, Khatib told the AP.

Israel's blistering attack with warplanes and drones against Iran's nuclear and military structure has sparked an open conflict between the two long-time foes that threatens to spiral into a wider, more dangerous regional war.

Since Friday, Israeli strikes have killed more than 200 people in Iran, including top generals and scientists but also civilians. Iran has retaliated by launching hundreds of drones and missiles against Israel, some of which have penetrated Israel's vaunted aerial defense system, killing two dozen people so far.

The region is already on edge as Israel seeks to annihilate the Hamas militant group, an Iranian ally, in the Gaza Strip, where war still rages after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel.

The Israeli military has warned residents of part of Iran's capital to evacuate ahead of Israeli strikes.

Israel said Monday it planned to strike military sites in the city. The Israeli military has issued similar evacuation warnings for civilians in parts of Gaza and Lebanon ahead of strikes.

            Like maple syrup and lakeside lounging, an annual influx of Canadians tourists has long been a part of life for the border-hugging New York region known as “North Country.”
    


            “I don't ever remember a summer where I wasn't at the beach, hearing the French language and seeing Quebec license plates,” said Kristy Kennedy, who grew up in the area.
    


            But Kennedy, now vice president of marketing and business development for the North Country Chamber of Commerce, has seen (and heard) far fewer Canadian visitors in recent months, as travel has dipped amid international tensions.
    


            Reservations are down at hotels and campgrounds, she said; local marinas, which depend on Canadian boaters, have watched bookings slow.
    


            “There's definitely a decline,” she said. For the rural area, such losses could mean economic pain. “Our leisure travel market is about 70% Canadians — it's a very large part of what we do.”
    


            Business is down 30% this spring, said Paul Dame, owner of Bluff Point Golf Resort in Plattsburg, New York, in a recent interview with CBC, and pinned the “disheartening” decline on the political situation.
    


            New York business owners aren't alone in their concern about the tourism slowdown. But now, they're in the vanguard of residents along the northern border working to woo Canadians back — and sweetening the message with Canadian-only deals.
    


            On June 1, members of the North Country Chamber of Commerce launched a “Cross-Border Specials” campaign encouraging businesses to welcome Canadians by offering special pricing and perks.
    


            “Our partners were like, ‘Absolutely yes, let's make it affordable for those who still want to come,'” said Kennedy.
    


            The deals range from cheaper stays to free activities: At the boutique hotel Bluebird Lake Placid, Canadian residents get a 30% discount through the end of August, and Canadian players at Bluff Point Golf Resort get a free sleeve of Callaway Canada balls. In Plattsburg, New York, Adirondack ElliptiGO is giving away full-day rentals of their stand-up elliptical bicycles to anyone with a Canadian ID.
    


            “I thought I'd do something to just invite them down,” said Adirondack ElliptiGO owner Donald Moore. He's partnering with the nearby Cabana Beach Bar, as well, with plans to give his Canadian visitors vouchers to use at the lakeside hangout. “They can get some drinks while they sit with their toes in the sand,” Moore said.
    


            In neighboring Vermont, those working in northern communities echoed sentiments heard along the New York border, as well as their commitment to bringing Canadians back.
    


            Abby Long, executive director of the nonprofit Kingdom Trails Association in East Burke, Vermont, said the proportion of Canadians riding its more than 100 miles of mountain bike trails has halved since last spring.
    


            “We heard from Canadian trail users that come year after year, multiple times a year,” she said. “They let us know that they love Kingdom Trails, they were sorry not to be joining, but they would not be coming this summer.”
    


            What's more, she said the drop is trickling down to countless small shops, restaurants and accommodations in the Northeast Kingdom, one of the state's most economically depressed regions.
    


            “All the businesses surrounding our trail network that depend on those visitor numbers are also being impacted,” Long said.
    


            Jay Peak Resort, which is just a few miles south of the international border, has seen similar fallout. The cancellations started after President Trump talked about Canada becoming America's “51st state,” said Steve Wright, the resort's president and general manager.
    


            It's only gotten worse since then. New reservations have sagged.
    


            “I think people are maybe ‘under-seeing' the impacts it's having on border communities and border economies up here, that rely on Canadians for their top and bottom line,” said Wright, who also spoke at a June 11 forum on tariff impacts hosted by US Senators Ben Ray Luján and Catherine Cortez Masto.
    


            “About 50% of our traffic is Canadian, and 60% in the summer,” Wright said. “There will almost certainly be a reduction in workforce if we don't get this turned around.”
    


            Jay Peak Resort has long offered “at-par” pricing for Canadians, allowing them to use Canadian dollars to pay the USD list price for lift tickets and more — a substantial savings as the US dollar remains strong.
    


            Now, some others are following suit. Emma Arian, the executive director of Vermont Brewers Festival, decided to roll out at-par pricing for their two-day craft beer event in July, which brings together some of the state's 77 breweries for tastings on the Burlington, Vermont, waterfront.
    


            “We wanted to make a meaningful gesture that says, ‘We see you, we value you and we want you here,'” said Vermont Brewers Festival executive director Emma Arian. In addition to the Canadian-only discount, Arian also recruited a trio of Quebec breweries — including Dieu du Ciel! and Messorem — to participate in the event, serving craft brews alongside their American counterparts.
    


            “It demonstrates our commitment to welcoming our neighbors from across the border,” she said. “We hope to capture the spirit of collaboration — and gratitude.”
    


            Similar efforts are taking place across the northern US. Last month, Maine Governor Janet Mills unveiled new signs reading “Bienvenue Canadiens,” which are currently being installed along interstates and at ports of entry.
    


            New, bilingual signage is cropping up in the Adirondacks region, too.
    


One hotel group based in Portland, Maine, has a “Canadian special” at its five properties, with discounts ranging from 10% to 15%. The tony hotels of the Kennebunkport Resort Collection have an “O Canada” discount of up to 15%, which comes with a free bottle of bubbly.
    


            In Washington State, a group of tourism businesses launched an “Open Arms for Canada” campaign, in which participating locations — from Seattle's Pacific Science Center to the seaside Semiahmoo Resort that's just shy of the international border — offered a weekend-long 30% discount to Canadian visitors in May.
    


            “It's our way of saying, ‘We're glad you're here, and we're on your side,' the campaign website reads.



            For now, the losses aren't evenly distributed, and northern states are noticing more acute declines than the rest of the US. Car trips to the US by Canadian residents were down 35.2% in April when compared with 2024.
    


            It was the fourth consecutive month of year-on-year contraction, with effects that are touching red and blue states alike.
    


            North Dakota has lost an estimated $13.4 million in spending by Canadian visitors, said a representative for the state's tourism and marketing department.
    


            Hotel bookings across Montana by Canadians were down 73% in January through March, said Discover Kalispell executive director Diane Medler, who noted that visitors from Canada account for 90% of her own city's international guests. Hoteliers have told her cancellations are hurting their bottom lines, particularly in the cooler spring season. One, she said, described a single cancellation by a Canadian tour group that represented a $35,000 hit.
    


            “Canadians help to boost our visitation year-round,” Medler told CNN. “That loss is especially hard during those slower months.”
    


            In an April radio address, Maine governor Mills described widespread cancellations by Canadian visitors calling off plans to visit the state's campgrounds and resorts. She estimated that the state would lose 225,000 Canadian travelers. (Recent reports suggest the numbers could prove far higher.)
    


            In Washington State, year-on-year hotel bookings have dropped 6% in the northwest region, said Michelle McKenzie, the director of marketing for State of Washington Tourism in an email to CNN. That figure pertains to all travelers, not just Canadians.
    


            Tiny Point Roberts, Washington, which has long relied on majority-Canadian tourism, has gone eerily silent, said Wayne Lyle, president of the Point Roberts Chamber of Commerce.
    


            “Gas stations are quieter, grocery stores are quieter, and restaurants are down 50% in business,” Lyle said. “It's been a huge impact.”
    


            If Canadians opt out of US vacations this year, it will affect more than northern states — it will be a drag on the nationwide economy. Visitors from Canada spent more than $20 billion in the US last year, and supported some 140,000 American jobs, estimates the U.S. Travel Association.
    


            Analysts from the travel industry website Skift have noted that even a relatively modest 10% decline in spending would translate to a $2 billion loss.
    


            And initial figures suggest that the damage might be far higher than that. Air travel by Canadian residents to the US was down nearly 20% in April when compared with the same month in 2024, according to Canada's national statistics office.

            At Home, a popular home goods retailer with 260 stores across 40 US states, has filed for bankruptcy, citing the backdrop of tariff increases and a slowdown in consumer spending.
    


            The Dallas-based company announced Monday that it had entered an agreement with its lenders that “will eliminate substantially all” of its roughly $2 billion in debt and provide $200 million in fresh funding to keep At Home operating while it navigates the Chapter 11 process.
    


            Brad Weston, At Home's CEO who joined the company last year, said in a statement that the company is “operating against the backdrop of an increasingly dynamic and rapidly evolving trade environment as we navigate the impact of tariffs” and that the changes “will improve our ability to compete in the marketplace in the face of continued volatility and increase the resilience of our business for the long term.”
    


            Businesses across the United States are grappling with uncertainty about tariffs, including on the countries from which At Home sources its products, notably China. At one point, American tariffs on that country were as high as 145% before an agreement last month to temporarily lower that to 30%.
    


            A pullback in discretionary spending in the US in recent years has also spelled trouble for the home goods industry, with The Container Store, Bed Bath & Beyond and Big Lots all filing for bankruptcy.
    


            However, the main problem for At Home is its “extensive debt that the company had on its balance sheet,” according to Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData. “This was not sustainable and its elimination under Chapter 11 will provide a more stable basis on which the company can operate.”
    


            He added that At Home's proposition is “weak” and is “not sufficiently differentiated to compete against rivals like Ikea, Wayfair and others.”
    


            “There is way too little inspiration and not nearly enough excitement to draw people in to the stores, particularly in areas where competition is high,” Saunders wrote in a note.
    


            At Home, which sells a wide variety of items such as furniture, rugs and other home accessories, said it would continue to operate as usual, including fulfilling orders, paying vendors and maintaining its loyalty program during the Chapter 11 process.
    


            However, the privately held company hinted that it might close some locations, saying that a “majority of our stores will remain open.” The Wall Street Journal recently reported that around 20 At Home locations were set to shutter.
    


            Upon exiting Chapter 11, At Home “will move forward with new owners and a meaningfully strengthened balance sheet,” Weston said.

MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin dairy farmer alleged in a federal lawsuit filed Monday that the Trump administration is illegally denying financial assistance to white farmers by continuing programs that favor minorities.

The conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty filed the lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture in federal court in Wisconsin on behalf of a white dairy farmer, Adam Faust.

Faust was among several farmers who successfully sued the Biden administration in 2021 for race discrimination in the USDA's Farmer Loan Forgiveness Plan.

The new lawsuit alleges the government has continued to implement diversity, equity and inclusion programs that were instituted under former President Joe Biden. The Wisconsin Institute wrote to the USDA in April warning of legal action, and six Republican Wisconsin congressmen called on the USDA to investigate and end the programs.

“The USDA should honor the President's promise to the American people to end racial discrimination in the federal government,” Faust said in a written statement. “After being ignored by a federal agency that's meant to support agriculture, I hope my lawsuit brings answers, accountability, and results from USDA.”

Trump administration spokesperson Anna Kelly did not immediately respond to an email Monday seeking comment.




The lawsuit contends that Faust is one of 2 million white male American farmers who are subject to discriminatory race-based policies at the USDA.




The lawsuit names three USDA programs and policies it says put white men at a disadvantage and violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal treatment by discriminating based on race and sex.

Faust participates in one program designed to offset the gap between milk prices and the cost of feed, but the lawsuit alleges he is charged a $100 administrative fee that minority and female farmers do not have to pay.

Faust also participates in a USDA program that guarantees 90% of the value of loans to white farmers, but 95% to women and racial minorities. That puts Faust at a disadvantage, the lawsuit alleges.

Faust has also begun work on a new manure storage system that could qualify for reimbursement under a USDA environmental conservation program, but 75% of his costs are eligible while 90% of the costs of minority farmers qualify, the lawsuit contends.

A federal court judge ruled in a similar 2021 case that granting loan forgiveness only to “socially disadvantaged farmers” amounts to unconstitutional race discrimination. The Biden administration suspended the program and Congress repealed it in 2022.

The Wisconsin Institute has filed dozens of such lawsuits in 25 states attacking DEI programs in government. In its April letter to the USDA, the law firm that has a long history of representing Republicans said it didn't want to sue “but there is no excuse for this continued discrimination.”

Trump has been aggressive in trying to end the government's DEI efforts to fulfill a campaign promise and bring about a profound cultural shift across the U.S. from promoting diversity to an exclusive focus on merit.

Fox News correspondent Christina Coleman reports on the ‘volatile and dangerous' situation in Los Angeles on ‘The Big Weekend Show.'

Los Angeles Dodgers player Enrique Hernandez claimed in a social media post over the weekend that the community was "being violated, profiled, abused and ripped apart" amid an illegal immigration crackdown in the city and in parts of the county.

The two-time World Series champion expressed his feelings about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE's) raids over the last week that led to hundreds of arrests and sparked riots in parts of Los Angeles. Hernandez made no mention of the violence that took place against law enforcement officers.

"I may not be Born & Raised, but this city adopted me as one of their own," he wrote on Instagram. "I am saddened and infuriated by what's happening in our country and our city. Los Angeles and Dodger fans have welcomed me, supported me and shown me nothing but kindness and love. 

"This is my second home. And I cannot stand to see our community being violated, profiled, abused and ripped apart. ALL people deserve to be treated with respect, dignity and human rights."

The anti-immigration enforcement protests began on June 7 and on June 8 the protests turned violent. Agitators sprayed walls and vehicles with the words "F--- ICE," autonomous vehicles were set on fire, and law enforcement officers were pelted with rocks and other objects in the Paramount neighborhood. Later in the week, stores in downtown Los Angeles were looted.

President Donald Trump immediately deployed the National Guard to the area where the issues began, garnering criticism from Democrats insisting their presence would only escalate tensions.

ICE has organized several high-profile raids across the country as part of the president's campaign promise to deliver mass deportations. Trump promised to prioritize criminal illegal immigrants, but critics allege the administration is separating families and targeting non-criminal workers.

Trump has since doubled down on his support of ICE in Los Angeles and called on ICE officers to expand their efforts to other cities.

IndyCar drivers Josef Newgarden and Louis Foster were in a dangerous crash on Sunday during the Bommarito Automotive Group 500 at World Wide Technology (WTT) Raceway in Madison, Illinois, just outside of St. Louis.

The incident occurred about midway through the race when Foster lost control of his vehicle in the corner and collided with the wall. He spun around as he came down the track on the frontstretch. Newgarden had nowhere to go and could not avoid Foster.

As Newgarden drove into Foster, he got airborne and flipped over in a terrifying crash. He landed on his roof and slid down the track. IndyCar safety officials immediately jumped over the barrier that separated the track from pit road to check on him.

Foster spoke to FOX Sports about the wreck after he was released from the infield care center.

"I got a bit of a wiggle ... got a bit too high and went into the marbles," Foster said. "I just couldn't stop the car from spinning and, obviously, a pretty scary impact with myself and Josef. I'm glad he is OK."

Newgarden declined to speak after the incident.

Kyle Kirkwood won the race, picking up his second consecutive win and third of the season. Only he and Alex Palou have won races on the IndyCar circuit this season.

Palou still holds the lead in the IndyCar standings, just 73 points over Pato O'Ward and 75 points ahead of Kirkwood.

﻿The wild reason why bird advocates are releasing these reviled insects from the sky.

It sounds like something out of a nightmare: a giant drone flying through the sky and dropping containers full of live, buzzing mosquitoes, one of the world's most hated insects.

But in Hawaii, this scenario is very much real. A remotely operated aircraft, about 8 feet long, is flying over remote forests in Maui and releasing cup-shaped capsules full of mosquitoes. 

As scary as it might sound, the project is a clever solution to a problem that has long plagued the Hawaiian islands. 

Hawaii faces an extinction crisis: It has lost hundreds of animals in the last two centuries, including dozens of land snails and birds, largely due to the spread of non-native species like stray cats and feral pigs. Many native animals found nowhere else on Earth are now gone for good. And several of the creatures that remain are heading in the same direction. Scientists on the islands are quite literally racing to save what wildlife remains.

For the state's avian species — its iconic forest birds, significant, too, to Indigenous Hawaiian culture — the main force of extinction is malaria, a mosquito-borne disease. Mosquitoes, a nonnative pest, were introduced accidentally in the early 1800s by a whaling ship. The blood-suckers proliferated across the islands and later began spreading avian malaria, a blood-borne pathogen they transmit through their bites. 

The disease, which can be fatal, utterly devastated the state's forest birds, and especially a group of species in the finch family known as honeycreepers. There were once more than 50 species of these colorful songbirds across Hawaii, and today all but 17 are extinct. As I've observed firsthand, the forests here have grown silent. 

The few honeycreeper species that persist today have been able to evade malaria largely because they live in higher elevations that are too cold for mosquitoes. But now, climate change is warming the islands, allowing the insects to march uphill into the remaining avian strongholds. Some experts describe this as an “extinction conveyor belt.”

Saving these birds is quite literally a race against the clock. That's where the drone comes in. 

For more than a year now, a group of environmental organizations have been dropping biodegradable containers of mosquitoes into honeycreeper habitats on Maui and Kauai from helicopters. Now they're starting to do it with giant drones. The containers fall to the ground without a top, and when they land the insects escape into the forest. 

Critically, these are not your typical mosquitoes. They're all males, which don't bite, that have been reared in a lab. More importantly, they contain a strain of bacteria called wolbachia that interferes with reproduction: When those males mate with females in the area, their eggs fail to hatch. (That's thanks to a bit of biology magic, referred to as the incompatible insect technique, or IIT.) 

The idea is to continually release these special males into honeycreeper habitat where malaria is spreading as a way to erode the population of biting mosquitoes — and thus suppress the spread of disease. The approach has little ecological downside, said Chris Farmer, Hawaii program director at American Bird Conservancy, a conservation group that's leading the drone effort. Mosquitoes are not native, so local ecosystems and species don't rely on them. 

“What this does is it erects an invisible barrier so that these mosquitoes can't get up to the forests where these birds remain,” Farmer told Vox. 

Since late 2023, a coalition of organizations known as Birds, Not Mosquitoes has unleashed more than 40 million male mosquitoes across Maui and Kauai. Nearly all of those were in containers tossed out of helicopters, which allow scientists to deliver the insects to remote forest regions where the birds remain. 

The group is now testing drones as an alternative. While the helicopters can carry more mosquitoes than drones in one flight — around 250,000, compared to about 23,000 — drones are safer because they're unmanned. They're also easier to fly on demand, says Adam Knox, the drone pilot and project manager for aerial deployment of mosquitoes at American Bird Conservancy. 

Dropping mosquitoes out of drones and choppers may sound unreal, but it's the best idea out there to help Hawaii's honeycreepers, said Marm Kilpatrick, an avian malaria expert at the University of California Santa Cruz. Kilpatrick is not affiliated with the mosquito-release project. “The reason that it's worth doing is that so far, we haven't discovered anything else that can possibly do this better,” Kilpatrick told Vox.

Scientists don't yet know if unleashing reproductively challenged mosquitoes is working and causing the resident mosquito population to crash. It's too soon to tell and the research is still underway, according to Christa Seidl, the mosquito research and control coordinator at Maui Forest Bird Recovery Project, a group leading avian conservation on the island. 

But the same approach has worked elsewhere — to stem mosquitoes that spread diseases among humans. Global health advocates have released mosquitoes with wolbachia strains that disrupt reproduction in other parts of the world and seen a massive decline in the incidence of, for example, dengue fever. 

“It sounds weird to say, but we're standing on the shoulders of human disease,” Farmer said. “The IIT we're using for conservation was first developed for human health.”

Ultimately, the goal is not total elimination of mosquitoes that carry avian malaria in Hawaii. That's likely impossible, Kilpatrick said, unless scientists could release millions or even billions of lab-grown insects all at once. 

For the time being, the plan is to regularly — and indefinitely — release the mosquitoes into forests with some of the most endangered birds, such as the kiwikiu, ‘ākohekohe, and ʻakekeʻe. Barring any regulatory or technical problems, drone deployments will soon be a regular part of that effort. 

“This is the last chance to save most of our remaining songbirds,” Farmer said. “When we've succeeded, the birds will come back.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — As Republican senators consider President Donald Trump's big bill that could slash federal spending and extend tax cuts, a new survey shows most U.S. adults don't think the government is overspending on the programs the GOP has focused on cutting, like Medicaid and food stamps.

Americans broadly support increasing or maintaining existing levels of funding for popular safety net programs, including Social Security and Medicare, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. They're more divided on spending around the military and border security, and most think the government is spending too much on foreign aid.

The poll points to a disconnect between Republicans' policy agenda and public sentiment around the domestic programs that are up for debate in the coming weeks. 

Here's the latest polling data on how Americans view federal funding: 

Many Americans see Medicaid and food assistance programs as underfunded — even as Congress proposes significant cuts to Medicaid and food and nutrition assistance programs — and few say “too much” money is going to these programs. 

About half of U.S. adults say “too little” funding goes to Medicaid, which is a government health care coverage program for low-income people and people with certain disabilities. Nearly half, 45%, say food and nutrition assistance programs like food stamps, SNAP or EBT cards are underfunded, according to the poll. About 3 in 10 U.S. adults in each case say those programs are receiving “about the right amount” of funding, indicating that most Americans likely do not want to see significant cuts to the two programs. 




About 2 in 10 say Medicaid is overfunded, while about one-quarter say that about food assistance programs.

Republicans are especially likely to say “too much” is spent on food and nutrition assistance programs when compared with Democrats and independents — 46% of Republicans say this, compared with about 1 in 10 Democrats and independents. 

When it comes to Medicaid, fewer Republicans, about one-third, say the government is spending “too much.”




About 6 in 10 Americans say there is not enough government money going toward Social Security, Medicare or education broadly. But Democrats overwhelmingly think “too little” money is allocated to these areas, while Republicans are happier with the status quo. 

Very few think Medicare, Social Security and education are getting “too much” funding. Only about 1 in 10 Republicans say this about either Medicare or Social Security. Roughly one-quarter of Republicans say too much is spent on education. 

When it comes to Social Security, about half of Republicans say “too little” is spent, compared with about 7 in 10 Democrats. 

Americans are more divided on whether the government is devoting too much money to the military or border security. 

About 3 in 10 say the government is spending “too much” on the military, while a similar share say the government is spending “too little.” Close to 4 in 10 say the government is spending “about the right amount.” 

Republicans are much less likely to say “too little” is being spent on border security than they were before Trump took office again in January. Now, 45% of Republicans say “too little” is being spent, down from 79% in a January AP-NORC poll.

On the other hand, Democrats are more likely to say that “too much” is being spent on border security. About half of Democrats now say this, compared with about 3 in 10 in January.

The Trump administration has asked Congress for deep reductions to foreign aid programs, including cuts to global health programs and refugee resettlement initiatives. 

Foreign aid is one area with more general agreement that there is “too much” federal spending. Most U.S. adults, 56%, say the U.S. government is spending too much on assistance to other countries, which is down from 69% in an AP-NORC poll from March 2023. 

There is a deep partisan divide on the issue, though. About 8 in 10 Republicans say the country is overspending on foreign aid, compared with about one-third of Democrats.

The AP-NORC poll of 1,158 adults was conducted June 5-9, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 4 percentage points.

BANFF, Canada – President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will face off on Monday during the 2025 Group of Seven leaders summit in Canada, with their second meeting carrying higher stakes than their first.

Months after mocking former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as governor of the 51st U.S. state and relishing in the negotiating pressure caused by his tariffs, Trump and Trudeau's successor will convene on Carney's home turf. 

“Mr. Carney needs to be careful about bending the knee,” Jeremy Ghio, a senior director at Montreal-based public affairs firm TACT and a Canadian political analyst, told the Washington Examiner. “He needs to find this balance between flattering Mr. Trump and not giving him an inch, and especially in terms of Canadian sovereignty.”

Although Canada is in a “better position” with the U.S. than under Trudeau, “nobody is safe” from Trump's “temperament,” according to the former Trudeau government official.

Carney held his own during the first meeting at the White House in May by asking Trump not to call Canada the 51st state while also pleasing Trump enough for the president to call him a “step up for Canada.”

As host of the G7, Carney now has a tougher task of not only making progress on his relationship with Trump on issues such as trade, but also making sure Trump gets along with everyone else, too.

Carney is hoping to avoid the optics of the last G7 summit hosted by Canada. That 2018 Charlevoix meeting is remembered for being the one during which Trump was photographed with his arms crossed across from former German Chancellor Angela Merkel before he decided to unendorse the leaders' communique. Trump's decision was prompted by Trudeau promising during his post-summit press conference to retaliate against the president's tariffs. That communique was the first in G7 history not to be endorsed by all leaders at a summit.

Josh Lipsky, international economics chairman at the Atlantic Council, argued that the “best-case scenario” for Carney “is that there's no real blow ups coming out of the back end.” 

“They don't want this feeling of it's a G6 plus one, and that image that came out of the 2018 G7 summit is in everyone's mind and everyone wants to avoid it,” Lipsky told reporters in a pre-summit briefing. “Carney has been through enough of these ministerials as a central banker to know that you don't want to get too hung up on the fact that there's a communique or not, but that's what I see as a positive outcome: a continuation of the G7, not a breakup of the G7 and what you need from that is at least a productive weekend where everyone has conversations.”

For Caitlin Welsh, who was part of Trump's White House National Security Council and National Economic Council before becoming a director at the CSIS, the 2018 summit has cast a “long shadow” over its 2025 counterpart. That includes the knowledge that the president firmly believes that “no deal is better than a bad deal,” and that consensus at a G7 should “not be taken for granted.”

“If it [Canada] wants a unified outcome of this year's G7 leaders' summit, then it should stick close to traditional G7 values while avoiding controversial topics,” Welsh told reporters during a CSIS pre-meeting briefing.

That means staying away from climate change and gender issues, and “promoting very little that the Trump administration would find reason to oppose,” Welsh suggested.

Canada's economy is also at stake. Canadians are concerned that Trump will continue to weaponize tariffs against them as he did early during his second administration, particularly with auto and lumber industry duties. And that is before the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal, which Trump negotiated during his first administration, will be reviewed next year. 

The G7 summit will be a “high-wire act” for Carney, according to Navin Girishankar, president of the Economic Security and Technology Department at CSIS.

That is because Carney is trying to “sidestep the multi-front trade war and refocus on shared priorities such as supply chains, [artificial intelligence] and quantum, and fighting financial crimes,” Girishankar told the Washington Examiner.

“A recently announced U.S.–China detente and anticipated U.S.-Japan deal provide precedents for the U.S. and Canada to de-escalate their trade tensions — reducing tariffs and counter-tariffs in exchange for purchase and investment agreements, as well as increased defense spending,” he said. “While a detente between North American neighbors will be too tall an order [this] week, bilateral discussions on an off-ramp would send a strong signal to North American supply chain partners, investors, and workers.”

In an interview with the Washington Examiner, Lipsky underscored how Canada has received some tariff relief under Trump's exemptions, especially with USMCA-compliant products, but that the residual steel, aluminum, and auto duties are “still a factor.”

“The most important thing to understand about trade with Canada, and Mexico, and the U.S. is how deeply integrated it is, and most goods like car parts flow across the border 15, 20, 25 times for one car,” Lipsky said. “It's important to think about it as, like, an integrated North American market. And so that's why these tariffs have been so painful and concerning both for the Mexicans and the Canadians.”

But regardless of what is at stake for Canada, Ghio, the Canadian political analyst, contends the stakes are also high for the U.S.

“Entrepreneurs in Canada are looking towards new markets – Europe, France, Asia, even India,” he said. “There's a real appetite in Canada to reduce the interdependence with the United States and to look and do business elsewhere. We were used to seeing business thrive north and south. Now Canadians are looking east and west.”

Canadian Trump supporter Derek Noonan, whom the Washington Examiner met earlier this year at the president's pre-inauguration rally at Capital One Arena, agreed with Ghio that tariffs would be a focal point of the G7 summit.

But Noonan, a Toronto businessman, criticized Canada's news media for undercovering how the government has permitted “China to dump steel into our market for years, hence the tariffs.”

Meanwhile, Noonan, who disagreed with Trump involving himself in Canada's elections, which arguably resulted in Carney and the Canadian Liberal Party's resounding victory, welcomed the prospect of his country becoming the U.S.'s 51st state.

“Canada's only viable future rests with being the 51st state, provided we keep our cultural heritage and traditions, as well as our treaties with First Nations,” the 59-year-old said. “Debt levels, negative growth, and faulting [gross domestic product], coupled with out-of-control corruption, spending, and [Chinese Communist Party] influence, our country risks collapse in the near future. The average Canadian is paying 55 to 64 cents in taxes on every dollar, yet the country still goes deeper and deeper in debt. Yes, 51st [state] please.”

Tensions between the U.S. and Canada reached fever-pitch earlier this year when Trump's approach to Trudeau and tariff policy coincided with the 4 Nations Face-Off, an ice hockey tournament between Canada, Finland, Sweden, and the U.S. during which American and Canadian fans were unsportsmanlike, even hostile, toward one another. 

NATIONWIDE ‘NO KINGS' PROTEST GRAPPLE WITH SECURITY THREATS FOLLOWING DEATH OF MINNESOTA LAWMAKER

But as protesters gather in Canada's Alberta region, ranging from host town Kananaskis to Calgary and Banff, the Heritage Foundation's Nile Gardiner declined to advise Trump to soften his 51st state talk.

“He's not going to change his messaging from what he says in the White House to what he says at a summit,” Gardiner, the director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, told the Washington Examiner. “Trump is a politician who will say the same thing at home as he does abroad.”

The suspected shooter of two Minnesota state legislators was arrested on Sunday evening in a wooded area near his home in Green Isle, Minnesota. Vance Boelter is believed to have shot Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman, her husband, state Sen. John Hoffman, and his wife in two separate incidents on Saturday. Hortman and her husband were killed in the attack. 

In a press conference after Boelter's arrest, Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) said political violence can't be “the norm” in the country, specifically mentioning “mean tweets” and “demeaning” people. He called for people and politicians to work together and demonstrate “decency.”

“It cannot be the norm; it cannot be the way that we deal with our political differences,” Walz said. “Now is the time for us to recommit to the core values of this country. And each and every one of us can do it.”

“It's not about hatred, it's not about mean tweets, it's not about demeaning someone, it's leading with grace and compassion and vision and compromise and decency,” Walz added. “That was taken from us in Minnesota with the murder of Speaker Hortman.”

Walz condemned inflammatory rhetoric and suggested it was linked to political violence, but the former vice presidential candidate has a history of making incendiary comments as well. 

During last year's presidential campaign, in October 2024, Walz insinuated that then-candidate Donald Trump's rally in Madison Square Garden in New York City was like a 1939 Nazi rally held at the same venue. 

“Donald Trump's got this big rally going at Madison Square Garden,” Walz said. “There's a direct parallel to a big rally that happened in the mid-1930s at Madison Square Garden.” 

“And don't think that he doesn't know for one second exactly what they're doing there,” he said.

Then, in May 2025, during a speech at the commencement ceremony for the University of Minnesota Law School, Walz referred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents as the “Gestapo.”

“Every single day, the president of the United States finds new ways to trample rights and undermine the rule of law,” Walz said. “And I'm going to start with the flashing red light. Donald Trump's modern-day Gestapo is scooping folks up off the streets.” 

Walz's comments drew criticism from Republicans and Department of Homeland Security employees. 

MINNESOTA SHOOTING SUSPECT ARRESTED AFTER TWO-DAY MANHUNT

“Governor Walz's comments comparing ICE agents to the Gestapo is sickening,” said Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary, in a statement at the time. “This type of rhetoric and demonization of ICE officers has led to our officers facing a 413% increase in assaults.”

“While politicians like Walz fight to protect criminal illegal aliens, our ICE officers will continue putting their lives and safety on the line to arrest murderers, kidnappers, and pedophiles that were let into our country by the previous administration's open border policies,” she added.

GOP Tax Bill:

The Senate's version of President Donald Trump's tax bill calls for a $10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction — a placeholder figure as Republicans remain divided over the valuable tax break.

The draft bill — slated to be released later on Monday — includes the current $10,000 SALT cap, according to a person familiar with the matter. But the Senate will continue to negotiate the deduction as it aims to pass the legislation by a self-imposed July 4 deadline.

Michael Saylor during the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas.

Michael Saylor's Strategy bought $1.05 billion in Bitcoin in the last seven days, the third consecutive week in which the cryptocurrency treasury company has used preferred shares exclusively instead of common stock to fund purchases. 

The company formerly known as MicroStrategy Inc. purchased 10,100 Bitcoin from June 9 to June 15 at an average price of $104,080, according to a filing Monday. The haul was the largest by Strategy in five weeks, raising its total holdings to roughly $63.4 billion.

The ETF market has hit a symbolic turning point: active funds now outnumber passive ones for the first time, marking a sharp break from the industry's index-tracking origins — even if actively managed assets still account for just a tenth of assets.

Roughly 51% of the nearly 4,300 US-listed exchange-traded funds are ones overseen by fund managers who have more discretion to pick stocks or other securities, eclipsing index-following products for the first time, Bloomberg Intelligence data show. The number of active ETFs has more than doubled in the past five years, from just 23% in 2020.

Justin Sun, the China-born crypto entrepreneur with ties to the Trump family who saw a federal investigation of his business interests paused earlier this year, is set to take his Tron blockchain platform public in the US through a reverse merger.   

SRM Entertainment Inc., a maker of toys and related projects, said in a statement Monday that it entered into a securities purchase agreement with a “private investor” for a $100 million equity investment. The name of Winter Park, Florida-based SRM will be changed to Tron Inc. and Sun will serve as an adviser. SRM said the investor is an affiliate of Sun, while Sun confirmed his involvement to Bloomberg News.

Global investors may be underpricing the impact of a conflict between Israel and Iran, market watchers warned on Monday, as stocks rallied despite escalating warfare in the Middle East.

The two regional powers continued trading fire on Monday, marking the fourth consecutive day of fighting since Israel launched airstrikes against Iran last week.

Despite the continued fighting — with hundreds reported dead — global stock markets sustained a positive momentum on Monday, seemingly shrugging off broader concerns about the conflict.

Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, warned on Monday that there was a risk markets were underpricing "the risk of a major conflagration in the Middle East," particularly when it comes to the energy market.

European shares opened broadly higher on Monday, with Asia-Pacific stocks and U.S. stock futures also trading in the green. Even Middle Eastern indexes saw gains on Monday, with the Tel Aviv 35 index last seen trading 1% higher after falling 1.5% last week.

"This is partly because there are so many moving parts and geopolitical considerations, and partly because the potential outcomes are so unthinkable," Mould said. "In a worst case, oil and share prices would be the least of our worries."

In a Monday morning note, David Roche, a strategist at Quantum Strategy, warned that the conflict between Israel and Iran "will last longer than the Israeli lightning-strikes that the market is used to."

Torbjorn Soltvedtp, principal Middle East analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, agreed, saying an escalation remained of "huge concern."

"What we have now is very different, and what we're seeing is effectively a war and an open-ended one," he told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe."

"And of course, that is something that has huge implications, not just for the region, but also for energy markets and how they interpret what is happening. You know, minute by minute and day by day."

Energy markets have moved the most on news of the attacks, as the Israel-Iran conflict stoked supply concerns.



While Friday marked the biggest single-day gain for crude since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, however, global benchmark Brent crude futures — last seen at $73.75 a barrel — were still far below the prices seen in the aftermath of Moscow's incursion into Ukrainian territory.

"A lull is the most likely outcome before later escalation when Iran rejects US Trump's overtures," Roche said. "The market is likely to mistake the lull for lasting peace. I would use the lull to buy into energy assets as a safe haven."

Some market watchers are taking a somewhat less pessimistic view, however.

In a note on Monday, Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid noted that while both Iran and Israel had traded retaliatory blows, they had so far avoided "the most extreme escalatory steps."

"As geopolitical shocks are becoming more frequent it seems it's now at least a yearly occurrence that we refer to our equity strategists' work on the impact of such shocks and how long it takes for the market to recover from them," he said.



"The typical pattern is for the S&P 500 to pull back about -6% in 3 weeks after the shock but then rally all the way back in another 3," Reid said. "[Our strategists] believe this incident will likely be milder than this unless we get notable escalation as they highlight that equity positioning is already underweight … and a -6% selloff would need it to fall all the way to the bottom of its usual range."

Philippe Gijsels, chief strategy officer at BNP Paribas Fortis, told CNBC on Monday that he feels the market is correct in not pricing a huge escalation, such as the U.S. being drawn into the fray, or a blockade of the Strait of Hormuz.

The Strait of Hormuz, nestled between Iran and Oman, is a vital oil transit route through which millions of barrels of oil are transported every day.

"Still, the market reaction has been very modest, so there is room for disappointment if things were to escalate," Gijsels conceded on Monday.

The stands of at least two major Israeli defense firms were blocked off to attendees at the Paris Air Show on Monday, in a move Israel said was ordered by the French government following a dispute over the displays.

Boards were placed around the pavilions of firms including Elbit Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), which were showcasing examples of military hardware. The booths of Rafael and Uvision were also shuttered, according to Reuters. CNBC has not independently verified this report.

"Last night, just one day before the Paris Air Show opened in Le Bourget Airport, exhibition organizers acting on behalf of the French government ordered the removal of offensive weapons systems from Israeli defense industry pavilions — breaking with standard practice at defense exhibitions worldwide," Israel's Defense Ministry said in a statement.

The ministry said it had told the air show organizers that it rejected the demand, and that the conference staff responded by erecting black walls overnight, blocking the pavilions for the start of the event Monday.

"This outrageous and unprecedented decision reeks of policy-driven and commercial considerations... The French are hiding behind supposedly political considerations to exclude Israeli offensive weapons from an international exhibition - weapons that compete with French industries," it said.

CNBC has contacted the Paris Air Show organizers and the French government for comment.

Israeli defense firms have been promoting new products set to unveil at the Paris event — one of the biggest in the aviation world — such as Elbit's PAWS-2 (HR) infrared missile warning system.

Defense is a major focus in Paris this year amid geopolitical tensions and pledges for higher European security spending, along with relatively subdued demand by commercial airlines to place major new orders given existing backlogs.

Other defense firms present at the show include the U.S.'s Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, European missile manufacturer MBDA and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, while hundreds of military delegations are set to attend.

"Last night, after our booth was set up and ready for the show, we were asked to remove some of our systems from the booth," IAI's President and CEO Boaz Levy said in a statement.

"We tried to negotiate with them, but it seems these orders came from the highest levels in Paris," Levy said, adding the company had received authorization to participate in the show and complied with organizers' requests. The IAI team was blocked from entering the booth, he noted.

Levy said he was "shocked" by the decision and alleged discrimination.

The move comes amid escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, with deadly air strikes between the countries continuing for a fourth day on Monday. Israel launched a series of strikes Friday targeting locations it said were related to Iran's nuclear program, killing several senior military officials.

France's government and President Emmanuel Macron have meanwhile increased their criticism of Israel over its ongoing military operation in Gaza in recent months, with a joint statement from the United Kingdom, France and Canada in May calling the level of human suffering there "intolerable."

U.S. Steel shares jumped Monday after President Donald Trump approved its controversial merger with Japan's Nippon Steel.

U.S. Steel shares closed about 5% higher at $54.85. 

Trump issued an executive order on Friday that allowed U.S. Steel and Nippon to finalize their merger so long as they signed a national security agreement with the U.S. government. The companies said they signed the agreement with the government, completing the final hurdle for the deal.

U.S. Steel said Friday that the national security agreement includes a golden share for the U.S government, without specifying what powers the government would wield with its share.

Trump said Thursday the golden share gives the U.S. president "total control" without providing specifics. Republican Pennsylvania Sen. Dave McCormick told CNBC in May that the share gives the U.S. government control of several board seats.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick detailed the rights that the U.S. government has with its golden share in a social media post Saturday. Lutnick said the share gives the U.S. president veto power over any decision to relocate U.S. Steel's headquarters, move the company outside the U.S., rename U.S. Steel, transfer production or jobs outside the U.S., and close or idle plants before certain time frames.

Trump has avoided calling the U.S. Steel-Nippon transaction a merger, describing the deal instead as a "partnership." U.S. Steel confirmed in a regulatory filing Monday that the company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America.

"All regulatory approvals required for the completion of the Transaction have been received," U.S. Steel said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. "The Transaction remains subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, and is expected to be completed promptly."

An investigation into the complexity of the global telecom system shows weaknesses in the transmission of secret codes sent via SMS.

Every day, millions of people sign in to their email, banking app or social media accounts with both their password and a one-time login code they receive by text message. The codes often arrive with a warning: “Do not share this with anyone.” The recipients of those warnings, though, have no way of knowing who saw it before it got to them.

When companies generate messages with one of these so-called two-factor authentication codes, they almost never send them directly. Instead they outsource the job, passing the codes through a thicket of intermediaries before they arrive at their destinations. Because of inherent weaknesses in SMS—the decades-old technology standard used for text messages—it's possible for entities that handle such messages to see their content. But the complexity of the system means neither the sender nor the recipient can be sure exactly who's handled them along the way.

Self-driving taxis are now a common sight on the streets of San Francisco and Shanghai — but in London, the city's famous black cabs still rule the roost.

That may not be the case for much longer. Earlier in June, Uber announced it would begin trialling driverless taxis in the UK's capital, in partnership with Microsoft and Nvidia-backed self-driving startup Wayve.

As the two companies prepare to launch their robotaxi service, I took a test drive through the busy streets of central London in one of the self-driving Ford Mach-Es Wayve has been testing in the city.

The robotaxi dealt with everything London's chaotic driving environment could throw at it, with Wayve CEO Alex Kendall, who joined for the ride, saying it was one of the more eventful trips he'd taken.

After a quick look around Wayve's Kings Cross base, we hopped in a Ford Mach-E equipped with the company's "AI driver" self-driving system.

Wayve's upcoming robotaxi service with Uber will be fully driverless, but for now, the company is testing with safety drivers who take over if the robotaxi runs into problems.

I sat in the front seat, alongside a big red button that disengages the self-driving system (the safety driver on my ride said he'd never had to use it).

The driver drove us out of the gates of Wayve's HQ and then, with a sharp buzzing noise, he removed his hands from the wheel, and the robotaxi took over.

London's streets are famously complex, so much so that taxi drivers are required to learn thousands of them off by heart in a 150-year-old exam known as "The Knowledge."

The city's hodgepodge of Roman and Victorian roads are a mess of cycle lanes and pedestrian crossings, with complex road layouts that often serve more as a rough guide than a rulebook for the millions of drivers passing through the city each day.

For Wayve, that complexity is the point. The company says its AI driver — which runs on an end-to-end AI model, an approach also adopted by Tesla — is capable of generalizing and reacting to the physical world in the same way a human would, unlike rivals like Waymo, which rely on high-definition maps and sensors.

Kendall said that this allows Wayve's software to drive anywhere, even places it hasn't seen before, and deal with the kind of unexpected encounters that are an everyday occurrence on the streets of a major city like London.

"I can't wait to see another autonomy company come into London because I think it's extremely challenging," said Kendall.

"The advantage of starting in London is that we've been forced to develop a system that can operate on complex roads and deal with all of these unexpected scenarios," he added.

In the first few minutes of our drive, we encountered multiple jaywalkers, including several who darted out across the street without warning in front of the robotaxi. We also had to inch through narrow gaps between rows of parked cars.

Perhaps understandably, Wayve's robotaxi was more cautious than your average Uber driver. On one occasion, the robotaxi came to a jerky stop at an amber light when it may have had enough time to go through.

Sometimes, that caution was too much for London's impatient commuters. One maneuver that saw the car slowly navigate a tight gap between a set of roadworks and a row of traffic drew an irate honk from the car behind, which was clearly keen for us to hurry up.

Wayve has been testing its autonomous vehicles on the streets of London for years, but they still run into the odd surprise. Around halfway into our drive, we came across a roadblock as a team of workers trimmed an overhanging tree.

In the seat behind me, Kendall broke off from answering my question and leaned forward to see how the car would deal with the falling branches and the worker directing traffic — but the robotaxi barely paused, successfully reading hand signals to stop and proceed and accelerating past the quizzical stares of the maintenance crew.

"I've never seen that before," said Kendall as the robotaxi exited the roadblock, also dodging a tractor reversing along the road.

Our route skirted the edge of Soho, London's central nightlife district, and went past the entrance to the British Museum, a narrow street packed with tourists, taxi drivers, and roadworks.

Perhaps the most impressive moment of the drive came on this road, one of London's busiest. The robotaxi came to a stop at a crosswalk in near constant use as a huge crowd of pedestrians streamed toward the Museum.

Working out the safe moment to move forward would be daunting even for a human driver, but the car spotted an opening and moved through the zebra crossing quickly, avoiding traffic building up behind us.

"Lots of autonomy systems, I think, would be stuck here for hours," said Kendall, explaining that moments like this required the robotaxi's AI software to track and predict the activity of dozens of pedestrians.

As the drive went on, the activity around us occasionally passed into the bizarre. While coming to a stop at a red light, we narrowly avoided being hit by a small piece of metal that fell off the truck in front as it accelerated away.

A pedestrian crossing at the red light kindly picked up the debris and moved it to the side of the road, but it's hard to imagine anyone thinking to simulate a situation so surreal.

For Kendall, incidents like this are proof that robotaxis need to get on as many roads as possible.

After opening offices in Canada, the US, and Japan over the last year, Wayve has now tested its vehicles in 90 cities in the past 90 days, from alpine roads in Switzerland and dirt tracks in rural Italy to bustling cities like Tokyo and Vancouver.

Kendall said for some of those places, Wayve had little to no training data, demonstrating the ability of its software to apply what it has learnt to completely new cities and driving environments.

"If robotaxis are just going to be in affluent areas like the Bay Area, then we've failed as an industry. We've got to make sure this technology is rolled out globally," Kendall said.

The launch of a driverless ride-hailing service with Uber in London, which will be the first time Wayve has taken the safety driver out of its vehicles, is a big step toward that vision.

Both companies declined to say when the driverless pilots would begin or which automaker would supply the vehicles for the robotaxi fleet, but Kendall described it as a huge moment for the young British startup and the broader industry.

"It's exciting, it's my life's work. Over 99% of road accidents are due to human error, and this technology can eliminate those," he said.

My ride in Wayve's robotaxi ended with the car smoothly negotiating a double roundabout, a fairly common feature on UK roads that is rare in the US. The safety driver took back control to pull into the company's headquarters, the first time he'd touched the wheel since we'd left an hour ago.

After 60 minutes of driving around the centre of one of the world's biggest and most chaotic cities without a hitch, I was impressed, if not completely sold.

While self-driving cars are now a reality, the history of the industry is littered with broken promises, high-profile failures, and impressive tech demos that have failed to pan out.

Saber Fallah, professor of safe AI and autonomy at the University of Surrey, told BI that while Wayve's AI-focused approach to self-driving was "bold and innovative," he was skeptical about how soon the company would be able to build a robotaxi network in a city as complex as London.

"Unlike cities like Phoenix, where many Level 4 trials have taken place, London presents an extremely dynamic and unpredictable environment," said Fallah, adding that the vehicles would need to understand informal social cues and context between drivers and reason about their intent.

Fallah said that one issue with Wayve's approach is that the "black box" nature of end-to-end AI systems might make it difficult to understand why robotaxis based on this tech make decisions, potentially undermining public trust.

Despite calling the planned robotaxi pilot an "exciting step" for self-driving cars in the UK, Fallah warned that Uber and Wayve would have to navigate challenging liability and regulatory issues while building public confidence in the frontier technology.

"Achieving consistent, safe operation without fallback drivers in central London will be an enormous hurdle," he added.

Whether Uber and Wayve can run rides like the one I experienced in London a hundred times a day, in rain, sun, fog, and hail, will be the ultimate test.

Until then, Londoners will have to stick to the city's black cabs and iconic red buses to get around.

Both Iran and Israel issued new evacuation orders Monday as the two regional powers continued firing missiles at each other for a fourth straight day.

Monday evening local time, the Israel Defense Forces warned residents in parts of northern Tehran that the Israeli army will attack Iran's military infrastructure there in the coming hours.

Meanwhile, Iranian state media reported that the country's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps announced it will launch its own attacks against Israel's military infrastructure in the Bnei Brak area of eastern Tel Aviv, according to NBC News.

"Your presence in this area puts your life at serious risk," the Guard said, in a statement that NBC reported.

Israel's defense minister warned earlier Monday that Tehran will "pay the price" for its fresh missile onslaught.

A live broadcast of the Islamic Republican of Iran News Network was interrupted Monday evening when the studio appeared to be struck by a missile. Video of the moment shows a news anchor abruptly stop speaking and leave her desk as debris and smoke billow into the frame.

Fire exchanges have continued since Israel's Friday attack against Iran, with Iranian media reporting Tehran's latest strikes hit Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Haifa, home to a major oil refinery. CNBC has reached out to operator Bazan for comment on the state of operations at the Haifa plant, amid reports of damage to Israel's energy infrastructure.

Iran's Guard said overnight it deployed "innovative methods" that "disrupted the enemy's multi-layered defense systems, to the point that the Zionist air defense systems engaged in targeting each other," according to a statement obtained by NBC News.

Israel has widely depended on its highly efficient Iron Dome missile defense system to fend off attacks throughout regional conflicts — but even it can be overwhelmed if a large number of projectiles are fired.

On Monday, the Israel Defense Forces claimed they had "achieved full aerial superiority over Tehran's skies" after previously saying they had deployed 50 fighter jets and aircraft in a coordinated strike mission. CNBC could not independently verify the report.

Iran has long struggled with an ageing aircraft fleet and has previously turned to Russia for fighter jet purchases.

The fresh hostilities are front-of-mind for investors, who have been weighing the odds of further escalation in the conflict and spillover into the broader oil-rich Middle East, amid concerns over crude supplies and the key shipping lane through the Strait of Hormuz connecting the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.

Oil prices retained the gains of recent days and at 1:11 p.m. London time, Ice Brent futures with August delivery were trading at $73.46 per barrel, down 1.04% from the previous trading session. The Nymex WTI contract with July expiry was at $72.14 per barrel, 1.15% lower.

Elsewhere, however, markets showed initial signs of shrugging off the latest hostilities early on Monday.

Spot prices for gold, a key safe-haven asset, fell nearly 1% to about $3,419 per ounce by 12:20 p.m. ET on Monday after nearly notching a two-year-high earlier in the session.

Tel Aviv share indices rose around the same time, with the blue-chip TA-35 up 1.82% and the wider TA-125 up 2.64% .

European and U.S. stock markets also opened higher.

Luis Costa, global head of EM sovereign credit at Citigroup Global Markets, signaled the muted reaction could be, in part, attributed to hopes of a brisk resolution to the conflict.

"So markets are obviously, you know, bearing in mind all potential scenarios. There are obviously potentially very bad scenarios in this story," he told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition" on Monday. "But there is still a way out in terms of, you know, a faster resolution and bringing Iran to the table, or a short continuation here, of a very surgical and intense strike by the Israeli army."

As of Monday morning, Israel's national emergency service Magen David Adom reported four dead and 87 injured following rocket strikes at four sites in "central Israel," reporting collapsed buildings, fire and people trapped under debris.

Accusing Tehran of targeting civilians in Israel to prevent the IDF from "continuing the attack that is collapsing its capabilities," Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz, a close longtime ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said in a Google-translated social media update that "the residents of Tehran will pay the price, and soon."

He clarified in a later Google-translated update that "the residents of Tehran will be forced to pay the price of dictatorship and evacuate their homes from areas where it will be necessary to attack regime targets and security infrastructure in Tehran."

The IDF on Sunday said it had in turn "completed a wide-scale wave of strikes on numerous weapon production sites belonging to the Quds Force, the IRGC and the Iranian military, in Tehran."

CNBC could not independently verify developments on the ground.

The U.S.' response is now in focus, given its close support and arms provision to Israel, the unexpected cancellation of Washington's latest nuclear deal talks with Iran, and President Donald Trump's historically hard-hitting stance against Tehran during his first term.

Trump, who has been pushing Iran for a deal over its nuclear program, has weighed in on the conflict, opposing an Israeli proposal to kill Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, according to NBC News.

Discussions about the conflict are expected to take place during the ongoing meeting of the G7, encapsulating Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., along with the European Union.

European leaders are looking to Southeast Asia with renewed interest amid Washington's aggressive tariff agenda, but experts warn that the state of regional trade ties makes it challenging to disrupt the U.S. or China's hold.

Southeast Asia is in a predicament: its ally China is ramping up its advances in the South China Sea, with state-of-the-art Chinese bomber planes. spotted in the disputed Paracel Islands in the region late last month as tensions flare with the Philippines. Meanwhile, its other ally, the U.S., hangs the threat of tariffs over the world, with uncertainty mounting as a 90-day reprieve is set to expire in July.

Europe is now seizing the opportunity to surface as an alternative ally to emerging Asian nations, with French President Emmanuel Macron calling for stronger ties between the blocs at the 2025 Shangri-La Dialogue that wrapped up earlier this month.

Southeast Asia brings Europe the opportunity to access another market for its defense sector, according to Bob Herrera-Lim, managing director at Teneo. Ifri's Pajon adds that the region could also provide Europe a diversified supply chain to hedge against economic reliance on the U.S. or China and significant raw material reserves essential for the EU's green and digital transition.

Europe is ambitious in its hopes for emerging Asia, but analysts nevertheless doubt it can overtake the U.S. or China's influence in the region.

"Europe, on its own, can offer Southeast Asia a valuable option to hedge against the risks of overdependence on either China or the United States," Céline Pajon, head of Japan and Indo-Pacific Research at Ifri's Center for Asian Studies, told CNBC by email.

While ties span more than half a century, Southeast Asian and European relations have been mired in various challenges that Teneo's Herrera-Lim attributes to factors such as geographic distance and diverging views over politics or the environment.

In his keynote speech at the 2025 Shangri-La Dialogue, Macron called for stronger ties between Europe and the Indo-Pacific's "new special relationship." He stressed that both blocs are facing the "potential erosion of long-time alliances" and the threat of countries vying for control or resorting to force, drawing direct parallels between China's advances in the South-China Sea and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 

Yet similar experiences alone might not be enough to sway emerging Asia away from the U.S. or China, according to Herrera-Lim.

"Form follows function in Southeast Asia," he told CNBC in a call, "Relationships are built on economic ties in Southeast Asia, more than anything else."

While the EU has trade ties with Singapore and Vietnam, talks for other bilateral deals or an EU-ASEAN wide free trade agreements (FTA) have been stalled for years, and Ifri's Pajon said that the bloc "still has progress to make" in increasing its presence and investment in the region.

Meanwhile, Beijing remains the Southeast Asia's largest trading partner since 2009, with total goods in trade reaching $982.3 billion in 2024. The U.S. follows behind in second place, with an estimated $476.8 billion goods in trade last year. The EU trails behind in third place, with roughly 258.7 billion euros ($299.7 billion) of goods in trade over the same period.

Without any meaningful reform or the promise of increased trade in the future, Herrera-Lim said that it will be difficult for Europe to compete against the bloc's established trading partners. 

"If in the next week or next month, China says, 'We're doing reforms so that domestic markets are opened up in China for Southeast Asian goods,' [then] Southeast Asian countries would line up to get access to the Chinese market. Independent of their politics around many of these issues," he said.

While Europe might not be able to replace the U.S. or China in emerging Asia, it can nevertheless offer transparent, reliable partnerships that aren't about zero-sum competition, Lizza Bomassi Research Analyst at the European Union Institute for Security Studies (EUISS), told CNBC by email.

"Europe's value proposition lies in being a reliable partner in critical areas like energy security, green infrastructure, and digital governance," she said, "These are areas where Southeast Asian countries want to diversify and build resilience, especially given concerns about overdependence."

Ifri's Pajon said that strengthening ties with Europe would allow Southeast Asia to diversify its strategic partnerships and enhance their capacity to resist hegemonic pressures.

"The presence of more partners, including Europe, raises the diplomatic and reputational costs for China to escalate [territorial disputes in the region], particularly given Beijing's emphasis on a 'peaceful rise'," Bomassi said. 

"In this context, the EU-ASEAN partnership isn't about hard military deterrence, but it serves as a crucial symbolic defence mechanism. It reinforces that Southeast Asia isn't isolated and has multiple partners, making the region more resilient to coercion," she added.

Shares of French fashion house Kering popped as much as 10% on Monday on reports that it has appointed industry outsider Luca de Meo as group CEO.

It comes as the owner of beleaguered brands Gucci and Saint Laurent embarks on the latest phase of its turnaround effort.

Auto veteran de Meo's departure as CEO of Renault was confirmed Sunday, with the French carmaker saying in a statement that he was stepping down "to take on new challenges outside the automotive sector." He will remain in post until July 15.

De Meo's move to Kering was first reported by French newspaper Le Figaro on Sunday. Kering declined to comment on the reports when contacted by CNBC.

Kering shares were trading up 10.4% by 1:15 p.m. London time as investors and analysts cheered the reports. Renault shares, meanwhile, shed 7%.

"Brand management and marketing are [de Meo's] forte, which dovetails with what the luxury industry does," Bernstein analysts wrote in a note Monday.

De Meo is seen as having a strong track record, having worked in the auto sector for over 30 years, including at Toyota, Fiat and Volkswagen. The Italian is largely credited with Renault's turnaround during his five years at the helm, with shares up over 90% over the period.

The challenges facing the luxury sector nevertheless loom large, with Kering among the biggest laggards as shoppers have fallen out of love with its star Gucci label. Kering shares have shed over 60% in the last two years, sparked by a series of profit warnings and designer changes at Gucci.

Kering's current CEO and chairman François-Henri Pinault, a member of the family that controls the group, has held the top jobs for two decades but is actively working on his succession, according to Reuters, citing sources. Pinault reportedly intends to split the roles of chair and CEO, according to the sources. It was unclear whether he will remain chair.

Thomas Chauvet, senior equity analyst at Citi, commended de Meo's turnaround of Renault, including his embrace of technological innovation and the brand's elevation. However, he noted that the challenges of the prospective new role would be significant.

"Execution of luxury brand turnarounds has become more complex, lengthy, costly, and far less public-market-friendly, reflecting consumer preference for top brands rather than those in transition and significant P&L disruption from greater investment commitment," he wrote in a note.

"There is still a considerable amount of work ahead at Gucci and Saint Laurent ... to rejuvenate both brands and generate a steady stream of revenue and cash flow for the group, which, if achieved, could result in significant multiple re-rating," he added.

In April, Kering posted a worse-than-expected 14% year-on-year decline in first quarter sales and pointed to macroeconomic headwinds ahead. Sales at Gucci, which make up nearly half of group revenues, led losses, falling 25% on a comparable basis.

Gucci in particular has suffered several consecutive quarters of weak sales, as its designs have fallen out of favor with shoppers, while its high exposure to the Chinese consumer has seen it hard hit by a recent downturn in the once lucrative Asian market.

In a bid to revive the ailing brand's fortunes, Kering in March appointed Demna Gvasalia as Gucci's new artistic director, joining internally from smaller label Balenciaga. However, a series of controversies associated with his earlier designs have so far prompted a cautious response from investors. His designs are expected to take effect from the Spring/Summer 2026 collections onward.

U.S. Treasury yields were relatively unchanged Monday as global markets continue to react to deadly air strikes being exchanged between Israel and Iran.

The 2-year Treasury yield rose less than 1 basis point to 3.96%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury was less than 1 basis point higher at 4.43%.

One basis point equals 0.01%. Bond yields and prices move inversely.

The moves follow Treasury yields climbing sharply on Friday after Israel launched strikes on Iran, targeting locations it said were linked to its nuclear program. Initial market moves saw oil prices spike, the U.S. dollar and gold rally, and stock markets decline.

Tensions showed little sign of abating over the weekend and into Monday, as casualties mounted on both sides and scheduled talks on Iran's nuclear program were canceled.

Investors later grew optimistic Monday that the conflict wouldn't intensify after The Wall Street Journal reported that Iran has been signaling through Arab intermediaries that it would be open to resuming negotiations.

Crude oil prices were volatile after Israeli unmanned aerial vehicles struck the South Pars gas field in southern Iran on Saturday. After trading above $77 per barrel overnight, U.S. West Texas Intermediate was down more than 1% to $72.04 a barrel. Global benchmark Brent was also down more than 1% at $73.25 a barrel.

The prior rise in oil rates had stoked fears of a resurgence in U.S. inflation. Investors were already on edge over the prospect of price rises in light of White House tariff policy, though the May consumer price index reading came in cooler than expected.

The Federal Reserve will hold its latest policy meeting this week. The market is expecting a 100% chance of a rate hold, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

Taiwan has added China's Huawei and SMIC to its trade blacklist in a move that further aligns it with U.S. trade policy and comes amid growing tensions with Beijing. 

The two leading Chinese chip firms have been put on Taiwan's "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List," along with many of their international subsidiaries.

Taiwan's current regulations require licenses from regulators before domestic firms can ship products to parties named on the entity list. 

In a statement on its website, Taiwan's International Trade Administration said that Huawei and SMIC were among the 601 new foreign entities, blacklisted due to their involvement in arms proliferation activities and other national security concerns.

Huawei and SMIC are also on a U.S. trade blacklist and have been impacted by Washington's sweeping controls on advanced chips. Companies such as contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co already follow U.S. export restrictions. 

However, the addition of Huawei and SMIC to the Taiwan blacklist is likely aimed at the reinforcement of this policy and a tightening of existing loopholes, Ray Wang, an independent semiconductor and tech analyst, told CNBC. 

He added that the new domestic export controls could also raise the punishment for any potential breaches in the future. 

TSMC had been embroiled in controversy in October last year when semiconductor research firm TechInsights found a TSMC-made chip in a Huawei AI training card. 

Following the discovery, the U.S. Commerce Department ordered TSMC to halt Chinese clients' access to chips used for AI services, according to a report from Reuters. TSMC could also reportedly face a $1 billion as penalty to settle a U.S. investigation into the matter.

Huawei has been working to create viable alternatives to Nvidia's general processing units used for AI. But, experts say the company's advancement has been limited by export controls and a lack of scale and capabilities in the domestic chip ecosystem. 

Still, Huawei is believed to have acquired several million GPU dies from TSMC for its AI chips by using previous loopholes before they were discovered, according to Paul Triolo, partner and senior vice president for China at advisory firm DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group. 

A die refers to a small piece of silicon material that serves as the foundation for building processors and contains the intricate circuitry and components necessary to perform computations. 

According to Brady Wang, associated director at Counterpoint Research, while the latest export restrictions on SMIC and Huawei are expected to have minimal direct impact on TSMC's business, the move from the Taiwanese government carries "significant symbolic weight."

"It underscores the Taiwanese government's intention to align more closely with international efforts — particularly those led by the U.S. — to curb the transfer of advanced technologies," he told CNBC.

"Other Taiwanese firms, especially smaller IC design houses or component suppliers that may have maintained indirect ties to Chinese companies such as Huawei or SMIC, could face tighter scrutiny and increased compliance obligations going forward," he added.

The Taiwanese government's crackdown on exports to SMIC and Huawei also comes amid tense geopolitical tensions with Mainland China, which regards the democratically governed island as its own territory to be reunited by force, if necessary.

In April, the U.S. reaffirmed its commitment to support the existing status quo as China conducted large-scale military exercises off the coast of the island.

In statements reported by state media on Sunday, China's top political adviser Wang Huning echoed Beijing's position, calling for the promotion of national reunification with Taiwan and for resolute opposition to Taiwan independence.

The CEOs of two major energy companies are monitoring the developments between Iran and Israel — but they aren't about to make firm predictions on oil prices.

Both countries traded strikes over the weekend, after Israel targeted nuclear and military facilities in Iran on Friday, killing some of its top nuclear scientists and military commanders.

Speaking at the Energy Asia conference in Kuala Lumpur on Monday, Lorenzo Simonelli, president and CEO of energy technology company Baker Hughes, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia" that "my experience has been, never try and predict what the price of oil is going to be, because there's one sure thing: You're going to be wrong."

Simonelli said the last 96 hours "have been very fluid," and expressed hope that there would be a de-escalation in tensions in the region.

"As we go forward, we'll obviously monitor the situation like everybody else is. It is moving very quickly, and we're going to anticipate the aspect of what's next," he added, saying that the company will take a wait-and-see approach for its projects.

At the same conference, Meg O'Neill, CEO of Australian oil and gas giant Woodside Energy, likewise told CNBC that the company is monitoring the impact of the conflict on markets around the world.

She highlighted that forward prices were already experiencing "very significant" effects in light of the events of the past four days.

If supplies through the Strait of Hormuz are affected, "that would have even more significant effects on prices, as customers around the world would be scrambling to meet their own energy needs," she added.

As of Sunday, the Strait remained open, according to an advisory from the Joint Maritime Information Center. It said, "There remains a media narrative on a potential blockade of the [Strait of Hormuz]. JMIC has no confirmed information pointing towards a blockade or closure, but will follow the situation closely."

Iran was reportedly considering closing the Strait of Hormuz in response to the attacks.

O'Neill said that oil and gas prices are closely linked to geopolitics, citing as examples events that date back to World War II and the oil crisis in the 1970s.

Nevertheless, she would not make a firm prediction on the price of oil, saying, "there's many things we can forecast. The price of oil in five years is not something I would try to put a bet on."

The Strait of Hormuz is a vital waterway between Iran and the United Arab Emirates. About 20% of the world's oil passes through it.

It is the only sea route from the Persian Gulf to the open ocean, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration has described it as the "world's most important oil transit chokepoint."

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is considering significantly expanding its travel restrictions by potentially banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the United States, according to an internal State Department cable seen by Reuters.

Earlier this month, the Republican president signed a proclamation that banned the entry of citizens from 12 countries, saying the move was needed to protect the United States against "foreign terrorists" and other national security threats.

The directive was part of an immigration crackdown Trump launched this year at the start of his second term, which has included the deportation to El Salvador of hundreds of Venezuelans suspected of being gang members, as well as efforts to deny enrollments of some foreign students from U.S. universities and deport others.

In an internal diplomatic cable signed by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the State Department outlined a dozen concerns about the countries in question and sought corrective action.

"The Department has identified 36 countries of concern that might be recommended for full or partial suspension of entry if they do not meet established benchmarks and requirements within 60 days," the cable sent out over the weekend said.

The cable was first reported by the Washington Post.

Among the concerns the State Department raised was the lack of a competent or cooperative government by some of the countries mentioned to produce reliable identity documents, the cable said. Another was "questionable security" of that country's passport.

Some countries, the cable said, were not cooperative in facilitating the removal of its nationals from the United States who were ordered to be removed. Some countries were overstaying the U.S. visas their citizens were being granted.

Other reasons for concern were the nationals of the country were involved in acts of terrorism in the United States, or antisemitic and anti-American activity.

The cable noted that not all of these concerns pertained to every country listed.

"We are constantly reevaluating policies to ensure the safety of Americans and that foreign nationals follow our laws," a senior State Department official said, declining to comment on specific internal deliberations and communications.

"The Department of State is committed to protecting our nation and its citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through our visa process," the official said.

The countries that could face a full or a partial ban if they do not address these concerns within the next 60 days are: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cote D'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Dominica, Ethiopia, Egypt, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Malawi, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, South Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Tonga, Tuvalu, Uganda, Vanuatu, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

That would be a significant expansion of the ban that came into effect earlier this month. The countries affected were Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.

The entry of people from seven other countries - Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela - has also been partially restricted.

During his first in office, Trump announced a ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations, a policy that went through several iterations before it was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018.

JPMorgan Chase is making fresh moves in the digital asset space with a newly filed trademark for “JPMD”, according to a June 15 submission to the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).

The application, submitted by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., covers a broad spectrum of digital asset and blockchain-related services, including digital currency issuance, electronic payment processing, and financial custody services, and it may signal the bank's next evolution in stablecoin offerings.

This isn't JPMorgan's first foray into blockchain-based finance. The bank already operates JPM Coin, a dollar-backed stablecoin used to facilitate instantaneous payments between institutional clients. The token operates on the Quorum blockchain, a private blockchain network developed by JPMorgan based on Ethereum technology.

The move comes as JPMorgan Chase and other US banking giants are reportedly considering a collaborative stablecoin project through their jointly owned entities, Early Warning Services and The Clearing House. The initiative aims to compete with the rapid growth of digital asset platforms.

The project's progress depends on regulatory acceptance and market demand, influenced by ongoing legislative developments such as the GENIUS Act, which is heading to a final vote this week.

Cantor initiated coverage of the three largest solana SOL$157.79 treasury companies DeFi Development (DFDV), Upexi (UPXI) and Sol Strategies (HODL) with an overweight rating, the Wall Street firm said in a research report Monday.

The broker has a $45 price target for DeFi Development, a C$54 objective for Sol Strategies, and a $16 price target for Upexi.

"We believe SOL treasury companies are betting the future of finance will be on-chain and that the chain of choice will be Solana," analysts led by Thomas Shinske wrote.

Solana's biggest competitor is the Ethereum blockchain, Cantor noted, but its technology is meaningfully better than its larger peer on every metric.

"Developer growth on SOL has far exceeded that on ETH recently, and we expect this to continue," the authors wrote.

Therefore, using solana as a treasury asset makes more sense than using ether ETH$2,667.79, the report said.

The report added that companies that have adopted solana as a treasury asset believe that the crypto can overtake ether, which currently has a market cap 2.5 times larger than SOL.

Asset manager Purpose Investments is set to launch a spot XRP XRP$2.30 exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Canada this week after obtaining regulatory approval, giving investors a way to gain exposure to the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization through traditional investment accounts.The ETF will start trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday, June 18, under the XRPP ticker, according to a Monday press release. The move comes after the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) granted final prospectus receipt for the investment vehicle, the company said.

XRP was up nearly 7% over the past 24 hours following the news, outperforming bitcoin BTC$107,709.17 and the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index.

"The OSC's granting of a receipt for the Purpose XRP ETF prospectus reinforces Canada's global leadership in building a regulated digital asset ecosystem," Vlad Tasevski, chief innovation officer at Purpose Investments, said in a press release.

Purpose Investments in 2021 launched in Canada the world's first spot bitcoin ETF, years before the vehicles' approval in the U.S.

On June 16, 2025, the UK Information Commissioner's Office (the “ICO”) published its draft guidance on Internet of Things (“IOT”) products and services (the “Guidance”).  Through the Guidance, the ICO aims to provide clarity to manufacturers and developers of smart products, such as smart speakers and Wi-Fi fridges, to ensure they create products that comply with data protection law. The Guidance covers key areas such as:

The ICO's intention behind the Guidance is to empower organizations to consider responsible use of information and compliance with data protection laws. However, the ICO has warned manufacturers and developers that it is “closely monitoring compliance” and will be “ready to act” where it believes “corners are being cut or personal information is being collected recklessly.”

The ICO has asked for manufacturers, developers and the wider tech industry to share their views on the draft Guidance, which will be open for consultation until September 7, 2025.

Trump Media & Technology Group wants to launch an exchange-traded fund to invest in the two biggest cryptocurrencies. 

Donald Trump's media company filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission seeking approval of a new bitcoin and ether ETF on Monday, with the fund aiming to invest 75% of its assets in bitcoin and 25% in ethereum.

Crypto.com will serve as the liquidity provider and prime execution agent of the ETF, the filing said. Trump Media has already partnered with Crypto.com in a deal that offers retail investors access to crypto investments on Truth Social, Trump's social media platform.

The new ETF is the latest push by Trump and his family into the world of crypto. 

In May, Trump Media announced it would raise $2.5 billion to create a "Bitcoin treasury," which the firm said was to "expand its reach throughout the America First economy."

"We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets," Devin Nunes, the CEO of Trump Media, said in a statement at the time.

Meanwhile, World Liberty Financial, a digital assets firm backed by Trump and his sons, issued a new dollar-backed stablecoin earlier this year dubbed USD1. 

The flurry of crypto maneuvers has solidified a reputation Trump was aiming to cultivate while he campaigned for president. He secured the support of crypto investors on the campaign trail with promises of more favorable regulation and the creation of a national bitcoin stockpile.

He's even dabbled in meme coins. 

In the days leading up to his inauguration, the president released a $TRUMP meme coin and promoted the crypto on his Truth Social account.

In May, the president appeared at a private dinner in Washington, DC, for the top 220 investors in his meme coin.

Bermuda's government has backed an event featuring an stablecoin ‘airdrop' as part of a push to promote digital finance.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by having their market value pegged to an external reference, typically fiat currency. An airdrop refers to the free distribution of tokens or coins to multiple wallet addresses, typically used as a promotional tactic to boost awareness and encourage adoption of a new project.

The ‘Bermuda Digital Finance Forum' was held from 6-9 May with aims including to ‘drive mass adoption of digital finance solutions' and ‘facilitate focused dialogues around digital transformation.'

Government support included providing ‘more than 150' free tickets for the event's Community Day. During the day ticket holders who downloaded a digital wallet supplied by US-headquartered cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (a ‘Coinbase Wallet') were airdropped $100 (US$100/ about £73) of USDC issued by US-headquartered peer-to-peer crypto payments company Circle that could be spent at local businesses – for example, food, drink and merchandise retailers – in the event's ‘Vendor Village' (USDC is a Circle-issued cryptocurrency stablecoin pegged to the US dollar).

“We want Bermudians to be part of this growing industry,” said Bermuda premier David Burt in a government press release in the run-up. “The Ministry of Finance aims to make digital finance more accessible, and these sponsored tickets will help encourage Bermudians to get involved. By giving all attendees digital dollars, the event organisers are offering a chance for Bermudians to experience what the future of money looks like.”

An empirical analysis of cross-border Bitcoin, Ether and stablecoin flows' – published as a Bank for International Settlements (BIS) working paper

‘The goal of the Community Day is to demonstrate how digital finance can empower Bermudians and small businesses with cheaper and faster payment options,' the government stated in its press release, adding that ‘the Government of Bermuda, conference organisers and participating sponsors are committed to making digital finance inclusive for all and ensuring that Bermudians are equipped to benefit from this growing sector.'

The Community Day was ‘open to residents interested in learning about or exploring a career in the digital finance sector', the government explained, adding that while a technical background was not required, ‘applicants should, however, possess a willingness to learn, explore new career opportunities, and actively engage with leaders in Bermuda's expanding digital asset sector.'

Digital assets consultancy Penrose Partners was among the companies involved in organising the event. In its own press release, the company described the airdrop as ‘one of the world's first fully compliant stablecoin airdrops to local residents' and a ‘landmark activation' that ‘advanced the adoption of digital finance and on-chain innovation' (on-chain meaning ‘on blockchain' – the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies).

Penrose Partners said that Coinbase and Circle, as event sponsors, had ‘helped onboard 250 Bermudians' during the Community Day.  

Local vendors were able to accept USDC ‘via QR [quick response] codes linked to their [own] Coinbase Wallets,' the release explained.

‘The initiative showcased Bermuda as a live testbed for inclusive, secure and accessible digital finance, demonstrating how stablecoins can integrate into everyday commerce,' the company said.

Burt took part in a fireside chat with Circle president Heath Tarbert during the event.

“The current state of digital finance in Bermuda is growing and blossoming, and we have a huge opportunity in this sector. Through events like this, the partnerships have onboarded our residents and local businesses into digital wallets so that they can accept and transact in digital dollars,” Burt said, according to a government press release published during the event (7 May).

The press release also records Burt as saying that the government is working to adopt this financial technology within public-sector systems.

“In government, we are updating our infrastructure to accept these digital dollars as payments for government dues and taxes,” he said.

Burt also noted that the Economic Development Department, in partnership with the Bermuda Economic Development Corporation (BEDC), has been running annual fintech training programmes to build local capacity.

“These programmes ensure that not only our students but also our working professionals in the industry are equipped with what they need to evolve and take on new digital finance opportunities coming to Bermuda,” he said.

Bermuda is a British island territory in the North Atlantic with a population of about 64,000 people.

The stablecoin airdrop gained further airtime one week later during a fireside chat at a cryptoaassets conference, ‘Consensus 2025', held in the Canadian city of Toronto.

This session saw Burt speaking to John Darsie, a partner at US-headquartered asset management firm SkyBridge Capital, about the Bermuda Digital Finance Forum and government authorities' strategies to support innovative financial technology companies.

Eight digital asset business licences were issued in Bermuda during 2024, bringing the total number of licensed entities on Bermuda's register to 53 (comprising 39 digital asset companies and 14 innovative insurer general businesses), according a government press release about Burt's Consensus 2025 appearance.

“It is our hope that this growing momentum encourages other digital finance businesses to consider Bermuda as their jurisdiction of choice, where our advanced regulations provide a foundation for business growth,” Burt said.

The Trump family's portfolio of commercial deals continues to grow, albeit under a cloud of scrutiny and criticism from certain partisan quarters, who allege that such deals tarnish the office of the US Presidency.

Even so, just today, Trump Media and Technology Group has furnished additional details on its upcoming crypto ETF, and Trump Mobile, a venture between Don Jr. and Eric Trump, has started accepting pre-orders for an upcoming smartphone.

To wit, Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent entity of the Truth Social platform and a host of ancillary offerings, has now filed a registration statement with the SEC for its Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, which will hold the two cryptocurrencies in a 75:25 ratio, respectively. Crypto.com will act as the ETF's custodian, prime execution agent, and a provider of staking and liquidity.

This follows a similar registration statement that Trump Media and Technology Group had filed with NYSE Arca in early June for its Truth Social Bitcoin ETF.

Bear in mind that the company's board approved back in January the diversion of up to $250 million towards setting up customized SMAs and ETFs under the Truth.Fi brand.

Recently, Trump Media also managed to raise $2.3 billion - via 29 million shares of underlying convertible notes and an equity offering consisting of 56 million common shares - for a dedicated Bitcoin Treasury.

Bear in mind that President Trump is by far the largest shareholder of Trump Media and Technology Group. However, he has transferred the custody of his gigantic stake to a trust headed by Donald Trump Junior.

Meanwhile, Trump Mobile has also now opened pre-orders for a $499 smartphone, dubbed the T1 Mobile. The smartphone is meant to commemorate the 10-year anniversary of President Trump's launch of his first presidential campaign.

Trump Mobile's 47 plan, available for $47.45 per month, offers:

As for the T1 Mobile, it is expected to go on sale in August, and feature "a sleek, gold smartphone engineered for performance and proudly designed and built in the United States for customers."

Oops, something went wrong

PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is one of the most undervalued financial stocks to buy, according to analysts. On June 11, the payment company confirmed bringing its PYUSD stablecoin to the stellar blockchain network. The move strengthens the dollar-pegged token's position in cross-border remittances and payment financing.

While operating in the Ethereum and Solana blockchain, PayPal will expand to the stellar network to explore new areas like payment financing. The expansion should allow small and medium-sized businesses that face delayed receivables or pre-funding requirements to access new sources of real-time working capital.

By expanding its stablecoin into the Stellar Network, PayPal plans to leverage its high speed, low transaction costs, and ease of integration to enhance the utility of real-world payments commerce and microfinancing.

The expansion will also offer PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) stablecoin holders access to a vast network of on and off-ramps. They will also enjoy access to digital wallets and connection to payment systems and vast payment networks. The stablecoin on the stellar network should also enhance liquidity and financing opportunities through payment financing.

While we acknowledge the potential of PYPL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

 The Cointelegraph Decentralization Guardians (CTDG) initiative is operational with validators on Solana, Chiliz, Polkadot, Coreum, Canton and Mantra. 

Cointelegraph is evolving from industry commentary to active participation in securing Web3 with the launch of the Cointelegraph Decentralization Guardians (CTDG) initiative, debuting live, institutional-grade validators on major blockchains including Solana, Chiliz, Polkadot, Coreum, Canton and Mantra.

The CTDG initiative functions as a multi-faceted program that combines running high-performance validator nodes across leading blockchain ecosystems with public education, data-driven network monitoring and increased visibility for partner protocols. Merging media operations with Web3 success support positions Cointelegraph as a direct contributor to the health and security of the industry it covers.

The program's mainnet validators are live, and its public dashboards are tracking key network statistics and validator performance. These tools are accompanied by new staking interfaces that give community members a direct way to participate in securing these networks.

“Cointelegraph has been the world's leading voice on the promise of decentralization for over a decade,” said Cointelegraph CEO Yana Prikhodchenko, adding: “With the introduction of the CTDG initiative, we're taking the next logical step by moving from commentary to active participation. Through the CTDG, we are investing our resources and reputation into the foundational principles of this industry: transparency, security, and decentralization.”

The CTDG initiative launches with a strong coalition of blockchain partners, each selected for its distinct technological strengths and market focus.

Cointelegraph Decentralization Guardians have created a sustainable model for collaborative validator deployment, enhanced staking experiences and greater network visibility at scale. Validators are more than code, they are the bedrock of a blockchain's integrity, security and resilience. A diverse, robust set of validators ensures that no single entity controls the network, that consensus remains transparent, and that the ecosystem is fortified against attack.

For blockchain networks, partnering with the CTDG initiative is a strategic move to reinforce these core principles. Participation demonstrates a profound commitment to strengthening the validator ecosystem, improving fault tolerance, and fostering long-term, sustainable decentralization. It sends a powerful signal to the community and the broader industry that the network prioritizes open growth and the highest standards of security.

Beyond the technical infrastructure, the initiative leverages Cointelegraph's greatest asset: its global reach. Partner ecosystems will be supported with ongoing educational content and coverage through Cointelegraph's media channels, connecting their technology with a worldwide audience.

Cointelegraph warmly invites blockchain networks and community members to join in shaping a decentralized future that is resilient, inclusive and collaborative.

 Strategy's latest Bitcoin purchases were made following Strategy's STRD, its third Bitcoin-backed preferred stock, launching on the Nasdaq on Wednesday. 

Michael Saylor's Strategy, the world's largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, disclosed its latest BTC purchases made last week amid escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. 

Strategy acquired 10,100 Bitcoin (BTC) for $1 billion during the week ending Sunday, the company officially announced on Monday.

The purchases were made at an average price of $104,080 per coin, with Bitcoin dropping from $110,000 on June 9 to an intraweek low of $103,639 on Thursday, following the news that Israel had struck Iranian nuclear facilities.

The latest haul was Strategy's second Bitcoin acquisition in June, bringing its total holdings to 592,100 BTC, acquired for about $41.8 billion at an average price of $70,666 per coin.

The announcement comes shortly after Strategy's third Bitcoin-backed preferred stock, STRD, began trading on the Nasdaq on Wednesday.

With STRD, Strategy plans to raise $250 million through an initial public offering of a new class of perpetual preferred stock to buy more Bitcoin.

As part of the STRD raise, Strategy will issue 2.5 million shares of its 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock at $100 per share.

With its latest acquisition, Strategy has significantly increased its Bitcoin yield, a measure counting the percentage increase in the value of its Bitcoin holdings over a specific period of time.

According to Strategy's data, the latest purchases increased its year-to-date BTC yield to 19.1%, up 2% from the previous 1,045 BTC buy announced June 9. Its quarter-to-date BTC yield is now 7.4%.

The latest BTC yield surge brings Strategy closer to its targeted YTD yield goal of 25% by the end of 2025. The company previously targeted a smaller yield of 15% but increased it on May 1.

Apart from hinting about Strategy's big purchase on social media, Saylor has been active in encouraging major Bitcoin strategy companies on X, including Japanese firm Metaplanet, which seeks to hold 100,000 BTC by 2026.

Saylor took to X on Monday to congratulate Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich, Bitcoin strategy director Dylan LeClair and the community on Metaplanet's Bitcoin stack reaching 10,000 BTC.

Elsewhere, global crypto analysts have continued posting warnings to global firms adopting Bitcoin strategies like Saylor's company.

On Monday, VanEck's head of digital assets research, Matthew Sigel, took to X to highlight the risks to public companies buying Bitcoin involving the scale of their BTC stack versus their market capitalization.

“If the stock trades at or near NAV [net asset value], continued equity issuance can dilute rather than create value,” Sigel wrote.

Previously, Standard Chartered also warned about the risks of increasing corporate Bitcoin adoption in the context of asset volatility.

FRANKLIN, NJ / ACCESS Newswire / June 16, 2025 / Silver Scott Mines, Inc. (OTC PINK:SILS), a diversified digital technology company focused on healthcare, blockchain, and real-world asset tokenization, proudly announces that its healthcare division, Silver Scott Health, Inc., has launched the Health Trust NFT , a groundbreaking blockchain-based solution designed to empower patients with full control over their medical and genetic data. This innovative platform directly addresses growing privacy concerns sparked by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' reported $600 million bid to acquire 23andMe's genetic data assets, highlighting the risks of corporate exploitation of sensitive personal information without explicit patient consent.

The Health Trust NFT leverages Silver Scott Health's proprietary TrustNFT.io blockchain technology to create a secure, decentralized ecosystem where patients own and manage access to their medical records, including genetic data, through non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Unlike traditional systems where institutions control and monetize patient data, the Health Trust NFT ensures that individuals decide who accesses their information, when, and for what purpose-putting privacy and consent back in the hands of patients.

"Regeneron's bid for 23andMe's data underscores a critical issue: the unauthorized use of personal genetic information for corporate gain," said Stuart Fine, CEO of Silver Scott Mines, Inc. "With the Health Trust NFT, Silver Scott Health is redefining the healthcare landscape by giving patients unprecedented control over their data. This is not just a technological leap; it's a movement toward ethical, patient-centered healthcare."

Key Features of the Health Trust NFT:

Patient-Controlled Access : Patients use their Health Trust NFT to grant or revoke access to their medical and genetic data instantly, ensuring no institution or corporation can use it without explicit permission.

HIPAA-Compliant Security : Built on a private blockchain with advanced encryption, the platform ensures compliance with HIPAA regulations while providing tamper-resistant data storage.

Permissioned Data Sharing : Patients can selectively share specific data with healthcare providers, researchers, or other parties, fostering transparency and trust.

Immutable Consent Records : Blockchain technology logs all consent transactions, creating an auditable trail to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.

Scalable Preventive Health : By empowering patients, the platform supports broader preventive health initiatives, reducing reliance on institutional data monopolies.

The European Central Bank (ECB) is boosting its efforts to introduce the digital euro, a central bank digital currency (CBDC) designed to improve Europe's financial sovereignty.

For users who are concerned about centralized risks, anonymous crypto wallets will be indispensable as adoption of digital currencies grows. Such solutions, like Best Wallet, offer a freedom-first alternative that puts you in control of your privacy and digital assets.

The digital euro is being developed with an ambitious goal in mind: to boost Europe's independence from foreign payment giants (Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal).

As geopolitical tensions continue to rise, the ECB aims to secure Europe's control over its financial systems. The EU no longer wants to be reliant on US-based companies to process transactions – and for legitimate reasons.



Europe is fighting back with the digital euro, as part of its ploy to safeguard its economic future and minimize dependency on external forces. Still the CBDC isn't without its challenges: privacy concerns, security risks, and system integration woes.

This is why Best Wallet and other similar emerging solutions have become increasingly popular.

In the face of privacy and centralization concerns, Best Wallet provides a decentralized solution that allows you to manage your digital assets securely and independently.

Best Wallet is a decentralized, non-custodial crypto wallet. It offers a compelling alternative to centralized systems (like the forthcoming digital euro), as it gives you complete control over your digital assets.

The app already offers direct support for top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ($BTC) and Ethereum ($ETH), as well as pegged coins like Tether ($USDT), making it a good option for users interested in the biggest crypto assets today.

It will soon be expanding its support to over 1,000 cryptocurrencies and 60 blockchain networks, allowing you to seamlessly manage, buy, and swap a wide range of digital assets securely – all in one place.

The app's proprietary cryptocurrency, $BEST, also brings many in-app perks. By holding the token, you secure lower transaction fees and governance rights within the Best Wallet ecosystem.

Having a say in the project's future trajectory is a major boon, as you can vote on key developments, such as which new cryptocurrencies, blockchains, or features should be added.

It's a powerful way to ensure that the system aligns with the needs of community members regarding privacy, accessibility, and cryptocurrency trading options. And Best Wallet already has lots to look forward to in its pipeline, development-wise.

Beyond making crypto onboarding a breeze for new, privacy-centered crypto users, Best Wallet also features a token launchpad for altcoin aficionados.

Here, you can explore the best crypto presales directly within the mobile app and invest in tokens at their lowest-ever prices before they attract mainstream demand. The $BEST token is currently in pre-market and also available on the launchpad.

As the digital euro moves closer to reality, it's clear that Europe is taking proactive measures to reshape its financial landscape amid heightened geopolitical instability.

Thankfully, Best Wallet offers a decentralized solution that puts you in control of your digital assets – free from government oversight and centralization risks.

To get the most out of Best Wallet, you can buy $BEST on presale for just $0.025185. Partly driven by new app developments, the token could hit $0.072 this year, making now a prime time to buy for potential 185%+ returns.

This article isn't financial advice. Do your research before investing in $BEST or other crypto assets. Crypto is highly volatile, and prices can fluctuate rapidly based on market sentiment.

The crypto market's appetite for risk assets returned with force on Monday, with altcoins including Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) surging as traders rotated out of Bitcoin (BTC) following its successful test of the $106,000 level.

SOL is up 6.1% in the last 24 hours, trading at $155.78, while ETH stands at $2,611, gaining 3.7% in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows.

Ethereum "came back into favour after 2.5 years of underperformance" following recent network upgrades, with the narrative shifting toward institutional adoption on Ethereum-based platforms, Sygnum analysts told Decrypt.

Meanwhile, XRP posted a gains of 4.6%, sending it to $2.26, and Cardano (ADA) rose 2.8% to $0.64 in the last 24 hours.

The broader altcoin rally swept across multiple tokens, with HyperLiquid (HYPE) leading the charge among mid-caps with a 9.7% surge to around $44.

The token has overtaken Dogecoin (DOGE)  to become the fifth-largest crypto by futures open interest, with traders placing $2.06 billion in active bets on HYPE contracts, per CoinGlass data.

Market analysts are carefully watching whether this represents the beginning of a broader altcoin season or merely a temporary rotation.

Vadim Taszycki, Head of Growth at StealthEX, told Decrypt institutional interest was a primary driver, noting that "nearly $1.9 billion has flowed into crypto funds" over recent days, according to Farside Investors data.

He also pointed to regulatory momentum, mentioning "the wave of updated SEC filings from major asset managers aiming to launch spot Solana ETFs with staking capabilities" as evidence of shifting sentiment.

“While that attention helps push crypto into the mainstream, it also brings some hesitation, which may be delaying a full altcoin season for now,” the expert said.

The latest gains come despite last Friday's sharp selloff triggered by Israeli airstrikes on Iranian targets, which sent Bitcoin tumbling 4% below $104,000.

Bitcoin has since recovered to $106,724, up by 1.6% in the last 24 hours, as markets viewed the geopolitical shock as a buying opportunity.

“As Bitcoin's positive demand trends continue, driven by the steady progress in institutional adoption and its increased use as a safe haven asset, Bitcoin's fast-shrinking liquid supply is creating the conditions for demand shocks and upside volatility,” Sygnum analysts pointed out.

Marcin Kazmierczak, Co-founder & COO at RedStone, told Decrypt the recent altcoin rally is "being driven by Bitcoin's push past $100,000, with BTC dominance at 61.4%," pointing to strong ETF inflows and technical breakouts as key drivers.

He added that "stablecoin supply held by whales (over $5M) has risen 5% in the past 30 days,” indicating increased buying pressure.

The expert expects a major altcoin surge between September and December, based on historical patterns.

Cryptocurrencies are broadly recovering on Monday, extending gains from the weekend, which followed instability and heightened volatility on Friday as geopolitical tensions exploded in the Middle East. Bitcoin (BTC) hovers above $107,000, up over 4% from its Friday low of $102,664. 

Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) have shown signs of a steadying recovery, bolstered by rising risk-on sentiment, particularly from institutional investors.

The conflict between Israel and Iran has escalated since the initial strike on Friday. After sustaining a wide-scale strike on nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories and military commanders, Iran retaliated by launching drones and missile attacks on Israel.

Reuters reports that Iran has rejected calls for a ceasefire, while Israel has vowed to make Tehran pay for Monday's dawn attacks on Tel Aviv and Haifa. The world remains on edge amid looming escalation.

Despite the recovery observed in major digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, the total market capitalization remains close to last week's lows, around $3.40 trillion. Volatility will likely be one of the main concerns for traders this week.

Digital asset investment products saw cumulative inflows of $1.9 billion last week, marking the ninth consecutive week of positive flows and a record year-to-date total of $13.2 billion, according to CoinShares' report.

Bitcoin experienced a significant rebound, with $1.3 billion in inflows, while Ethereum saw a $583 million inflow. This was the smart contracts token's strongest week since February. 

Ethereum assets under management (AUM) surged to $14.9 billion, while XRP stood out among altcoins, boasting over $11.8 million in weekly inflows. Sui experienced renewed investor interest, with last week's inflows reaching $3.5 million.

"Bitcoin's resilient price action appears underpinned by continued institutional accumulation," QCP Capital states in the latest market update. "Notably, Metaplanet and Strategy have persisted in buying the dip, while spot BTC Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) recorded their seventh consecutive week of inflows," the update added.

The derivative market ticked up over the weekend after sustaining massive liquidations on Friday, which exceeded $1 billion in 24 hours. Bitcoin's Open Interest (OI) has increased to $72 billion, along with a 28% surge in trading volume to $58 billion, according to CoinGlass data.

OI represents the number of active futures and options contracts that have yet to be settled or closed. An increase in OI, in tandem with volume, often signals an improving risk-on sentiment and increased market participation. In other words, traders are willing to bet on Bitcoin's price recovering despite the tensions in the Middle East.

Bitcoin's price hovers slightly at around $107,037 at the time of writing, rising slightly on the day. Short-term technical indicators, such as the 4-hour Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD), indicate a bullish outlook bolstered by a buy signal.

Traders will likely continue to seek exposure to BTC if the MACD indicator sustains the buy signal sent on Sunday when the blue MACD line crossed above the red signal line.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reinforced the bullish grip and momentum after rising above the 50 midline from near-oversold levels on Friday. Further movement toward the overbought territory could pave the way for additional gains toward the key resistance at $110,000.

BTC/USD 4-hour chart

Traders should consider a potential correction below $107,000, especially if the uptrend toward $110,000 loses steam. In such a scenario, key areas of interest would be $106,188, where the 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 100-period EMA converge, and the 200-period EMA at $104,696.

Ethereum's price has remained largely above the 200-period EMA support on the 4-hour chart at around $2,503, marking its lower consolidation limit. Following Friday's sell-off, the ETH price gained bullish momentum, breaking above two key levels: the 100-period EMA, currently at $2,582, and the 50-period EMA at $2,592.

The MACD indicator has maintained a buy signal since Sunday, encouraging traders to seek exposure to ETH. If institutional and retail interest in Ethereum steadies this week, the uptrend could accelerate toward the coveted $3,000 level.

Meanwhile, the price of XRP is printing the second green daily candle after the sell-off that tested the 200-day EMA support at around $2.09 on Friday. The cross-border remittance token is trading at around $2.20 at the time of writing, up over 1.5% on the day.

Traders may anticipate a buy signal if the blue MACD line crosses above the red signal line in upcoming sessions. If demand for XRP overwhelms selling pressure, a breakout toward a recent peak of $2.65 will be on the cards. 

Other key areas for monitoring include the buyer congestion at $2.00 and the seller congestion at $2.40, likely to determine the direction of the trend in the near term.

Token launches influence demand and adoption among market participants. Listings on crypto exchanges deepen the liquidity for an asset and add new participants to an asset's network. This is typically bullish for a digital asset. 

A hack is an event in which an attacker captures a large volume of the asset from a DeFi bridge or hot wallet of an exchange or any other crypto platform via exploits, bugs or other methods. The exploiter then transfers these tokens out of the exchange platforms to ultimately sell or swap the assets for other cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. Such events often involve an en masse panic triggering a sell-off in the affected assets.

Macroeconomic events like the US Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates influence crypto assets mainly through the direct impact they have on the US Dollar. An increase in interest rate typically negatively influences Bitcoin and altcoin prices, and vice versa. If the US Dollar index declines, risk assets and associated leverage for trading gets cheaper, in turn driving crypto prices higher.

Halvings are typically considered bullish events as they slash the block reward in half for miners, constricting the supply of the asset. At consistent demand if the supply reduces, the asset's price climbs.

As Dogecoin and Shiba Inu capture the spotlight, a new set of digital currencies is quietly gaining traction. These emerging altcoins show promise for remarkable growth and could be the next big thing in the cryptocurrency arena. This article delves into five such tokens that might shape the future of digital wealth creation.



The XYZVerse ($XYZ) project, which merges the worlds of sports and crypto, has attracted significant investor interest. Unlike typical memecoins, XYZVerse positions itself as a long-term initiative with a clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, further solidifying its appeal.

During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.003333, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.005. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges.

The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization.

So far, more than $14 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $15 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors.

In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors aren't just spectators—they're rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It's a game where the most passionate players win big.

With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary.

Imagine a world where you can trace your favorite fashion item or dinner ingredients back to their origins with ease. VeChain is making this a reality. Founded in 2015 by Sunny Lu, former CIO at Louis Vuitton China, VeChain uses blockchain technology to assign unique IDs and sensors to physical products. This means every step of a product's journey—from creation to delivery—is recorded and transparent. Industries like luxury fashion, food and beverage, and automotive are benefiting from this system by verifying authenticity and managing recalls more efficiently.

VeChain's native token, VET, ranks among the top 40 cryptocurrencies by market cap, highlighting its growing adoption. In 2018, VeChain launched its own blockchain, VeChainThor, and introduced a dual-token system with VET and VeThor Token (VTHO). This setup helps in value transfer and covers transaction fees, making the system more efficient. With partnerships involving big names like Walmart China, BMW, and PricewaterhouseCoopers, VeChain is demonstrating real-world utility. Its unique proof-of-authority consensus mechanism enhances transaction validation. As businesses increasingly look for secure and transparent solutions, VeChain stands out as a promising option in the current market landscape.

Ondo Finance combines traditional finance and blockchain technology. By turning stable, income-generating real-world assets into digital tokens, Ondo makes high-quality financial products accessible to more people. It has two main parts: one creates these tokenized products, and the other builds technology to support them. This helps their offerings work better and reach more users.

In a market where trust and security are big concerns, Ondo stands out. They partner with reputable firms like BlackRock and use Coinbase for asset custody. They value transparency and follow regulations. Their product USDY offers stablecoin accessibility with added yield, backed by US Treasuries and bank deposits. For non-US investors seeking regulated and transparent products, USDY is attractive. Compared to other coins, Ondo's focus on real-world assets and compliance makes it appealing in a market looking for stability. Their approach could set a new trend in blending traditional finance with crypto.

Maker (MKR) is more than just another cryptocurrency. It's the heart of MakerDAO and the Maker Protocol on the Ethereum blockchain. These platforms let users create and manage DAI, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. MKR tokens give holders a say in how DAI is run. While MKR holders don't earn dividends, they can vote on key decisions, shaping the future of the system.

In today's market, MKR stands out because it offers real utility and community control. As one of the first projects in decentralized finance (DeFi), it has a proven track record. Its success is tied to DAI's growth. With more people seeking stable investments in crypto, DAI's use could rise, boosting MKR's value. Compared to other coins that promise big gains but lack substance, MKR provides a solid foundation. Its role in DeFi makes it an attractive option now.

In the quirky world of cryptocurrency, FARTCOIN is making a loud entrance. Built on the Solana blockchain, it's a memecoin that mixes internet humor with digital money. Users can earn tokens by sharing fart-themed memes, jokes, or short posts. Every transaction comes with a playful twist—the “Gas Fee” feature triggers a digital fart sound. This turns ordinary transfers into funny moments, nodding to both blockchain terms and meme culture.

But there's more than just laughs. The “Terminal of Truth” is an AI-powered tool that helps create new content and boosts community fun. By blending user-made jokes with artificial intelligence, FARTCOIN turns viral humor into a shared movement. In a market where memecoins often fizzle out, FARTCOIN stands out with its unique approach. Its mix of humor, technology, and community spirit could make it a hit. While the crypto market is always changing, coins that engage users in new ways have a chance to shine. FARTCOIN just might be the breath of fresh air the crypto world needs.

VET, ONDO, MKR, and FART are promising altcoins, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out by uniting sports fans and aiming for massive growth within its community-driven ecosystem.

The lean green Pepe machine with a flair for crypto trading that would put Jordan Belfort's calls to shame is proving exactly why they call him Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE).



 



 



Since launching in February, the $WEPE token has surged 233% in June alone – powered by the rise of its Alpha Chat community, a private trading hub that's delivered serious gains for its members.

Fueling the rally further is growing hype around the upcoming WEPE NFT collection – a key that unlocks rewards, access, and future perks across the ecosystem. It's all part of the mission: empowering the retail crowd to outmaneuver the whales who've dominated crypto for too long.

Because when retail bands together, no whale can rig the tide. And if you're done watching them eat, it's time to eat with the WEPE Army – the side that keeps choosing rich.

 

Of course, Wall Street Pepe wouldn't be strutting down the digital temple of capitalism, phone in hand and smug in a suit, if he couldn't back it up with trades that would've put Stratton Oakmont to shame in its heyday.

Since launching its Alpha Chat on March 17, the group has grown to over 1,200 active members – each gaining access to exclusive trading signals, market insights, and educational content.

But even before the presale ended, $WEPE had already earned a reputation for serious trading alpha. The team behind Wall Street Pepe aren't just meme curators – they're seasoned crypto traders, and it shows.

Alpha Chat members have posted massive wins, with many reporting 500% to 1,000% returns from signals. One standout member even turned their initial stack into 20x through just three trades. Cumulative wins across the group are up over 1,500%, with the biggest single trade yielding 700%.

Some of the most talked-about calls include a 178% return on DogWifHat (WIF) on April 1, followed by a 290% gain on MogCoin (MOG) on April 9. From April 11 to 28, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) delivered another 220% boost. 

The team also called AI16Z on April 28, which delivered 55%, while May's plays like PopCat (POPCAT) and MooDeng (MOODENG) brought in 100% and 700%, respectively.

While Alpha Chat delivers the trades, the upcoming WEPE NFT collection is building the culture – the culture built on flipping charts and flipping off whales in the same breath.

Through its ongoing campaign on QuestN – Web3's go-to platform for social engagement and quest-based rewards – Wall Street Pepe is onboarding its next squadron of loyal supporters. 

Over 150,000 participants have already joined, completing quests to earn raffle tickets, mint spots, and exclusive perks tied to the NFT launch.



https://app.questn.com/Wepe

And this isn't just for clicks and clout. The campaign has driven over 10 million impressions and 7.5 million profile views, turning heads across Web3.

The upcoming NFT drop will feature 5,000 generative Wall Street Pepe art pieces – each unlocking token-gated rewards, alpha group access, and exclusive community features. Alpha Chat members get guaranteed whitelist and one free mint, while the public mint is expected to go live at just $3–$5.

In short: Wall Street Pepe's NFTs offer access – the kind that turns retail traders into rainmakers.

If you want to be a rainmaker yourself and beat the whales at their own game, join the WEPE Army by scooping up your $WEPE tokens on the Wall Street Pepe website – then secure exclusive access to its upcoming NFT drop by joining the live campaign.

Just head to app.questn.com, connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet), make a profile, and link your socials. From there, hit the WEPE campaign page and start completing daily quests.

Every action earns you points – and the most active users will unlock guaranteed whitelist spots for the WEPE NFT collection. Holding $WEPE boosts your score and puts you ahead of the pack.



https://twitter.com/WEPEToken/status/1920862031453782373

The campaign is already handing out daily prizes and exclusive mints. But more than that, it's building an army – not of whales, but of everyday traders claiming their seat at the table.

You want in? Move now. Because on Wall Street Pepe's turf, retail runs the floor.

Edoardo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy and a vocal supporter of XRP, boldly claims that owning at least 1,000 XRP could be life-changing.

He supports this view with geopolitical and financial developments, arguing that XRP will play a significant role in the future of global finance.

Farina's thesis centers on a key upcoming milestone: the official launch of the European Central Bank's (ECB) digital euro, slated for October 2025. He emphasizes that Christine Lagarde, ECB President, has made it clear that all European institutions will be involved in rolling out the digital euro as “the currency of the future.”

With central banks across Europe preparing for the Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) era, Farina believes XRP could play an instrumental role. He claims the TIPS system (Target Instant Payment Settlement), used across Europe, shows ties to the XRP Ledger. However, this remains unconfirmed.

Farina argues that the XRP Ledger isn't just theoretically capable; the Central Bank of France may have already tested it for digital payments. Furthermore, Palau's digital currency, which uses the euro and is built on XRPL, may serve as a testbed for broader use in the Eurozone.

Furthermore, Farina points to Ripple's potential acquisition of Circle, the issuer of USDC, one of the few stablecoins compliant with Europe's new MiCA regulations. This move, Farina argues, could position Ripple to dominate the regulated stablecoin market and cement its infrastructure within the EU's financial system.

To further illustrate XRP's potential price reaction, Farina draws a parallel to Stellar (XLM). He noted XLM surged over 200% following the announcement that Ukraine would build its CBDC on the Stellar network. He speculates that XRP could experience a similar, if not greater, rally if the digital euro is confirmed to run on the XRP Ledger.

While NDAs may delay public announcements, Farina warns that once the news breaks, “the train will leave the station fast.”

Based on these speculative scenarios, Farina insists that holding 1,000 XRP is essential for those serious about their financial positioning. At today's price of around $2.18, accumulating 1,000 XRP would cost approximately $2,180.

In Farina's view, this could be a strategic decision for investors who believe in the asset's long-term role in global finance. He frames this as a “non-negotiable” goal for those aiming to future-proof their portfolios.

The view is that XRP could reach anywhere from $100 to $1,000 in the coming years, potentially putting those who hold 1,000 tokens on the path to realizing their millionaire dreams. However, this remains highly speculative, as it could take several decades for XRP to reach those lofty heights.

Yet, Farina warns that once institutions start FOMOing in, retail investors may find themselves priced out.

“Ignoring XRP or not holding at least 1,000 would be the definition of insanity,” he concludes.

A widely followed trader believes that a layer-1 decentralized exchange (DEX) altcoin is gearing up for rallies to new all-time highs.

Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 248,500 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks Hyperliquid (HYPE) looks very strong despite the recent marketwide correction.

The trader sees HYPE consolidating close to the highs for now before igniting a fresh leg up en route to a new record high.

“HYPE has insane strength right now, this one got bought up quickly. wouldn't be surprised to see a bit more chop around here but $50+ is destined, even in these crazy times.”

At time of writing, HYPE is worth $40.44.

While Altcoin Sherpa is bullish on HYPE, he says he's bearish on two Solana (SOL)-based memecoins. The trader notes that dogwifhat (WIF) and Popcat (POPCAT) are both in the midst of a downtrend and may drop to much lower levels if BTC fails to print new all-time highs.

“Moment of truth for many of these [coins] soon; that could have just been a lower high formed. It's all going to be dependent on BTC. If we see it blast through the highs, we're going up again. If not, alts probably go [down] another 30-50%. Can see some examples with WIF, POPCAT.”

Based on the trader's chart, he seems to predict that POPCAT could fall to as low as $0.22. At time of writing, POPCAT is worth $0.31.

Looking at the trader's chart, he seems to suggest that WIF could plunge to $0.60. At time of writing, WIF is trading for $0.839.

A published research paper is the result of an extensive conversation between authors and reviewers, guided by editors.Credit: Getty

Since 2020, Nature has offered authors the opportunity to have their peer-review file published alongside their paper. Our colleagues at Nature Communications have been doing so since 2016. Until now, Nature authors could opt in to this process of transparent peer review. From 16 June, however, new submissions of manuscripts that are published as research articles in Nature will automatically include a link to the reviewers' reports and author responses.

It means that, over time, more Nature papers will include a peer-review file. The identity of the reviewers will remain anonymous, unless they choose otherwise — as happens now. But the exchanges between the referees and the authors will be accessible to all. Our aim in doing so is to open up what many see as the ‘black box' of science, shedding light on how a research paper is made. This serves to increase transparency and (we hope) to build trust in the scientific process.

Research evaluation needs to change with the times

Research evaluation needs to change with the times

As we have written previously, a published research paper is the result of an extensive conversation between authors and reviewers, guided by editors. These discussions, which can last for months, aim to improve a study's clarity and the robustness of its conclusions. It is a hugely important process that should receive increased recognition, including acknowledgement of the reviewers involved, if they choose to be named. For early-career researchers, there is great value in seeing inside a process that is key to their career development. Making peer-reviewer reports public also enriches science communication: it's a chance to add to the ‘story' of how a result is arrived at, or a conclusion supported, even if it includes only the perspectives of authors and reviewers. The full story of a paper is, of course, more complex, involving many other contributors.

Many people think of science as something fixed and unchanging. But scientific knowledge evolves as new or more-nuanced evidence comes to light. Scientists constantly discuss their results, yet these debates are not contained in research papers and often remain unreported in wider science-communication efforts.

Three-year trial shows support for recognizing peer reviewers

Three-year trial shows support for recognizing peer reviewers

The COVID-19 pandemic provided a brief interlude during which much of the world got to see how research works, almost in real time. It's easy to forget that, right from the start, we were continuously learning something new about the nature and behaviour of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. On television screens, in newspapers and on social media worldwide, scientists were discussing among themselves and with public audiences the nature of the virus, how it infects people and how it spreads. They were debating treatments and prevention methods, constantly adjusting everyone's knowledge as fresh evidence came to light. And then, it went mostly back to business as usual.

We hope that publishing the peer-reviewer reports of all newly submitted Nature papers shows, in a small way, that this doesn't need to remain the case. Nature started mandating peer review for all published research articles only in 1973 (M. Baldwin Notes Rec. 69, 337–352; 2015). But the convention in most fields is still to keep the content of these peer-review exchanges confidential. That has meant that the wider research community, and the world, has had few opportunities to learn what is discussed.

Peer review improves papers. The exchanges between authors and referees should be seen as a crucial part of the scientific record, just as they are a key part of doing and disseminating research.

“This sarcophagus offers an unusual perspective of the idea of death—not as an end, but as the beginning of a new path.”

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Dionysus is the twice-born Greek god of wine, the son of Zeus and a mortal woman named Semele. Similarly, Heracles (more commonly known by his Latin name, Hercules) was also sired by Zeus with a human mother. Recently, archaeologists found a sarcophagus depicting the two mythic figures fighting an epic battle—except it wasn't a fist fight or a clash of swords. It was a drinking competition. A team from the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) unearthed the coffin outside the city of Caesarea. 

According to a translated press release from the IAA, the excavations were “like a scene out of a movie.” As archeologists brushed away the sand, a marble object began to appear, and the team was shocked by the intricate gods, animals, and trees carved into the stone. By the final hour of excavations, researchers uncovered an entire intact side of the sarcophagus that depicted Hercules lounging on his lion skin, chalice in hand. 

After the excavation, a team from the IAA's conservation team worked to restore the different images. After hours of cleaning and reassembling the broken sarcophagus, a scene depicting Dionysus surrounded by a party of mythological characters—including Maenads (female followers of Dionysus), satyrs, the gods Hermes and Pan, lions, and tigers—was revealed. 

This isn't the first time this motif has appeared in Roman art, according to IAA archeologist Nohar Shahar. He explained in the press release that Dionysus often appears on second and third century B.C. sarcophagi, though the “wine competition” imagery primarily occurs in mosaics. In fact, this is the first time a sarcophagus with the wine competition scene was found in the region, making it particularly interesting to researchers. 

“In this case, it seems that the figures are not only celebrating—they are in fact accompanying the dead on his last journey, when drinking and dancing are transformed into a symbol of liberation and transition to life in the next world,” Shahar explained. “This sarcophagus offers an unusual perspective of the idea of death—not as an end, but as the beginning of a new path.”

History lesson aside, there's one glaring question that can't be ignored: who won this “battle of the beers,” Hercules or Dionysus? According to Shahar, the answer is quite obvious. 

“Hercules' condition, depicted on the sarcophagus as someone who is no longer able to stand, points to the obvious answer: Dionysus,” he said in the release.

The tomb was also found outside the walls of Caesarea, suggesting that the city wasn't just prosperous inside the gates, but also in the surrounding area. Eli Escusido, Director of the IAA, highlighted the cultural richness the excavation brings to the region.  

“This is a thought-provoking discovery reflecting how life and faith were perceived in the Roman world,” he said in the press release. “The sarcophagus is undergoing a meticulous conservation process, which upon completion will enable it to be presented to the general public as part of our commitment to making the country's past heritage accessible.”

Metrics details

Approximately half of the Universe's dark matter resides in collapsed halos; significantly less than half of the baryonic matter (protons and neutrons) remains confined to halos. A small fraction of baryons are in stars and the interstellar medium within galaxies. The majority are diffuse (<10−3 cm−3) and ionized (neutral fraction <10−4), located in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and in the halos of galaxy clusters, groups and galaxies. This diffuse ionized gas is notoriously difficult to measure, but has wide implications for galaxy formation, astrophysical feedback and precision cosmology. Recently, the dispersion of extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs) has been used to measure the total content of cosmic baryons. Here we present a large cosmological sample of FRB sources localized to their host galaxies. We have robustly partitioned the missing baryons into the IGM, galaxy clusters and galaxies, providing a late-Universe measurement of the cosmic baryon abundance, \({\varOmega }_{{\mathrm{b}}}{h}_{70}=0.05{1}_{-0.006}^{+0.006}\), where Ωb is the baryon density parameter and h70 is the scaled Hubble constant. Our results indicate efficient feedback processes that can deplete galaxy halos and enrich the IGM (total baryon fraction in the IGM is \({f}_{{\rm{IGM}}}=0.7{6}_{-0.11}^{+0.10}\)), agreeing with the baryon-rich cosmic web scenario seen in cosmological simulations. Our results may reduce the ‘S8 tension' in cosmology, as strong feedback leads to suppression of the matter power spectrum.

This subset of sources are the FRBs that did not make it into our companion paper's host galaxy analysis, either because they were discovered after November 2023 or because their host did not meet the r ~ 23.5 mag criteria. Each image is centred on the host galaxy candidate preferred by PATH, identified by cyan cross-hairs6. The 90% confidence FRB localization regions are marked as red ellipses. All images were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of σ = 0″. 2 – 0″. 4 to improve visibility.

Panels a-d show Macquart Relations for different components of diffuse cosmic gas from a mock FRB survey10. We plot \({{\rm{DM}}}_{{\rm{ex}}/{z}_{\rm s}}\) for intervening halos (green, panel a), the IGM (grey, b), and total DM (black, c). The solid curves are the mean extragalactic DM at that redshift. Panel d shows the total extragalactic DM distribution after including a log-normal host DM distribution, where the heatmap is the log probability and the redpoints are the actual samples. Panel e is a radial treemap showing the partition of baryons in TNG300-1.

The two upper rows show the 2D P(DMIGM, DMX) distribution, which is the relative probability in DMIGM and DMX for FRBs at zs = 0.5 (top) and zs = 1.0 (middle) for increasing values of the halo gas fraction, fX. We use a bivariate log-normal distribution that has been calibrated to mock FRB surveys in the Illustris TNG300-1 simulation. The distribution ensures that DMIGM and DMX are correlated, since sightlines that pass through halos are more likely to pass through overdensities in the cosmic web and have large DMIGM. In order to compute our final likelihood function, the 2D distribution shown in the top two rows must be integrated along curves of constant cosmic DM, \({{\rm{DM}}}_{\cos }={{\rm{DM}}}_{{\rm{IGM}}}+{{\rm{DM}}}_{{\rm{X}}}\). The resulting \(P({{\rm{DM}}}_{{\rm{ex}}}| {z}_{\rm s},\overrightarrow{\theta })\) are show in the bottom row, with μhost = 4.5 and σhost = 0.7. The bottom left and bottom right likelihoods are not supported by our data.

The value of \({{\rm{DM}}}_{\cos }={{\rm{DM}}}_{{\rm{IGM}}}+{{\rm{DM}}}_{{\rm{X}}}\) averaged over a large number of sightlines is a direct measure of the cosmic density of diffuse, ionized baryonic matter, fd Ωb. We show the results from two different methods for estimating the ionized fraction of baryons, fd. The corner plot in panel a shows pairwise posteriors from an MCMC fit, which produces \({f}_{d}=0.9{3}_{-0.05}^{+0.04}\) after marginalizing over the host DM parameters. In panel b we plot the diffuse fraction of baryons as a function of redshift for our sample of localized FRBs with 1σ error bars (red markers). Over-plotted as black points are the zs > 0.2 sample we use to compute a weighted average of fd. The right side shows the probability P(fd) from kernel density estimation (KDE), where the red distribution is for the whole sample.

We plot the fraction of matter bound in massive groups and galaxy clusters above a given mass, defined here as M500. The left vertical axis shows the fraction of cosmic baryons within r500 of halos with mass greater than M500. The right vertical axis shows the total matter bound in halos. The divergence at low masses is due to the apparent scarcity of baryons in smaller halos.

Truly Intelligent AI Could Play by the Rules, No Matter How Strange

To build safe but powerful AI models, start by testing their ability to play games on the fly

By Vinay K. Chaudhri edited by Dan Vergano

A proposed game-playing challenge would evaluate AIs on how well they can adapt to and follow new rules.

Tic-tac-toe is about as simple as games get—but as Scientific American's legendary contributor Martin Gardner pointed out almost 70 years ago, it has complex variations and strategic aspects. They range from “reverse” games—where the first player to make three in a row loses—to three-dimensional versions played on cubes and beyond. Gardner's games, even if they boggle a typical human mind, might point us to a way to make artificial intelligence more humanlike.

That's because games in their endless variety—with rules that must be imagined, understood and followed—are part of what makes us human. Navigating rules is also a key challenge for AI models as they start to approximate human thought. And as things stand, it's a challenge where most of these models fall short.

That's a big deal because if there's a path to artificial general intelligence, the ultimate goal of machine-learning and AI research, it can only come through building AIs that are capable of interpreting, adapting to and rigidly following the rules we set for them.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

To drive the development of such AI, we must develop a new test—let's call it the Gardner test—in which an AI is surprised with the rules of a game and is then expected to play by those rules without human intervention. One simple way to achieve the surprise is to disclose the rules only when the game begins.

The Gardner test, with apologies to the Turing test, is inspired by and builds on the pioneering work in AI on general game playing (GGP), a field largely shaped by Stanford University professor Michael Genesereth. In GGP competitions, AIs running on standard laptops face off against other AIs in games whose rules—written in a formal mathematical language—are revealed only at the start. The test proposed here advances a new frontier: accepting game rules expressed in a natural language such as English. Once a distant goal, this is now within reach of modern AIs because of the recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) such as those that power ChatGPT and that fall within the families of Claude and Llama.

The proposed challenge should include a battery of tests that could be initially focused on games that have been staples of GGP competitions such as Connect Four, Hex and Pentago. It should also leverage an impressive array of games that Gardner wrote about. Test design could benefit from the involvement of the vibrant international GGP research community, developers of frontier AI models and, of course, diehard Martin Gardner fans.

But to pass the new test, it isn't enough to create an AI system that's good at playing one specific predetermined game or even many. Instead, an AI must be designed to master any strategy game on the fly. Strategy games require humanlike ability to think across and beyond multiple steps, deal with unpredictable responses, adapt to changing objectives and still conform to a strict rule set.

That's a big leap from today's top game-playing AI models, which rely on knowing the rules in advance to train their algorithms. Consider, for instance, AlphaZero, the revolutionary AI model that's capable of playing three games—chess, Go and shogi (Japanese chess)—at a superhuman level. AlphaZero learns through a technique known as “self-play”—it repeatedly plays against a copy of itself, and from that experience, it gets better over time. Self-play, however, requires the rules of each game to be set before training. AlphaZero's ability to master complex games is undoubtedly impressive, but it's a brittle system: if you present AlphaZero with a game different than the ones it's learned, it will be completely flummoxed. In contrast, an AI model performing well on the proposed new test would be capable of adapting to new rules, even in the absence of data; it would play any game and follow any novel rule set with power and precision.

That last point—precision—is an important one. You can prompt many generative AI systems to execute variants on simple games, and they'll play along: ChatGPT can play a 4×4 or 5×5 variant of tic-tac-toe, for instance. But an LLM prompt is best thought of as a suggestion rather than a concrete set of rules—that's why we often have to coax, wheedle and prompt tune LLMs into doing exactly what we want. A general intelligence that would pass the Gardner test, by contrast, would by definition be able to follow the rules perfectly: not following a rule exactly would mean failing the test.

Specialized tools that operate without truly understanding the rules tend to color outside the lines, reproducing past errors from training data rather than adhering to the rules we set. It's easy to imagine real-world scenarios in which such errors could be catastrophic: in a national security context, for instance, AI capabilities are needed that can accurately apply rules of engagement dynamically or negotiate subtle but crucial differences in legal and command authorities. In finance, programmable money is emerging as a new form of currency that can obey rules of ownership and transferability—and misapplying these rules could lead to financial disaster.

Ironically, building AI systems that can follow rules rigorously would ultimately make it possible to create machine intelligences that are far more humanlike in their flexibility and ability to adapt to uncertain and novel situations. When we think of human game players, we tend to think of specialists: Magnus Carlsen is a great chess player but might not be so hot at Texas Hold'Em. The point, though, is that humans are capable of generalizing; if Carlsen ever gave up chess, he could be a decent contender for the Pentamind World Championship, which celebrates the best all-round games player.

Game playing with a novel set of rules is crucial to the next evolution of AI because it will potentially let us create AIs that will be capable of anything—but that will also meticulously and reliably follow the rules we set for them. If we want powerful but safe AI, testing its ability in playing games on the fly might be the best path forward.

Scientists have discovered a unique class of small antibodies that are strongly protective against a wide range of SARS coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1 and numerous early and recent SARS-CoV-2 variants. The unique antibodies target an essential highly conserved site at the base of the virus's spike protein, effectively clamping it shut and preventing the virus from infecting cells. The findings, published in Nature Communications, offer a promising route to developing broad-spectrum antiviral treatments that could remain effective against future viral variants.

SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19, continues to be a potential threat as it evolves into newer variants that are resistant to currently approved antibody therapies. Resistance largely emerges because antibodies typically target virus regions, such as the receptor binding domain of the spike protein, that also frequently mutate, enabling escape from antibody recognition.

To address this, a research team led by Prof. Xavier Saelens and Dr. Bert Schepens at the VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology explored a different strategy by focusing on one of the more stable subunits of the spike protein. The so-called S2 subunit is critical for the virus's ability to fuse with host cells, a process essential for infection, and it is more conserved across different coronaviruses.

A molecular clamp on the virus

The team turned to llamas (more specifically a llama called Winter). Llamas generate so-called single-domain antibodies, also known as VHHs or nanobodies, that are much smaller than the antibodies generated by most animals, including humans. The researchers identified several llama antibodies that strongly neutralize a broad panel of SARS coronaviruses.

What makes these antibodies particularly promising is their unique mode of action: they act like a molecular clamp. They latch onto the poorly exposed, highly conserved region (a coiled coil of 3 alpha helices) at the base of the virus's spike protein. In doing so, they lock the spike protein in its original shape, physically preventing it from unfolding into the form the virus needs to infect cells.

The antibodies showed strong protection against infection in lab animals, even at low doses. And when researchers attempted to force the virus to evolve resistance, the virus struggled, producing only rare escape variants that were much less infectious. This points to a powerful, hard-to-evade treatment option.

"This region is so crucial to the virus that it can't easily mutate without weakening the virus itself," explains Schepens, senior author of the study. "That gives us a rare advantage: a target that's both essential and stable across variants."

Better treatments

This discovery marks a significant advancement in the quest for durable and broadly effective antiviral therapies, offering hope for treatments that can keep pace with viral evolution.

"The combination of high potency, broad activity against numerous viral variants, and a high barrier to resistance is incredibly promising," adds Saelens. "This work provides a strong foundation for developing next-generation antibodies that could be vital in combating not only current but also future coronavirus threats."

This research was made possible with financial support from, among others, the Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO), EOS, EU Horizon 2021, and Exevir.

Metrics details

Precision engineering of semiconductor nanomaterials remains difficult. Here we present a programmable approach to synthesizing a library of atomically precise semiconductor nanoclusters via cation exchange. Using a universal metal–ligand coordination complex to program cations and surface ligands, and a Cu26Se13 template cluster to control the anion lattice, we synthesize a homologous series of Zn14Se13, Cd14Se13 and Hg14Se13 clusters, all featuring a pair of prominent absorption peaks. The shared A14B13 framework with icosahedral anion packing and tetrahedral cation bonding serves as a blueprint for constructing chiral semiconductor nanostructures. Theoretical calculations reveal atom-like frontier orbitals, including triply degenerate P-type orbitals for holes and singlet S-type orbitals for electrons. The doublet absorptions originate from the spin–orbit splitting of the P → S transition. The precise and programmable synthesis is expected to enable atomic-level control over the optical, electronic and spin properties of semiconductor artificial atoms and their assemblies.

Metrics details

Due to the structural complexity of natural products, their target-oriented syntheses usually require the design of individualized routes that are tailor-made for the specific targets. As such, route redesign is needed when targets of different skeletal connectivities are considered. Here we report a versatile synthetic strategy that runs counter to this conventional wisdom and allows access to a range of terpenoids with distinct skeletal frameworks from the sesquiterpene lactone sclareolide as the starting material. By viewing a biocatalytically installed alcohol as an exploitable motif rather than a structural endpoint, a number of abiotic skeletal rearrangements were designed, resulting in substantial structural divergence from the original drimane ring system of sclareolide. Using this approach, the syntheses of four terpenoid natural products, namely, merosterolic acid B, cochlioquinone B, (+)-daucene and dolasta-1(15),8-diene, were achieved.

Mathematicians Come Up with ‘Mind-Blowing' Method for Defining Prime Numbers

Using a notion called integer partitions, mathematicians have discovered a new way to detect prime numbers while also connecting two areas of math in an unexpected way

By Rachel Crowell edited by Clara Moskowitz

For centuries, prime numbers have captured the imaginations of mathematicians, who continue to search for new patterns that help identify them and the way they're distributed among other numbers. Primes are whole numbers that are greater than 1 and are divisible by only 1 and themselves. The three smallest prime numbers are 2, 3 and 5. It's easy to find out if small numbers are prime—one simply needs to check what numbers can factor them. When mathematicians consider large numbers, however, the task of discerning which ones are prime quickly mushrooms in difficulty. Although it might be practical to check if, say, the numbers 10 or 1,000 have more than two factors, that strategy is unfavorable or even untenable for checking if gigantic numbers are prime or composite. For instance, the largest known prime number, which is 2¹³⁶²⁷⁹⁸⁴¹ − 1, is 41,024,320 digits long. At first, that number may seem mind-bogglingly large. Given that there are infinitely many positive integers of all different sizes, however, this number is minuscule compared with even larger primes.

Furthermore, mathematicians want to do more than just tediously attempt to factor numbers one by one to determine if any given integer is prime. “We're interested in the prime numbers because there are infinitely many of them, but it's very difficult to identify any patterns in them,” says Ken Ono, a mathematician at the University of Virginia. Still, one main goal is to determine how prime numbers are distributed within larger sets of numbers.

Recently, Ono and two of his colleagues—William Craig, a mathematician at the U.S. Naval Academy, and Jan-Willem van Ittersum, a mathematician at the University of Cologne in Germany—identified a whole new approach for finding prime numbers. “We have described infinitely many new kinds of criteria for exactly determining the set of prime numbers, all of which are very different from ‘If you can't factor it, it must be prime,'” Ono says. He and his colleagues' paper, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, was runner-up for a physical science prize that recognizes scientific excellence and originality. In some sense, the finding offers an infinite number of new definitions for what it means for numbers to be prime, Ono notes.

At the heart of the team's strategy is a notion called integer partitions. “The theory of partitions is very old,” Ono says. It dates back to the 18th-century Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, and it has continued to be expanded and refined by mathematicians over time. “Partitions, at first glance, seem to be the stuff of child's play,” Ono says. “How many ways can you add up numbers to get other numbers?” For instance, the number 5 has seven partitions: 4 + 1, 3 + 2, 3 + 1 + 1, 2 + 2 + 1, 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 and 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1.

Yet the concept turns out to be powerful as a hidden key that unlocks new ways of detecting primes. “It is remarkable that such a classical combinatorial object—the partition function—can be used to detect primes in this novel way,” says Kathrin Bringmann, a mathematician at the University of Cologne. (Bringmann has worked with Ono and Craig before, and she's currently van Ittersum's postdoctoral adviser, but she wasn't involved with this research.) Ono notes that the idea for this approach originated in a question posed by one of his former students, Robert Schneider, who's now a mathematician at Michigan Technological University.

Ono, Craig and van Ittersum proved that prime numbers are the solutions of an infinite number of a particular type of polynomial equation in partition functions. Named Diophantine equations after third-century mathematician Diophantus of Alexandria (and studied long before him), these expressions can have integer solutions or rational ones (meaning they can be written as a fraction). In other words, the finding shows that “integer partitions detect the primes in infinitely many natural ways,” the researchers wrote in their PNAS paper.

George Andrews, a mathematician at Pennsylvania State University, who edited the PNAS paper but wasn't involved with the research, describes the finding as “something that's brand new” and “not something that was anticipated,” making it difficult to predict “where it will lead.”

The discovery goes beyond probing the distribution of prime numbers. “We're actually nailing all the prime numbers on the nose,” Ono says. In this method, you can plug an integer that is 2 or larger into particular equations, and if they are true, then the integer is prime. One such equation is (3n3 − 13n2 + 18n − 8)M1(n) + (12n2 − 120n + 212)M2(n) − 960M3(n) = 0, where M1(n), M2(n) and M3(n) are well-studied partition functions. “More generally,” for a particular type of partition function, “we prove that there are infinitely many such prime detecting equations with constant coefficients,” the researchers wrote in their PNAS paper. Put more simply, “it's almost like our work gives you infinitely many new definitions for prime,” Ono says. “That's kind of mind-blowing.”

The team's findings could lead to many new discoveries, Bringmann notes. “Beyond its intrinsic mathematical interest, this work may inspire further investigations into the surprising algebraic or analytic properties hidden in combinatorial functions,” she says. In combinatorics—the mathematics of counting—combinatorial functions are used to describe the number of ways that items in sets can be chosen or arranged. “More broadly, it shows the richness of connections in mathematics,” she adds. “These kinds of results often stimulate fresh thinking across subfields.”

Bringmann suggests some potential ways that mathematicians could build on the research. For instance, they could explore what other types of mathematical structures could be found using partition functions or look for ways that the main result could be expanded to study different types of numbers. “Are there generalizations of the main result to other sequences, such as composite numbers or values of arithmetic functions?” she asks.

“Ken Ono is, in my opinion, one of the most exciting mathematicians around today,” Andrews says. "This isn't the first time that he has seen into a classic problem and brought really new things to light.”

There remains a glut of open questions about prime numbers, many of which are long-standing. Two examples are the twin prime conjecture and Goldbach's conjecture. The twin prime conjecture states that there are infinitely many twin primes—prime numbers that are separated by a value of two. The numbers 5 and 7 are twin primes, as are 11 and 13. Goldbach's conjecture states that “every even number bigger than 2 is a sum of two primes in at least one way,” Ono says. But no one has proven this conjecture to be true.

“Problems like that have befuddled mathematicians and number theorists for generations, almost throughout the entire history of number theory,” Ono says. Although his team's recent finding doesn't solve those problems, he says, it's a profound example of how mathematicians are pushing boundaries to better understand the mysterious nature of prime numbers.

RFK, Jr., Fires CDC Vaccine Panel, Oceans Are Acidifying, and Pangolins Face Newly Understood Threat

Major changes hit a key CDC vaccine advisory panel, ocean acidification crosses a critical threshold, and new research reveals an unexpected threat to pangolins.

Rachel Feltman: Happy Monday, listeners! For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. You're listening to the weekly science news roundup. Let's dive right in.

First, I've got a quick dispatch from Lauren Young, associate editor for health and medicine at Scientific American. Last week Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, announced the dismissal of all the public health experts on the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The ACIP is an independent committee that counsels the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccines. Here's Lauren now to tell us more about the situation.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

Lauren Young: So a little rundown of what ACIP does: the committee's recommendations help guide doctors, health practitioners and the general public on whether or not various groups of people should get access to vaccines and when. So for instance, they help shape immunization schedules for adults, kids, pregnant people and those with preexisting health conditions that may make them more vulnerable to severe illness.

So the ACIP meets about three times a year, and the meetings are open to the public and typically broadcasted and recorded online; you can go back and watch old meetings. The ACIP members review all sorts of different types of data: evidence from government scientists, studies from vaccine manufacturers, independent studies, etcetera.

In Kennedy's announcement of the dismissals in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, he framed the firings as a “bold step in restoring public trust” in the committee and said that a total rehaul of ACIP is needed. HHS also made a statement that the next meeting on June 25–27 is still on the books. And that upcoming meeting is a big one: votes for the upcoming fall COVID vaccines as well as guidance for flu and RSV vaccines are all on the table.

I spoke with Brown University epidemiologist Jennifer Nuzzo, and she says that without ACIP's nonpartisan expert guidance, access to vaccines can easily become interrupted. She also points out that the HHS secretary makes final approvals of new members, giving a potential opportunity for Kennedy, who has a history being an anti-vaccine advocate, to potentially stack the committee with new members who may support anti-vaccine views. And this can have larger consequences on access to all vaccines in the United States.

So if the ACIP doesn't recommend a vaccine, health insurers don't have to cover the costs, and that can mean a pretty hefty bill for a shot. That's a concern scientists are wrestling with right now with the anticipated reductions in access for the next COVID shots. But Nuzzo is worried that COVID shots may only be the beginning. We're gonna have to wait and see what potentially happens at the next ACIP meeting for more information.

Feltman: On Wednesday afternoon Kennedy announced eight people he'd chosen to replace the 17 dismissed advisory panel members. His picks are already raising red flags among public health experts, with the list including several individuals who have expressed skepticism or spread misinformation about vaccine safety and efficacy.

We'll keep you updated on this situation as it evolves further. You can also read more on ScientificAmerican.com.

Now for some environmental news. You've heard of climate change, but what about its “evil twin”? That's what some experts have dubbed ocean acidification, according to the Guardian. Until now ocean acidification was one of the few Earth system processes thought to still be within its “planetary boundary”—the safe operating limits for keeping the planet stable. But a study published last Monday in Global Change Biology suggests this isn't the case.

Ocean acidification refers to the dropping pH of ocean waters. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the acidity of surface waters has increased by about 30 percent in the more than 200 years since the start of the industrial revolution. That's because when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels go up, global warming isn't the only consequence; the ocean absorbs a lot of the atmosphere's carbon dioxide, and CO2 sets off a series of chemical reactions that leads to a lower pH. The first organisms to fall victim to ocean acidification are typically ones with skeletons and hard shells because a lower pH makes it more difficult for animals to build and maintain those structures. But fish and other organisms can suffer, too.

The new study combined existing ice core data with computer models to get a better picture of how the ocean's pH is changing. The researchers found that by 2020, more than 40 percent of the global ocean surface had passed the planetary boundary threshold. The authors say lowering carbon dioxide emissions is the only way to fix the problem, but conservation efforts could help affected organisms and regions in the meantime.

We'll wrap up with a couple of animal stories. I'll get the less fun one out of the way first. If you've never seen a pangolin, I highly recommend doing a quick image search for one. They're the only mammals fully covered in scales, and I've always thought they look like sentient pine cones. Unfortunately, pangolin scales are highly sought after for use in traditional medicine, and these adorable critters are considered to be the most highly trafficked mammal on the planet. What's worse is that they react to danger by curling up into little scaly balls—that's where the pine cone resemblance gets really uncanny—which is a great way to ward off a hungry predator but also a great way to make them easy pickings for a human hunter.

A study published last Friday in Nature Ecology & Evolution confirms another inconvenient truth about pangolins: apparently they're delicious.

It's not actually news that lots of people eat the eight pangolin species found in Africa and Asia. But researchers wanted to figure out how much the demand for meat contributed to the animal's decline versus the scale trade. The researchers surveyed 809 hunters and meat vendors in Nigeria—which has become a major hub for pangolin trafficking, thanks to the creature's dwindling populations in Asia—about how and why they acquire pangolins. It turns out that 97 percent of pangolins are captured not by dedicated pangolin hunters but by people in the right place at the right time and largely to be eaten. More often than not, the scales are actually discarded. Another survey the researchers ran—this one focused on hunters, meat vendors, and household members of each—also ranked pangolin meat higher than any other wild game or domesticated animal in terms of taste.

This matters for a couple of reasons. First, the researchers point out, their data suggests that our estimates of pangolin exploitation, which largely rely on the number of scales found on the trafficking market, are probably way too low. This also suggests that conservation efforts are putting their resources in the wrong place. The authors note that implementing programs to improve food security for local people, combined with efforts to educate hunters about the importance of pangolin conservation, could have a bigger impact than aggressive policing of scale traffickers. The results also provide a broader reminder that conservationists need to make an effort to understand the motivations of the people who are hunting or otherwise exploiting endangered animals.

Lastly, we have a story about Triassic reptiles walking 500 miles and then walking 500 more—and doing that 10 times.

In a study published last Wednesday in Nature Ecology and Evolution, scientists report that more than 200 million years ago, archosauromorphs—reptiles from the evolutionary branch upon which dinosaurs and crocodiles would later emerge—may have migrated across vast distances that were previously thought to be inhospitable to life.

Scientists already knew that these reptiles survived a brutal mass extinction, which opened the door for dinosaurs to evolve. It was previously assumed that archosauromorphs were stuck living in a few specific spots because of extreme heat throughout the tropics. But by modeling the reptiles' evolutionary trees to cover gaps in the fossil record, researchers found evidence that the creatures managed to cross 10,000 miles of hellish terrain to spread across the globe. I guess it really is true that life finds a way.

That's all for this week's news roundup. We'll be back on Wednesday with some surprising new microbiome science.

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

A brand-new, cutting-edge telescope called the Vera C. Rubin Observatory is about to release its first images to the world, and the public can watch in real time.

On June 23 the observatory will unveil a first look at ultrahigh-definition images and videos of the cosmos taken from a mountaintop in Chile. And you can participate by joining a public livestream (in English and Spanish) or one of the in-person watch parties at planetariums, universities and museums around the globe. These watch parties will include a stream of the live unveiling event, as well as three-dimensional virtual tours of the observatory and its surroundings on the peak of Cerro Pachón, a mountain in the Chilean Andes.

Space enthusiasts who can get to a watch party at a planetarium will be rewarded with immersive full-dome images of the horizon-to-horizon Southern Hemisphere night sky. U.S. planetariums throwing watch parties include the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, the CCNY Planetarium at the City College of New York, the Fogg Planetarium at the Challenger Learning Center of Tallahassee in Florida, the Eastern Michigan University Planetarium in Ypsilanti, the Fiske Planetarium in Boulder, Colo., and the Ritter Planetarium at the University of Toledo in Ohio, among others. A full list can be found at the Rubin Observatory Watch Party website.

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory takes a full image of the southern sky every three nights using the 8.4-meter Simonyi Survey telescope, whose array of mirrors includes the largest convex mirror ever made. The view from the telescope is photographed with the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) camera, which is the largest digital camera ever made—about the size of a car. The sky images can be stitched together to show changes in the cosmos, such as the movements of comets through the solar system.

During the public events, you'll also get to watch one of the observatory's high-resolution time-lapse “movies” of the visible sky. It will be sky watching in high definition: the observatory is designed to show very detailed views of the universe in crisp detail over wide areas, so viewers will get a glimpse of distant galaxies, galaxy clusters and stars. One goal is to map the Milky Way and look for streams of stars that are the remnants of galaxies that were torn apart by their neighbors eons ago. These remnants can help scientists understand how the Milky Way formed. Another goal is to catalog the solar system's asteroids and comets, as well as farther-flung transient phenomena such as supernovae. Finally astronomers want to use the Rubin Observatory to understand dark matter, which has mass but doesn't release or reflect light. So while you won't get a glimpse of this pervasive matter, astronomers can study it through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the galaxies and galaxy clusters that the LSST camera will photograph night after night.

Anyone can sign up to host a watch party at the Rubin Observatory website. Hosts will receive access to a virtual 3D model of the observatory and a virtual tour of Cerro Pachón. They'll also have access to a planetarium-dome-sized feed of the livestream, as well as other planetarium content. Home viewers will be able to see the livestream and images at rubinobservatory.org.

Metrics details

High ambient temperatures are associated with reduced sleep duration and quality, but effects on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity are unknown. Here we quantify the effect of 24 h ambient temperature on nightly OSA severity in 116,620 users of a Food and Drug Administration-cleared nearable over 3.5 years. Wellbeing and productivity OSA burden for different levels of global warming were estimated. Globally, higher temperatures (99th vs. 25th; 27.3 vs. 6.4 °C) were associated with a 45% higher probability of having OSA on a given night (mean [95% confidence interval]; 1.45 [1.44, 1.47]). Warming-related increase in OSA prevalence in 2023 was estimated to be associated with a loss of 788,198 (489,226, 1,087,170) healthy life years (in 29 countries), and a workplace productivity loss of 30 (21 to 40) billion United States dollars. Scenarios with projected temperatures ≥1.8 °C above pre-industrial levels would incur a further 1.2 to 3-fold increase in OSA burden by 2100.

In 2023, mean temperature recordings in the northern hemisphere were the highest on record in over 2000 years1, with temperatures 2.07 °C warmer than the pre-industrial period ( ~ 1850-1900)1. Mean global temperature is projected to increase by 2.1 to 3.4 °C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century, in the absence of additional reductions in greenhouse gas emissions2. High ambient temperatures have strong, well-established, negative effects on health3,4, including mental health outcomes5,6,7, reduced physical activity8, and ultimately, mortality9,10,11,12,13,14. High ambient temperatures are also associated with considerable reductions in sleep duration and quality15,16,17, including a near doubling of short sleep ( < 6 h) prevalence18. Sleep loss due to global warming in 2023 was recently estimated to incur a loss of 3.9 million years of life because of disability or death18.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder with an estimated global prevalence of nearly 1 billion adults19. OSA severity is typically quantified using the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), a count of partial (hypopnea) or total (apnea) upper airway collapses per hour of sleep. Untreated OSA is associated with a wide range of adverse health outcomes20, road safety events21, and all-cause mortality20. Increased OSA severity also has a dose-response relationship with the incidence of co-morbid chronic conditions, such as hypertension and type-2 diabetes20. In addition, untreated OSA is associated with large decreases in workplace productivity and absenteeism. This is estimated to cost the Australian economy nearly 4 billion AUD22 and the US economy nearly $87 billion US per year23; while data for other countries is lacking.

Some studies have shown an association between outdoor ambient temperature and OSA severity24,25,26,27. A major limitation is that most prior studies are cross-sectional and use single-night estimates of AHI, therefore neglecting to account for the substantial night-to-night variability in AHI28,29,30. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, personal, and social burden of OSA due to increased temperatures, including changes in prevalence, wellbeing burden, and workplace productivity loss have not been quantified to date. Given the potential future impact that global warming is expected to have on OSA prevalence, better estimates of the subsequent burden are needed.

Accordingly, in this global study involving 116,620 users of a validated and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared nearable OSA monitor, we investigate the dose-response relationship between daily ambient temperature and nightly OSA status, using data from the fifth generation of European Reanalysis (ERA5) dataset31. We demonstrate that high-temperature days (99th percentile; 27.3 °C) increase the probability of OSA by 45% compared to low-temperature days (25th percentile; 6.4 °C). The effect size varies by country and is generally stronger in European countries. The increased prevalence of OSA attributed to global warming in 2023 is associated with a loss of over 780,000 healthy life years and 105 million workplace productivity days across 29 countries, resulting in an estimated economic cost of ~98 billion United States dollars. Projections estimate that a ≥ 1.8 °C increase in global ambient temperature above pre-industrial levels could double the burden, impacts, and costs of OSA by 2100.

Data for final analysis was acquired from 116,620 regular users of the under-mattress OSA sensor, for a combined total of ~62 million nights. The most common reason for excluding participants (N = 8261, ~6.6%) was a lack of regular use of the device (see flow chart in Supplementary Fig. 1). Users were mainly middle-aged and predominantly male (22.7% female), with a median [IQR] of 509 [246, 787] sleep recordings per user (Table 1). The overall prevalence of moderate-to-severe (AHI ≥ 15 events/h) and severe OSA (AHI ≥ 30 events/h) was 25.4% and 8.9%, respectively. Users were located across most world regions (Fig. 1), including 41 countries with at least 100 users. OSA prevalence was between 15 and 32% depending on the country (Fig. 1), and demographics were consistent across countries (Table S1).

Country by country prevalence of moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (blue) and severe OSA (dark blue) is highlighted in the bar chart. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

There was a non-linear dose-response association between 24 h daily average ambient temperatures and the risk of having OSA on the following night (Fig. 2a). Globally, the probability of having OSA was 45% (risk ratio (RR) [95%CI]; 1.45 [1.44, 1.47]) higher during days with high temperatures (99th; 27.3 °C) vs. during days with lower temperatures (25th; 6.4 °C). Similarly, the probability of having severe OSA was 49% (1.49 [1.46, 1.52] higher in high vs. low temperature days. The probability of nightly OSA was higher at T99 in countries with lower gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (Fig. 2b). Out of the 41 studied countries, we found a significant association between ambient temperature and increased probability of nightly OSA in 29 countries (Fig. 2d). The effect size at T99 varied by country (Fig. 2c) and was generally stronger in European countries, with up to ~2.0 -fold increase in the probability of nightly OSA. Similar results were observed for the probability of nightly severe OSA (Table S1). The number of users was generally lower in countries where we did not find a significant association between temperature and OSA prevalence (Table S1). The association between ambient temperature and the probability of nightly OSA was stronger in males, users with higher body mass index (BMI), and among participants with usual sleep duration longer than 6 h (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 4). Age did not have a strong effect on the association between temperature and nightly OSA (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). Heterogeneity in country demographics (see Table S1), including mean age (p-value = 0.17), mean BMI (p-value = 0.57), and sex proportion (p-value = 0.68) was not associated with a differential effect in the association between ambient temperature and the probability of nightly OSA. The exposure-response curve between ambient temperature and the probability of nightly OSA remained largely similar in the sensitivity analyses, when minimum or maximum 24 h temperature were used as exposure variables (Supplementary Fig. 4). The exposure-response curve between ambient temperature and the probability of nightly OSA also remained similar when adjusting for particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <10 µm (Supplementary Fig. 5), previously shown to be associated with increased OSA severity in some studies26. The association between temperature and nightly OSA was also not modified by air pollution levels (Supplementary Fig. 5). A total of 9.4% of nightly sleep recordings did not have an AHI measurement, as the AHI cannot be calculated for nights with a sleep duration of less than 5 h. There was a bias towards a lower effect size in the association between temperature and nightly OSA for participants with a higher amount of missing AHI data (see Supplementary Fig. 6). Given the association between high temperature and short sleep duration16,18, this may suggest that our estimates are conservative.

We use disability adjusted life years (DALYs), a standardized measure employed by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD)32 studies that captures the combined impact of illness, injury, and premature mortality, to quantify the wellbeing and societal burden due to increased prevalence of OSA from high temperatures. DALYs combines time lost due to premature death (years of life lost; YLL) and time lived with less than-optimal health (years lived with disability; YLD). The increased prevalence of OSA due to global warming was associated with a strong societal impact. For example, in the UK (London; Fig. 3a), we observed a ~ 0.7 °C temperature increase from 2000 to 2023, which corresponded with an additional ~150 million person-days with OSA in 2023 compared to 2000. The increase in OSA prevalence due to global warming was associated with a loss of 59,365 DALYs (uncertainty range: 36,975 to 81,755), including 58,341 YLDs (36,463 to 80,2189), and 1024 YLLs (512 to 1,536); 92% higher than in 2000 (Table S2). In the 29 countries where we found an association between OSA prevalence and ambient temperature (involving 1.02 billion people), temperature-related increase in OSA prevalence was associated with a loss of 788,198 (489,226 to 1,087,170) DALYs in 2023, including 27,180 (13,590 to 40,770) years of life lost. The economic cost of this wellbeing impact in 2023 was estimated to be ~68 billion USD (Table S2) in the 29 studied countries. These estimates were ~2-fold higher than in 2000.

Wellbeing burden of warming-related increase in moderate-to-severe OSA prevalence is exemplified for the UK (a–c and d) and globally (e–g). a Historical and projected temperatures for different climate scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were used to (b) derive the number of additional person-days with OSA due to temperature increases, which were subsequently used to calculate (c) years lived with disability (YLD) and (d) years of life lost (YLL). Baseline temperatures were based on the historical 1950-1990 data. The wellbeing and economic impact of the estimated temperature-related increase in OSA by 2100 for different climate scenarios from the IPCC were calculated for (e) YLL, (f) YLD, and (g) wellbeing economic cost, expressed as rate per 100,000 persons per year. The white line-marker represents current rates (as of 2023) of YLL, YLD, and economic cost.

We used the climate scenarios CMIP633 from the 2021 sixth assessment report of the IPCC2—termed the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP), to estimate future OSA burden for different levels of global warming. We downloaded daily temperatures from 2023 to 2100 projections for 4 SSPs (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, SSP585), based on 27 climate models from multiple countries and climate modelling groups. In the 29 studied countries, a ~ 1.8°C increase in global ambient temperatures above pre-industrial levels (SSP126 by 2100) was associated with in a ~ 15% increase in wellbeing burden compared to 2023 estimates (Table S3). Scenarios with projected increased temperature higher than SSP126 were estimated to further increase the wellbeing burden by 10 to 30% by 2050, and 1.5 to 2.5-fold by 2100, depending on the country (Fig. 3b). Temperatures higher than 1.8 °C above pre-industrial levels were estimated to incur an additional 12 to 36 million YLDs, 0.5 to 1.3 million YLLs, and an associated cost of 1.0 −2.8 trillion USD, over the 2023 to 2100 period. Country by country rates of DALYs per 100,000, absolute number of YLLs, absolute numbers of YLDs, and associated economic cost persons under different scenarios in 2050 and 2100 are presented in Tables S3 to S6. Accounting for population forecast and a potential 30% increase in OSA prevalence by 2050 due to rise in obesity34 would further increase these estimates in most countries by 10 to 25%. Comparison of the main model estimates vs. the alternative scenario is available in Tables S7 and S8. Under these assumptions, any other scenario than SSP126 would be estimated to incur an additional 16.9 to 47.4 million DALYs lost over the 2023 to 2100 period.

OSA has a considerable impact on productivity and is associated with increased likelihood of absenteeism and presenteeism (being at work but not functioning at full capacity)22,35. The calculated increase in OSA prevalence from global warming is estimated to incur additional productivity losses (Fig. 4). In 2023, for the 29 studied countries, the increase in OSA prevalence due to higher temperatures was associated with an additional 80 million presenteeism days (59 to 101 million) and an additional 25 million absenteeism days (12 to 38 million). The total economic cost of this loss of labor was 30 (21 to 40) billion USD. Globally, the rate of labor loss in 2023 was 8.4 (5.7 to 11.1) million USD per 100,000 persons and was double the rate of labor loss of 2000 (4.0 [2.7 to 5.2] million USD; see Table S7).

Scenarios with projected increased temperatures higher than 1.8 °C (SSP126) above pre-industrial levels are expected to increase labor loss by 10 to 25% by 2050, and 1.3- to 2.2-fold by 2100, depending on the country (Fig. 4; Tables S10, S11). These scenarios are projected to incur an additional cost of 0.9 to 2.0 trillion USD in labor loss over the 2023 to 2100 period (Fig. 4). In 2100, the labor loss rates per year for different climate models in the 29 studied countries are projected to be 37 billion (10.0 million per 100,000 - SSP126), 50 billion (13.3 million per 100,000 - SSP245), 69 billion (18.4 million per 100,000 - SSP370) and 84 billion (22.8 million per 100,000 - SSP545), see Tables S10 and S11. Country by country rates and absolute numbers of labor loss for different climate scenarios in 2050 and 2100 are presented in Tables S10 and S11.

High ambient temperatures (99th vs. 25th; 27.3 vs. 6.4 °C) are associated with a ~ 45% increase in the probability of having OSA on a given night, globally. The increase in OSA prevalence in 2023 due to global warming was associated with a loss of 788,198 (489,226 to 1,087,170) healthy life years, and a productivity loss of ~105 million days from impaired workplace attendance in the 29 studied countries. In 2023 alone, the estimated total economic cost associated with the warming-related increase in OSA prevalence was ~98 billion USD, including 68 (34 to 102) billion USD from additional wellbeing burden and 30 (21 to 40) billion USD from workplace productivity loss.

Modelled temperatures consistent with the continuation of government climate change policies implemented by 2020 are projected to lead to global warming of 2.1 to 3.4 °C by 21002,36. The health and economic impact of these estimates would be consequential, and the increase in OSA prevalence due to rising temperatures in such scenario may double the overall OSA burden. Indeed, rates of DALYs, without considering temperature, for OSA in 2019 in Australia were already ~200 to 260 DALYs per 100,00022. Estimated 2100 rates of DALYs observed for most countries under SSP245 ( ~ 2.8 °C degrees of warming) were also around 150 to 300 DALYs per 100,000 people depending on the country, which would approximately double the current OSA burden. A previous, not yet peer reviewed, study also estimated a 122 billion USD wellbeing cost due to warming-related increase in short sleep prevalence18. Together, these studies highlight the economic burden associated with sleep-related inadequacy from rising temperatures. In addition, these estimates contribute to the growing body of evidence that investment to limit global warming would be a cost-effective strategy to prevent climate-related sleep impairment and its consequences37,38.

The sample used in this study likely under-represents lower socioeconomic groups, given that all participants owned a consumer-grade sleep tracking device, and most participants resided in highly developed countries. Hence, participants may have also had access to more favorable sleeping environments and heat stress-mitigation strategies such as air conditioning, which are less readily available in lower socioeconomic populations39. There are large global inequalities in availability of population sleep health data—with only 22% WHO member states (mostly highly developed) having published population data in sleep duration40. Similarly, published global estimates of OSA prevalence are derived from population studies in mostly high socio-economic countries19. Our study is also biased towards higher socioeconomic countries and highlights the urgent need for global strategies to collect appropriate sleep and temperature data worldwide40. In addition, 77% of the participants in the current study were male. We did not detect a large difference between sex in the temperature-OSA association. However, this study sample may not be representative of the wider general population and does not resolve the long-standing issue in sleep research of under-representation of female in such analyses.

Furthermore, since we lacked access to precise geographical locations and the indoor temperature of users, exact temperature-related effects could not be calculated. The potential confounding effect of air pollution on the association between high temperature and nightly OSA status may also have been underestimated since we lacked precise geographical locations and indoor measurements of air pollution. We also lacked clinical information on participants' co-morbidities, treatment status, daytime symptoms, and impairments, and thus, could not explore potential modifiable effects of these conditions and symptoms on the detected association. Individuals with OSA and daytime sleepiness are at much greater risk of motor-vehicle accidents compared to those with OSA alone41. Hence, the temperature-related burden of OSA may be greater in this specific population. This aligns with previous studies that indicate that sleep loss and ambient temperature disproportionately affect more vulnerable populations16,17. High ambient temperatures have also been found to exacerbate the severity of chronic diseases42. Thus, further consideration of co-morbidities and daytime symptoms associated with OSA is warranted to better determine the impact of ambient temperature on OSA in vulnerable populations, and the additional burden this may incur. Although our robust time-series analysis design provides support for a potential causal association between high temperature exposure and increased OSA prevalence, other time-varying confounders (e.g., alcohol intake) were not available in the current study, and should be accounted for in further studies.

The under-mattress sensor used in this study does not measure the contribution of some physiological aspects of OSA (e.g., hypoxia, arousals) which may undermine OSA detection. However, existing validation studies versus gold standard polysomnography in over 150 participants28,43 support the device performance characteristics. Furthermore, OSA prevalence estimates using non-contact multi-night data found in this study yield very similar findings to previously published literature19,28. Similarly, previous studies that used this device have shown that misclassification rates and AHI variability are comparable to other devices30, and that the effect size of the association between the estimated AHI and health outcomes is also similar to existing epidemiological trials44,45. Furthermore, conventional single-night polysomnography can lead to inaccurate OSA diagnoses and severity estimation in 20 to 50% of patients due to high-night-to-night variability of OSA28,29,46. Thus, these studies provide support that the multi-night AHI estimates used in the current study provide comparable or superior insight to conventional single-night polysomnography AHI while being less cumbersome and allowing nightly data collection over ~1.5 years per individual.

Our main analysis aimed to model rising temperature's impact on OSA-related wellbeing and productivity by holding other factors constant. However, BMI is projected to increase over the next 50 years, likely leading to higher OSA prevalence34. This suggests our main estimates may understate the future temperature-related OSA burden. Indeed, once accounting for BMI-related increase in OSA prevalence in our sensitivity analyses, our estimates were 10 to 30% higher. On the other hand, recent developments in OSA treatment47, including FDA-approved weight loss medications48, could help manage OSA more effectively. Given that approximately 80% of OSA patients are currently undiagnosed or untreated49, improved treatment rates could serve as an adaptation mechanism to offset temperature-induced increases in OSA burden. We also assumed constant heat adaptation at the population level. However, heat-related mortality in Europe has declined over the past two decades50, and global air conditioning adoption has increased from 19.3% (2000) to 35.3% (2021). Studies that have investigated heat adaptation strategies and its effects on sleep and OSA are scarce15. Thus, we could not account for heat adaptation. In addition, heat adaptation is not uniform: highly developed countries have 44-48% household air conditioning coverage, while low and medium developed countries have 4% and 14%, respectively51. Accordingly, given our sample's socioeconomic bias toward developed nations, we likely underestimate the global impact of temperature-induced OSA, even without accounting for increased adaptation capabilities.

In conclusion, our study underscores the potential significant impact of increasing ambient temperatures on the prevalence of OSA, globally. Without substantially greater policy change to slow global warming, the health and economic burdens associated with OSA may double by 2100. These results highlight the urgency of limiting global warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, in alignment with the Paris Agreement. Our findings also emphasize the immediate need for targeted measures to potentially minimize the health and economic impacts of the growing OSA prevalence associated with rising temperatures.

The current study was approved by the Flinders University Human Research Ethics Committee (Project number: 4291). This study complies with the recommendations of the GATHER statement52, and GATHER checklist can be found at the end of supplementary materials.

Retrospective data were acquired from 125,295 participants who registered to use an under-mattress sleep sensor (Withings Sleep Analyzer/Sleep Rx; WSA) between January 2020 and September 2023. To be included in this analysis, participants were required to have ≥28 nights of data and an average of ≥4 sleep recordings per week. When participants sign-up to the Withings app, they are prompted to fill in their age, sex, height, and weight. Information on gender is not collected. Participants were required to be 18 years or older to be included in this study. Participants were geo-localized to the closest city within a given time zone. A more precise location was not available due to concern for re-identification and privacy. All participants provided written consent through the Withings app for their deidentified data to be used for research purposes when signing up for a Withings account.

Country level GDP per capita and GDP per capita employed were collected from the World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD). Population and life expectancy estimates were based on the United Nations World 2024 Populations Prospects report53.

The WSA is a FDA-cleared sleep monitoring device placed under the mattress that estimates sleep timing, quality, and breathing using ballistography and sound data (FDA 510(k) number: K231667)43. WSA-derived sleep duration, timing, and AHI have good agreement against polysomnography in multiple independent validation studies28,43,54. The WSA-estimated AHI also shows good agreement with in-laboratory polysomnography-derived AHI to classify moderate-to-severe OSA (88% sensitivity and 88% specificity to detect ≥15 events/h during sleep)28,43. The AHI cannot be reliably calculated for nights with a sleep duration of less than five hours43, and these nights were excluded from analysis. Our primary outcome of interest was the nightly OSA status for a given participant on a given night, based on the AHI and clinically defined severity categories (nightly OSA: AHI ≥ 15; and nightly severe OSA: AHI ≥ 30 event/h). For each participant, we also calculated the average OSA severity category based on the average AHI on all available nights and using pre-defined clinical cut-offs (mild: 5–15; moderate: 15–30 and severe: ≥30 events/h). The prevalence of OSA per country was calculated based on the average OSA severity category for each participant.

Weather information was time-matched for each day of data for every user based on their closest location, collected from the Copernicus Climate Change Service55. We extracted and calculated 24 h minimum, maximum, and average daily temperature as well as total cloud cover, surface pressure, and relative humidity from the fifth generation of ERA5 dataset31. We extracted fine particulate matter (aerodynamic diameter <2.5 µm) concentration from the ECMWF Atmospheric Composition Reanalysis 4 model as a measure of air quality56. These re-analysis models have been validated against station-based measurements57,58,59 and are widely applied in environmental health research57,58,60. We used the climate scenarios CMIP633 from the 2021 sixth assessment report of the IPCC2. We downloaded daily temperatures from 2023 to 2100 projections for 4 SSPs (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, SSP585), based on 27 climate models from multiple countries and climate modelling groups. Averaged daily projections were calculated as the daily median of the 27 projections. Detailed information on pre-processing and weather variable extraction can be found in the Supplementary Methods.

Non-linear fixed effect models were used to study the effects of 24 h average ambient temperature on nightly OSA status on the following night, defined as an AHI ≥ 15 events/h for that night. We followed the recently proposed case-time series methodology61 which has been used extensively in environmental health studies42,62,63,64,65, including in our previous study estimating the effect of high ambient temperature on sleep18. We used participant/year/month strata intercepts, natural splines of time (day of the year; with 4 degrees of freedom [df]), and indicators of the day of the week to model individual baseline risks, in addition to shared long-term, seasonal, and weekly trends. Models were further adjusted for total cloud cover (4 df), relative humidity (4 df), density of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <2.5 µg/m3 (4 df), surface pressure (4 df), total precipitation (4 df), wind speed (4 df) and variation in total sleep time (4 df) as these potential confounders may have effects on OSA prevalence within the 1-month stratum27.

The exposure-response association of interest between temperature and nightly OSA status was modelled using distributed lags9,66. We primarily chose a 4-day lag structure since the effect of temperature on sleep duration was shown to be significant up to the fourth day18. Other lag structures were explored but made little difference to the main findings (see Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8). Similar to previous studies on the effect of temperature on health9,10,13,66, we used the sum of the effect over the lag period to summarize the association between temperature and nightly OSA status. This analytic approach was conducted on the complete dataset, and in independent analyses stratified by country. Further analyses examined specific subgroups of interest, including age groups (10-year categories), sex, BMI categories, habitual sleep duration categories (average sleep duration over the recording period), and tertiles of GDP per capita. The above analyses also estimated the association between ambient temperature and severe OSA (AHI ≥ 30 events/h) prevalence rates. Models are summarized using RR [95%CI], calculated from the odds ratio using existing formula67. We used the R programming language (version 4.3.3), specifically with the dlnm68 (version 2.4.7) and gnm69 packages (version 1.1-5). Sensitivity analyses were conducted, and the analysis was repeated by using minimum 24h-average temperature and maximum 24h-average temperature to further validate our findings. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis to investigate potential bias due to missing data when users are sleeping less than five hours. In this sensitivity analysis, we calculated the exposure-response curve between temperature and nightly OSA for each quartile of missing data proportion (determined per-participant).

For each country, we calculated the difference in temperature for a given year compared to the 1950–1990 historical average temperature (see Fig. 5a for an example in the UK). This difference in temperature was used to calculate the change in the probability of having OSA between a given calendar year (e.g., 2022) versus historical data, which was subsequently transformed into a RR. Using this RR, we calculated the relative change in nightly OSA prevalence associated with global warming-related increased temperatures for each calendar day (in person-days) for that specific year and country. This approach was repeated for each location and each calendar day between 1950 and 2100, as well as for each tested climate projection.

a The difference in temperature for a given year (here 2023—black solid line) was compared to the 1950–1990 historical average temperature (dashed red line). b This difference in temperature (blue arrow) was used to calculate the change in the risk of nightly OSA between current vs. historical average temperature, for a particular day. This daily change was summed over the year and used to calculate the associated wellbeing and workplace productivity burden (see text for further details). Figure 5b represents the cumulative exposure–response (and 95%CI in shaded area) between ambient temperature and nightly OSA in the UK. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

DALYs are a standardized summary measure employed by the World Health Organization and the GBD studies32 to quantify the impact of illness, injury, and/or dying prematurely. DALY combines time lost due to premature death (YLL) and time lived with less than-optimal health (YLD). DALYs measures have been used to assess the effect of temperature on health in other studies70,71. For this study, we followed the methodology previously used to assess the wellbeing burden of OSA in Australia22,72 and our previous report on the global wellbeing burden of reduced sleep duration18. DALYs, YLLs, and YLDs were quantified using the calculated warming-related person-days increase in OSA prevalence (see previous section) and published literature on associations between OSA and health outcomes.

Given the well-established association between OSA and motor-vehicle accidents, we estimated the years of life lost (YLL) due to increased motor vehicle accidents associated with the warming-related increase in OSA prevalence. We also estimated temperature-related OSA effects on other conditions that may induce less-than-optimal health and hence increase the number of YLD. In our study, we based these estimates for the YLD using data from a previous studies22,72. More formally, \({{YLL}}_{c,y}\) for a given country c at a year y was calculated as follows:

where \({{MVA}}_{{{death\_rate}}_{c}}\) is the daily rate of fatal motor vehicle accidents for a given country c, extracted from the GBD73; \({{RR}}_{{MVA\_OSA}}\) is the daily RR of fatal motor vehicle accidents associated with OSA, here estimated to be 100% based on previous literature21,41,74,75,76; \({{RR}}_{c}\) is the daily RR function for OSA function for a given country c; \({{Thist}}_{d,1950-90}\) is the average historical temperature (1950–1990; Fig. 5a red) for a particular day of the year (1–365); \({T}_{d,y}\) is the temperature for a particular day of the year d and a year y; \({p0}_{c}\) is the prevalence of OSA for a given country c; and \({{APOP}}_{c,y}\) is the given adult population for a country c in year y; \({{RLE}}_{c}\) is the average years of life lost for a given fatal motor vehicle accident for a country c, also extracted from the GBD73. Uncertainty intervals for YLLs were constructed using an \({{RR}}_{{MVA\_OSA}}\) of 50% (lower bound) and 150% (upper bound), using 100% as the mean.

Similarly, \({{YLD}}_{c,y}\) can be calculated as follows:

where DW is the daily disability weight associated with OSA, and was estimated to be between 0.05–0.11 based on previous literature22,72. Uncertainty intervals for YLDs were constructed using a disability weight of 0.05 (lower bound) and 0.11 (upper bound), using 0.08 as the mean. L is the duration of the “diseases/impairment” associated with OSA on a given day. Here, we conservatively assumed this duration to be 1 day, similar to a previous study on quality of life lost to heatwaves in Japan77. Other terms are similar to the calculation of \({{YLL}}_{c,y}\). Finally, \({{DALY}}_{c,y}\) can be calculated as follows:

The economic cost of wellbeing loss can be calculated using estimated values of DALYs. Here we used values of one time (lower bound), two times (mean) and three times (upper bound) GDP per capita (2023 USD) as proxies for the value of a DALY, as used in previous studies78,79. In our primary model, to isolate the effect of temperature on DALY modelling, we fixed the prevalence of OSA and population per country to a constant number (2023 estimate) until 2100. However, in a sensitivity analysis, we account for these factors using population forecasts from the UN world prospect 2024 and using projection on increased OSA prevalence (30% increase by 2050) due to increased obesity34.

Sleep disorders have a considerable impact on productivity and are associated with increased likelihood of absenteeism and presenteeism (being at work but not functioning at full capacity)80. On average, people with OSA report five additional days of sick leave per year, relative to people without OSA, and spend 6.8% of their working days with reduced productivity22,35. The additional absenteeism and presenteeism due to the increase in OSA prevalence days were quantified using similar methodology to the wellbeing burden in the previous section. The overall labor loss was then calculated by adding absenteeism and presenteeism days and multiplying by the average gross domestic product per capita employed. Presenteeism and absenteeism days for a given country c and year y can be calculated as follows:

where \({NWD}\) is the number of working days per person on a given year for a full-time employee, here assumed to be 235 (assuming 5 weeks of annual leave). \({{PRES}}_{{rate}}\) and \({{ABS}}_{{rate}}\) is the daily absenteeism on presenteeism rate (2.1% and 6.8% for absenteeism and presenteeism, respectively). \({{LF}}_{c}\) is the labor force for a given country c in 2023, downloaded from the World Bank. Since labor force estimates do not account for part-time labor, we weighted overall labor force using estimate of part-time worker percentage from the World Bank. We multiplied labor force population by half the percentage of part time employment (assuming part-time employment is 50% full time equivalent) and subtracted it to the overall labor force. The overall labor loss was then calculated as follows:

A cosmic particle detector in Antarctica has emitted a series of bizarre signals that defy the current understanding of particle physics, according to an international research group that includes scientists from Penn State. The unusual radio pulses were detected by the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) experiment, a range of instruments flown on balloons high above Antarctica that are designed to detect radio waves from cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere.

The goal of the experiment is to gain insight into distant cosmic events by analyzing signals that reach the Earth. Rather than reflecting off the ice, the signals -- a form of radio waves -- appeared to be coming from below the horizon, an orientation that cannot be explained by the current understanding of particle physics and may hint at new types of particles or interactions previously unknown to science, the team said.

The researchers published their results in the journal Physical Review Letters.

"The radio waves that we detected were at really steep angles, like 30 degrees below the surface of the ice," said Stephanie Wissel, associate professor of physics, astronomy and astrophysics who worked on the ANITA team searching for signals from elusive particles called neutrinos.

She explained that by their calculations, the anomalous signal had to pass through and interact with thousands of kilometers of rock before reaching the detector, which should have left the radio signal undetectable because it would have been absorbed into the rock.

"It's an interesting problem because we still don't actually have an explanation for what those anomalies are, but what we do know is that they're most likely not representing neutrinos," Wissel said.

Neutrinos, a type of particle with no charge and the smallest mass of all subatomic particles, are abundant in the universe. Usually emitted by high-energy sources like the sun or major cosmic events like supernovas or even the Big Bang, there are neutrino signals everywhere. The problem with these particles, though, is that they are notoriously difficult to detect, Wissel explained.

"You have a billion neutrinos passing through your thumbnail at any moment, but neutrinos don't really interact," she said. "So, this is the double-edged sword problem. If we detect them, it means they have traveled all this way without interacting with anything else. We could be detecting a neutrino coming from the edge of the observable universe."

Once detected and traced to their source, these particles can reveal more about cosmic events than even the most high-powered telescopes, Wissel added, as the particles can travel undisturbed and almost as fast as the speed of light, giving clues about cosmic events that happened lightyears away.

Wissel and teams of researchers around the world have been working to design and build special detectors to capture sensitive neutrino signals, even in relatively small amounts. Even one small signal from a neutrino holds a treasure trove of information, so all data has significance, she said.

"We use radio detectors to try to build really, really large neutrino telescopes so that we can go after a pretty low expected event rate," said Wissel, who has designed experiments to spot neutrinos in Antarctica and South America.

ANITA is one of these detectors, and it was placed in Antarctica because there is little chance of interference from other signals. To capture the emission signals, the balloon-borne radio detector is sent to fly over stretches of ice, capturing what are called ice showers.

"We have these radio antennas on a balloon that flies 40 kilometers above the ice in Antarctica," Wissel said. "We point our antennas down at the ice and look for neutrinos that interact in the ice, producing radio emissions that we can then sense on our detectors."

These special ice-interacting neutrinos, called tau neutrinos, produce a secondary particle called a tau lepton that is released out of the ice and decays, the physics term referring to how the particle loses energy as it travels over space and breaks down into its constituents. This produces emissions known as air showers.

If they were visible to the naked eye, air showers might look like a sparkler waved in one direction, with sparks trailing it, Wissel explained. The researchers can distinguish between the two signals -- ice and air showers -- to determine attributes about the particle that created the signal.

These signals can then be traced back to their origin, similar to how a ball thrown at an angle will predictably bounce back at the same angle, Wissel said. The recent anomalous findings, though, cannot be traced back in such a manner as the angle is much sharper than existing models predict.

By analyzing data collected from multiple ANITA flights and comparing it with mathematical models and extensive simulations of both regular cosmic rays and upward-going air showers, the researchers were able to filter out background noise and eliminate the possibility of other known particle-based signals.

The researchers then cross-referenced signals from other independent detectors like the IceCube Experiment and the Pierre Auger Observatory to see if data from upward-going air showers, similar to those found by ANITA, were captured by other experiments.

Analysis revealed the other detectors did not register anything that could have explained what ANITA detected, which led the researchers to describe the signal as "anomalous," meaning that the particles causing the signal are not neutrinos, Wissel explained. The signals do not fit within the standard picture of particle physics, and while several theories suggest that it may be a hint of dark matter, the lack of follow-up observations with IceCube and Auger really narrow the possibilities, she said.

Penn State has built detectors and analyzed neutrino signals for close to 10 years, Wissel explained, and added that her team is currently designing and building the next big detector. The new detector, called PUEO, will be larger and better at detecting neutrino signals, Wissel said, and it will hopefully shed light on what exactly the anomalous signal is.

"My guess is that some interesting radio propagation effect occurs near ice and also near the horizon that I don't fully understand, but we certainly explored several of those, and we haven't been able to find any of those yet either," Wissel said. "So, right now, it's one of these long-standing mysteries, and I'm excited that when we fly PUEO, we'll have better sensitivity. In principle, we should pick up more anomalies, and maybe we'll actually understand what they are. We also might detect neutrinos, which would in some ways be a lot more exciting."

A University of Queensland-led project has developed a tool to standardize genetic testing of koala populations, providing a significant boost to conservation and recovery efforts.

Dr Lyndal Hulse from UQ's School of the Environment said the standardized koala genetic marker panel provides a consistent method for researchers nationwide to capture and share koala genetic variation, enabling improved collaboration and data integration across studies.

"Koalas in the wild are under increasing pressure from habitat loss, disease and vehicle strikes, forcing them to live in increasingly smaller and more isolated pockets with limited access to breeding mates outside their group," Dr Hulse said.

"Population inbreeding can mean detrimental effects on their health.

"A standardized panel for directly comparing genetic markers enables researchers, conservationists and government agencies to better understand the genetic diversity of koala populations, allowing for greater collaboration to ensure their survival."

Saurabh Shrivastava, Senior Account Manager at project partner the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF Ltd), said the new screening tool was a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array that used next-generation sequencing technologies.

"The Koala SNP-array can accommodate good quality DNA, so is suitable for broad-scale monitoring of wild koala populations," Mr Shrivastava said.

"Importantly, it is available to all researchers and managers."

Dr Hulse said ideally the tool could help guide targeted koala relocations across regions.

"There are very strict rules about relocating koalas, but this could be key to improving and increasing the genetics of populations under threat," she said.

"These iconic Australian marsupials are listed as endangered in Queensland, New South Wales and the ACT - and in 50 years we may only be able to see koalas in captivity.

"Understanding the genetic diversity of different populations of koalas is crucial if we're going to save them from extinction."

The project included researchers from the Australasian Wildlife Genomics Group at the University of New South Wales.

AGRF Ltd is a not-for-profit organization advancing Australian genomics through nationwide access to expert support and cutting-edge technology across a broad range of industries including biomedical, health, agriculture and environmental sectors.

Scientists have shed new light on the evolution of an important species of wasp - and believe that the findings could help improve the effectiveness of natural pest control.

Dr Rebecca Boulton, from the University of Stirling, has shown, for the first time, that Lysiphlebus fabarum - a tiny species of wasp - can reproduce with or without a mate. This discovery challenges the previous assumption that asexual females could not mate and produce offspring sexually.

Significantly, the wasps lay their eggs inside small sap-sucking insects called aphids before consuming their host from the inside out -- meaning that they are natural pest controllers.

Lysiphlebus fabarum is known to have both sexual and asexual populations but, until now, it was not known whether asexual females could reproduce sexually with males. The discovery opens up new possibilities for improving biological pest control.

Many species of parasitoid wasps are mass-reared and released as a natural alternative to pesticides because they lay their eggs on or in other species, many of which are pests, before the developing wasp larvae consumes their host, killing it in the process.

Asexual reproduction makes it easy to produce large numbers of wasps, but these need to be suitably adapted to local pests and environments to be effective. Currently, Lysiphlebus fabarum is not used commercially despite being found worldwide and naturally targeting aphids.

Developing an understanding of how the species reproduce could help boost genetic diversity in commercially reared lines, making future biocontrol agents more resilient and better adapted.

Dr Boulton, a lecturer in Biological and Environmental Sciences at the University's Faculty of Natural Sciences, led the study. She said: "In an evolutionary sense, facultative sex seems like a perfect strategy - asexual reproduction is highly efficient, and takes away the costs of finding a mate as well as the risks of failing to find one.

"But sex is really important for evolution. When females reproduce asexually they don't mix their genes up with any others which limits the potential for evolution to happen.

"If the environment changes, asexual species may be unable to adapt in the same way that sexuals can.

"Facultative sex brings the efficiency of asexual reproduction with the evolutionary benefits of sex and so has been touted as the best of both worlds.

"The results of my study show that there might be hidden costs to facultative sex though as it reduces female wasps' reproductive success, and this might limit how frequently it occurs in nature.

"The wasps that I studied are an important natural enemy of aphids, they aren't currently commercially reared, but they are found globally.

"My findings could be used to develop new biocontrol agents that can be used to control aphids throughout the world, harnessing their natural reproductive behavior to ensure that they are adapted to the hosts and environments that are specific to different regions."

Dr Boulton reared the wasps in a Controlled Environment Facility (CEF) at the University and had initially planned to put asexual and sexual wasps together, in direct competition, to see which parasitized the most aphids.

However, in the early stages of these experiments she realized the female asexual wasps were behaving unexpectedly and were mating with males from the sexual population.

This led to a change in strategy, as she started to record this behavior in more detail, before carrying out wasp paternity testing to see whether the asexual females were just mating or actually fertilizing eggs.

Once it confirmed that the asexual wasps were engaging in facultative sex, Dr Boulton carried out an experiment where asexual females either mated or didn't, before examining how successful these females, and their daughters, were at parasitizing aphids.

The study involved putting around 300 wasps, each around 1mm long, in their own petri dish with a colony of sap-sucking aphids and counting how many were parasitized.

Lysiphlebus fabarum wasps only live a few days but spend two weeks developing as larvae on their hosts.

The entire experiment, which was carried out across two generations of wasps, took six weeks to run.

On completion Dr Boulton extracted DNA from the wasps and sent it to be paternity tested. When the results were returned it was clear that the asexual wasps which mated were, in most cases, reproducing sexually as their offspring had bits of DNA that were only found in the fathers.

The study, Is facultative sex the best of both worlds in the parasitoid wasp Lysiphlebus fabarum? is published in the Royal Society of Open Science.

It was funded through a BBSRC Discovery fellowship.

Professor Anne Ferguson-Smith, Executive Chair of BBSRC, said: "This is an exciting example of how BBSRC's Discovery Fellowships are helping talented early career researchers explore fundamental questions in bioscience with real-world relevance.

"Dr Boulton's work, which measures the costs of sex in this predominantly asexual parasitoid wasp, opens up promising avenues for more sustainable pest control. Supporting curiosity-driven research like this not only strengthens the UK's research base, but helps drive innovation that benefits the environment, food systems and society at large."

'You Serve, You Save,' but you have to hunt through nondescript brown boxes.

The U.S. Navy Exchange store seems to be a treasure trove of MSRP RTX 50 graphics cards. This bargain alert comes from a Redditor who recently picked up a keenly priced Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 FE model for a cool $1,900, after various store and credit card promotions were applied. However, the NEX isn't open for everybody. As the site snappily says, "You Serve, You Save," meaning it is for active and retired military families, but many readers might have a close friend or relative who can shop there. Additionally, every branch of the US armed forces has its own equivalent shop, although it is unclear how widespread deals on GPUs would be (if at all).

If you don't have experience with the NEX store, Redditor Accomplished-Feed123 sums it up as “like a Target or Walmart mixed with a Best Buy and Marshall's that also sells snacks and beer but no groceries.” That might not sound like an ideal hunting ground for the best graphics cards, but the Redditor had experience finding prior bargains like open-box electronics and/or computer gaming products at the store.

Drawn by spider-senses towards the locked Apple cage of goods, Accomplished-Feed123 spotted some “largeish brown boxes.” At this point, they didn't know they would be stuffed with green GPU gold. But, it soon became apparent that this was a bounty of “several 5070s, 5080s, and one single 5090,” wrote the Redditor. "All were priced at MSRP (550, 999, and 1999, respectively)." It was obviously hard to resist, and they "said YOLO and picked up the 5090."

Googling the part number on the nondescript RTX 5090 package, it was discovered that inside was an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 FE model. These are sometimes sought after for their brand status, build quality, and relatively compact design. If your case is large enough, you might prefer a bigger, quieter, and better-cooled model, though.



Thanks to the canny use of various credit card and store rewards, Accomplished-Feed123 managed to walk away with Nvidia's current flagship for $1,900. Not bad, in the current GPU retail climate.

To conclude their tale of bargains at NEX, it was interesting to hear that the Redditor previously owned a capable but now last-gen Radeon RX 7900 XTX. They haven't been in the green team since owning an RTX 3060 Ti (launched Dec 2020).

We are happy for Accomplished-Feed123, and hope others with access to NEX can grab similar MSRP-beating bargains. However, the wider public, and shoppers elsewhere around the globe, should probably be content with the way the latest and greatest graphics cards are trending downwards in price.

At the time of writing, we are starting to see more MSRP-and-under graphics cards become available. Sometimes they might not be obvious, requiring a special code or promo voucher, but a patient price sniper can do OK right now. For example, someone snagged an RTX 5090 from Walmart for a cool $1,679. We've also reported on sub-MSRP RTX 5090s in the UK. If you don't need a top-end flagship GPU, we are also happy to report that recently launched cards like the AMD Radeon RX 9600 XT didn't sell out, and thus they haven't been subject to the inevitable pricing inflation from slim stock levels. I've also been able to snag an RX 9070 at below MSRP in the UK using various discount codes.

It is always hard to know whether prices will continue to slide as demand cools, or there will be some tech movement (crypto, AI, etc.) that will inflate prices, or even some kind of supply-side calamity (wars, earthquakes) to cause fresh price spikes.

If there's one thing we've learned over the years, it's that President Donald J. Trump loves two things: gold furniture and using his status as U.S. president to make money. And now, to everyone's detriment, Trump is apparently combining those two passions into a mobile device that you can buy with real American tender. It gives me no pleasure to introduce to you all: the Trump phone.

🚨BREAKING: The Trump family is LAUCHING  a "Trump Phone" the phones will be made in the USA 🇺🇸

Mobile plans will offer a flagship "47 Plan," which costs $47.45 per month. pic.twitter.com/ZXEXPKLTSS

— The Patriot Oasis™ (@ThePatriotOasis) June 16, 2025



The T1, as Trump's family is calling it, will launch alongside an all-new mobile network, Trump Mobile, and comes with an aptly named “47 Plan,” which costs an even more apt $47.45 per month. You can use Trump Mobile with your existing device, apparently, but why would you do that if you could show everyone your appreciation for fascism with a whole-ass gold phone? Trump is also claiming the T1 will be “made in the USA,” though I have doubts there's much truth to that. At most, it'll be assembled in America. There's a reason why Apple—with all of its resources—can't just make iPhones in America overnight or even within a few years.

Here's a statement from President Trump himself on the launch of the phone:

“Trump Mobile is going to change the game, we're building on the movement to put America first, and we will deliver the highest levels of quality and service. Our company is based right here in the United States because we know it's what our customers want and deserve.”

This isn't Trump's first attempt at a cash grab that leverages his status and fame as POTUS—he's already peddled gaudy gold sneakers, crypto, and NFTs—but for me, the T1 is by far the most egregious. Phones aren't just another product; they're a gateway into everything you do, say, and think. While Trump's team unsurprisingly doesn't mention privacy one single time in its announcement of the T1, there are lots of inherent concerns there. The good news is that this phone is so bad I don't really think most people, outside of Trump's diehard supporters, will be tempted to buy it, let alone use it every day.

Here's a list of quick facts about the $500 T1: It has a below-average 5,000mAh battery that Trump's team accidentally calls a “long life camera” and there are no details on the processor, though if it's as quick as the person who wrote the press materials, I'm going to assume that it's not great. There's a tri-camera system with no ultrawide, though it does have a 50-megapixel main sensor and what can only be garbage 2-megapixel depth and macro cameras.

Oh, and the T1 runs Android 15. There's no mention of what apps are pre-installed, but if I were to guess… it's probably Truth Social. I'll grant you one free silent cry today in remembrance of a time before blatant conflicts of interest in the White House.

The phone, if it wasn't a depressing reminder that our country has no standards anymore, would be fine, but for obvious reasons, it's not that, so I've gone ahead and made a list of all the things I'd sooner buy over the Trump phone:

I don't think anyone should buy this phone for lots of reasons, but one of the main reasons is it just doesn't seem like a good deal. There are tons of nice mid-range phones out there that are doing a lot more, and there's no reason for you to buy a stunt phone that will probably end up unsupported and underserved faster than you can misspell “coverage” as “covfefe.” That being said, if you suck, you can pre-order this device right now.

Americans' air is teeming with all sorts of known toxin pollutants—now scientists have found a new one to add to the list.

Researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder detailed their discovery in a study published earlier this month. They sampled agricultural sites in Oklahoma and found clear traces of medium-chain chlorinated paraffins (MCCPs) in the surrounding air. The health effects of MCCPs on people are still being studied, though countries are already planning to debate whether these chemicals should be regulated.

“It's very exciting as a scientist to find something unexpected like this that we weren't looking for,” said lead author Daniel Katz, a chemistry PhD student at CU Boulder, in a statement from the university. “We're starting to learn more about this toxic, organic pollutant that we know is out there, and which we need to understand better.”

While environmental regulations in recent decades have greatly reduced levels of certain pollutants in the air and environment, such as lead, there are still many other lingering airborne toxins out there. Scientists have detected compounds like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) phenylcyclohexene (PCH), and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in the air, for instance—many of which have the potential to disturb our hormones.

MCCPs and other chlorinated paraffins are common industrial chemicals. They're regularly used as flame retardants and plasticizers (substances that improve flexibility and softness) in a variety of applications. But research has started to suggest that much like short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs), MCCPs aren't without their risks. They appear to be toxic to marine and other aquatic environments, for instance. They might also persist in the environment and our bodies for a very long time, similar to so-called forever chemicals like per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).

The CU Boulder researchers weren't aiming to find MCCPs in the air—they were simply trying to document the general identity, distribution, and behavior of aerosol particles in the atmosphere. They planted a nitrate chemical ionization mass spectrometer at the study site for a month, 24 hours a day. To their surprise, they came across compounds with different patterns than expected, which they eventually determined were actually MCCPs.

Their findings, published in ACS Environmental Au, represent not only the first detection of airborne MCCPs in the U.S., but in the Western Hemisphere as a whole. MCCPs have been regularly found in wastewater, which can be recycled into biosolid fertilizer. So in this particular case, the researchers suspect that the chemicals came from the biosolid fertilizer used in the field near their study site.

“When sewage sludges are spread across the fields, those toxic compounds could be released into the air,” Katz said. “We can't show directly that that's happening, but we think it's a reasonable way that they could be winding up in the air. Sewage sludge fertilizers have been shown to release similar compounds.”

SCCPs have been regulated in the U.S. and other countries for several years now. But experts argue that this regulation has spurred manufacturing industries to rely more on MCCPs as an alternative, leading to increased pollution. Members of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, a UN-led international treaty that meets biannually to address potential threats to the environment and human health, are set to discuss this year whether MCCPs should be added to the list of organic chemicals that warrant regulation.

Whatever the verdict of the Stockholm Convention, the CU Boulder researchers say that much remains unknown about MCCPs. And they're hoping they and other scientists can continue to study these chemicals.

“We identified them, but we still don't know exactly what they do when they are in the atmosphere, and they need to be investigated further,” Katz said. “I think it's important that we continue to have governmental agencies that are capable of evaluating the science and regulating these chemicals as necessary for public health and safety.”

Unfortunately, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency may not be up to such a task currently. The renewed Trump administration has started to defang the EPA in all sorts of ways, from telling staffers to ease up on the fossil fuel industry to repealing already-created regulations on greenhouse emissions. MCCPs may be a real public health threat, but there's little indication that U.S. regulators will be interested in tackling them, at least under President Donald Trump.

Food distribution giant United Natural Foods (UNFI) said it is making “significant progress” in recovering from a cyberattack that occurred almost two weeks ago, as grocery stores across North America reliant on the distributor continue to report food shortages.

UNFI said in an update on Sunday that it was restoring its electronic ordering systems, which its customers use to place orders for their grocery stores and supermarkets.

The company, which provides more than 30,000 stores across the United States and Canada with fresh produce and other products, was hit by a cyberattack on June 5, which the company disclosed several days later. 

UNFI has not yet described the nature of the cyberattack, though it told investors last week that it had shut down its entire network to contain the incident. The ongoing outage is preventing the company from fulfilling and distributing customer orders at scale.

One of the largest grocers affected is Whole Foods, which relies on UNFI as its “primary distributor.” Several Whole Foods stores, including one visited by TechCrunch last week and others in the New York area, are experiencing shelf shortages amid the UNFI outages. One employee at a Whole Foods in California told TechCrunch described supply issues at their store, saying they had not seen some products for days. 

Whole Foods previously told TechCrunch that it was working to restore its shelves “as quickly as possible,” but did not say when shipments would return to normal.

People working at local grocery stores and big-chain supermarkets alike have told TechCrunch that they continue to experience disruption of varying degrees. Some said that other distributors are providing some supplies, while others are still reporting issues with ordering products from UNFI. 

UNFI has not yet provided a timeline for recovery.

If you've ever watched your phone battery dip into the danger zone right when you needed it most, you know the sinking feeling that comes with being powerless. Portable chargers are more than just handy now. You need them in your bag or with you in your car if you want to get yourself out of a no phone emergency. But not all power banks are created equal.

See at Amazon

Tons of them are bulky, charge too slowly, or just can't hold up under repeated use. And some are outdated and unsafe. Fires, anyone? If you want a good one that you can actually count on right now, you're going to want to head to Amazon for one from the brand INIU.

Check out Amazon to get an INIU Portable Charger for just $21, down from its usual price of $27. That's a discount of 22%.

This portable charger is easily one of the best compact options out there. It's lightweight enough to toss in a purse, carry-on, or glove box without thinking twice, yet powerful enough to recharge most smartphones at least two full times. It has 10,000mAh of power, so it can handle just about any charging situation you present it with. And it's got a digital readout so you don't have to guess how much juice is left in it.

It includes dual USB-A ports and a USB-C port that handles both input and output, so you can charge multiple devices at once. That means your phone, wireless earbuds, and maybe even a friend's phone can all get a power boost at the same time. The USB-C support also means faster charging overall, both when you're charging the power bank itself and when you're using it to top off your devices. It even includes a built-in flashlight.

Best of all, it's durable. Whether you're a traveler, student, commuter, or just someone who doesn't want to worry about dead devices, the INIU 10,000mAh charger can help you make sure you've always got some reliable tech in your pocket no matter what's going on in your day to day life.

And right now, you can snag it for a solid discount of 22%. It's just $21, which is the price of Starbucks a few times a week, so if you're someone who relies on using a phone that's stuck at 5% battery all week, you might want to splurge on something else.

On the official Apple site, the new MacBook Air laptops that debuted in March are, naturally, still at full retail price. But on Amazon, the MacBook Air 2025 256GB with the M4 chip is available for only $849 which is a massive discount from its list price of $999. With a record-high rating of 4.8 out of 5 stars, the model is not only a bestseller but, in our own view, also the best money-for-value option available now. Higher capacity models (e.g., 512GB) and more RAM options also have their lowest prices ever since launch.

See at Amazon

The MacBook Air 2025 is built upon the latest M4 chip which offers incredible performance for everyday use and even more demanding creative work. The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display is a real showstopper and offers vivid colors, sharp details and excellent brightness which are ideal for business or entertainment use. With its 16GB of total memory, this MacBook Air is a cinch to multitask with. Its 256GB SSD storage is quick on the draw with your programs and files but still has enough space for most users' needs. And if you need more, Amazon's larger-capacity models are an easy way to get the perfect option.

You will also enjoy the Apple Intelligence support which is a collection of intelligent features that are meant to boost your creativity and productivity. Whether editing images or simply browsing the web, the M4 chip and Apple Intelligence seamlessly collaborate to provide a responsive and seamless experience.

The scope of 3D printing has gotten much bigger over the years, so much so that 3D-printed buildings are on track to become less of a novelty. A team of scientists from the UK, more specifically professors from the University of Bristol, have thankfully been hard at work developing a giant simulator capable of testing these 3D printed buildings for safety in the event of natural disasters like earthquakes by shaking them.

The simulator is essentially a huge table with mounting brackets to hold 3D-printed structures in place. The team can program a handful of movements, particularly horizontal motions, which can provide a look at how the structure will behave during sudden seismic activity. This work is being handled in the University of Bristol's Soil Foundation Structure Interaction Laboratory (SoFSI) and has been showcased by the BBC, which claims this project is the first of its kind.

Anastasios Sextos is a professor of earthquake engineering and confirmed that a major goal of this project is to help find a crossroads between affordability and safety when it comes to the future of 3D printed housing. Tests like these are crucial in helping designers create stable 3D designs that can be replicated safely for consumers who may not have the means to ensure the design integrity on their own.

Joking with BBC, Professor Sextos claims the team can test "anything that we can bolt to the table." So far, the simulator seems to be exclusively dedicated to testing 3D printed buildings. Once the simulator has completed the test, the information gathered can be shared with the original designers for further study.

Professor Sextos hopes that this work can help designers create safe and reliable building designs for people worldwide. Some countries are more likely to encounter earthquakes than others, and these tests make a huge difference for the people who rely on housing options like 3D-printed buildings.

There are some limitations with the simulator, mainly in the department of size. Speaking of giant 3D-printed buildings, you might like our recent story on the world's tallest 3D-printed building, found in Switzerland.

Throughout her years working in technology, Jenny Wang, 28, always found herself stumbling back to one idea — a personal styling agent to help users decide what to wear and buy based on their budget, lifestyle, weather, and calendar. 

She has tried to build such a product numerous times in the past, “but the AI technology was not yet mature enough,” she told TechCrunch. That's changed, so a few months ago she announced the launch of her dream company, Alta, followed by the announcement today of an $11 million seed round led by Menlo Ventures. 

The product, which feels straight out of the movie “Clueless,” is indeed an AI stylist and personal shopper that makes outfit recommendations and lets users try on those looks with their personalized virtual avatar. For example, a person can ask Alta what the best outfit might be for, say, TechCrunch Disrupt, and the AI will offer suggestions and present a lookbook of outfits. 

Users upload their closet by either taking photos, forwarding purchase receipts, or searching what is already in the Alta database. People can also dress themselves in clothes they are looking to buy, mixing and matching with clothes already in their closet. 

There are others playing around in the AI styling space, such as Whering and Cladwell, all trying to recreate the magic of that iconic scene in “Clueless,” where Cher plans an outfit from her closet using computer technology. Wang considers herself to be part of the new wave of consumer technology, looking to make styling and shopping more effective. 

“There are existing players like Google Shopping and Pinterest who are also experimenting with AI,” she continued. “But the experiences that consumers will crave and use in the future will need to be built with new technical architectures and new user interfaces.” 

The product is backed by some heavy names, including Michelle Obama's stylist Meredith Koop, who Wang said helped train Alta's AI. 

Other investors in the company include Benchstrength; Algaé Ventures, the investment firm backed by fashion's prestigious Arnault family of LVMH; Phenomenal Ventures, the firm founded by Kamala Harris' niece Meena; Anthropic's VC arm Anthology fund; and a slew of angel investors including DoorDash CEO and co-founder Tony Xu, super models Jasmine Tookes and Karlie Kloss, Rent the Runway co-founder Jenny Fleiss, and Poshmark CEO and co-founder Manish Chandra. 

Wang used the word “aligned” to describe her fundraising process and leaned heavily on the network she amassed while working in various tech roles throughout her career. She's a Harvard engineer by training and has invested in numerous companies, served as a technical advisor to brands, and also held roles at investment firms. 

Years ago, for example, she was an intern at DoorDash, and previously volunteered on Karlie Kloss' podcast “Kode With Klossy.” 

“I am still actively coding every day and learning from our team and technical advisors,” she said. 

Wang said the fresh capital will be used to grow the team and fund more research and development. “Our team is continuously updating our in-house models and improving the experience based on community feedback,” she said. 

Alta has already struck a partnership with the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) to offer Alta to its membership base. Wang used to live in San Francisco but relocated to New York to help build out the technology. “NYC is also a closer flight to Paris than SF,” she said, adding that LVMH and one of her angel investors, tech influencer Zita d'Hautville, are helping the company expand throughout Europe.

Alta is also working with Marie Kondo as the company expands throughout parts of Oceania and the Pacific. 

The plan is to next look at partnering with retailers worldwide.  

“Many of the most exciting consumer AI companies are being started in NYC,” Wang continued, adding that she's assembled a highly technical but also fashion-obsessed team. This startup is her dream come true.

It calls to me...

I'm not especially in the market for a GPU upgrade right now (especially if my Wife is listening), but I've just come across a pretty excellent deal at Amazon that's making me itch for a new GPU.

Right now at Amazon UK, you can score the MSI GeForce RTX 5070 12G Ventus 3X OC edition fully 17% off, now just £545.

Not only is that considerably cheaper than its £654 list price, it's also £30 cheaper than the most recent lowest price we've seen on this, £575, according to our price tracking.

MSI GeForce RTX 5070 12G VENTUS 3X OC: (was £654.99) now £545.70 at Amazon The lowest-ever price we've seen on this card, and just £20 shy of the MSRP Founder's Edition, despite its heftier clock and performant triple fan cooling.  

A 1440p card that easily outstrips the RTX 4070, the RTX 5070 is our number one pick in our best GPU roundup for a reason. With a decent jump over the previous gen, it's a great overall pick thanks to the combination of price and performance.

Over the RTX 3070 sat in my gaming PC under this desk, it's certainly an enticing upgrade. This MSI variant boasts much heftier triple fan cooling compared to the dual fan configuration of the FE.

Not only are you getting more cooling for your money, but the MSI Ventus comes with a 2.54 GHz boost clock (compared to 2.51 GHz on the FE), as well as the MSI Extreme Performance option, which dials it up to 2.55 GHz.

If you want to save a bit more money, or space is a constraint, there's also a similarly chunky saving on the more modest Ventus 2X variant, now just £509.99 instead of £619.99. Sporting one fewer fan than the 3X, this is also another lowest-ever price on MSI's range, and, crucially, is cheaper than MSRP.

A complex network of bank accounts, businesses, couriers, and cryptocurrency accounts is under further investigation.

Australian law enforcement has charged four people who were allegedly behind an “elaborate and calculated” large scale money laundering operation. Over an 18-month period, investigators allege AUD$190 million ($124 million) was channeled through a “complex network of bank accounts, businesses, couriers and cryptocurrency accounts,” to avoid the attention of the authorities. Of course, the source of all this money was alleged illicit activities.

As the purported money laundering operation was so complex, uncovering it meant significant work for multiple agencies and more than 70 staff over the last year and a half.

The official PR indicates that the Australian Federal Police (AFP) coordinated the investigations, with their Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT). Other parties involved in uncovering this apparent web of deceit include the Queensland Police Service, Australian Border Force, the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, AUSTRAC, and Australian Taxation Office – under the auspices of the Queensland Joint Organized Crime Taskforce (QJOCTF).

The above law enforcement organizations coordinated the execution of 14 search warrants at homes and businesses across Brisbane and the Gold Coast on June 5 and 6. At the same time, the aforementioned four people were charged. Some are now in custody, others on bail.

Obfuscating the source of millions of dollars is a lot of work, and those charged are claimed to be part of a network which:

Clearly, some of those businesses were chosen for their ease of mixing legitimate money with illicit income, in order to launder it. The degree of anonymity, speed of transactions, and loose global regulation of cryptocurrency made it instrumental to the income obfuscation efforts in the uncovered operation.

For the four people now formally charged, the next big event on their calendars will be upcoming appearances in court through July and August. We'd expect investigators to use the results of their searches and seizures to firm up their cases in the meantime.

The maximum sentences the accused will face range from 10 years to life imprisonment. Some of those charged face multiple counts.

“Many Australians are feeling the financial pinch but remain law-abiding and honest citizens,” said AFP Detective Superintendent Adrian Telfer, in an official statement. “Criminals always choose greed over decency and will constantly find opportunities to increase their wealth at the expense of others.” It was also underlined that money laundering isn't a victimless crime, as it fuels serious organized crime like drug trafficking, exploitation, and violence.

If you own a PS5, having multiple controllers is almost a necessity as there's nothing better than sharing your favorite PlayStation games with friends or family in the same room. While it's always wise to have a spare controller ready for multi-player sessions or simply as a backup for you, genuine discounts on the PlayStation DualSense wireless controller are rare.

Even during Black Friday, major promotions were hard to find which makes this moment the perfect opportunity to add another controller to your setup. Right now, the PlayStation DualSense controller is available on Amazon for just $54 which is a substantial 27% off its usual $74 price. This limited-time deal marks an all-time low, so it's an ideal time to buy.

The biggest feature of the DualSense controler is haptic feedback which puts the feel of in-game action and environments right in your hands. Whether you're racing down rough roads, wielding guns or feeling the crash of a collision, the controller's next-gen vibration motors plunge you further into the game.

Aside from the haptic feedback, adaptive triggers provide varying levels of force and tension so that you can feel the distinction between drawing back a bowstring or slamming on the brakes in a racing title. They work together to create a feeling of realism and immersion that was not achievable on previous PlayStation controllers.

The built-in microphone allows you to chat online without a headset and the 3.5mm audio jack allows you to plug in your favorite headphones for individual use. The create button is convenient to use to capture and stream your most excellent gaming moments in case you're playing with buddies or capturing highlights to playback later. The controller's iconic appearance has been fine-tuned for comfort with enhanced sticks and an intuitive layout that feels great in your hand even after long gaming sessions.

DualSense isn't only for PlayStation 5 gamers: With its USB Type-C and Bluetooth connectivity, you can easily play it on Windows desktops and Macs too which gives you even more gaming possibilities outside of the console. Most high-end PC games currently support advanced features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, which lets you experience the same immersive experience playing from your computer.

With over 33,000 reviews and a lovely 4.6 out of 5-star rating, the PlayStation DualSense Wireless Controller is a proven winner among gamers. Don't hesitate too much: These sales don't come around often, and the stock may not be here.

Google's latest flagship, the Pixel 9, is here to raise the bar on what one can expect from a premium smartphone – most notably in the fields of photography and video. Launched in September, this Android phone is very popular with its mind-boggling performance, seamless integration with Gemini AI, and, most importantly, world-class camera capabilities.

While Pixel phones have been praised in the past for their incredible value and camera prowess, the Pixel 9 takes it to the next level – particularly now that it's available at an all-time low. Amazon currently has the Pixel 9 listed with 256GB storage for a mere $699, a staggering 22% discount from its retail price of $899. You can also get the 128GB model for $599 down from $799.

Pixel 9 is typically the highest-rated smartphone on the market for both photography and videography. Its pro-level camera technology uses Google's own AI and computational photography capabilities to provide images and videos that are on par with and frequently better than, those of much more costly rivals. From everyday snaps or low-light photography, Pixel 9 provides clear, bright and life-like output. The camera on the phone is equally stunning, delivering silky-smooth stabilization, rich colors with its capture and AI-edited capabilities thanks to Gemini AI driving the process.

Its camera boasts a main sensor with advanced pixel-binning technology for better low-light performance an ultra-wide-angle lens for expansive shots, and a suite of AI-powered features like Magic Eraser, Night Sight, and Real Tone. Video recording isn't left out, either, with 4K resolution at 60 frames per second, cinematic stabilization, and AI-fortified optimization that makes each clip appear as if it had a pro behind the camera.

Internally, the Pixel 9 is powered by Google's latest Tensor chip delivering zip in terms of performance, effortless multitasking and organic integration within Google's ecosystem. The smartphone has a 6.3-inch Actua screen, which provides sharp images, rich blacks, and a silky smooth 120Hz refresh rate for seamless scrolling and gaming. The screen is bright and colorful with no struggle to use it in direct sunlight or outdoors.

The Pixel 9 promises up to 24 hours of usage from a single charge. Wireless charging is also enabled, adding to the device's convenience and versatility.

At the software level, Pixel 9 runs on the newest version of Android, guaranteed updates and security patches for future years.

The Pixel 9 is one of the wisest value smartphone available today, especially at this record-low price on Amazon.

Right now, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is Amazon's top-selling phone. It came out in January 2025 and is now seen as the best Android phone – even better than the iPhone 16 Pro according to many. Amazon is selling it for $1,099 which is $200 less than its original price of $1,299, and a record low price. It's also a lot cheaper here than at the official Samsung store, but it could sell out fast.

See at Amazon

The Galaxy S25 Ultra is regarded by experts as the best phone available currently: Samsung has pushed the boundaries of hardware and software by integrating artificial intelligence at every level to deliver a seamless user experience. At the heart of the phone is the newest Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 processor which offers lightning-quick performance for lag-free multitasking and media consumption. The huge 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display offers stunning colors and clear graphics so whether it's work or gaming, everything is a treat. Its battery life is long enough for you to use during a whole day (and maybe even more) of heavy usage without needing to worry that you'll be running out of power, which makes it ideal for business people, influencers, and others who use their phone all day long.

You will also adore its AI-driven camera system: The Galaxy S25 Ultra features a high-end quad-camera setup, including a 200MP main sensor, a 50MP periscope telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom, a 12MP ultra-wide lens, and a second telephoto lens for versatile photography. The Audio Eraser camera captures stunning video in challenging low-light environments and eliminates background noise. So that you can relive your most cherished moments with less distraction and greater sharpness. The portrait features are optimized to sharpen skin tones while preserving natural texture so that each photo looks professional and stylish.

Other than photography, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is also great at keeping your day simple through its wide usage of AI: With features like “Multiple Tasks With One Ask,” you can keep your day simple by instructing your phone to perform several tasks all at the same time with a single request. For example, you can have it search for a nearby vegan pet-friendly restaurant and text the results to a friend in one shot. It's this combination of premium hardware—like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chipset and multi-purpose camera array—with smart AI features that makes the Galaxy S25 Ultra such a compelling choice for those seeking the best in performance and innovation.

If you're looking for a premium AI smartphone that makes life easier, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is a great pick at its lowest price ever.

India has been one of the top recipients of remittances in the world for more than a decade. Inward remittances jumped from $55.6 billion in 2010-11 to $118.7 billion in 2023-24, according to data from the country's central bank. The bank projects that figure will reach $160 billion in 2029.

This means there is an increasing market for digitalized banking experiences for non-resident Indians (NRIs), ranging from remittances to investing in different assets back home.

Aspora (formerly Vance) is trying to build a verticalized financial experience for the Indian diaspora by keeping convenience at the center. While a lot of financial products are in its future roadmap, the company currently focuses largely on remittances.

“While multiple financial products for non-resident Indians exist, they don't know about them because there is no digital journey for them. They possibly use the same banking app as residents, which makes it harder for them to discover products catered towards them,” founder Parth Garg said.

In the last year, the company has grown the volume of remittances by 6x — from $400 million to $2 billion in yearly volume processed. 

With this growth, the company has attracted a lot of investor interest. It raised $35 million in Series A funding last December — which was previously unreported — led by Sequoia, with participation from Greylock, Y Combinator, Hummingbird Ventures, and Global Founders Capital. The round pegged the company's valuation at $150 million. In the four months following, the company tripled its transaction volume, prompting investors to put in more money.

The company announced today it has raised $50 million in Series B funding, co-led by Sequoia and Greylock, with Hummingbird, Quantum Light Ventures, and Y Combinator also contributing to the round. The startup said this round values the company at $500 million. The startup has raised over $99 million in funding to date.

After pivoting from being Pipe.com for India, the company started by offering remittance for NRIs in the U.K. in 2023 and has expanded its presence in other markets, including Europe and the United Arab Emirates. It charges a flat fee for money transfer and offers a competitive rate. Now it also allows customers to invest in mutual funds in India. The startup markets its exchange rates as “Google rate” as customers often search for currency conversion rates, even though they may not reflect live rates.

The startup is also set to launch in the U.S., one of the biggest remittance corridors to India, next month. Plus, it plans to open up shop in Canada, Singapore, and Australia by the fourth quarter of this year.

Garg, who grew up in the UAE, said that remittances are just the start, and the company wants to build out more financial tools for NRIs.

“We want to use remittances as a wedge and build all the financial solutions that the diaspora needs, including banking, investing, insurance, lending in the home country, and products that help them take care of their parents,” he told TechCrunch.

He added that a large chunk of money that NRIs send home is for wealth creation rather than family sustenance. The startup said that 80% of its users are sending money to their own accounts back home.

In the next few months, the company is launching a few products to offer more services. This month, it plans to launch a bill payment platform to let users pay for services like rent and utilities. Next month, it plans to launch fixed deposit accounts for non-resident Indians that allow them to park money in foreign currency. By the end of the year, it plans to launch a full-stack banking account for NRIs that typically takes days for users to open. While these accounts can help the diaspora maintain their tax status in India, a lot of people use a family member's account because of the cumbersome process, and Aspora wants to simplify this.

Apart from banking, the company also plans to launch a product that would help NRIs take care of their parents back home by offering regular medical checkups, emergency care coverage, and concierge services for other assistance.

Besides global competitors like Remitly and Wise, the company also has India-based rivals like Abound, which was spun off from Times Internet.

Sequoia's Luciana Lixandru is confident that Aspora's execution speed and verticalized solution will give it an edge.

“Speed of execution, for me, is one of the main indicators in the early days of the future success of a company,” she told TechCrunch over a call. “Aspora moves fast, but it is also very deliberate in building corridor by corridor, which is very important in financial services.”

The first patient enrolled in a planned international clinical trial has been treated at HonorHealth Research Institute with a new type of immune therapy for those with a rare muscle-weakness disease known as Myasthenia Gravis.

In an odd medical twist, this auto-immune disease - in which antibodies interfere with the connection between nerves and muscles - most often strikes young women in their 20s and 30s, and older men in their 60s and 70s, though it can affect others. 

The disease affects fewer than 200 in every 1 million people. Symptoms range from droopy eyelids, problems chewing, general fatigue, difficulty swallowing and even problems breathing when the muscles surrounding the lungs are weakened. Patients often find it difficult to conduct basic hygiene and grooming; things as simple as brushing their teeth, taking a shower and getting dressed.

"It's kind of exciting," said Anne Hatch, D.O., Principal Investigator for this international clinical trial (NTC06744920), which will consider the safety and effectiveness of a drug called Remibrutinib, manufactured by Novartis Pharmaceuticals of Basel, Switzerland.

Dr. Hatch explained that, for the first time in this disease, the drug will target B cells, a type of white blood cell that makes antibodies. While usually an important part of the body's immune system, she said, in Myasthenia Gravis malfunctioning white blood cells interfere with the messaging between the nervous system and muscles in what is known as the neuro-muscular-junction pathway.

This new drug blocks a different part of the pathway than before. Hopefully, with this new mechanism of action, the patient's symptoms will improve."

Anne Hatch, D.O., Principal Investigator for international clinical trial NTC06744920

If successful, this Phase III clinical trial could lead to the drug being approved by the FDA for Myasthenia Gravis . The treatment has already been approved for some types of cancer.

Trial participants must be 18-75 years old with a confirmed diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis. They must be able to breathe without a respirator and be able to safely swallow the oral medication. A Patient's progress could be followed for up to 5 years.

Babies born to mothers potentially exposed to low levels of arsenic in public drinking water-even at levels below the federal safety standard-were more likely to be born preterm, with lower birthweight, or be smaller than expected, according to a study at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and funded by the National Institutes of Health's Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Program. The findings are published in JAMA Network Open.

While the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sets a maximum contaminant level of 10 micrograms per liter for arsenic in public water systems, this study examines how even lower-level arsenic exposures may still affect pregnancy outcomes in a large population. Previous research largely focused on private wells or smaller study groups.

Because arsenic occurs naturally, water that comes in contact with certain rocks and soils may contain it. Contamination from various industrial processes also contributes to increased levels of arsenic in some areas.

Most U.S. residents rely on public drinking water, and our findings suggest that further reducing arsenic in public water systems could be an important step to improve infant health across the U.S. Even low levels of arsenic in public drinking water were associated with low birthweight and other adverse birth outcomes in U.S. infants."

Anne Nigra, PhD, assistant professor of Environmental Health Sciences at Columbia Mailman School

Key takeaways include:

Researchers analyzed data from nearly 14,000 mother-infant pairs from the ECHO Cohort. Arsenic exposures during pregnancy were estimated by combining water quality data with the residential histories of participants. No actual arsenic levels were tested for these participants.

Homelessness is increasing in pregnant and parenting people in Canada, posing health risks to children. Authors of a commentary in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.241623 argue it is a health crisis that needs urgent attention.

Housing is a basic life necessity for everyone. With rising numbers of pregnant and parenting people experiencing homelessness in Canada, more children are being put at risk of negative health outcomes. Adequate housing that interfaces with supportive health and mental health services is a fundamental first step to counter the effects of poverty, family fragmentation, and displacement for this vulnerable group."

Drs. Nicole Racine and Stéphanie Manoni-Millar, University of Ottawa, and CHEO Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario

Recent data show that the number of people experiencing homelessness increased by 20% from 2018 to 2022, with 10% indicating they are part of a family. 

"The health and developmental implications of homelessness for infants and young children are profound," the authors write. It has been found that infants born to people experiencing homelessness have lower birth weights, higher risk of needing neonatal intensive care, and increased likelihood of infections and negative mental health and cognitive development.

They urge federal and provincial funding to provide access to safe and affordable housing with integrated services to support families, with support from municipal governments, social services and other providers. 

"Reducing service fragmentation by enhancing collaboration and communication between housing services, mental health and addiction services, and health services optimizes the continuity of service delivery. However, few services or programs currently have the capacity or funding to provide longer-term services to clients."

Obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are increasingly present in the population. Brown adipose tissue has a protective function against these prevalent diseases, as it burns calories and can produce body heat from fat. But as the body ages, the activity of brown adipose tissue decreases. This inactivation of brown adipose tissue — also typical of obese people — remains poorly studied in the scientific literature.

Now, a study by the University of Barcelona has identified, for the first time, a molecule that represses the activity of brown adipose tissue. The paper opens new paths to understand why and how the inactivation of this key tissue for metabolizing fat in the body takes place, and especially to determine wether this repressor function can be reversed and help design strategies for the treatment of obesity and cardiometabolic diseases.

The study, published in Molecular Metabolism, is led by Professor Francesc Villarroya, from the UB's Faculty of Biology and the UB Institute of Biomedicine (IBUB) — headquartered at the Barcelona Science Park (PCB) —, Sant Joan de Déu Research Institute (IRSJD) and the CIBER area for Pathophysiology of Obesity (CIBEROBN). The article is the core of the research of the doctoral thesis of the expert Albert Blasco Roset, first author of the paper and doctoral student at the UB.

There are two types of adipose tissue in the body: white adipose tissue (it stores energy in the form of lipids) and brown adipose tissue (the main heat-generating organ in the body through thermogenesis).

Although the problem is to know what reduces the activity of brown fat, until now, research has focused on identifying the factors that activate its function in the organism, but not the factors with a repressive function."

Francesc Villarroya, member of the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine at the Faculty of Biology

"As a result, it was generally assumed that the low activity of brown fat in ageing and obesity could be explained by the fact that its activators do not work properly".

The new study, conducted in animal models, describes a repressor factor that blocks brown fat activity: the ACBP protein. Under normal conditions, this protein would regulate when brown fat activity is not needed (e.g. in a warm environment). However, this molecule would also be involved in ageing and in the pathological blocking of brown adipose tissue that leads to obesity.

The ACBP protein's control activity reveals further biomedical implications in the fight against diseases such as cancer. "In some cancers, brown adipose tissue becomes pathologically overactive and causes uncontrolled metabolic energy expenditure, leading to cachexia (extreme malnutrition and muscle wasting). In this case, the function of the ACBP protein as a repressor factor could become a therapeutic tool of interest in cancer patients", says Villarroya.

In another context, it is also known that global warming caused by climate change is contributing to rising obesity rates, as an increasingly warmer environment leads to inactive brown adipose tissue. "An excess action of the ACBP protein blocking the activity of brown fat would be the molecular basis of this phenomenon. Once this factor has been identified, we can design intervention tools to promote a healthier lifestyle", concludes the researcher.

New results from a clinical trial reveal that a single dose of psilocybin-a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in mushrooms-can provide sustained reductions in depression and anxiety in individuals with cancer suffering from major depressive disorder. The findings are published by Wiley online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society.

People with cancer often struggle with depression. In this phase 2 trial, 28 patients with cancer and major depressive disorder received psychological support from a therapist prior to, during, and following a single 25-mg dose of psilocybin.

During clinical interviews conducted 2 years later, 15 (53.6%) patients demonstrated a significant reduction in depression, and 14 (50%) had sustained depression reduction as well as remission. Similarly, psilocybin reduced anxiety for 12 (42.9%) patients at 2 years.

An ongoing randomized, double-blind trial is currently evaluating up to two doses of 25 mg of psilocybin versus placebo as treatment for depression and anxiety in patients with cancer. This study is building on the single-dose study in an effort to bring a larger majority of the patients into remission of depression and anxiety.

One dose of psilocybin with psychological support to treat depression has a long-term positive impact on relieving depression for as much as 2 years for a substantial portion of patients with cancer, and we're exploring whether repeating the treatment resolves depression for more than half of the patients. If randomized testing shows similar results, this could lead to greater use of psilocybin to treat depression in patients with cancer."

Scientists at UCLA and the University of Toronto have developed an advanced computational tool, called moPepGen, that helps identify previously invisible genetic mutations in proteins, unlocking new possibilities in cancer research and beyond. 

The tool, described in Nature Biotechnology, will help understand how changes in our DNA affect proteins and ultimately contribute to cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and other conditions. It provides a new way to create diagnostic tests and to find treatment targets previously invisible to researchers.

Proteogenomics combines the study of genomics and proteomics to provide a comprehensive molecular profile of diseases. However, a major challenge has been the inability to accurately detect variant peptides, limiting the ability to identify genetic mutations at the protein level. Existing proteomic tools often fail to capture the full diversity of protein variations.

To overcome this challenge, the researchers developed moPepGen, which enables more precise identification of protein variations. 

We developed moPepGen to help researchers determine which genetic variants are truly expressed at the protein level, addressing a long-standing challenge in the proteogenomic community. Our tool significantly improves the detection of hidden protein variations by using a graph-based approach to efficiently process all types of genetic changes. This provides a more comprehensive view of protein diversity and gives researchers a much more accurate picture of how mutations influence disease."

Chenghao Zhu, PhD, postdoctoral scholar at the department of human genetics at UCLA and co-first author of the study

This level of precision is critical because proteins play a fundamental role in nearly every biological function, and alterations in their structures can signal disease progression, particularly in cancer. Yet, analyzing proteins to detect these changes remains an immense computational challenge. 

Unlike existing methods, which primarily detect simple genetic changes such as single amino acid substitutions, moPepGen is designed to identify a wide range of protein variations caused by alternative splicing, circular RNAs, gene fusions, RNA editing, and other complex genetic modifications. The tool systematically models how genes are expressed and translated into proteins, significantly expanding the ability to detect disease-associated mutations. 

"Until now, there hasn't been a practical way to handle the enormous complexity of genetic and transcriptomic variation," said Zhu. "The algorithm works rapidly, even when analyzing massive amounts of data, and is designed to function across multiple technologies and species."

To demonstrate its effectiveness, the team used moPepGen to analyze proteogenomic data from five prostate tumors, eight kidney tumors, and 376 cell lines. They found that moPepGen successfully identified previously undetectable protein variations linked to genetic mutations, gene fusions, and other molecular changes. It also proved more sensitive and comprehensive than previous methods, detecting four times more unique protein variants than older approaches.

The researchers noted that one of moPepGen's most exciting applications is in immunotherapy, as it can identify cancer-specific variant peptides that may serve as neoantigen candidates, which is key to developing personalized cancer vaccines and cell therapies.

"By making it easier to analyze complex protein variations, moPepGen has the potential to advance research in cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and other fields where understanding protein diversity is critical," said Paul Boutros, PhD, professor of urology and human genetics at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, director of cancer data science at the UCLA Health Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center and co-senior author of the study. "It bridges the gap between genetic data and real-world protein expression, unlocking new possibilities in precision medicine and beyond."

The tool is freely available for researchers and can integrate with existing proteomics workflows, making it accessible for labs worldwide.

The study's other first author is Lydia Liu, PhD, and the other senior author is Thomas Kislinger, PhD, both from the University of Toronto. A full list of authors is available in the study.

Boutros also serves as the interim vice dean for research at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, associate director of cancer informatics at the UCLA Institute for Precision Health and is a member of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research.

A new study offers insight into the health and lifestyle indicators - including diet, physical activity and weight - that align most closely with healthy brain function across the lifespan. The study used machine learning to determine which variables best predicted a person's ability to quickly complete a task without becoming distracted.

Reported in The Journal of Nutrition, the study found that age, blood pressure and body mass index were the strongest predictors of success on a test called the flanker task, which requires participants to focus on a central object without becoming distracted by flanking information.

Diet and exercise also played a smaller but relevant role in performance on the test, the team found, sometimes appearing to offset the ill effects of a high BMI or other potentially detrimental factors.

"This study used machine learning to evaluate a host of variables at once to help identify those that align most closely with cognitive performance," said Naiman Khan, a professor of health and kinesiology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who led the work with kinesiology Ph.D. student Shreya Verma. "Standard statistical approaches cannot embrace this level of complexity all at once."

To build the model, the team used data collected from 374 adults 19 to 82 years of age. The data included participant demographics, such as age, BMI, blood pressure and physical activity levels, along with dietary patterns and performance on a flanker test that measured their processing speed and accuracy in determining the orientation of a central arrow flanked by other arrows that pointed in the same or opposite direction.

"This is a well-established measure of cognitive function that assesses attention and inhibitory control," Khan said.

Previous studies have found that several factors are implicated in the preservation of cognitive function across the lifespan, Khan said.

Adherence to the healthy eating index, a measure of diet quality, has been linked to superior executive function and processing speed in older adults. Other studies have found that diets that are rich in antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamins are associated with better cognitive function."

Naiman Khan, professor of health and kinesiology, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign

The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, or DASH diet, the Mediterranean diet, and a diet that combines the two, called the MIND diet, all "have been linked to protective effects against cognitive decline and dementia," the researchers wrote. Physical factors, such as BMI and blood pressure, along with increased physical activity also are strong predictors of cognitive health, or decline, in aging.

"Clearly, cognitive health is driven by a host of factors, but which ones are most important?" Verma said. "We wanted to evaluate the relative strength of each of these factors in combination with all the others."

Machine learning "offers a promising avenue for analyzing large datasets with multiple variables and identifying patterns that may not be apparent through conventional statistical approaches," the researchers wrote.

The team tested various machine learning algorithms to see which one best weighed the various factors to predict the speed of accurate responses in the flanker test. The researchers tested the predictive ability of each algorithm, using a variety of approaches to validate those that appeared to perform the best.

They found that age was the most influential predictor of performance on the test, followed by diastolic blood pressure, BMI and systolic blood pressure. Adherence to the healthy eating index was less predictive of cognitive performance than blood pressure or BMI but also correlated with better performance on the test.

"Physical activity emerged as a moderate predictor of reaction time, with results suggesting it may interact with other lifestyle factors, such as diet and body weight, to influence cognitive performance," Khan said.

"This study reveals how machine learning can bring precision and nuance to the field of nutritional neuroscience," he said. "By moving beyond traditional approaches, machine learning could help tailor strategies for aging populations, individuals with metabolic risks or those seeking to enhance cognitive function through lifestyle changes."

The Personalized Nutrition Initiative and National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the U. of I. supported this research.

Khan is a dietitian and an affiliate faculty member of the Division of Nutritional Sciences, the Neuroscience Program and the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at Illinois.

Two existing medications - one used for smoking cessation and the other for depression - appear to work effectively together in treating alcohol use disorder. The combination reduces alcohol cravings, lowers consumption, and may decrease the risk of nausea. These findings come from a new study led by the University of Gothenburg, Sweden.

Alcohol use disorder is a serious condition that can shorten the lives of those with severe forms of the disorder by 25 years or more. Yet, existing treatments are effective for only a small subset of patients.

The results are published in The Lancet Regional Health - Europe. The study was carried out in collaboration with researchers from Karolinska Institutet, Lund University, and Linköping University. It introduces a potential new treatment strategy: boosting dopamine levels in the brain.

The researchers based their approach on the hypothesis that a dopamine deficiency drives the craving for alcohol. They aimed to enhance dopamine signaling by combining varenicline, which stimulates dopamine release via nicotine receptors, with bupropion, which helps the brain maintain dopamine levels after release.

A total of 384 individuals with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder took part in the 13-week study. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups, receiving either the combination treatment, one of the two drugs alone, or a placebo. Neither the participants nor the researchers knew who received what during the trial.

Results showed the greatest reduction in alcohol consumption among those who received the combination therapy. Varenicline alone also produced a measurable effect. The outcomes were assessed using both blood biomarkers (B-PEth, which reflects long-term alcohol intake) and self-reported data.

One of the researchers behind the study is Bo Söderpalm, professor of psychiatry at the Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, and senior physician at Sahlgrenska University Hospital:

We observed approximately twice the effect compared to currently available medications, which is highly promising. However, additional studies are required before the combination treatment can be approved for alcohol use disorder."

Bo Söderpalm, professor of psychiatry, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg

An important secondary finding was that the combination treatment caused less nausea, which is a known side effect of varenicline. Among those who did experience nausea, symptoms lasted for a shorter period of time, similar to what was observed in the placebo group.

Andrea de Bejczy, PhD researcher affiliated with the Sahlgrenska Academy and resident physician at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, played a central role in conducting the study:

"Nausea is a well-known and troublesome side effect of treatment with varenicline. It was surprising but very encouraging to see that nausea decreased when bupropion was added. The fact that the combination treatment is more tolerable for patients increases the chances that they will complete the full course of treatment," says Andrea de Bejczy.

SOLASCURE Ltd (SolasCure), a biotechnology company developing a novel treatment to transform chronic wound healing, today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track Designation for its investigational Aurase Wound Gel (AWG), in the treatment of patients with calciphylaxis ulcers. The designation recognizes the potential of AWG in the treatment of this new indication, widening its application in the healing of chronic wounds whilst expediting the speed at which the new therapy could be available to patients.

Calciphylaxis is a rare but serious condition involving the calcification of small blood vessels in the fat and skin tissues. It leads to blood clots, painful skin ulcers, and can progress to severe infections and sepsis. Although most commonly associated with end-stage renal disease, the condition can also occur in individuals with normal kidney function. With limited treatment options and a high one-year mortality rate, AWG offers an alternative debridement solution that potentially reduces the risk of infection and sepsis, opening up treatment options for patients previously considered too fragile to receive the current standard of care and improving outcomes in this vulnerable population.

AWG is a hydrogel releasing Tarumase, a recombinant enzyme originally isolated from medical maggots, which selectively targets fibrin, collagen and elastin in wounds to promote healing through debridement and wound bed preparation. It is currently in Phase II Clinical trials for the treatment of venous leg ulcers, having established proof-of-concept, a strong safety profile and pain-free application.

Given the unmet medical need and the poor outcomes for patients with calciphylaxis, the FDA's granting Fast Track Designation is a significant milestone. Not only does it reflect the promise of Aurase Wound Gel in the treatment of calciphylaxis ulcers, but it also adds a new indication, increasing its potential to help more patients, therefore opening up an even larger target market for SolasCure."

A first-of-its-kind blood test to detect amyloid plaques in the brain associated with Alzheimer's disease recently received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. An Indiana University School of Medicine researcher who helped lead the discovery and development of one of the biomarkers the test identifies hopes it will provide greater access and a more accurate diagnosis for patients.

The test received FDA clearance, which allows medical devices to be legally marketed in the U.S., on May 16. People 55 and older who exhibit signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease can now receive the test, which is more than 90% accurate in diagnosing the disease, through a blood draw ordered by their physician.

Jeff Dage, PhD, senior research professor of neurology at the IU School of Medicine, discovered nearly a decade ago that phosphorylated tau - a protein in the brain that is associated with Alzheimer's disease and gets filtered through the bloodstream - is a potential biomarker for Alzheimer's disease. Together with collaborators from the Mayo Clinic, Lund University in Sweden, the University of San Francisco and Columbia University, Dage worked to demonstrate the performance of the blood test across a wide population of patients.

The teams published landmark papers, from 2018 to 2020, establishing they had identified a useful blood-based test. Their results showed the test was 96% accurate in determining whether a patient had pathological evidence of disease - on par with FDA-cleared cerebrospinal fluid testing or PET scans.

The blood test measures the ratio of two proteins that are hallmark characteristics of Alzheimer's disease: phosphorylated tau (pTau217) and an amyloid protein (β-amyloid 1-42).

This offers a less invasive, more accessible and scalable method to identify Alzheimer's pathology early in the disease process. It opens the door to more efficient diagnosis, earlier interventions and broader participation in clinical trials, which is essential for advancing treatment."

Jeff Dage, PhD, senior research professor of neurology, IU School of Medicine

According to the Alzheimer's Association, more than 7 million people in the U.S. are living with Alzheimer's disease, and that number is projected to rise to nearly 13 million in 2050.

For nearly 15 years, doctors detected amyloid plaques to diagnose Alzheimer's disease using positron emission tomography (PET) brain scans, and, in 2022, the FDA cleared collecting cerebrospinal fluid samples through lumbar punctures to detect plaques. Those methods, however, are more invasive, more expensive and less accessible for all types of patients.

"Now we can obtain more specific and accurate diagnoses of tens of thousands of patients and improve our understanding of the risk or protective factors specifically associated with Alzheimer's disease or non-Alzheimer's disease dementias," Dage said.

As the blood test is rolled out into the health care industry and doctors become more comfortable with its performance, Dage said it may provide earlier diagnoses for patients.

Dage, who joined the IU School of Medicine faculty in 2021 after more than 20 years as a scientist at Eli Lilly and Co., said developing an affordable and accessible blood test to aid in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is personal to him. He started his pursuit of a blood-based biomarker only a few years after walking through the steps of diagnosis as a caregiver for his mother, who passed away from complications of dementia in 2019.

"While the test is a major milestone, we must continue to refine it, expand its use and ensure it reaches those who need it most," Dage said. "Above all, I'm grateful to the patients and families who have participated in our research - they are the true heroes of this story. I hope even more people will become excited about participating in research and even donate cerebrospinal fluid and blood so we can make the next discoveries."

Biomarker research is an emerging facet of the IU School of Medicine's comprehensive Alzheimer's disease research program, which encompasses basic and translational research, drug discovery, testing new therapeutics and clinical research. 

Dage's expertise in biomarkers has supported multiple Alzheimer's disease research programs at the medical school, such as the Indiana Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, the Longitudinal Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease Study, the Target Enablement to Accelerate Therapy Development for Alzheimer's Disease center and the National Centralized Repository for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias.

Bruce Lamb, PhD, an IU Distinguished Professor and the executive director of the Stark Neurosciences Research Institute, said fluid biomarkers link the basic, translational and clinical research investigating Alzheimer's disease and related dementias at the IU School of Medicine.

"This program has allowed us to identify and validate biomarkers of disease in animal models, identify unique biomarkers linked to therapeutic targets, characterize novel fluid biomarkers in patient populations and clinical trials and implement biomarkers into the community," Lamb said.

A video consultation between patient and surgeon is just as good as a physical visit to the outpatient clinic to discuss a major operation. This is evident from research by Amsterdam UMC, demonstrated that a video consultation is just as good as a physical consultation in terms of information uptake. Alongside this finding, patients save an average of two hours of travel time and waiting time per consultation, incur no costs for travel and parking, and reduce their ecological footprint. The CO₂ emissions of a video consultation are 99 percent lower than those of a physical hospital visit. The results were published today in The Lancet Digital Health. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Amsterdam UMC's, as with many other hospitals, video consultation infrastructure was quickly scaled up allowing consultations to continue to take place. Nevertheless, after the pandemic, many healthcare providers were still reluctant to make use of the digital tool, perhaps due to unfamiliarity or doubts about its effectiveness. 

Researchers at Amsterdam UMC wanted to know whether a video consultation works just as well as a physical conversation when preparing for major abdominal surgery. "Do patients receive the same amount of information? Do they feel just as well helped? Does it work for all ages and digital skills? And how do surgeons experience it?" summarizes PhD candidate at Amsterdam UMC, Britte ten Haaft. 

The outcome of the "VIDEOGO" trial leaves no doubt: a video consultation with the surgeon is just as good as a physical outpatient visit. The study involved 112 patients in two Dutch hospitals. Participants were divided in two groups, with half taking part in a video consultation and the others in physical conversation. 

Despite the change in setting, the researchers saw the same amount of information absorption, equal satisfaction among both patient and healthcare provider and a lot of extra benefits for the patient. An average of two hours less time per consultation, for example (including travel time and waiting time), but also savings on travel costs and parking and less dependence on a companion. 

There are also important social benefits. The CO₂ emissions of a video consultation are 99 percent lower than those of a physical visit. Moreover, it increases the accessibility of care, emphasizes ten Haaft: "For patients with a long travel time or without travel guidance, a physical consultation can be a considerable barrier. Moreover, the healthcare sector is responsible for 7 percent of total CO₂ emissions in the Netherlands-so let's use video calling where possible." 

Professor of Surgery Marc Besselink also sees practical advantages: "Many patients enjoyed processing the explanation at home, in a familiar environment and with family present. Discussing a CT scan or surgery image also went well online." 

Professor of Digital Health Marlies Schijven is just as enthusiastic: "A fantastic expansion of the contact options with patients. It is important for healthcare providers to know that they can safely offer patients a video consultation, with all the benefits that come with it. In practice, this works as follows: patients indicate their preference for a physical appointment or a video consultation, the healthcare provider includes this in the file and acts accordingly if possible. A great step towards future-proof healthcare." 

The research was carried out at the surgery outpatient clinics of Amsterdam UMC and Catharina Hospital and funded by ZonMw from the Citrine programme Towards Regional Oncology Networks 2019-2022.

By the time Eric Tennant was diagnosed in 2023 with a rare cancer of the bile ducts, the disease had spread to his bones. He weighed 97 pounds and wasn't expected to survive a year with stage 4 cancer.

Two years later, grueling rounds of chemotherapy have slowed the cancer's progress, even as it has continued to spread. But chemotherapy has also ravaged Tennant's body and his quality of life.

Recently, however, the 58-year-old had reason to hope things would improve. Last fall, his wife, Rebecca, learned of a relatively new, noninvasive procedure called histotripsy, which uses targeted ultrasound waves to destroy tumors in the liver. The treatment could extend his life and buy him more downtime between rounds of chemotherapy.

Early this year, Tennant's oncologist agreed he was a good candidate since the largest tumor in his body is in his liver. But that's when his family began fighting another adversary: their health insurer, which decided the treatment was "not medically necessary," according to insurance paperwork.

Health insurers issue millions of denials every year. And like the Tennants, many patients find themselves stuck in a convoluted appeals process marked by long wait times, frustrating customer service encounters, and decisions by medical professionals they've never met who may lack relevant training.

Recent federal and state efforts, as well as changes undertaken by insurance companies themselves, have attempted to improve a 50-year-old system that disproportionately burdens some of the sickest patients at the worst times. And yet many doctors complain that insurance denials are worse than ever as the use of prior authorization has ramped up in recent years, reporting by KFF Health News and NBC News found.

When the Tennant family was told histotripsy would cost $50,000 and insurance wouldn't cover it, they appealed the denial four times.

"It's a big mess," said Rebecca Tennant, who described feeling like a pingpong ball, bouncing between the insurer and various health care companies involved in the appeals process.

"There's literally nothing we can do to get them to change," she said in an April interview with KFF Health News. "They're, like, not accountable to anyone."

While the killing of UnitedHealthcare chief executive Brian Thompson in December incited a fresh wave of public fury about denials, there is almost no hope of meaningful change on the horizon, said Jay Pickern, an assistant professor of health services administration at Auburn University.

"You would think the murder of a major health insurance CEO on the streets of New York in broad daylight would be a major watershed moment," Pickern said. Yet, once the news cycle died down, "everything went back to the status quo."

Back in West Virginia, Eric and Rebecca Tennant say they are realistic about Eric's prognosis.

They never expected histotripsy to cure his cancer. At best, the procedure could buy him more time and might allow him to take an extended break from chemotherapy. That makes it worth trying, they said.

As a safety instructor with the West Virginia Office of Miners' Health Safety and Training, Eric Tennant is a state employee and is insured by West Virginia's Public Employees Insurance Agency.

As the Tennants pleaded with the state insurance agency to cover histotripsy, they faced a list of other companies involved in the decision, including UMR, a UnitedHealthcare subsidiary that contracts with West Virginia to manage the public employee plans, and MES Peer Review Services, a Massachusetts company that upheld the insurer's decision in March, citing that histotripsy is "unproven in this case and is not medically necessary."

None of their appeals worked. After KFF Health News and NBC News reached out to West Virginia's Public Employees Insurance Agency with questions for this article, the agency changed its mind, explaining the insurer had consulted with medical experts to further evaluate the case.

"This decision reflects a rare and exceptional situation" and does not represent a change in the Public Employees Insurance Agency's overall coverage policies," Director Brent Wolfingbarger said in a prepared statement to KFF Health News.

In a separate prepared statement, UnitedHealthcare spokesperson Eric Hausman said the company sympathizes with "anyone navigating through life-threatening care decisions."

"Currently, there is no evidence that histotripsy is as effective as alternative treatment options available," he said in late May, after the earlier insurance denials were reversed, "and its impact on survival or cancer recurrence is unknown."

MES Peer Review Services did not respond to a request for an interview.

Meanwhile, Rebecca Tennant worries it might be too late. She said her husband was first evaluated for histotripsy in February. But his health has recently taken a turn for the worse. In late May and early June, she said, he spent five days in the hospital after developing heart and lung complications.

Eric Tennant is no longer considered a viable candidate for histotripsy, his wife said, although the Tennants are hopeful that will change if his health improves. Scans scheduled for July will determine whether his cancer has continued to progress. Rebecca Tennant blames her husband's insurance plan for wasting months of their time.

"Time is precious," she said. "They know he has stage 4 cancer, and it's almost like they don't care if he lives or dies."

Recent tracking polls report that about one in eight people have taken a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, more commonly known as GLP-1 medications. 

Originally used to help treat type 2 diabetes, these medications have gained in popularity over the last few years for weight loss. 

Currently, the most common types of GLP-1 drugs are semaglutide — sold under the brand names Ozempic for type 2 diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss — and tirzepatide, sold under the brand names Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss. 

Just like any medication, GLP-1 drugs have possible side effects and complications. One potential complication was first reported in July 2024 when a study found people using semaglutide were at a four times higher risk of developing nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). This was followed by research published in January 2025 that discovered people taking either semaglutide or tirzepatide may be at an increased risk for potentially blinding vision issues. 

Now, a new study recently published in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology reports that older adults with diabetes taking any type of GLP-1 medication may be at a heightened risk for developing neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD).

For this study, researchers analyzed health records from 2020 to 2023 of more than 139,000 Ontario residents with an average age of 66 and diagnosis of diabetes. Participants who used GLP-1 medications did so for more than six months. 

“Our study included any GLP-1 receptor agonists that were prescribed during the study period in Ontario, Canada; we did not exclude any specific type of these medications,” Rajeev H. Muni, MD MSc FRCSC, associate professor and vice chair of Clinical Research in the Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences at the University of Toronto in Canada, and principal investigator of this study explained to Medical News Today. “However, semaglutide represented the vast majority of use in our cohort, accounting for 97.5% of all GLP-1 prescriptions.”

“Lixisenatide made up the remaining 2.5%, and nearly all prescriptions of lixisenatide were in combination with insulin glargine,” Muni continued. “Tirzepatide was not included because it had not yet been approved in Canada during the study period.” 

“Furthermore, while Wegovy was approved in late 2021, our study focused on patients with diabetes from 2020 to 2023,” he added. “Therefore, it is very likely that the semaglutide included in our analysis was prescribed as Ozempic, which is indicated for blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes.” 

Upon analysis, researchers found that participants with diabetes taking a GLP-1 medication had a two-fold higher risk of developing nAMD — a type of AMD where malformed blood vessels grow underneath the retina, causing fluids to leak into the macula of the eye. 

There is currently no cure for nAMD and it is a condition that can potentially cause blindness. 

“We found that among patients with diabetes aged 66 and older, the incidence of nAMD was approximately 1 in 1,000 in those who had never used GLP-1 receptor agonists, compared to about 2 in 1,000 among those who had been exposed to these medications for at least six months,” Muni said. “While the absolute risk remains low, this represents a relative doubling in risk.” 

“While our findings should not prompt alarm, they do warrant increased clinical awareness,” he continued. “These medications have well-established benefits for cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic health. However, patients who may be at higher risk for nAMD, such as older adults, should be aware of the possibility of new visual symptoms. If any new changes in vision occur while taking these medications, patients should promptly inform their doctor and be referred to an ophthalmologist for further assessment.” 

Additionally, Muni and his team observed that the highest nAMD risk was associated with participants who had used GLP-1 medications for the longest amount of time. 

“We observed a clear dose-response relationship in our analysis, with the risk of nAMD increasing as the duration of GLP-1 receptor agonist exposure increased,” Muni explained. “This finding is clinically meaningful because it suggests that the risk may accumulate over time.” 

“Given that many individuals use these medications chronically, whether for blood sugar control or for weight loss, the long-term ocular safety of GLP-1 RAs requires further investigation,” he continued. “While observational data can't prove causation on its own, seeing a graded relationship like this suggests that prolonged exposure could play a role in increasing risk; however, this needs to be validated in future studies.” 

MNT also talked to Demetrios Vavvas, MD, PhD, director of the retina service at Mass Eye and Ear in Massachusetts, about this research.

Vavvas commented that the study's strength is on its massive scale of real-world data, the robust statistical technique used, and the evidence it found of a “dose-response” relationship.

“The risk of developing nAMD appeared to increase the longer a patient was exposed to the medication,” he continued. “This type of pattern makes a potential link more compelling than a single, static finding and provides a significant signal that warrants serious follow-up investigation.”

However, Vavvas did point out that the study has some limitations.

“The most significant limitation is that this study can only show an association, not prove that the drug causes this eye condition. This is because critical risk factors like smoking, obesity (BMI), and sun exposure were not accounted for in the data. Since GLP-1 RAs are often prescribed to patients with obesity, this single unmeasured factor could be the true driver of the observed risk.”— Demetrios Vavvas, MD, PhD

“Second, the results may be influenced by surveillance bias,” Vavvas continued. “Patients starting a powerful new medication like a GLP-1 RA are likely to be monitored more closely by their doctors. This increased medical attention could lead to a higher likelihood of their eye problems being detected and treated, which is what the study measured, creating the appearance of increased risk.”

“Thirdly, the actual events were very small — less than 0.2% so despite statistical adjustment results may not be accurate,” he added. “Lastly as the majority of GLP-1 RAs in this study were semaglutide, this may not apply to all GLP-1 RAs and additionally, because the analysis excluded over 26,000 patients who could not be matched, the results may not apply to the full spectrum of patients taking these drugs in the real world, particularly those with more complex health profiles.”

MNT spoke with David I. Geffen, OD, FAAO, director of optometric and refractive services at the Gordon Schanzlin New Vision in La Jolla, CA, about this study. 

Geffen commented that as GLP-1 medications are being prescribed to a huge number of patients — and as it's been observed that not all patients are symptom free and not side effect free — doctors must be very careful to make sure their patients' eye health is not compromised utilizing these medications. 

“It is important to make sure that we know our patients are taking these medications,” he explained. “This study shows that as new medications are approved we need to be careful as long term side-effects may be seen that we were not aware of.” 

“Diabetes is very common in our practices and many of our patients are put on the GPL-1s,” Geffen continued. “We need (to) be vigilant in examining patients with diabetes. If using these meds, it is even more important. One study is not enough to make too many assumptions however in deciding to use these meds. The GLP-1 medications have shown many benefits for most patients.”

“It is important to carry on further studies in other countries to see if this is seen in other populations,” he added. “It would be important to know more of the demographics of the afflicted populations. Knowing the status of the retina in the individuals before being put on the medications would be helpful in determining safety profiles.”

The U.S. health care workforce has bounced back from the massive job losses of early 2020, with employment now matching pre-pandemic projections, according to new research from the University of Michigan.

The recovery, however, is uneven with some health care settings thriving while others continue to struggle with severe staffing shortages.

For example, while doctors' offices have exceeded pre-pandemic employment growth trends since 2023, skilled nursing facilities and intensive behavioral health centers are still dealing with widespread staffing shortages that began during the pandemic.

The study, led by School of Public Health researcher Thuy Nguyen and detailed in a research letter published in JAMA, captured staffing comparisons by analyzing employment data from 2016 through 2024 to track health care sectors' recovery from the pandemic's impact.

One of the most striking findings involves mental health services. Office-based behavioral health practitioners such as therapists and counselors working in private practice settings saw their employment numbers skyrocket by 84% from 2019 to 2024. Meanwhile, intensive behavioral health facilities that provide more comprehensive mental health and substance abuse treatment have struggled to rebuild their workforce.

The findings on behavioral health practitioners are significant and can guide policy changes in response to the rise of office-based practitioners amid a prolonged shortage in more intensive care settings that began during the pandemic.”

Thuy Nguyen, U-M assistant professor of health management and policy

The research points to several factors that may explain why some health care settings recovered better than others. Office-based practices may have been seen as lower-risk environments for COVID-19 transmission and offered less stressful working conditions compared to hospitals and nursing homes. The growth in demand for office-based mental health services through traditional and telehealth platforms likely contributed to the expansion of office-based mental health services.

“For patients and families, these employment patterns have real-world implications,” said study co-author Kosali Simon, the Herman B. Wells Endowed Professor in Health Economics at Indiana University. “The continued staffing challenges in nursing homes and intensive mental health facilities could affect access to care and quality of services in these critical health care settings.”

Health care employment dropped by nearly 7% in the second quarter 2020 due to pandemic-related shutdowns. By 2024, however, health care jobs had bounced back to pre-pandemic levels, reaching over 24 million jobs as of September last year. By comparison, nonhealth care employment fell more dramatically—more than 11%—and has been slower to recover, remaining at 3% below expected levels in 2024.

The research used data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and compared actual employment numbers to what would have been expected if pre-pandemic trends had continued uninterrupted.

The latest research on the pandemic and health care employment builds on Nguyen's previous work, which first identified that nursing homes were among the hardest hit by health care employment declines during the pandemic. Her earlier 2023 study found that long-term care facilities were still operating with staffing levels more than 10% below pre-pandemic numbers.

Co-authors include Christopher Whaley of Brown University School of Public Health and Jonathan Cantor of RAND.

Michael Emons

Enzo Fernandez



Chelsea 1-0 Los Angeles FC

LA with three chances in quick succession and it ends with Timothy Tillman sending the ball to the back post and Denis Bouanga sliding the ball wide, but it wouldn't have counted anyway as it was offside.

Chelsea 1-0 Los Angeles FC

Marc Cucurella and David Martinez have been battling since Martinez came on at half-time. Martinez got booked for a foul on Cucurella earlier on and now Cucurella has got booked for a foul on Martinez.

Chelsea 1-0 Los Angeles FC

A painful one for Moises Caicedo as he collides with LA's David Martinez, with Marc Cucurella quickly joining the pair.

Caicedo and Cucurella are left briefly limping, but no real damage.

Michael BrownFormer Tottenham and Man City midfielder on Channel 5

Chelsea have got a really good, healthy squad now. The size, the depth, the age, they can only get better.

Chelsea 1-0 Los Angeles

This game is not done yet. LA left-back Ryan Hollingshead comes forwards and unleashes a piledriver from 25 yards that zips over the crossbar. Just a little warning for Chelsea.

Interesting body language from Nicolas Jackson coming off there. He does not look overjoyed for his new team-mate Delap.

Michael BrownFormer Tottenham and Man City midfielder on Channel 5

That first run showed you everything about Liam Delap. He saw the space and ran into it, then he had the awareness to run it to the line and pull a pass back into the middle.

Chelsea 1-0 Los Angeles FC

Liam Delap runs down the right channel, sprints past a defender and pulls it back for Enzo Fernandez, but Chelsea are denied a second goal by some good defending from LA.

Cole Palmer then tries a snapshot inside the penalty area but shoots well over the top.

Nizaar KinsellaBBC Sport football news reporter

Chelsea fans outnumber a loud Los Angeles FC ultras section and have made their voices heard when anything big happens. 

The introduction of new striker Liam Delap may have prompted the biggest cheer, aside from Pedro Neto's goal, inside the Mercedes-Benz Stadium. 

His introduction after his £30m move from Ipswich isn't lost on the mostly US-based Chelsea fans in attendance. 

Chelsea 1-0 Los Angeles FC

A Chelsea debut for striker Liam Delap, after his £30m move from Ipswich Town earlier this month.

He comes on for Nicolas Jackson, with youngster Tyrique George, who featured in Chelsea's Conference League run, replacing Noni Madueke.

Chelsea 1-0 Los Angeles FC

LA's David Martinez is playing a risky game. He's already on a booking and fouls Marc Cucurella and then kicks the ball away. Final warning for the teenager.

Chelsea 1-0 Los Angeles FC

Cole Palmer tries to take on two players and plays a give and go but LA can defend it well and concede a corner.

Tosin Adarabaioyo gets his head to a looping cross after the original corner was cleared, but Hugo Lloris is able to leap and gather the ball underneath the crossbar.

Cucurella once again showing what an embarrassment he is. Get up man, it's absolutely pathetic.

Chelsea 1-0 Los Angeles FC

LA substitute David Martinez gets a booking for a push in the face on Marc Cucurella, who crumples to the ground. He's OK. 

Chelsea 1-0 Los Angeles FC

Michael BrownFormer Tottenham and Man City midfielder on Channel 5

That is a big moment in the game. Real quality and power from Denis Bouanga, pushed it back onto his right foot, could he have gone across the goalkeeper? He hit it early towards the near post and it was a big save from Robert Sanchez.

Chelsea 1-0 Los Angeles FC

LA's Denis Bouanga gets the wrong side of Pedro Neto in Chelsea's penalty area and strikes low and hard, but Robert Sanchez was able to stick out a foot and keep the ball out.

LA have been much improved in this second half.

Chelsea 1-0 Los Angeles FC

So nearly two. Goalscorer Pedro Neto, this time on the left, twists and turns to create space for a cross, Nicolas Jackson gets his head to the delivery, the ball bounces off an LA defender and just about creeps wide.

Chelsea 1-0 Los Angeles FC

Michael BrownFormer Tottenham and Man City midfielder on Channel 5

Brilliant skill from David Martinez. When he gets into the box he has to try and go across the goalkeeper. He goes with his right foot and it goes well wide. 

Neto's goal in the first half was similar but he had the quality to check back and produce the finish. That was a big opportunity for LA.

Chelsea 1-0 Los Angeles FC

LA have their first real chance of the game and substitute David Martinez has a strike at goal, but it hits fellow replacement Olivier Giroud and that is enough to just about deflect it away from target.

Martinez, a 19-year-old Venezuela international, then has another chance, this time from a tight angle, but he can't adjust his feet in time and fires it well wide.

Better from the American side.

MIAMI – FIFA president Gianni Infantino has a vision that in 100 years people will remember this year's Club World Cup in the United States, and have a centennial celebration for the tournament.

Call him overly optimistic – or even crazy. But he may be onto something.

The opening weekend of Club World Cup 2025 alone saw:  

“The FIFA Club World Cup is conquering the world, and soccer is conquering America,” Infantino said in a video posted to his Instagram account Sunday. "It is already epic, and will become better and better. Stay tuned.”

One year before World Cup 2026 descends on the U.S, Canada and Mexico, the 2025 Club World Cup has 32 of the best teams in the world competing for a $1 billion prize pool.

It's taken some time for brand awareness to register – particularly in a host nation where football (not soccer), basketball, hockey and baseball are the predominant sports garnering fan attention.

However, soccer is the prevailing sport above all those worldwide. People from around the globe have arrived in the United States, and are carrying the tournament from a fan perspective.

“There are huge teams coming from all over the world, and that moves a lot of people everywhere. We're talking about great teams with very important players that people love to watch,” Messi said during an interview with FIFA before the tournament. “So, it's a great opportunity to watch the best players play out here in the United States, and it's an amazing opportunity to do this.”

The general public has easy accessibility to games with every Club World Cup match is available to live stream for free on DAZN's website or app. Outside of downloading an app and registering login information, there's no need to enter a credit card number – unless you wish to unlock premium features like watching the games in higher definition (1080p instead of 720p).

FIFA has also introduced referee cameras, giving fans a never-before-seen view of all the action directly on the field from the referees' perspective. The videos shared on social media, during the broadcasts and inside the stadiums have been well received.

The elaborate basketball-lineup introductions of players before matches, however, have not because they aren't typical in soccer matches.

Hey, not everything FIFA is trying out is going to work or be embraced by soccer purists.

The Club World Cup has drawn criticism for being a cash grab – $1.5 billion of FIFA's $2 billion revenue target has already been grabbed.

DAZN paid $1 billion to broadcast the tournament, and $500 million in marketing rights were already secured before the tournament. The other $500 million, if it reaches that, will come from hospitality rights and ticket sales.

Will there be some empty seats in the stands for some matches? Sure. But it won't hurt worldwide viewership.

“When it comes to revenues, everything is perfectly secured,” Infantino said before the tournament.

The Club World Cup has also been criticized for overloading the calendar for soccer teams, raising questions about whether the players would compete with the same fervor and energy they do during their regular seasons.

The 32 participating clubs will play three matches minimum – before half are sent home when the knockout stage begins June 28. Only two clubs will play seven total matches when they reach the July 13 final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

Although the Club World Cup falls after regular seasons for most of the teams involved, MLS is in the middle of its season.

The Seattle Sounders, one of three MLS clubs in the field, along with Inter Miami and Los Angeles FC, had Brazilian champion Botafogo desperately waiting for the match to end. The Sounders admirably pushed for a draw against one of the best clubs in South America before falling 2-1 on their home turf at Lumen Field in Seattle.

“We show that not only can we compete, not only from an intensity and an athletic standpoint but from a tactical standpoint … that this league is good enough at the world stage,” Seattle's goal scorer Cristian Roldan said after the loss. "I think that's what this tournament is all about."

LAFC coach Steve Cherundolo said he believes this summer's Club World Cup and next year's World Cup will inspire young fans to love the sport – just like watching the 1994 World Cup did for him.

"It had a profound effect in 1994, when I was a kid in the stands at the Rose Bowl, watching games live. It really planted the seed for me that has guided my life since that day,” Cherundolo said during a FIFA interview before LAFC plays English Premier League standout Chelsea on Monday in Atlanta.

“It should have a very profound effect and positive effect on our sport – or the world sport – in our country.”

Enzo Maresca's side open their tournament against the MLS club

Chelsea open their Club World Cup campaign with a meeting with LAFC in Atlanta.

With a trophy in tow after Conference League success capped a solid first season under Enzo Maresca, Chelsea will now hope to build and mount a more realistic title challenge in the Premier League next season. First, though, they will look to negotiate this competition, beginning with an encounter with an LAFC that will feature Olivier Giroud up front against his former club.

Flamengo and Esperance de Tunis are the other pair of teams in Group D, with the top two advancing to the knockout rounds. The expanded competition is being held at 12 venues across the United States, with 32 entrants ranging from some of Europe's biggest clubs to semi-professional Auckland City.

In fact, Enzo Maresca isn't going to risk Reece James - Malo Gusto has been introduced, while Enzo Fernandez is on in midfield, too. It looks like Romeo Lavia has departed. 

The players re-emerge, hopefully with those simmering tensions of the end of the first 45 minutes just calmed a bit. Reece James was in the thick of things, I think playing peace-maker - both he and Tosin Adarabioyo are on bookings, of course.

A few handbags after the half-time whistle is blown for...some reason. All rather odd.

Anyway, Chelsea in control and not out of the low gears. Back for more in a bit. 

Two minutes added on at the end of the half. Tosin Adarabioyo joins fellow defender Reece James in the book after sliding through the back of a would-be recipient of a pass. 

An unfortunate slip from Jeremy Ebobisse, studs not quite catching in the turf as he tries to retrieve a knock-down in the Chelsea box. 

A delay as Nathan Ordaz is seen to by the LAFC medics having taken a bang to the head. A change will be made, but not before the free kick...which is tipped over the bar by Robert Sanchez.

On comes talented Venezuelan teenager David Martinez.

The first caution of the game goes the way of Reece James as he chops down Denis Bouanga after being narrowly second to a bouncing ball.

Chelsea lead. A soft pass in midfield allows Marc Cucurella to nip in, and Chelsea break with speed. A lovely pass from Nicolas Jackson sends Pedro Neto scampering through, and a defender slides out of frame as Neto produces a crisp Cruyff turn. A tidy finish and the Premier League side are in front.

Bright work from Pedro Neto again, zipping past Ryan Hollingshead and swinging in another delivery. Too deep and tall for Noni Madueke to make anything of it.

Awful Announcing

This new generation of the U.S. Men's National Team hasn't exactly taken over the world like we were told they would. Maybe it was hubris, maybe it was hype. Either way, the so-called “golden generation” hasn't delivered. Players moved to bigger clubs, managers came and went, and the same underwhelming results keep rolling in.

At this point, disappointment feels like the only real tradition. And now the latest drama swirling around Christian Pulisic has only deepened the sense that something's broken.

So, what should we attribute that to?

Alexi Lalas thinks — again — that we should attribute it to diversity.

“We oftentimes talk about our diversity and we talk about it in the fact that it is one of the advantages we have, and of the great things about our country,” Lalas said on First Things First. “But with that diversity comes diversity of thought. If I go and ask a hundred soccer people out there, ‘What's beautiful soccer?' I'm going to get a hundred different answers. And it might be based on ethnicity, where you grew up, even geography. All of these different things.

“So I've argued that the homogenous nature of some other countries and cultures just in population in terms of size are much more manageable. And there is a collective understanding and, more importantly, an agreement in this is how we're going to play. But getting 11 men to represent this great country of 350 million people, and all be on the same page, that is very, very difficult.”



Lalas doubled down, arguing that the team might be better off being less inclusive. That, instead of embracing the country's diversity, perhaps the solution is to pick players from the same region, with shared upbringings and a common worldview.

“I've argued before that maybe our best route to actually being better from a men's perspective in soccer is actually being more exclusive, not being as inclusive,” Lalas continued. “In that if you went to the New York metropolitan area or Southern California and you just took players that all grew up in the same area, had all this shared experiences, maybe that would be better in terms of an understanding.

“This melting pot fallacy that I'll be the first to admit, I bought into. And I'm not saying it can't happen. It just takes a lot longer and with a lot more work. And especially when it comes to a national team, you don't have time to be able to do that.”

That theory falls apart when you consider that one of the most dominant international teams of this generation — France — won the 2018 World Cup with a roster made up of players from wildly different backgrounds, ethnicities, and life experiences. Kylian Mbappé, Paul Pogba, N'Golo Kanté, and countless others didn't grow up in some shared suburb with the same coach and identical worldview. What they had was a clear identity, a strong system, and buy-in across the board.

Lalas' argument doesn't explain why diversity works elsewhere. It just highlights that the U.S. hasn't figured out how to make it work here.

Maybe the issue isn't too many perspectives, it's the lack of a clear plan to unify them.

And if your takeaway is that inclusion is the problem, then maybe you're not identifying the failure. Maybe you're contributing to it.

FIFA bosses have been left red-faced after Chelsea's Club World Cup opener against LAFC was played in front of a half-empty stadium. There were huge swathes of empty red seats in the 71,000 capacity Mercedes Benz Stadium in Atlanta as ticket sales appeared to have flopped.

Tickets for general admission were on sale for £38 ($51) but the spectacular £1billion stadium did not look even half full at kick-off. There were pre-match estimates that the crowd was expected to be around 26,000 and it is hard to estimate exact figures.

FIFA had reduced prices for matches in the States after a poor take up - and attendances over the weekend had been better than first feared. Inter Miami's opening match of the tournament - with Lionel Messi the star attraction - drew 60,927 for their game with Al Ahly.

More than 80,000 were in the Rose Bowl on Sunday to watch Paris-Saint Germain's 4-0 win over Atletico Madrid. But the game in Atlanta failed to have the same attraction although it was played at 3pm on a normal work day Monday.

The scheduling has clearly been an issue but the number of empty seats will be a blow to FIFA at the start of their new-look 32 team tournament. The winners stand to win £97m in prize money with a total pot of £775m across the four-week tournament played across the States.

Meanwhile, Bayern Munich 's 10-goal win in the Club World Cup drew in a bumper TV audience. A peak of 560,000 watched Bayern's win over no-hopers Auckland City on Channel 5 as the new tournament drew in viewers.

There was an average audience of 392,000 for the 10-0 thumping while England's under-21s averaged 562,000 and peaked at 840,000 on Channel 4.

Channel 5 are showing live games from the tournament in the United States after striking a deal with DAZN and it remains to be seen whether it will be a hit with viewers.

Ahead of Chelsea's first match, Enzo Maresca said Liam Delap can become England's next No9. Maresca insists his new £30m signing has got all the attributes to succeed Harry Kane as England's first choice centre forward.

Chelsea boss Maresca worked with Delap while an academy coach at Manchester City and that was a major factor in why they were able to persuade him to move to Stamford Bridge from Ipswich this summer.

Maresca said: “When we faced Ipswich, before we faced Ipswich, so Liam was not a Chelsea player, I said that for me, Liam, potentially he can be England number nine.

“So he was not even with us. And for sure now that he's with us, I'm going to say again that I don't have any doubt that he can be in the future England number nine. And then the other one, we'll see.

“Liam knows quite well how important the number nine is for this club. Personally I don't see any problem about that in terms of, I see Liam quite relaxed, easy, he's doing well, since he arrived he's working well.

“We know each other from years ago, so I know what Liam can give us, he knows what we can give to him to improve and to become a better player. And again in terms of number nine, hopefully he can score goals for us.”

ATLANTA, Ga. -- Ellie Fife of the University of Michigan women's soccer team has been named to the 42-player roster for the first-ever Women's College Talent ID Camp, U.S. Soccer announced on Monday afternoon (June 16).

The camp is the first step in building the U.S. Youth National Teams' scouting strategy of increasing programming opportunities for high-potential college players. The Talent ID Camp, hosted at McCurry Park in Atlanta from June 18-22, has the goal of expanding the Under-18, U19, and U20 Women's National Team player pools.

An Ann Arbor native, Fife has picked up three previous invites to U.S. Talent ID Camps, most recently in 2022. She transferred from Vanderbilt for the upcoming 2025 season, appearing in seven contests for the Commodores and was named to the 2024 SEC Fall Academic Honor Roll.

She was ranked as the 32nd best player in the United States by Prep Soccer in 2024 while playing club soccer for the Michigan Hawks.

Summer is here but there's no time for football to take a break. Why this weekend alone we've had Gold Cup and Club World Cup, both of which will go careening on into this week and beyond. I'm James Benge, let's take a look back at what you might have missed this weekend:

All times U.S./Eastern

Monday, June 16🏆 CWC: Chelsea vs. Los Angeles FC, 3 p.m. ➡️ DAZN🏆 CWC: Boca Juniors vs. Benfica, 6 p.m. ➡️ DAZN🌎 Gold Cup: Jamaica vs. Guatemala, 10 p.m. ➡️ FS1

Tuesday, June 17🏆 CWC: Fluminense vs. Borussia Dortmund, 12 p.m. ➡️ DAZN🇪🇺 U21 Euros: Spain vs. Italy, 3 p.m. ➡️ Vix🌎 Gold Cup: Canada vs. Honduras, 10:30 p.m. ➡️ FS1

In his report on last night's game, Chuck Booth was at pains to warn you all "don't get carried away." I'm here to tell you the exact opposite. The US men's national team have won a soccer match! And they've done it by five goals! Everything is so, so back.

Ok, maybe not. Trinidad and Tobago are hardly the sternest opposition that the USMNT are going to face in the Gold Cup, let alone in the bigger assignments to come next summer. The Soca Warriors had never won on American soil before and they didn't get close on Sunday night, Malik Tillman scoring the first two in what wound up being a comprehensive 5-0 win for Mauricio Pochettino's men. Across the pitch, the US looked stronger and more incisive, dominating possession on their way to 21 shots and 3.6 expected goals. The margin of the win did not flatter the hosts in San Jose.

That matters, more than perhaps it ought to, given the trying circumstances that the USMNT finds itself in. Four defeats on the spin is not exactly a formula for winning morale nor did any of those results imbue much hope over the quality of the back ups and back ups to the back ups. Meanwhile the starriest of stars, Christian Pulisic, was jabbing at Mauricio Pochettino about the games he might wish to pick and choose. The US needed to change the conversation. They did that.

Now there is an opportunity to build real momentum and for a few of those fringe players to carve out bigger roles. Tillman translating his PSV Eindhoven form to the national team suggests he should not even be in the fringe category. Perhaps the same was true of Diego Luna, impressive once more on his way to two assists. Up next in Austin is Saudi Arabia, another faltering future World Cup host albeit with plenty more time to build something. Beat them and the knockout stages will beckon, bringing with them a real prospect of more silverware. After a trying few months, that would go down very nicely for USMNT.

With the first weekend in the bag, the Club World Cup is going just about as you would expect. FIFA was at great pains on Saturday morning to pronounce the kick off of the tournament a "resounding success" as 60,927 spectators at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium (that's about 93% capacity) were treated to Robbie Williams, Lionel Messi and, well, no goals. That was not for the want of trying by Al Ahly, who were denied an upset win by the heroics of Oscar Ustari in the Inter Miami goal. Trezeguet saw his penalty saved, Lionel Messi hit the woodwork and the Herons had to settle for a point.

That leaves Group A as intriguingly set as it promised to be at the outset, the only one where it didn't profile as having a runaway European winner. Palmeiras proved that to be the case, having the better of the game despite being held to a 0-0 draw by Porto, as Pardeep Cattry noted:

That might have been the most intriguing game of the week, which says a lot for the relative imbalance elsewhere. Bayern Munich did what you would expect they would do an amateur side from New Zealand, only to the max, winning 10-0 against Auckland City. Seattle Sounders were not so outclassed but their defeat for Botafogo means they are right on the edge of elimination from an extremely tough group.

Their best hope might come in the faltering of Atletico Madrid, reduced to 10 men and crushed 4-0 by Paris Saint-Germain. Diego Simeone's side looked heavy legged, like a team that were supposed to be on the beach after a 56 game season. Aaah, yes. 

The sheer heft of that defeat means they are going to have quite the match on their hands when they face Botafogo in the final round of group stage games. With Group A up in the air and Group B also intriguingly set, there does at least to seem to be bubbling intrigue around knockout stage qualification. The same could be true as Boca Juniors face off against Benfica tonight.

🇳🇿 About that 10-0 loss: Yes it's not a great look for the Club World Cup or indeed for Auckland City that they just lost by double digits to Bayern Munich. Still, it probably was even more of a freak result than you might think. Here's why.

Mauricio Pochettino gives his thoughts after the USMNT's 5-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago in the Concacaf Gold Cup (0:31)

SAN JOSE, Calif. -- After a turbulent run-up to this summer's Gold Cup, the U.S. men's national team can breathe again.

In the throes of a four-game home losing streak under new-ish manager Mauricio Pochettino, the U.S. began the Gold Cup on Sunday with a resounding 5-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago. The scoreline was by no means a fluke, either. The U.S. dominated from start to finish, getting a pair of goals from Malik Tillman and another from Patrick Agyemang when he deflected in Diego Luna's goal-bound effort. Substitutes Brenden Aaronson and Haji Wright rounded out the scoring in the final 10 minutes, padding the USMNT's goal differential in the process.

It made for the kind of comfortable win that seemed beyond this group of players just last Tuesday following its 4-0 humbling against Switzerland. But the funk surrounding the USMNT went deeper than that result.

Just how low had the U.S. sunk? It hadn't lost four consecutive games at home since 1988, when it dropped two games each to Chile and Ecuador. That was at the tail end of a 40-year barren spell between World Cup appearances. The latest streak also involved almost the whole U.S. player pool from stars to second-teamers. It couldn't entirely be blamed on youth.

Then there was the off-field drama. Among the dominant storylines surrounding the side was Christian Pulisic's decision to take the summer off and not play in the Gold Cup, which resulted in a chorus of criticism from fans as well as former U.S. internationals such as Landon Donovan.

Pulisic's father, Mark, then came to his son's defense with the help of ChatGPT. That was followed by Pulisic saying he didn't understand the decision to turn down his offer to play in two friendlies and bypass the Gold Cup, to which Pochettino reminded the sometime U.S. captain that the manager is the one in charge, not the players.

The only way for the U.S. team to change the conversation was by winning. It didn't really matter that the victory came over the 100th-ranked team in the world -- one shorn of key forward Levi García who, in an only-in-Concacaf move, picked this weekend to get married. (He'll be back for T&T's remaining games.) This youthful side, with seven starters having fewer than seven caps entering the match, needed to start building a foundation somehow, and it did precisely that.

"I think [Sunday's win] is about [congratulating] them, and I think the first half there's a lot of positive things, that we need to keep evolving in different areas," Pochettino said. "But I think overall it was a good game and three points. [It's] important to keep working.

"Nothing is done, but yes, to feel the victory and being more positive in the next few days, I think it's important to grow that confidence in between us."

It helped that the more veteran elements of the U.S. lineup provided the required platform for success. Center backs Tim Ream and Chris Richards gave outside backs Alex Freeman and Max Arfsten the security to perform their two-way roles on offense and defense with confidence, Arfsten in particular pushing higher up the field. Luca de la Torre provided stability to Sebastian Berhalter in midfield, while Tillman led the attack, allowing Luna to buzz around defensively and provide two assists, with Jack McGlynn making attacking contributions as well.

Granted, it helps that the U.S. was playing T&T and not Switzerland, but scaling the rock face is a lot easier when the handholds are within reach. It will make for a greater level of confidence when the tougher moments arrive, and could apply to team veterans and youngsters alike.

For Tillman, this kind of performance has been a long time coming, so much so that Richards was shocked that the goals were Tillman's first with the national team. But more is being asked of the PSV attacker in this environment than in previous camps with the national team. He's as soft-spoken as they come, but is ready to take on a bigger role.

"I'm quite confident. I had a good season at PSV," said Tillman, who notched 16 goals and five assists for his Dutch team in 2024-25 (34 games, all competitions). "I've been here quite some time now. So yeah, I just take the responsibility. I like to take it and try to show it to everyone else."

That dynamic between youth and experience was also visible through a more unsung contribution deeper in midfield. Tyler Adams was out because of a foot injury and Johnny Cardoso was sidelined due to an illness, which meant Pochettino had to mine the depth chart. In this instance, he opted for De la Torre and Berhalter. The latter sat in a deeper role, allowing de la Torre to sniff out opportunities while also tracking back when needed.

Overall, the combination showed promise and is the latest sign that De la Torre is another player making an impression on Pochettino. The San Diego FC midfielder has long been a performer who knits the attack together in the middle third. But in this case, he has picked his moments to push farther upfield when the situation demands it.

Kasey Keller breaks down the situation between Christian Pulisic and Mauricio Pochettino, in which Pochettino said Pulisic isn't allowed to dictate games he plays in.

Pochettino liked what he saw out of both players, and is pleased that another midfield combination is emerging.

"I think the football relationship between Luca and [Sebastian], it was fantastic and they controlled the game," Pochettino said. "They played really well. I am so happy. They both show that in that position they can fit very well.

"Of course, we didn't have the help of Tyler and Johnny, but this is a good thing -- a period of opportunity to see [the other two] players. But sometimes [they] surprise you and say, 'OK, they take the opportunity,' and that is good because the competition is going to be higher now."

Luna, for one, felt the presence of his veteran teammates as well as the love of 30 friends and family members in the stands.

"It allows me to get the ball and combine," Luna said about playing with Tillman and De la Torre. "And then have guys that have experience and have been in tough moments, be there and help along the way. [Having] good players around you always allows you to be more confident and have trust within the team."

Luna's two-assist performance, including a steal and feed to Tillman for the USMNT's second goal, was another step forward for the native of nearby Sunnyvale. The bear hug he got from Pochettino after being substituted in the 74th minute showed his continued ascendency.

The extent to which this mix of youth and experience can move forward will get its next test in four days against Saudi Arabia in Austin, Texas. That is bound to be a much tougher assignment than Sunday's match. But for now, the clouds have parted a bit, and the hope is that the coming forecast for the U.S. team involves even more sunshine.

There are an awful lot of problems with the Club World Cup. The competitive imbalance between a European giant and the best team in Oceania is not remotely near to being one of them.

Would it have been better for Gianni Infantino's summer jamboree if Bayern Munich had not run 10 past Auckland City in Cincinatti on Sunday? Of course. Given that Vincent Kompany's side slowed the scoring rate before troubling their own record winning margin -- 16-1 win against DJK Waldberg in the 1997-98 DFB Cup -- this is not a game that will make its way to the history books of either club. Auckland City have been here before and, given their dominance of the OFC Champions League, they will likely be here again.

For some that is a cause of contention. "I don't want to belittle anyone, but Bayern's opponent is semi [pro]," grumbled Boca Juniors manager Miguel Angel Russo, who really is setting himself up for the most embarrassing of falls when his side face Auckland City in the final round of Group C fixtures. In the immediate aftermath of the double digit defeat, the question was asked by many. Should Auckland City even be here?

The answer is of course. So long as we accept at first principle that a competition to establish the best club side in the world is a worthwhile endeavour then Auckland City have just as much right to be in the United States as anyone. Frankly they have more than Bayern Munich, who have not won their Champions League in the last four years. 

There is no more logical way to build a tournament like this one than to draw together the best of every continent. On an annual cycle it makes sense to trim representatives from the less wealthy of the six federations before the big boys enter; in its current format there is no reason why every team should not start from the same point. Indeed a fairer question is why Oceania only gets one representative, had another team from Fiji, Tonga or elsewhere in the federation won their Champions League in recent years it would be a matter of brazen unfairness that they would have to battle it out with Auckland City while Bayern got to swan in by dint of being one of the best teams at nearly winning the European Cup.

From the big picture global view, the deck is already weighted against the New Zealanders much as it is Esperance de Tunis, off the pitch. Any suggestion that they should have to jump through further hoops just to meet the likes of Bayern Munich defies the stated purpose of this competition, loosely followed though it may be.

It is not Auckland City's fault that the professional team in town opted to play in the Australian A League, rendering themselves ineligible for the OFC Champions League. Nor are they responsible for the power balances both within football and without that mean the champions of Oceania can get by on an annual budget of about $670,000, barely enough to cover a month's salary for one of Bayern's superstars.

They have not come to the competition asking for pity nor have they gotten any. Asked directly if he felt sorry for his Auckland City counterparts, Michael Olise simply said: "No." Nor should he. If nothing else, this is hardly an out of the ordinary experience for Bayern. Four years ago they ran 12 past Bremer SV in the first round of the German Cup. On Sunday they put up 4.28 expected goals (xG) to their opponent 0.03. That is a cavernous difference but still on six occasions in the last four years of Bundesliga football Bayern have had a higher xG difference. And yet no one could reasonably argue that Bochum should play their season in a different format to Bayern just because they got tanked when they ran into them. 

In the aftermath of Auckland's defeat it was widely noted that it had taken 52 years for a nation to score 10 goals at the men's World Cup proper and barely 52 hours for it to happen at Gianni Infantino's Club World Cup. That speaks to little more than the randomness of high scoring games. Using a basic match expected goals simulator speaks to the brutal imbalance between these two teams on the day. Based on the shots and xG value for both teams, this was a game Bayern Munich win 99.6 percent of the time. Even so, the odds that they run in 10 goals from the 31 shots they took? They're long. They have only a 0.2% probability of happening, at least absent other information.

This was a game of incredible scoring fortune for Bayern. Maybe the defenses Michael Olise meets across the remainder of the Club World Cup won't make it as easy for him to glide off the right flank as he did just before half time but plenty of goalkeepers who are not taking unpaid leave to be at the tournament wouldn't have been able to stop his brilliant strike for Bayern's sixth goal. 

The issues around the Club World Cup are to do with the load it is placing on players, the cynical addition of clubs, the seeming disinterest of the wider footballing public. It won't help competitive balance. Those problems should not include whether a continental champion should be given access to the intercontinental championship because of one freak result against them, even if the odds of them winning a match themselves remain long.

The Football Reporters crew discuss Real Madrid's chances of winning the FIFA Club World Cup under new manager Xabi Alonso. (1:54)

When Real Madrid marked their upcoming involvement in the FIFA Club World Cup with a post on their social media accounts on Saturday, the biggest face in the composite image wasn't that of star striker Kylian Mbappé.

It wasn't Vinícius Júnior's or Jude Bellingham's, either, although all three superstars were featured, alongside the competition's glistening trophy and images of soaring U.S. skyscrapers and bridges.

Instead, the image was dominated by the -- admittedly very handsome -- face of new coach Xabi Alonso. It has been only a few weeks, but already Madridistas couldn't be more excited about the Alonso era, his messianic promise outshining the combined star power of three of the game's most high-profile players.

The new coach's arrival -- returning to the club where he impressed as a player and later began his coaching journey at the academy -- was made official on May 25, the day after Madrid's 2024-25 LaLiga season ended. He took his first training session on June 9, just seven days ago. But already Alonso's Madrid are in Palm Beach, Florida, preparing for the Club World Cup.

A post shared by Real Madrid C.F. (@realmadrid)

Beyond the hype, clues as to exactly what Alonso has planned for the team have been scarce. At home in Madrid, at the club's Valdebebas base, training took place behind closed doors last week. Just 15 minutes of Sunday's first open session in the United States, at their training camp in Palm Beach Gardens, were open to the media. But the little we've seen of Alonso at work, in photos and video carefully compiled and released by the club, has been intriguing.

Every image has already been pored over and analyzed by fans. In one photo, from a set released by the club on June 9, Alonso sits in an office with five of his key coaching staff: Sebas Parrilla (assistant manager), Ismael Camenforte (fitness coach), Alberto Encinas and Beñat Labaien (analysts) and Luis Lopis (the ongoing goalkeeping coach). Their laptops are at the ready, with what look like tactical plans on the screens. Alonso is poised with a tablet in front of him. The intended message, perhaps a little unfairly, is clear: This is a thoroughly modern coach, unlike his predecessor, Carlo Ancelotti.

Training footage shows Alonso to be just as focused, interventionist and detail-orientated as you'd expect: actively directing, stopping play when necessary, pointing and shouting, watching his players' every move and frequently correcting their positioning.

Again, the contrast with the more laid-back Ancelotti couldn't be more stark. Alonso might have played under the chilled-out Italian; but he learned his trade under Rafa Benítez, José Mourinho and Pep Guardiola, too.

At his introductory news conference on May 26, Alonso provided more hints as to the kind of team we might see begin to evolve at the Club World Cup and to flourish in LaLiga next season. He said: "Today in football you have to be flexible, and dynamic. You have to move pieces around during games. I have an idea of how we want to play, but the system can change, with four [defenders], or with three.

"What I want is that we know how to choose our moments, to be organized, to control the ball, and know what to do when we don't have the ball. You have to press when it's necessary, and sit back when it's necessary. It's about taking the initiative, and we have the players to do it."

We'll get a first real glimpse of how close Alonso's embryonic side are to that ideal when Madrid kick off against Al Hilal at Hard Rock Stadium, Miami, on Wednesday.

The task ahead for Alonso is considerable. Madrid underperformed last season, slumping into an ineffective shadow of the team that won LaLiga and the Champions League the year before. When pushed, Alonso refused to provide an analysis of the side's weaknesses, reluctant to get into specifics.

"I've seen the games, I've analyzed them, and now I'm thinking about what we can do to have balance and control," he said. "That will give us a stability which will enable the individual qualities to flourish."

Balance and control. Both were lacking for Ancelotti's Madrid last season. The campaign wasn't a catastrophe: The team finished second in LaLiga, kept the title race alive until May and reached the Copa del Rey final. But Madrid were embarrassed in their Champions League round-of-16 elimination to Arsenal, losing 5-1 on aggregate -- and they lost four consecutive Clásicos to Barcelona for the first time in 15 years, including the 4-3 on May 11 that handed Barça the league. Mbappé might have scored 43 goals in all competitions, but he was just about the only functioning part of the team.

That meant Ancelotti had to lose his job. It was a decision Ancelotti himself accepted and understood, content to bid an emotional farewell and move on to a next destination he had long fancied, as Brazil's national team coach. For an equally long time -- dating back years -- Alonso had been Madrid's favorite to replace him. That view was backed up by his performance at Bayer Leverkusen, with their 2023-24 unbeaten Bundesliga title-winning season.

Circumstances made the handover unexpectedly awkward. Madrid couldn't act while they were still, even theoretically, in the title race. Alonso, respectfully, didn't want to make his future plans public until the end of Leverkusen's season. And Brazil's football federation was keen -- for internal, political reasons -- to secure Ancelotti as soon as possible. The result was Alonso confirming his Leverkusen departure on May 9, and Ancelotti then being announced as Brazil coach, 11 days before his Madrid exit would be made official.

It didn't bother Ancelotti much, though, and he gave his former player his blessing, calling Alonso a "fantastic" coach who had "all doors open to him." The outgoing boss said of his successor: "He's shown himself to be one of the best coaches in the world."

Gustavo Hofman believes Real Madrid would be open to parting ways with Rodrygo but only for a transfer fee between 80-100 million euros.

When Alonso was finally presented as Madrid's new coach on May 26, he was predictably assured, charismatic and eloquent. However, there were some subjects he had to work hard to avoid, such as exactly when Madrid had offered him the job, and how much input he'd had on issues such as the decision not to award veteran midfielder Luka Modric a new contract.

He wouldn't commit to a formation, saying again that "football is dynamic." When asked how he would help Mbappé and Vini Jr. work together as a front two, he answered enigmatically: "I have ideas." There was more detail on a position for Jude Bellingham -- "I see him as a midfielder. We'll try to make sure he's as efficient as possible" -- and a noncommittal answer on Rodrygo who, sources have told ESPN, wants clarity on his future role. "I'll talk to all the players, because we have to get to know each other," Alonso said.

With the 2024-25 season officially over, it's time to rank the top 100 players in the world of men's soccer right now. Welcome to the FC 100. Read the full list here.

This Club World Cup sits between two seasons, two eras, and two Real Madrid teams. Veterans like Modric and Lucas Vázquez will play for Madrid in the tournament for the last time, before their contracts expire. Two new players, center back Dean Huijsen and right back Trent Alexander-Arnold, have already signed and are with the squad in Florida. Two more are in the United States, but elsewhere. River Plate playmaker Franco Mastantuono will join in August when he turns 18, while left back Álvaro Carreras is still with Benfica, the two clubs unable to agree on a fee.

Ball-playing defender Huijsen believes he "fits in well with Xabi's football." Alexander-Arnold says Alonso was a "big idol" for him as a kid, and more than that, he has already affected the development of the full back's playing style. "He impacted my game growing up," Alexander-Arnold said at his unveiling on Thursday. "Watching him pass the ball gave me the hunger to do that. ... He's a new manager, but he's shown how amazing he is. I'll be soaking up all the information I can."

Alonso was reluctant to take on the Club World Cup and would have preferred to begin afterward. An interim, internal appointment was considered, like director of football Santi Solari, before being dismissed as impractical.

Alonso has not had time yet to properly assemble a new team, with a new philosophy and identity, but the demands at Madrid are blind to that. They will be as high as ever. An early elimination, even in the knockout phase, would be viewed as unacceptable. But there's also the alluring possibility of a good performance, an early proof of concept for Alonso's project. "These are the circumstances, and once it's like that, I see it as an opportunity," Alonso insisted last month. "On the one hand, to get started with processes, how we want [the team] to be. And then on the other hand, to fight for a trophy. If we do those two things, it can be a great start."

Former Liverpool and Real Madrid manager Rafa Benítez gives his thoughts on Xabi Alonso's imminent move to Real Madrid.

Those "circumstances" include three players -- Vini Jr., Arda Güler and Andriy Lunin -- meeting up with Alonso and the squad for the very first time on Saturday, at the Four Seasons Hotel in Palm Beach, after their international commitments ended. Other crucial figures -- Mbappé, Bellingham, Alexander-Arnold, Huijsen, Modric and Aurélien Tchouaméni -- only returned on Friday, meaning that they will have only completed five training sessions before Alonso's first game in charge.

And then there's a long list of others -- Dani Carvajal, Éder Militão, Antonio Rüdiger, David Alaba, Eduardo Camavinga, Endrick and Ferland Mendy -- who are still not fully fit and are working on their recovery. All were named in Madrid's Club World Cup squad and have traveled to the U.S.

Speaking on arrival in Palm Beach, Alonso did his best to stay upbeat. "It's been very positive," he said. "You get to know [the players] little by little, having that contact, that's very necessary. And more players are arriving.

"Everything has been sped up a lot, because we have very little time to get to know each other. Today we arrived, and we'll start to make a team. We have three training sessions before the [Al Hilal] match, but we're excited to be here, to have a good tournament, and to go all the way to the end."

That's Madrid's target: getting to the final at MetLife Stadium and winning it. But there's also another, even more important objective: building an improved team for next season, a team that won't get hammered repeatedly by Barcelona or bested by any top side they come up against in the Champions League. And in that regard, it's not yet clear if this tournament will be a help, or a hindrance.

It just continues...

Like a movie with three endings, Chelsea's 2024-25 season just keeps going. We've had the top-four finish.  We've had the Conference League final.  Now we have at least three more games to play, and perhaps a few more if (when) we get to the knockout stages of FIFA's newfangled Club World Cup.  (That's a “when” for manifesting, not a “when” for underestimating.)

Our first group stage game sees us face late-entrants Los Angeles FC, who were granted the opportunity to get Club León's spot after the Liga MX side were kicked due to their shared ownership structure with fellow qualifiers Club Pachuca.  LAFC beat Club América in a one-game playoff to earn their chance against Chelsea, Flamengo, and ES Tunis.

For them, this game, this tournament means everything.  Or at least a lot.

For us, it might not mean that much.

But we play to win every game and every competition, and this one is about as competitive as you can get for a summer tournament.  If FIFA have it their way, this thing will grow to become as big of a deal as the Champions League or maybe even the World Cup.  I doubt that's going to be the case — the old format, which we won in 2021 (well, 2022), certainly never took off — but I've been wrong before.

So, put those vacation plans on hold.  Mykonos can wait.  A trophy's calling.

On TV: Channel 5 (UK); TBS, TUDN (USA); none (India); SuperSport Premier League (NGA); elsewhereStreaming: DAZN is streaming ALL the games globally; you do have to watch through their website or their App (mobile or smart TV). The games are all free (with a free DAZN account) with the occasional in-game split screen ad, though they will push paid plans in your face and that can be tricky to navigate around sometimes.  Paid plans remove the in-game ads.  Here's a link (USA) that should skip past the annoying signup splash page and go directly to their CWC hub.

Chelsea team news: For logistical, competitive, and transfer-market reasons, we've decided to not make too many changes to the squad from the second half of the season, adding only the four new signings that we been already made: Liam Delap, Dário Essugo, Mamadou Sarr, and Mike Penders.

Penders replaces Marcus Bettinelli as the third goalkeeper, with Betts leaving for Manchester City.  Fourth goalkeeper Lucas Bergström was released and his place has gone to Gaga Slonina.  Chelsea wanted to bring Đorđe Petrović along at first, but Petro has decided to explore his transfer options instead.

Other notable absentees from the 28-man squad registered for the group stage include Wesley Fofana, who's currently recovering from hamstring surgery, and Mykhailo Mudryk, who's serving his (officially still just provisional) suspension for a doping ban.  And Jadon Sancho has gone back to Manchester United after failing to agree a (lower-paying) contract with Chelsea.

About a third of the squad had been involved in internationals in the last couple weeks, so they've had practically no break at all since the Conference League final.  That might actually be helpful in avoiding “pre-season mode”.

LAFC team news: Speaking of no break, LAFC are in the middle of their MLS season, which started at the end of February.  The defending Western Conference regular season champions began in fairly poor form, but have now gone unbeaten in their last ten in all competitions (five wins, five draws), including their 2-1 extra-time victory over Club América in the play-in game.

Their main threat is a man named Denis Bouanga, once of AS Saint-Étienee, who's scored 20 league goals in back-to-back seasons and is on track for a third consecutive.  A more familiar, though these days far less threatening name will be Olivier Giroud.  He does have three goals in MLS this season, which is three more than last season, but he's struggled since joining from AC Milan last summer.

Fellow 38-year-old veteran Hugo Lloris will be another familiar name: the former Spurs goalkeeper was an MLS All-Star last season.  We might also remember ex-Roma striker Cengiz Ünder from the season he spent on loan at Leicester City a few years ago.

Head coach Steve Cherundolo made over 300 appearances in the Bundesliga (all for Hannover 96 in a remarkable 15-year career at the club) so he's not blind to the reality of this situation.  But he will certainly do his utmost to prepare his team, who will be fired up for the occasion.

“I know our players are competitive, I know our players really want to be here, and I know our players want to show well, and we are prepared for this. But yes [...] it's very clear who the underdog is, and who the favourite is, but we feel fine with that, and we're comfortable with that. [We] try not to hope, we prepare and have plans for everything that can come our way.”

-Steve Cherundolo; source: ESPN

Previously: LAFC have only been in existence for eight years, so this is unsurprisingly our first ever game against them.  This is however the third straight year that we've played in Atlanta, after a 1-1 draw against Newcastle United in the Premier League Summer Series two years ago and a 3-0 win against Club América in a friendly last year.

Club World Cup

The head coaches of both FC Porto and Palmeiras, as well as the Brazilian wonderkid Estevao, criticised the turf at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on Sunday night following the draw between the two teams in the Club World Cup.

MetLife Stadium will host eight Club World Cup matches this summer, including both semi-finals and the final, before hosting the men's World Cup final next summer in a tournament which will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico.

Playing surfaces were a cause for complaint at last summer's Copa America in the U.S. and the Argentine head coach Lionel Scaloni described the field at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta as not being up to standard while goalkeeper Emi Martinez said it was a “disaster” and “like a trampoline.” Brown patches were also visible on the sides of the pitch at MetLife during last summer's tournament, which was organised by CONMEBOL rather than FIFA.

In a news conference following the 0-0 draw between Brazilian team Palmeiras and the Portuguese team FC Porto, the 18-year-old man of the match Estevao raised the pitch as a cause of concern.

Estevao, who has already agreed to join Premier League team Chelsea after this tournament, said: “I think the pitch should have been watered a little more as the ball was a little slow which interferes with the pace of the game. It was both for ourselves and for Porto. As the game went on, it rained which made it roll a bit faster.”

Over the past year, FIFA has studied which grass type would be best for MetLife, before deciding upon a “warm-season grass” it believed would endure the local conditions. The Athletic has previously reported that grass was grown at Tuckahoe Turf Farms, which is also responsible for the grass being grown for the men's World Cup in 2026.

The stadium, shared by the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets, usually has a synthetic turf but the FIFA competitions this year and next summer require natural grass. This week has been inconsistent in terms of weather, with boiling temperatures midweek before dropping closer to 60 degrees Fahrenheit over the weekend.

Abel Ferreira, the Palmeiras coach, said: “In the beginning, the pitch was dry. I don't know who is the patron saint for rain but after it rained it then enabled us to play our game.”

The Porto player Ze Pedro also said the pitch “could be better” while the Porto coach Martin Anselmi added: “I do feel like the pitch caused us to be a bit imprecise. This was particularly when we wanted to accelerate the game. There were some mistakes that happened (as a result) but the grass is the same for both teams. We had to adapt.”

Meanwhile, the Palmeiras coach also suggested that FIFA should consolidate fans within the lower rings of the stadium when attendances fall considerably below a sell-out during this tournament. This match had a creditable attendance of 46,275, largely made up of passionate Palmeiras fans and while the lower rings appeared close to full, supporters were scattered across three tiers which does not make for the best atmosphere. Some had flown in but the match also benefited from the Brazilian diaspora within the U.S.

Ferreira said: “The issue is the stadium is huge. Forty-six thousand is a big number but maybe they could have closed the third ring and placed everyone in the first and second (to bring it closer).. But with the amount of Palmeiras fans, it was like we were playing at home and this was a strength for Palmeiras. The stadium is too big but 46,000 is very good when people from Brazil and Portugal had to come and fly in and it's not so easy to do that.”

He declined to comment as to whether FIFA should look to reduce ticket prices further in order to make the game more accessible to a broader audience. FIFA did provide QR codes to fans attending the game on boards outside the stadium which offered 20 per cent discount on other group stage games being played at MetLife Stadium.

Thursday's fixture for Palmeiras against Al-Ahly at MetLife has now dropped down to $45 on Ticketmaster for standard admission while Tuesday's noon kick off between Borussia Dortmund and Fluminense is now down to $33 at the same venue.

SAN JOSE, Calif. — The surprise on Chris Richards' face said it all.

Told following the U.S. men's national team's resounding 5-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago on Sunday that three-year veteran Malik Tillman had scored his first two goals for the USMNT, Richards couldn't believe it.

"I had no idea," said the U.S. center back. "Malik, to be fair, he doesn't speak that much, so I wouldn't have known that. But that's crazy."

Tillman earned the first of his 20 international caps in 2022. One of the final cuts from the USMNT's 2022 World Cup roster, the German-born Bayern Munich product is coming off a career season with PSV Eindhoven, which he helped win the last two Dutch titles and advance to the knockout stage of the UEFA Champions League in consecutive seasons.

Despite missing a chunk of the 2024-25 campaign because of injury, he still managed to score 16 goals in 34 appearances for PSV last term. Still, he'd never found the net at international level until Sunday.

With most of the Americans' top stars — Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Antonee "Jedi" Robinson and Tim Weah among them — missing for various reasons this summer, this Gold Cup and the two tuneups before it represent an opportunity for others to make their mark. 

Tillman, who manned an attacking midfield role for coach Mauricio Pochettino against the Soca Warriors, has made the most of his opportunity so far. He was the best U.S. player in last weekend's 2-1 loss to Türkiye. On Sunday, he was even better — with the goals to show for it. The 23-year-old opened the scoring for the hosts 16 minutes in, then doubled his team's lead before halftime.

"I've been waiting for this moment for a long time," Tillman, his voice barely above a whisper as always, said after earning Man of the Match honors. "A lot of people have been waiting as well."

Given his pedigree, Tillman's quality has never been in doubt. But until Sunday, he had struggled to duplicate his form for PSV with the national team — in part because his path to logging regular minutes was blocked. Now, with fellow attackers like Pulisic, Weah and Gio Reyna absent, he has his first real chance to occupy a significant role at the international level.

The payoff has been a long time coming, both for Tillman and the USMNT 

"I understand him better now," said Pochettino, who replaced former coach Gregg Berhalter last September. "October, November, when we met for the first time, I think it was difficult to create this relationship that the player needs, and the coach needs, to trust each other," Pochettino said. "That is about time. Now, after a few weeks together, I really start to understand him, and he starts to understand us. 

"He's a fantastic kid," the former Chelsea, Tottenham and Paris Saint-Germain manager continued. "He's a talented player, one of the most talented players I think that we have in the USA."

Tillman wasn't the only player to stand out against T&T. Diego Luna assisted on Tillman's second goal, then set up the Americans' third when his low shot hit striker Patrick Agyemang and then the back of the net. Luca de la Torre, who made the U.S. roster for the last World Cup but didn't play in Qatar, bossed the midfield alongside newcomer Sebastian Berhalter. With two late helpers, fullback Max Arfsten rebounded from a poor performance in last week's 4-0 loss to Switzerland. Haji Wright, another 2022 vet, scored the Americans' fifth on Sunday in clinical fashion.

The victory simultaneously snapped a four-match losing skid and set the U.S. up well for its final two group games, against guest team Saudi Arabia and Haiti. (The Saudis beat the Haitians 1-0 in Sunday's nightcap).

"That is only one victory," Pochettino said. "Now we need to see the next one."

With the 2026 World Cup on home soil now less than a year away, the opportunity isn't lost on his players.

"It's the last tournament that we have before the World Cup," Tillman said. "So it's very important for us to show ourselves, to show that we are still there, that we're still a good team, even though some players are not here."

Nobody boosted their stock on Sunday as much as Tillman, who is finally beginning to show U.S. fans and players alike his personality, both on and off the field.

"From the outside, he's very quiet. But then once you get to know him he's a teddy bear," said Richards of Tillman, who he's known since both were playing in Bayern's reserve squad six years ago.

"When I first met him he didn't speak any English, and now he's playing for the national team," Richards added. "It's really amazing to not just see him develop as a player, but as a person. And he fully deserved two goals today. 

"He's a baller."

Seated on the steps in the late-afternoon sun along the west side of Lumen Field, Torri Murray watches the Sounders fans' march to the match walk past while he finishes his traditional pre-match bratwurst. His order includes grilled onions and yellow banana peppers.

Murray, who moved to Seattle from New Orleans less than two years ago, remains unconvinced by the proposition of adding cream cheese. 

“I haven't tried it yet,” he said. “That scares me. Cream cheese? I'll try it one day.”

Murray is one of the announced 30,151 fans who showed up to watch the Sounders fall 2-1 to Brazilian club Botafogo in Sunday's Club World Cup match. It's the first of six matches Seattle will host for the tournament. 

Murray, a Sounders season-ticket holder, held off on buying tickets to the match until Friday to avoid paying the high prices enforced by FIFA's dynamic-pricing model, but said he empathized with fans who bought tickets early only to see prices tumble. 

“I waited to buy and they still ended up expensive,” he said. “But this is a rare event to be coming here, so I just figured let me just blow the money and see it anyway. But it's stupid expensive. And you can probably tell from the crowd turnout, if you go on Ticketmaster right now, a lot of seats are still empty.” 

FIFA's dynamic pricing model factors demand into ticket cost, causing prices to plummet during the weeks before the tournament's opening. A 300-level ticket to Sunday's game cost more than $153 during the December presale period. Three days before the match, a 300-level ticket was just $62 after taxes and fees. 

Dynamic pricing will become even more relevant next summer, when Seattle hosts six games during the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Steve DeBroux, another Sounders fan, called the dynamic pricing “disappointing” and said it was making him rethink his strategy for buying World Cup tickets next year. DeBroux said this experience erased any thoughts he'd had about purchasing one of the World Cup hospitality packages being offered.

DeBroux's wariness following his Club World Cup ticketing experience, however, is countered by a simple desire to make sure he gets to see a World Cup game in Seattle. It was a similar sentiment echoed by Ben Allen-White, another Sounders season-ticket holder. 

Allen-White also bought Club World Cup tickets during the presale period before prices tumbled, but described himself as just mildly disappointed about the eventual outcome. He also still plans to buy World Cup tickets as early as possible, because he feels there will be more demand for that tournament and he doesn't want to miss it. 

“I'm going to be just as foolish next time, too,” he said. “But I think I'll be right that time. … I think I'm going to have to mortgage a home or something to get into any game there.”

The Sounders, in an attempt to placate frustrated fans, offered two free tickets to Sunday's game for anyone who'd purchased tickets through the club during the presale period. 

The Sounders tried to get free tickets from FIFA to each of their three games at Lumen Field as additional compensation for fans who bought the presale tickets, but were only able to get them for the Botafogo game, a source with knowledge of the situation said. The source added the Sounders were the only MLS club in the competition — which also includes LAFC and Inter Miami — that was able to negotiate free tickets as additional compensation. 

Those additional tickets allowed some extra fans to come to the match. Allycea Weil and Wayne Liou are more casual Sounders fans. They weren't planning to go until they received the tickets for free from a friend. Edward Liu, a five-year Sounders season-ticket holder, bought tickets for his family, including his wife and daughter. He used his two extra tickets to bring two of his daughter's soccer teammates to the game. 

“I appreciate that the Sounders stepped up to help us,” Liu said. 

While several fans said they appreciated the Sounders' effort to compensate them, others expressed concerns about the club's attitude toward the tournament. 

Weil, Liou, Allen-White and his brother Lawrence White, DeBroux and Jed Feltis, a season-ticket holder since 2009 — the club's first MLS season — all said they'd be more interested and invested in the tournament if the players received a larger share of the Club World Cup's prize money. 

Sounders players wore shirts emblazoned with the phrase “Club World Ca$h Grab” before their game against Minnesota United on June 1 to call attention to MLS owners refusal to formally negotiate about how the nearly $9.55 million prize pool each MLS club will earn for participating in the Club World Cup will be split with the players. Sounders owner Adrian Hanauer reportedly confronted players about wearing the shirts after the match. 

“I wish Hanauer would step behind the players and say ‘They deserve more,'” Feltis said. “This club has been the best club in the league. Keep it that way. Don't denigrate your players.”

SAN JOSE, Calif. (June 15, 2025) - Seeking an eighth Concacaf Gold Cup trophy, the United States Men's National Team kicked off its 2025 campaign on a resounding high note Sunday afternoon, winning the first match of group play with a 5-0 victory against Trinidad and Tobago at PayPal Park in San Jose, Calif., behind an energetic team performance that will build momentum into the next two group stage matches.

Like Mauricio Pochettino's lineups for the June friendlies, tonight's starting XI was relatively inexperienced in global competition. The lineup Sunday averaged 15 caps and seven in official competition. Leading the group was the oldest and most capped player, Tim Ream. The 37-year-old was the only U.S. starter with previous Gold Cup experience, and the reliable defender captained the side.

The team's Gold Cup opener Sunday marked significant milestones for several players in the starting XI. Midfielder Sebastian Berhalter, defender Alex Freeman and goalkeeper Matt Freese all earned their first caps in official competition. Midfielder Jack McGlynn also collected his first start in official competition. Every player in the starting XI besides Ream made their Gold Cup debuts.

Trinidad and Tobago began the match sitting in a deep block, which allowed the United States to control possession and play some exciting soccer. Malik Tillman, making his first competitive start since the Concacaf Nations League semifinal in 2024, was especially effective distributing from the middle channel of the field. His lovely one-touch pass into space for Patrick Agyemang led to the first shot attempt of the match. Moments later, the midfielder was part of a beautiful combination that eventually led to a disciplined, one-touch strike from Sebastian Berhalter that was on frame but deflected out-of-bounds for a U.S. corner kick.

Agyemang would have another good look at goal in the 12th minute. After the U.S. shifted the ball side-to-side, Max Arfsten got wide and made a nifty stepover move before sending a scintillating ball into the box. Agyemang nodded a fierce header toward the far post, but it bounced just wide.

After having their way in the opening minutes, the Americans found the finishing touch for the first goal of the match. Agyemang won the ball deep in the Americans' attacking third and played it ahead to McGlynn to his right. With Trinidad and Tobago disorganized, the winger located an unmarked Tillman toward the far post. Tillman controlled the cross and finished it off with his right foot for his first international goal to put the United States ahead in the 16th minute.

The United States would've scored a second goal earlier if not for the heroics of Trinidad and Tobago's goalkeeper Marvin Phillip, including a diving save on Arfsten's right-footed shot taken from the center of the box. In the 25th minute, McGlynn played a terrific 40-yard ball across the field on a rope to Diego Luna. With space, the native of nearby Sunnyvale, Calif. took a good first touch, but Phillip won the battle, leaving his line swiftly to block Luna's attempted chip. Again, in the 36th minute, after a hard foul gave the United States a free kick, Phillip stopped Alex Freeman's header from McGlynn's left-footed service.

Tillman would make it 2-0 for the United States in the 41st minute after the Americans capitalized on a mistake from Trinidad and Tobago. Alvin Jones attempted to get out of pressure with a pass back to his goalkeeper, but he didn't see Luna in the area. The 21-year-old midfielder anticipated the pass perfectly, using his speed to regain possession for the United States. On the breakaway, Luna sent a rolling ball along the six-yard box line to Tillman, making a dead sprint into the box, who hammered it home to record a first-half brace.

Luna, showing his relentless work rate all throughout the first half, would soon record his second assist in three minutes.Tillman played a long ball out of the USA's defensive half deep into space for Luna, and the midfielder, fresh off assisting Tillman's second goal, decided to take it himself this time. He eluded his defender on the dribble inside the box and struck a low ball with his right foot that deflected off Agyemang and found the back of the net, and the USA led 3-0 heading into the halftime break.

Playing with a three-goal lead did not mean the United States would sit back in the second half. In the 50th minute, McGlynn nearly capitalized following a cross from Arfsten. Moments later, Agyemang used his physicality and speed to create a chance for himself, a smashing strike that required a push over the crossbar from Philip, his fifth of six saves on the day.

Trinidad and Tobago nearly got on the scoresheet in the 58th minute when Tyrese Spicer dribbled into dangerous territory and took a shot that was headed toward goal. The play called Matt Freese into action, and the United States goalkeeper, making just his second career appearance, came up with a crucial touch to preserve his clean sheet. Other than that play, and a flurry in the USA's defensive half in the 36th minute, Trinidad and Tobago never tested the United States, and the Americans piled up a 21-3 shot advantage.

Pochettino sent on subs for three of the match's biggest contributors. Haji Wright, Brenden Aaronson, and Mark McKenzie replaced Agyemang, Luna, and McGlynn.

Those substitutes added two more goals for the United States late in the match. Making a run, Aaronson received the ball at the end line and made a decisive cut with the outside of his right foot to set up his shot. The midfielder hit the ball hard to secure his ninth career goal, his first goal in almost two years for the United States, in the 82nd minute.

Just two minutes later, Wright added a goal of his own. Receiving the ball from Arfsten, Wright carried the ball into the center of the pitch, finding space with his speed and fresh legs. Putting the ball on his right foot, he curled the ball into the side netting for the fifth goal of the day as the United States ran up the score to 5-0.

The win places the United States solely atop Group D for the moment, with Saudi Arabia and Haiti set to face off later Sunday night. The outcome follows Saturday's tournament opener, where defending Gold Cup champion Mexico beat Dominican Republic 3-2 at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif.

The United States will carry the momentum from Sunday's win to Texas for their remaining group stages matches. The team will next face guest side Saudi Arabia on Thursday, June 19 at Q2 Stadium in Austin, Texas (9:15 p.m. ET; FS1, TUDN, ViX, FDP Radio) and conclude group play Sunday, June 22 against Haiti at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas (7 p.m. ET; FOX, TUDN, ViX, FDP Radio). 

USA – MALIK TILLMAN (JACK MCGLYNN), 16th minute: Following two shot attempts of his own, Patrick Agyemang produced a takeaway that ignited a quick United States counter. Agyemang sent the ball ahead to Jack McGlynn, who crossed the ball far post to Malik Tillman. The midfielder brought it down and put it away for his first international goal. USA 1, TRI 0

USA – MALIK TILLMAN (DIEGO LUNA), 41st minute: Diego Luna took advantage of a costly mistake from Trinidad and Tobago when he intercepted a pass back to the goalkeeper. Luna took possession and slid a rolling pass across the face of the goal for Tillman, sprinting into the box. The midfielder finished it off to record his second international goal and first brace. USA 2, TRI 0

USA – PATRICK AGYEMANG (DIEGO LUNA), 44th minute: Fresh off assisting Tillman's second goal, Luna tallied one more. Receiving a long ball up into space on the left side of the pitch, Luna carried the ball and beat his defender one-on-one. Luna's shot deflected off Agyemang and into the back of the net. USA 3, TRI 0

USA – BRENDEN AARONSON (MAX ARFSTEN), 82nd minute: Moments after entering the match as a substitute, Brenden Aaronson received a pass from Max Arfsten near the end line. Aaronson beat his defender one-on-one and delivered a right-footed shot near post to extend the lead for the United States. USA 4, TRI 0

USA – HAJI WRIGHT (MAX ARFSTEN), 84th minute: Max Arfsten found success working the right side of the pitch. Just after assisting Aaronson's goal, he found Wright making a run on the right side. Wright did the rest, beating his defender and carrying the ball centrally to set up his curling shot into the upper right corner of the net. USA 5, TRI 0 FINAL.

U.S. Men's National Team boss Mauricio Pochettino isn't letting a single player “dictate the plan” he has for the American squad, even if that player is Christian Pulisic. 

The ongoing controversy surrounding Pulisic's absence from the squad after deciding not to play in this summer's Gold Cup has been the focal point of American soccer. 

It's led to a number of former USMNT players, most notably Landon Donovan, to criticise Pulisic, who has said he's taking a step back after a grueling season with his club team, AC Milan.

Pulisic added to the controversy when he appeared on CBS Sports Golazo Network last week and revealed that he had wanted to play in a pair of exhibition matches before the Gold Cup, but Pochettino declined the request, wanting to play the same squad all summer. 

The American soccer star said he had understood that it was a “coach's decision” and that “I fully respect that,” but Pulisic added that he “didn't understand it.” 

That didn't seem to bother Pochettino. 

“Players don't need to understand,” Pochettino said, according to Fox Sports. “Players need to listen and to stick with our plan. They cannot dictate the plan.

“He explained why he only wanted to be involved in two games and not the Gold Cup, and I respect that. I understand him. But I do need that he understands our decision. When I signed my contract with the [U.S. Soccer] Federation, I am the head coach. I am not a mannequin.”

The dynamic between the new USMNT head coach and one of the biggest stars on the team in Pulisic has added to the already concerning issues surrounding the program as it prepares for the World Cup next year and continues to struggle on the pitch more recently. 

A loss to Switzerland last week sent the US into the Gold Cup on a down note, but it rebounded by beating Trinidad and Tobago 5-0 in its group stage opener on Sunday. 

Pulisic had noted in his interview that he had only had one conversation with Pochettino, but the coach brushed that aside, asserting that he tries to maintain the same level of communication with all his players. 

“I love to be in communication with my players,” he said. “I love to communicate, but at the same time, I want to [ensure] that all the players feel the same respect from the coaching staff and from myself.”

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

Dino Prizmic took a few weeks off after winning Zagreb, but had no issues finding that form in Bratislava to pick up his 10th win in a row. Tristan Schoolkate is nearing a Top 100 debut, while Joao Lucas Reis da Silva was flawless in his campaign for a maiden title in Santa Fe. Read up on last week's action:

Jack Pinnington Jones was already a factor during last year's grass season, posting a massive win over Cameron Norrie in Nottingham. The 22-year-old, who plays college tennis for the same school that Norrie once did (Texas Christian University), went even further in his 6th pro appearance of the season. While no singular upset was as huge as the one from last year, he posted wins over strong grass-courters like Mikhail Kukushkin, Billy Harris, and former Wimbledon junior champion Shintaro Mochizuki.

Tristan Schoolkate won just one match in his next four events after reaching the final in Guangzhou at the start of May, with his grass campaign starting with a loss to Nicolas Jarry in Birmingham. His hyper-aggressive style of play led to some wild matches in Ilkley as well, but this time he was coming out on top in these encounters. That included coming back from 1-3 down in sets 2 and 3 against Harold Mayot and surviving a deciding set tie-break against Sho Shimabukuro to make his first grass Challenger final.

The hyper-aggressive plays of Schoolkate were often a double-edged sword with the Australian serve-and-volleying on second delivery at 8-all in the first set tie-break. It didn't pan out, but over the course of the match dictating the low of the proceedings turned out to be an asset. The player putting on more pressure was Schoolkate, who eventually claimed his 3rd Challenger title 6-7(8) 6-4 6-3 and now finds himself just 40 points outside the Top 100. Both finalists are featuring in Ilkley next week.

After going 16-2 on the ITF Tour since the start of the season, Nerman Fatic recently reached a Challenger final in Skopje. He came from the qualifying there before only losing to Jay Clarke and also had to work his way into the main draw in Perugia. The most important win of this run had him save 2 match points to fight his way back into the match against Oriol Roca Batalla from 3-6 2-5 down. The whole affair lasted 3 hours and 27 minutes.

Andrea Pellegrino had the best week of his career in Estoril about a month ago, defeating World No. 19 Felix Auger-Aliassime on the way to the final. The Italian had gone a bit quiet since, but was able to find his groove after a gritty win from 4-6 1-3 down against Gabriele Piraino. Pellegrino faced four consecutive compatriots on the way to the final and the difficulty level was gradually increasing. From Piraino it went to Federico Bondioli, then Francesco Passaro, and eventually Luca Nardi.

Once Pellegrino catches fire, he gets very tough to stop. Fatic had to try to keep him off-rhythm, but the clean ball from the Italian was still a major issue. To make matters worse, the Bosnian cramped up in the second set and Pellegrino expertly erased a 0-40 deficit at 3-all to avoid getting in trouble. Soon after, he claimed his 4th Challenger title 6-2 6-4 and is now back to career-high No. 136. This week he's playing in Poznan, while Fatic will be trying to keep up his good momentum in Sassuolo.

Valentin Royer slowed down recently after his incredible achievements in March/April when he was in the semifinals of five consecutive Challengers, winning two of them and making a further final. Getting back on track took some impressive resilience as the Frenchman was down a set in three consecutive matches to begin the event. He fought through all of that before ending the run of 2022 champion and No. 1 seed Alexander Shevchenko to reach his 4th final of the season.

Dino Prizmic was the champion in Zagreb recently and didn't play again until Bratislava. Despite being able to produce a high level sporadically over the past year or so, the Croat kept battling various physical issues and couldn't combine his good performances into runs. That situation might be handled now as Prizmic was in phenomenal form all week, not dropping more than four games in a set on the way to the final. That included quality wins over Henrique Rocha or Cristian Garin.

Prizmic lost to Royer in Zadar in March, getting bullied by the Frenchman's consistent depth and pace off both wings. The patterns of play weren't that different in this encounter, but this time the 19-year-old had more to stand up to his opponent with. A mammoth second set (around 80 minutes) decided the match as Royer blew a 6-3 lead in the tie-break with Prizmic taking his 3rd Challenger title 6-4 7-6(6). He returns to the Top 200 and will now play Sassuolo, while the runner-up quickly switches to grass in Nottingham.

Marco Trungelliti had recently reached a couple of Challenger semifinals in Zagreb and Heilbronn, so going a round further seemed like a natural step that would happen for him soon. The 35-year-old needed to use his experience to turn matches around against Ivan Gakhov and Dimitar Kuzmanov, before defeating Clement Tabur to reach his first final in just over a year (Vicenza 2024). And that's despite Gakhov seemingly having him on the ropes at 6-2 3-1.

Daniel Merida had only one Challenger quarterfinal to his name before last week, losing to Francesco Passaro in Maia in November. But the Spanish youngster had long been considered a prospect and with two stacked ITF titles claimed this season, it was time to produce something at the higher level. Players like Kyrian Jacquet or Luca Van Assche had no answer to his game with only Henri Squire coming any close as Merida reached his first Challenger final.

Trungelliti had a 3-11 record in Challenger finals and while he was dominating for 90% of the match on Sunday, these nerves presented themselves eventually. Merida was able to run away with the second set but was once more under pressure in the decider, miraculously keeping himself in it on a few occasions. Trungelliti finally converted his 12th match point to claim his 4th Challenger title 6-3 4-6 6-3 and took a special exempt for Nottingham (on grass), while Merida sticks to the dirt in Royan.

Joao Lucas Reis da Silva recently won an M25 title in Coquimbo and entered this event with a lot of confidence. The Brazilian has been known for his yearly week of peak performance, losing all three Challenger finals previously contested at 2022 Ambato, 2023 Coquimbo, and 2024 Florianopolis. But his ceiling has always been very high and didn't drop more than four games in a set on the way to his 4th final at this level, including a strong win over defending champion Andrea Collarini.

Lautaro Midon had been looking for a Challenger breakthrough himself, reaching three quarterfinals this season and losing to Matheus Pucinelli de Almeida in back-to-back wins in Brazil recently. His matches were a bit more competitive than Reis da Silva's, but he also didn't drop a set on the way to the Santa Fe final. Santiago Rodriguez Taverna took him to a tie-break in the quarterfinals, while Dali Blanch had absolutely nothing to say as Midon outfoxed him in the final four.

Midon will have his shots at Challenger titles in the future, but this was simply the week of Reis da Silva and there was nothing anybody could do about that. The Brazilian kept up his incredible standard of play from the previous encounters and while he could have closed it out a bit more efficiently, he still claimed his 1st Challenger title 6-4 6-3. Both players will stay in South America to play Santa Cruz this week.

Luca Nardi (Nottingham) was supposed to be the only Top 100 player in action, but pulled out after the draw was made.

Today, he is vying for a spot in the U.S. Open.

Kim, who now competes for Ohio State University, will take on Michael Zheng of Columbia University at 5 p.m. June 16 in a wild card playoff at the USTA National Campus in Orlando, Florida, with the event streamed live from the USTA National Campus website.

“At this level, it's hard with very small margins, every match is pretty close,” Kim said June 13, just hours before boarding a plane for Florida. “But I have known (Zheng) for a while, we've trained together. We're friends, but the court is a little different, especially for what we are playing for.”

This is the first time the USTA is hosting a wild card collegiate event for the U.S. Open, Kim said. The event, held June 16-18, features the four top-ranked American men and four top-ranked women in single-elimination play, as well as men's and women's doubles teams.Kim, 20, was an at-large selection to the field of four men, and not the only Michigan native. Ozan Baris of Okemos, who plays tennis at Michigan State University, earned a spot by reaching the final of the NCAA men's single tournament in November.

Kim is ranked 4th in the U.S. and 8th in the world in men's collegiate tennis, making good on the promise he first showed as a youngster in Michigan. Back in 2016, at just 12-years-old, he was a top-ranked junior player, scoring an invite to play at the Orange Bowl.

At that time, Kim, who has been playing tennis “since I could hold a racket,” was coached by his father Andrew, a former professional tennis player. He trained five hours a day while doing a mix of in-person and online schooling, and he favored clay courts.

Nearly a decade later, Kim is almost a foot taller at 6'3, prefers hard courts, and is under the tutelage of Ohio State coaches after transferring from the University of Florida.

“A main part of this is my college coaches,” said Kim, who is majoring in sports industry at OSU and entering his junior year this fall. “When I transferred, my level definitely jumped. I couldn't be more grateful. They are constantly working with me and helping my game.”

Kim trains for two hours every morning and another two hours in the afternoon, with daily hourlong gym workouts. Weekends are “more relaxed.”

Even with a grueling schedule, he says he has always enjoyed tennis and his dreams remain the same — to be a professional tennis player, compete in the Olympics, and to play in the U.S. Open.

He is now just a few steps, and perhaps aces, away from making the U.S. Open dream come true.

“I play pretty aggressive from the baseline, but my serve is a main focus,” Kim said. “I'm more of an all-court type player, but the serve is a big aspect in my game. I plan on hitting a lot of aces.”

If Kim wins the June 16 match, he will be guaranteed a spot in the qualifying rounds of the U.S. Open and could secure a berth in the world's biggest tournament with a win on June 18.“The determination to win always comes with nerves, but in high pressure situations, I embrace it a little easier,” said Kim, whose parents, Andrew and Alice Kim, now Orlando residents, will be on hand to watch their son play. “Coming into the match for the playoffs, I don't want to lose because of nerves, or being passive or tentative. I just want to play my game, so it's easier to reflect on, whether I win or lose.”

Rafael Nadal has opened up about his experience watching the thrilling French Open final as a spectator this month.

The match, which saw Carlos Alcaraz triumph over Jannik Sinner in a nail-biting 4-6, 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 7-6 victory after fending off three match points, had fans worldwide on the edge of their seats, including Nadal. Fellow tennis legend John McEnroe, who recently named the only player he'd pay to watch, hit the headlines during the French Open for turning up late for live TV coverage.

Known as the 'King of Clay' for his dominance at Roland Garros, where he won 14 of his 22 Grand Slam titles, Nadal observed the Paris tournament for the first time since hanging up his racket last year. Despite the intense action, Nadal insists he felt no longing to be back on the court.

He said: "I don't feel like I would have liked to be there.

"I watched the tournament like any other fan, excited to see a place that was so important during my career and simply enjoying the tennis.

"This is my new reality, I don't look beyond that."

While attending a charity golf event in Spain, Nadal acknowledged being captivated by Alcaraz's comeback from a two-set deficit.

He praised his fellow Spaniard's fifth Grand Slam win but cautioned that it's not guaranteed that Alcaraz and Sinner will maintain their dominance in the sport.

"It was a match for the ages," he said. "I'm very happy for Carlos.

"It was a spectacular final, very exciting. Ending up with the cup after Sinner was so close to taking it for so long, I'm very happy for him.

"There will be Grand Slam champions every year, and each of them will tread their own path.

"New stars will always appear, and here we have two of them. They are two players who are head and shoulders above the rest at the moment."

This win cements Alcaraz and Sinner's dominance in the sport, as they have now taken home the last six Grand Slam tournaments between them, a streak that started in September 2023 when Novak Djokovic won the U.S. Open.

Djokovic, who is chasing a record-extending 25th Grand Slam title, will look to end Alcaraz and Sinner's dominance at either Wimbledon or the U.S. Open later this year.

Taylor Fritz has only just won his first ATP title of the 2025 season at the BOSS Open in Stuttgart.

Fritz beat Alexander Zverev to win the ATP 250 tournament in Stuttgart for the first time in his career.

This has enabled the American to return to world number four in the ATP rankings, bouncing back after Fritz lost in the first round of Roland Garros.

While this is a positive sign of where Fritz's game is heading, he has now admitted that he has some limitations.

Before Fritz beat Zverev in the Stuttgart final, he spoke on WTA player Caroline Garcia's Tennis Insider Podcast.

During this conversation, Fritz was asked about his game and what he thinks he does well, as well as what he thinks he could improve.

In his response, Fritz praised his mental resilience, but claimed that he was a bit limited in his shot selection and wished he had more variety in his game.

“Yeah, I think one of my best abilities on the court is my mind and thinking, and I think I think really well on the court,” said Fritz.

“I wish I could do…I wish I had more shots so I could do more things I'm somewhat limited and all the different strategies and stuff I can do, because I have to play, at least in some way play to my game.

“But yeah, I never want a coach to just tell me something, and I just blindly listen. I want to understand why they're saying that and then maybe some situations, once we like talk it through, I still decide that I think my way of thinking is the right way to do it.”

Fritz will not have much time to celebrate his Stuttgart victory, as he is playing in both singles and doubles, with Jiri Lehecka, at the Queen's Club Championships.

The 27-year-old achieved his best result at Queen's last year by reaching the quarter-finals, but will want to go even further as the third seed in 2025.

Fritz's first round opponent at the ATP 500 tournament will be qualifier Corentin Moutet, in a first-time meeting between the pair.

If he is able to match his result at Queen's from last year, Fritz could potentially play fifth seed Alex de Minaur or his doubles partner Lehecka.

Jack Draper is a potential semi-final opponent for Fritz, and he would only play Carlos Alcaraz if both players reach the final.

It's been a very tough season for Hubert Hurkacz. The Pole has been struggling to find the desired consistency and has been dealing with back issues since Miami. This was the reason he had to withdraw from the competition last week in Den Bosch and has led to his last-minute withdrawal from ATP Halle 2025. Hurkacz, who was on the same side of the draw as Jannik Sinner (potentially meeting in the quarterfinals), will lose the runner-up points from last season and, most importantly, will arrive at Wimbledon 2025 without being a seeded player. This makes him (assuming he's physically fit) one of the opponents to avoid in the first round. One more tough opponent to face in the draw of the third Grand Slam of the year.

In 2022, Nick Kyrgios had his greatest ever run at a Grand Slam, making the final of Wimbledon, where he met Novak Djokovic. 

Kyrgios had enjoyed a career-best campaign at the championships, earning wins over Stefanos Tsitsipas, Brandon Nakashima and Cristian Garin to advance to the semi-finals of the tournament.

Scheduled to play Rafael Nadal in the final four, the Australian automatically advanced to the final after the Spaniard withdrew from the event prior to the match due to injury.

Having only reached the quarter-finals at majors previously, which he achieved in Melbourne and London earlier in his career, the match was the first Grand Slam final Kyrgios had made.

It was also the first time an Australian man had made the final of Wimbledon since 2003, a feat that Kyrgios said, prior to the clash with Djokovic, wasn't celebrated by tennis greats from his home nation. 

In his pre-final press conference, when asked about potentially joining the list of his compatriots to become champion at Wimbledon, Kyrgios said: “As for the greats of Australian tennis, they haven't always been the nicest to me personally. 

“They haven't always been supportive, and they havent been supportive these two weeks.

“So it's hard for me to read things that they say about me, when, for instance, when I saw Ashleigh Barty in the final of the Australian I was nothing but happy, and I would never say a bad word about an Australian making a final, like that's just mean.

“The only great that's been supportive of me the whole time has been Lleyton Hewitt. He's our Davis Cup captain, and he kind of knows that I do my own thing; he knows to keep his distance and let me do me.

“He sends me a message here and there [saying] ‘keep going', but it's pretty sad because I don't get any support from any of the other Australian tennis players; not the players, I mean, the past greats. 

“It's weird, they just have a sick obsession with just tearing me down for some reason. Whether they don't like me, or whether they're afraid, like, I don't know.

“It sucks because if it was roles reversed, and I saw de Minaur in the final or Jordan Thompson, I'd be pumped, I'd be stoked, I'd be having a pint watching and going nuts. 

“So shoutout to Lleyton I guess.”

Since his campaign at the All England Club in 2022, Kyrgios has only played in two Grand Slam events due to injuries he has sustained in recent years.

After ultimately losing to Djokovic in the Wimbledon final, he entered the US Open later that season, where he made the quarter-finals. 

He lost to Karen Khachanov over five sets in the last eight at Flushing Meadows, which would be the last match at a major he would play for over two years. 

Kyrgios' next, and most recent, appearance at a Grand Slam was at the Australian Open this year, where he crashed out in the first round to Britain's Jacob Fearnley. 

Despite announcing earlier in the season that he would play at Wimbledon, the former world number 13 has since withdrawn from the championships after another injury setback.

US Open Fan Week 2025 returns from 18 to 23 August, offering free access to the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York, with a packed schedule of matches, player practices and fan activities. While general entry is free, select events will require a paid ticket or Fan Access Pass.

The heart of Fan Week lies in the US Open Qualifying Tournament, which kicks off on a Monday, 18 August. Over the course of four days, 128 men and 128 women will compete for a place in the main US Open draw. Matches begin at 11 a.m., with gates opening an hour earlier.

In addition to the qualifying rounds, fans will have the chance to witness some of the biggest names in tennis fine-tuning their game during practice sessions, many of which take place inside Arthur Ashe Stadium. Access to these sessions, however, will require a free Fan Access Pass, which can be obtained through the US Open app.

The week also features a variety of ticketed events, most notably the Stars of the Open showcase, scheduled for Thursday, 21 August at 7 p.m. This event combines tennis with entertainment, often featuring appearances by former champions and celebrities. Families will also be drawn to Arthur Ashe Kids' Day on Saturday, 23 August, which includes on-court activities and live performances tailored for younger audiences.

While the majority of Fan Week remains free and open to the public, tickets are required for certain headline events. Fans can purchase tickets for featured matches and exhibitions directly via the official US Open website.

For enhanced access, the Fan Access Pass allows entry into select stadium areas, including Ashe practice sessions and reserved seating zones. Registration for the 2025 pass is now open, and all adults are required to register individually — even if they've held a pass in previous years. Children may accompany a registered adult without needing their own pass.

Once registered, fans will receive a QR code via email or can retrieve it by logging into the Fan Access Hub.

Visitors are encouraged to arrive early, especially on the opening days of the tournament. With matches and events beginning at 11 a.m., arriving shortly after gates open at 10 a.m. provides the best chance to secure seating and avoid queues.

Fans are also advised to download the official US Open app, which includes the full event schedule, player practice times, and ticketing information. With warm weather expected in New York during August, appropriate sun protection, hydration and comfortable clothing are also essential.

With free entry, early glimpses of top-ranked players, and engaging off-court experiences, US Open Fan Week 2025 offers a rare opportunity to enjoy Grand Slam tennis without the premium price tag. Whether attending as a dedicated follower of the sport or bringing the family for a summer outing, the event remains a unique and accessible way to experience one of tennis's greatest stages.

For updates, ticketing and registration, visit the official US Open Fan Week website.

No one must be happier that the clay season is over than USA's Taylor Fritz.

After enduring a torrid time on the red dirt and crashing out in the first round of the French Open to Germany's Daniel Altmaier, Taylor Fritz rediscovered his missing form to capture his fourth ATP Tour title on grass and ninth overall on Sunday at the BOSS Open in Stuttgart, where he defeated World No. 3 Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6(0).

Thanks to the win, Fritz, who has now won his past five meetings against Zverev, will return to No. 4 in the ATP Rankings on Monday, overtaking British lefty Jack Draper following his triumph. 

Fritz's performance in Stuttgart was so much more impressive, judging from the fact that he did not drop a set all week at the ATP 250 event in Germany and became the first player to lift a tour-level trophy without losing serve since Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in Basel last October.

By winning in Stuttgart, Fritz recorded his fourth career title on grass, putting him level alongside Matteo Berrettini and Nicolas Mahut. Only Novak Djokovic has more titles on grass (8) among active players. 

At the Queen's Club in London, the 37-year-old Tatjana Maria proved that age is just a number for her as she became the oldest champion on tour since Serena Williams in 2020, when she blew away four top 20 players to capture her first WTA 500 title at the HSBC Championships.

Maria even came through the qualification to earn her ticket for the tournament, but went from strength to strength and capped off an amazing week of upsets to capture the title on Sunday with a 6-3, 6-4 final victory over No. 8 seed Amanda Anisimova of the United States. 

Another qualifier, Elena-Gabriela Ruse, made it all the way to the final in 's-Hertogenbosch but had no answer to the power of Belgium's Elise Mertens in the final.

Mertens, who enjoyed plenty of support from friends and family in the final as 's-Hertogenbosch is only about an hour-and-a-half by car from Mertens' Belgian hometown of Leuven, won 6-3, 7-6(4) to secure her 10th career WTA singles title.

The win was the Belgian's second on tour this year after she won the WTA 250 in Singapore in February. She was also runner-up in Hobart at the start of the season in Australia.

Czech tennis star Karolina Muchova is currently going through a challenging period in her career. Following a disappointing loss at Roland Garros where she was defeated by the USA's Alycia Parks, Muchova crashed out of the 1/8-finals at Queen's to the champion Maria. 

Muchova has revealed she might need to undergo another surgery due to persistent pain in her left wrist, a procedure that could sideline the world No. 13 again for several months.

Wrist problems continue to be an everlasting problem on the ATP and WTA Tours and should certainly not be underestimated. Just look at former Grand Slam winner Dominic Thiem, who never recovered his form and chose to retire after persistent wrist problems. 

Injuries have continued to disrupt Muchova's momentum throughout the season, raising questions if she will be able to recover her consistency which saw her reach the French Open final in 2023 and propelled her to a career-high ranking of No. 8 in September 2023.

"I treated my right wrist conservatively for half a year and then I had surgery anyway. That is always the last option for me, I don't want to have it. I will try some alternative solutions, but if they don't work, I will have to go back to the operating room," says Muchova.

Elise Mertens launched one of the most improbable comebacks in recent WTA history on Saturday at the Libéma Open in 's-Hertogenbosch, when she managed to save no less than 11 match points in her 2-6, 7-6(7), 6-4 victory over Ekaterina Alexandrova in the semi-final.

According to the WTA, it is the most match points saved by a player in a main-draw match in the 2020s. They all came in the second set, and 10 of the 11 came with Mertens serving.

"I didn't even know it was 11, after one or two I lost count," Mertens said, after her comeback. "I was very focused on the game, which, of course, I like that about me, that I just keep going."

"It was a difficult match, I think she started really well, and it was 6-2, 5-3 for her. I just stayed with my head in the game and gave everything I had. Especially in the third set, I felt like, ‘OK, this is maybe my opportunity.' So I'm very happy I took that chance."

Canada's Gabriel Diallo captured his first ATP Tour title at the Libema Open in the Netherlands on Sunday, when the 23-year-old from Montreal defeated Belgium's Zizou Bergs 7-5, 7-6(8). Diallo sealed the win with a superb backhand cross-court winner after a spectacular rally with the Belgian. 

It's not easy to complete a lob over the 1.98 metres tall Alexander Zverev, but Brandon Nakashima still managed to accomplish the virtually impossible challenge when he faced the German during last week's tournament in Stuttgart. 

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz will be back on grass for the first time this season at ATP 500 events in Halle and London, respectively.

World No. 1 Sinner leads an impressive field at the Terra Wortmann Open in Germany, where spectators will also enjoy the chance to see Alexander Zverev, Daniil Medvedev and Joao Fonseca in action. Sinner heads into the tournament as defending champion at the ATP 500 event, after beating Hubert Hurkacz in the final 12 months ago. 

At the HSBC Championships in London, Alcaraz is the main attraction in a draw that also features British No. 1 Jack Draper and Top 10 stars Taylor Fritz and Holger Rune.

On the WTA Tour, nine of the top 10 players in the WTA singles rankings will compete at the year's second WTA 500 grass-court event, the Berlin Tennis Open while the WTA 250 event at Lexus Nottingham Open features 32 singles players aiming to to get their grass court preparation just right before Wimbledon starts in two weeks time.

It was a scorching week in Umbria, and even though Sunday's singles final of the 10th edition of the Internazionali di Tennis Città di Perugia | G.I.Ma. Tennis Cup didn't get underway until 8:30pm, temperatures in Perugia were still above 30 degrees Celsius. But the conditions seemed to suit Andrea Pellegrino perfectly. The 28-year-old Italian dropped just one set on his way to claiming his fourth career title on the ATP Challenger Tour.Under the lights on Center Court at Tennis Club Perugia, Pellegrino defeated Bosnian qualifier Nerman Fatic 6-2, 6-4. World No. 173 Pellegrino dominated most of the rallies from the baseline, saved all three break points he faced, and broke Fatic's serve three times.Midway through the second set, Pellegrino also benefited from an apparent injury to Fatic, and one hour and 35 minutes of play, he emerged victorious.

“I am really happy, as I lost a few finals before,” Pellegrino told Tennis.com. “I came here with different expectations. I played well the entire week and I am really happy to win the title.”Pellegrino only dropped the very first set of the week against Italian qualifier Gabriele Piraino. From then on, the Bisceglie native enjoyed a fantastic run of form. “The first match was really tough. I didn't play well in the beginning. But I took the opportunity to win this match and afterwards my level increased match by match.“Winning the title here in Perugia is very special. I really like the tournament. It's my seventh time here and I always played well but couldn't win it. But I am a different player now and I am really happy.”

Schoolkate claimed his third ATP Challenger Tour career title."It's fantastic - I enjoy the grass - it's the biggest title I've won,“ Schoolkate said. „I thought I started pretty well - the crowd got behind him. The conditions were very tough, with the wind, and we struggled a little bit on our serves.

Trungelliti triumphs in LyonMarco Trungelliti of Argentina captured his first title of the season by lifting the trophy of the Open Sopra Steria in Lyon, France. The No. 8 seed of the ATP Challenger 100 clay-court event outlasted Spaniard Daniel Merida 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 in the singles final. It's his fourth ATP Challenger Tour career crown and first since the Rwanda Challenger in Kigali last March."I'm quite happy with the way I played and, above all, with the mental approach I had during the match," said Trungelliti after his win. "I was very close to taking the second set, I had a break point at 4-2 to serve for 5-2 and suddenly, he started playing really well. At that moment, I felt a bit overwhelmed. Maybe I made one or two mistakes when serving at 5-4, but nothing major that would justify such a drop in rhythm."Then, in the third set, he started a little slower, just like he did at the end of the previous set, and that gave me some breathing room. I stayed calm and felt that, at some point, either I would play better on the match points or he would eventually miss, which is what happened in the end."

The players on the WTA Tour are now gearing up for Wimbledon, with the Nottingham Open providing a final warm-up chance for some players. 

It's been a frantic period for the players, with the French Open being won by Coco Gauff, who defeated Aryna Sabalenka in the final at Roland Garros. 

This morning, players are receiving news of the latest update on the world rankings, with the top four positions the ones to be had ahead of Wimbledon. 

Players will want to avoid other members of the top four before the semi-final stage and with that in mind, there is positive news for Qinwen Zheng. 

However, Iga Swiatek won't like what she's seeing this morning…

Zheng reached the semi-final at Queen's last week, defeating Emma Raducanu along the way, before losing to Amanda Anisimova. 

The 22-year-old managed to reach the last eight at the French Open before losing to Sabalenka and it does feel as though she's close to a maiden Grand Slam. 

Zheng's form of late appears to have handed her a huge boost ahead of Wimbledon, with the player now edging into the top four. 

The talented player reached the final of the Australian Open and the WTA Tour Finals last year but has never gone to the second week at Wimbledon. 

Swiatek is striving for a bit of consistency and her semi-final defeat to Sabalenka at the French Open ended her dominant streak of titles at that event. 

Now, she will go into Wimbledon clinging on to her place in the world's top 10, with her form in 2025 doing little to help her ranking. 

As the saying goes, however, form is temporary and class is permanent, with Swiatek more than capable of going all the way at Wimbledon. 

The new ranking won't help her cause, but perhaps there is a chance now for her to slip under the radar and catch some of the top players cold at Wimbledon.

Tennis icon Rafael Nadal has made an honest admission after watching the epic French Open final as a fan this month. Nadal was one of millions around the world captivated by the epic contest between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, which the Spaniard won 4-6 6-7(4) 6-4 7-6(3) 7-6(2) after saving three match points.

Dubbed the ‘King of Clay', 14 of Nadal's 22 major titles came at Roland Garros. This year signified the first time the tournament in Paris had taken place since his retirement last year. However, he's now insisted there were no cravings to be on court as he watched the epic drama unfold in the final.

Refuting suggestions that he would have loved to have been in the shoes of Alcaraz on the Court Philippe-Chatrier, Nadal said: “I don't feel like I would have liked to be there.

“I watched the tournament like any other fan, excited to see a place that was so important during my career and simply enjoying the tennis. This is my new reality, I don't look beyond that.”

Speaking from a charity golf tournament in Spain, Nadal did admit to being gripped as Alcaraz fought back from two sets down. However, despite voicing his pleasure at his compatriot winning his fifth Grand Slam title, he also warned it was no formality that he and Sinner would continue to dominate at the top level.

“It was a match for the ages,” he said. “I'm very happy for Carlos. It was a spectacular final, very exciting. Ending up with the cup after Sinner was so close to taking it for so long, I'm very happy for him.

“There will be Grand Slam champions every year, and each of them will tread their own path. New stars will always appear, and here we have two of them. They are two players who are head and shoulders above the rest at the moment.”

Alcaraz and Sinner have now won the last six Slam tournaments between them. That run dates back to September 2023 when Novak Djokovic prevailed at the US Open.

Taylor Fritz, on Sunday, won his fourth ATP Tour title on grass and ninth overall, as he beat World No. 3 Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6(0) to lift the Stuttgart trophy. While American produced a splendid show on serve in the rain-disrupted final to maintain his dominant recent record against the German, the result brought bad news for Novak Djokovic ahead of Wimbledon.

The reason simply boils down to ranking. Jack Draper, previously ranked fourth, failed to defend his crown in Stuttgart as he suffered an opening-round exit, and hence fell to the sixth position in the live rankings. While the fourth spot was Djokovic's for the taking, Fritz's unlikely victory saw the American move to the top four.

Fritz's move, hence, left Djokovic in the fifth spot. With the Serb not playing any tune-up event ahead of the Wimbledon, his ranking is likely to remain the same, implying that he could be in for a nightmarish draw at the SW19. His current ranking means that the 24-time Grand Slam winner could face either Jannik Sinner (No. 1), Carlos Alcaraz (2) or in-form Zverev (3) and Fritz (4) in the quarterfinal.

Djokovic still has the edge over the German, who he defeated comfortably in the Roland Garros quarterfinals earlier this month, and against Fritz, to whom he has never lost, but a potential spot in Alcaraz or Sinner's quarter could leave the former champion in danger of an early exit.

Djokovic is an eight-time Wimbledon champion and has reached the final in each of the seven times he has played in London since 2018—which includes four titles in a row and two consecutive defeats to Alcaraz.

Djokovic heads to London on the back of a semifinal exit at the Roland Garros earlier this month, where he lost to Sinner. An injury in Melbourne forced him to retire during the semifinal against Zverev in the Australian Open.

WME and its IMG Tennis division worked with the Scottish star athlete to develop a very different kind of tour, bringing him to venues where fans will place their mobiles in lockable pouches for a VIP experience.

	Scottish tennis icon Andy Murray is used to touring and playing on many a center court, including the famous Centre Court of Wimbledon. Now, he is taking the spotlight on a very different tour, one that will bring his new show Centre Stage to four U.K. venues in the run-up to Wimbledon 2025. 


	Murray developed the interactive live stage shows with a screen with video footage behind him with WME and its IMG Tennis team. In them, the former world number 1 player will look back at his tennis career, sharing anecdotes and insights on life on tour, the circuit and beyond.

	“In conversation with sports broadcaster Andrew Cotter, they'll recount intimate and untold moments from Andy's career,” a description of the show promises. “Having decided to retire after his final professional tournament at the 2024 Paris Olympics, Andy is going to explore what life is like off the court.”


	Murray won three Grand Slam singles titles — two at Wimbledon, one at the U.S. Open — as well as two Olympic gold medals.


	His show will bring the star to three cities throughout the U.K. grass court season. Kicking off with the debut this Wednesday, June 18, at the SEC Armadillo in Glasgow, the city where Murray was born, it will travel to the Playhouse in Edinburgh the following day, before heading to the Eventim Hammersmith Apollo in London's Hammersmith neighborhood on Saturday, June 21. The grand final is set for Sunday, June 29, the night before the Wimbledon Championships, at the New Wimbledon Theatre. 


	The Edinburgh appearance sold out about 20 minutes after the general sale of tickets started, Hammersmith sold out within a day, and the Wimbledon show sold out in less than one hour.

	The WME and IMG team working on the show say that Murray didn't simply want to be a talking head or analyst for a TV network or move into a similar traditional role for athletes once he retired from tennis.

	











	“He's one of the few tennis players who really transcends the sport. He's also unique in the sense that he's very intelligent and very articulate. And he has a great sense of humor and is very knowledgeable about many different topics,” Chris Helliar, agent at IMG Tennis, tells THR. “When you have a client like that, it's really a duty to think outside the box.” IMG Tennis clients just swept the men's and women's singles titles at the French Open, with Carlos Alcaraz and Coco Gauff winning the tournament, marking the second singles sweep in Paris in a row.


	When Murray and the agents first brainstormed ideas when he was still an active player, they came up with all sorts of opportunities. “We focused not only on what Andy would be good at, but what he would also enjoy,” Helliar recalls. “Many of those ideas are still being talked about. We thought about the tour idea then, but it was after Andy retired that we sat down with him and went through a bunch of different ideas, and this was one that really stood out to him. It was a chance for him to speak to his fans.”


	Chris Payne, personal appearance agent at WME, shares that Murray needed some convincing that his fans would come out for a stage show. “We had to overcome Andy being so humble,” he tells THR. “And show business is so showy that there was a conversation we had about how to present this in a way that is very Andy Murray. When communicating it to fans, it had to feel like it came from the man himself, so that we could ensure the authenticity of this experience.”Meera Patel, tour marketing agent at WME, echoes that. “The concept of the tour and its announcement had to be such that fans knew straight away what they were going to watch, because for a tour, especially one that's not music-based, you don't really know what you're going to see,” she explains. “We had to make sure the wording was right, even down to the press shots that we put out, the artwork. Even in terms of video, we used a clip of one of his last interviews that was so raw and so emotional. Even when I watch it now, I still get goosebumps.”

	











	There is a special twist to the stage show. “Given the exclusive and intimate nature of the event, the show will be a phoneless experience, and all mobiles will be placed in lockable Yondr pouches,” according to a note on the tour website. How was that decision reached? 


	“The show is a way for him to really speak to his fans who have watched him for so long and supported him and give them something special and unique,” Helliar explains. “He likes to step out of the comfort zone, which this is, and it's something that hasn't really been done before by a tennis player.”


	Keeping away mobile phones is also part of the special fan club access feeling and experience that the stage show wants to provide. “This is such a unicorn that the idea of locking it off from the digital world is very exciting,” Payne tells THR. “It makes it a real pressure cooker, almost.”


	The stage show will have a rough structure but “it definitely won't be scripted,” Helliar tells THR. “That's not really Andy's style.”


	Murray also wanted to make sure his hard-core fans had an early chance to get tickets, but how do you organize presales opportunities when you don't have a music star-like fan mailing list? “We decided to work with Wimbledon LTA, which is the Lawn Tennis Association, and Andy's hotel in Scotland, Cromlix,” Patel shares. “We ran presales through them 48 hours before the general on-sale to give them the exclusivity that you would give music fans, and it worked really well. They helped with our marketing as well.”

	











	So, super-fans were in focus for everyone. Or maybe a different word is more appropriate. “Fan is just such a word thrown around, but if you are a fanatic about something, you will go to great lengths to see it,” Payne offers.


	Helliar saw the benefits of being able to tap into the expertise and skills across the various parts of WME and IMG to craft the best possible stage show offering for Murray. “Chris and Meera have an idea of how shows sell, which I don't, but I know tennis and Andy,” he says. “Being in an agency like this, where you have experts in every division, is so amazing. You can really put something tailored like this together for a client like Andy and for his fans.”

Born to tennis royalty, Draper's supreme work ethic and ascent up the rankings in the past 12 months have been astonishing. Here's why Kieran Jackson believes he poses a serious challenge to Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner for the Wimbledon title

To pinpoint the exact moment where British No 1 Jack Draper launched his ascent to the upper echelons of men's tennis, you'd need only go back 12 months this very weekend. 

Off the back of a disappointing first-round exit at the 2024 French Open, Draper broke his ATP title duck with a statement triumph on the grass in Stuttgart. That week, as he has since acknowledged, something clicked in his big-hitting, flamboyant lefty game. 

A few days later, the Brit outgunned Carlos Alcaraz at Queen's. While the Spaniard would go on to win his second title at SW19 a few weeks later, Draper slumped to a disappointing second-round loss to compatriot Cameron Norrie.

However, what has followed has been splendid. A US Open semi-final, a title in Vienna last October and a Masters 1000 victory in Indian Wells in March – a tournament seen by many as the fifth Grand Slam. Yet, most impressive of all? A newfound physical and mental resilience to compete with the very best, week in, week out. 

The net result? A career-high ranking of world No 4 for the 23-year-old from Sutton. Frustratingly, he will enter Queen's on Monday at No 5, behind Novak Djokovic, with his Stuttgart points dropping off. But the race to be fourth seed at Wimbledon – with the prospect of avoiding the likes of Jannik Sinner, Alexander Zverev and Alcaraz until the semi-final – is very much on, as Draper returns to Queen's this week.

The summer of '24 was a huge turning point. Draper, the son of former LTA chief executive Roger and ex-British junior tennis champion Nicky, has struggled immensely with injuries and physical fitness since turning professional in 2021. Shoulder and hip issues – remember Andy Murray's issues with the latter – have plagued him, while he has regularly vomited on court in humid conditions. 

“Coming into last year, the only goal was to stay fit and healthy,” Draper's long-term coach, James Trotman, told the ATP website in March. Interestingly, Draper's short-term coaching trial with South African ex-pro Wayne Ferreira last summer did not last more than a few months, with the Brit ultimately placing complete trust in Trotman, who is double his age at 46. 

“We were at the point where it didn't matter how good he could be, or was going to be, our focus was to keep him fit. It's challenging to build up trust in your body again. It's not something that happens instantly. This has been a long journey.

”It wasn't just one injury, it was three or four on the back of each other. I thought that was enough. ‘What are we going to do here, Jack? Who are the people we're going to put around you?' That was the first objective. It's okay to fail, but if we do, it's not because we're not trying.”

Sporting a backwards cap at all times – Lleyton Hewitt-esque – Draper emits something of a braggadocio persona; yet that could not be further from the truth. First emerging in the public eye in 2018, Draper reached the final of junior Wimbledon, winning a marathon semi-final 19-17 in the final set after four hours and 23 minutes. His heart in the heat of battle has never wavered. Quickly, he was elevated to the role of hitting partner for the Great Britain Davis Cup team. 

“There was a lot of potential there,” Trotman said of Draper, the junior. “He was very small until the age of 15 or 16. He grew up as a smaller player, having to compete against bigger guys, having to defend and find ways of being competitive against the stronger players who could hit him off the court.

“His identity from a young age was to be a little bit more defensive. All of a sudden, he grows to 6' 4” and he's serving out of a tree and hitting the ball big. A big part of that coaching journey that we're still on today is to try and impose his weapons on the court and take the racquet out of his opponent's hand.”

Draper was also able to learn from Murray during the latter stages of his career as part of the Davis Cup team, while showcasing his personality. Notably, GB's celebrations on the way back from the 2023 victory over France, where a young Draper, in a bucket hat and sipping a beer, belted out The Proclaimers' classic “500 Miles”, with the viral video showing an unimpressed Murray.

Whilst his raw ability – his fierce serve and swashbuckling forehand are his two greatest assets – has never been in doubt, his fitness over best-of-five set tennis has often been placed under the microscope. In fact, not unlike the early stages of Murray's career. Pleasingly, Draper dedicated his most recent off-season, when nursing a hip injury, to his physical conditioning and notably employed a breathing coach.

“I had a lot of problems with my sinuses when I was younger so I breathe a lot through my mouth,” explained Draper, having come through three back-to-back five-set matches at the Australian Open in January. 

“When you are anxious or have long points and you have to recover quickly, it's not efficient to breathe through your mouth. So, I've been trying to reverse what I do and breathe through my nose a lot more.”

Fast-forward six months, Draper is one of the fittest athletes on tour. So much so that the effervescent Alexander Bublik, prior to beating the Brit in the fourth round, said to him at Roland Garros: “Are you getting ready for UFC?!”

Now firmly rooted in the top 10 in the rankings, Draper does not want his upward trajectory to stop. The Putney resident was back on court at Queen's ahead of the tournament, hitting with former world No 14 Kyle Edmund, who knows a thing or two about career-impacting injuries. 

Draper will play just one warm-up tournament, at Queen's, before Wimbledon. While still a step short of Sinner and Alcaraz's insane level of consistency, as shown by their magnificent five-hour-plus Roland-Garros final, the Briton has the potential to cause an upset if either player has an off day. 

He has beaten both Sinner and Alcaraz at Queen's, in 2021 and 2024. His hard-hitting game is well-suited to the quick nature of grass-court tennis. And should the draw surprisingly open up at any point, he will be ready to pounce at SW19.

It's the first time there are three Americans inside the Top 10 of the ATP rankings at the same time since 2006.ByJohn BerkokPublished Jun 16, 2025 copy_link

There's a big breakthrough on the ATP rankings today, as American Ben Shelton rises from No. 12 to No. 10—his Top 10 debut—after reaching the first grass-court semifinal of his career in Stuttgart.He's the first U.S. man born in the 2000s to break into the elite.And there's more.With Shelton's countrymen Taylor Fritz and Tommy Paul currently at No. 4 and No. 8, this is also the first time there are three American men inside the Top 10 at the same time in almost two decades.The last time this happened was the week of April 17th, 2006, when—with almost identical rankings to this week—Andy Roddick was No. 4, James Blake was No. 7 and Andre Agassi was No. 10.That was actually Agassi's final career week in the Top 10.Fritz jumps from No. 7 back to his career-high of No. 4 this week after winning his first title of the year in Stuttgart. Paul rose to his new career-high of No. 8 a week ago after reaching the quarterfinals of Roland Garros, which was his third quarterfinal at the last four majors.And it's possible we could have four American men in the Top 10 soon, with Frances Tiafoe lurking just outside the elite at No. 13...

The United States is the only country with three men in the current Top 10. Italy has the next-most with two.

Shelton is the seventh man born in the 2000s from anywhere to break into the Top 10, and the fourth man born in 2002 or later to do it, after Carlos Alcaraz, Holger Rune and Lorenzo Musetti.MEN BORN IN 2000s TO REACH ATP TOP 10:Felix Auger-Aliassime [born in 2000, Top 10 debut in 2021]Jannik Sinner [born in 2001, Top 10 debut in 2021]Carlos Alcaraz [born in 2003, Top 10 debut in 2022]Holger Rune [born in 2003, Top 10 debut in 2022]Jack Draper [born in 2001, Top 10 debut in 2025]Lorenzo Musetti [born in 2002, Top 10 debut in 2025]Ben Shelton [born in 2002, Top 10 debut in 2025]Meanwhile, a little further down the ATP rankings, there's another breakthrough for a player born in the 2000s, as 23-year-old Canadian Gabriel Diallo rises from No. 55 to No. 44—his Top 50 debut—after capturing the first ATP title of his career in 's-Hertogenbosch.Perhaps surprisingly, he's just the second Canadian in the entire Open Era to win an ATP title on grass, after Greg Rusedski at Newport in 1993, before he switched representation to Great Britain in 1995.

Jack Draper is back in Queen's this week, and will be hoping to enjoy a solid run ahead of Wimbledon later this month.

However, any hopes of winning this upcoming Grand Slam will certainly have been reduced somewhat after watching the Roland Garros final just a few weeks ago.

There, Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner put on the most magnificent display, battling through a five-set epic that left the tennis world, and many beyond it, stunned.

It's the kind of event that draws countless new people into the sport, such was the quality and drama of each point.

Jack Draper has since sought to review the action.

Speaking to the press ahead of his return to Queen's this week, one reporter wondered if Draper had made the time to watch that historic recent French Open final between Alcaraz and Sinner.

He replied: ‘I didn't watch the first two sets… I watched it in my flat. I watched the last three sets, unbelievable tennis. 

‘I think it inspired all the players and I think it captured the attention of all the spectators, all the people around the world, even people who aren't into tennis, it was one of those sporting moments I think everyone was embraced by, so I think Jannik and Carlos did an unbelievable show there.

‘Shame someone had to lose, but that's the nature of sport; but I think tennis won for sure. 

Asked if he felt like he could reach that level soon, Draper then continued: ‘Yeah, I mean, I think so. 

‘I think, you know, the tennis they were playing that was, I think the combination of them two together, I think it was the moment they were in. 

‘My friend said to me when we were watching them play, like, “How are they playing this way in this moment in this after five hours or something like that?” And I said, “I don't think they're thinking about anything. I think they're just thinking about playing”. 

‘I don't know what I'm capable of yet, but I aspire to be at that level, and I think what those guys are doing is setting away and it's changing the game. And I think that, you know, players like myself are going to be working very hard to get to that point. That's that's 100% for sure.'

Jack Draper's relationship with Andy Murray was analysed by Jamie Murray over the weekend, and perhaps the 22-year-old can seek some counsel from the legendary Scotsman on how he can compete with such forces of nature.

Draper has troubled Alcaraz in the past when they have played, beating him at Queen's this time last year, and on his way to his Indian Wells title earlier in 2025.

He's also had his fair share of beatings, but on his day, he can challenge the Spaniard.

However, much like the rest of the tour, Sinner proposes a wholly different challenge that he cannot seem to overcome.

He did beat the world number one back in 2021, but when they faced more recently, whilst the Italian was at the level he currently is, the Brit was swept aside in the US Open semi-finals.

Draper managed to compete, dragging the opening two sets to tiebreaks, but could not find that extra level needed to trouble the most consistent and ruthless player on tour.

If he is to challenge for the Wimbledon title, he'll need to follow in Alcaraz's footsteps and try and unsettle Sinner with a variety of shots on this unique surface.

5 Winners and 5 Losers from the Canadian GP

The key factors behind Norris and Piastri's Canada crash

Fernando Alonso and George Russell were quick to praise Robert Kubica's efforts in the wake of the Canadian Grand Prix, as the Polish driver and his fellow team mates took victory in the famous Le Mans 24 Hours while the F1 were stars were racing in Montreal.

Kubica, Phil Hanson and Yifei Ye won in the satellite #83 AF Corse Ferrari 499P LMH, with the former F1 star completing a mighty final stint to ensure victory for his team. He completed the final 59 laps without a functioning drinks bottle, and was behind the steering wheel for 43% of the race.

While Kubica's F1 career never reached the heights it once seemed destined to following a horrific 2011 rallying crash, winning the illustrious Le Mans is just reward for a driver once described by Fernando Alonso as “the best” he'd faced.

CANADA LOWDOWN: All the key moments as Norris and Piastri collide, Russell shines and F1 ACADEMY puts on a show

His win at Le Mans follows that of Alonso himself, who triumphed back in 2018 and 2019 when he took a hiatus from F1 racing. And the Spaniard was swift to congratulate his former rival on social media.

“Bravo Robert,” Alonso posted, with Russell – fresh from triumphing in Canada – adding his own praise.

“Congrats mate on winning Le Mans, so happy for you!!” Russell wrote on social media. The British star was Kubica's team mate at Williams when the Pole attempted an F1 comeback in 2019 following his rally crash, which severely injured his right arm.

Kubica's career has always been one of huge highs and crushing lows. He suffered a shocking crash in Canada in 2007 when driving for BMW, before going on to win that race the following season – which ended up being his only F1 victory.

HIGHLIGHTS: Watch the action from the Canadian GP as Russell clinches victory while Norris and Piastri collide

So, it seemed apt that his Le Mans win coincided with the Canadian Grand Prix, and that his last team mate in F1 managed to take the win in Montreal.

Winning Le Mans in a Ferrari is especially poetic for Kubica, who reportedly had a contract to join the Scuderia in 2012 – only for his rallying crash to end put paid to his Ferrari F1 dreams.

“An all time moment for Robert Kubica,” F1 commentator Alex Jacques wrote, echoing the sentiments of many. “His dreams of racing for Ferrari in F1 were dashed by a horror crash which would have ended most careers, a lost LMP2 win on the last lap in '21 added more heartbreak, today a comeback for the ages is complete. Congrats to the whole #83 entry”.

Ferrari team boss Fred Vasseur knows Kubica well from their time together at Alfa Romeo when Kubica was the team's reserve driver, and was another who wanted to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the popular racer.

“I have a close relationship with Robert, he stayed with me a couple of years at Alfa Romeo and before in F3 Formula Renault,” Vasseur explained after the Canadian Grand Prix.

“For me, he's an extra-terrestrial. What he's doing is mega and to win in Le Mans in this situation and to be the leader of the car, to [lead] the team, it's something that I can't imagine.

“I'm very, very pleased for Robert. He had a chaotic career in motorsport, and when you see the level of effort that he put into his career, I'm very, very pleased for him to have this kind of result today.”

Good Deed has acquired the family drama movie in which the father-son duo star alongside Walker Scobell and David Morse.


							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


Michael Douglas and real-life son Cameron Douglas are set to reunite on the big screen.


	Good Deed Entertainment has acquired domestic rights to Looking Through Water — a family drama feature starring Michael Douglas — and is planning a late summer theatrical release, The Hollywood Reporter has learned exclusively. Roberto Sneider helmed the film that co-stars Cameron Douglas as a younger version of his father's character. Walker Scobell, David Morse, Michael Stahl-David, Ximena Romo and Tamara Tunie round out the cast.




Looking Through Water centers on a father who attempts to bond with his estranged son by teaming up with him for a father-son fishing competition.

	Sneider (Tear This Heart Out) directed the movie from a script by Rowdy Herrington (director of the original Road House) and Zach Dean (Fast X). Hailing from Aeth Entertainment, the project is based on the novels Catching Big Fish and Looking Through Water from author Bob Rich, who executive produces.


	Producers include Robert Mitas, Stan Spry, Carla Woods and Eric Woods. Storyboard Media executive produces and worked to negotiate the deal for the film that was previously known as Blood Knot.


	“With Good Deed and Storyboard Media on board, we're excited to bring Looking Through Water to audiences — it's a story of healing, forgiveness and second chances, while the American pastime of fishing connects generations through water,” says Aeth Entertainment CEO Woods.


	“We are honored to be teaming up with Aeth Entertainment and Storyboard Media to bring Looking Through Water to audiences in the U.S. later this summer,” adds GDE head of acquisitions and distribution Erik Donley. 


	Michael and Cameron Douglas previously starred together in the 2003 feature It Runs in the Family, alongside Michael's late real-life parents Kirk Douglas and Diana Douglas. Michael was last seen on the big screen in 2023's Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. 

	











	Cameron Douglas' recent credits include the 2022 Bruce Willis-led action film Wire Room and the Apple TV+ series The Crowded Room. His book Long Way Home was published in 2019 and details his journey following his conviction on drug charges.

Tributes from celebrities and fans of fashion designer Afa Ah Loo, a contestant on season 17 of Bravo's “Project Runway,” began rolling in on June 16, 2025, after authorities in Salt Lake City identified him as the victim of a shooting at a peaceful protest two days before. 

Arthur Folasa Ah Loo — known as Afa Ah Loo publicly — was “hit by a stray bullet,” according to Salt Lake City station Fox13, when a “peacekeeping” volunteer at the “No Kings” protest there shot at a suspect, Arturo Roberto Gamboa, who pulled an AR-15 out of his backpack. Despite attempts to save Ah Loo's life at the hospital, he succumbed to his injuries. Gamboa, meanwhile, was treated for a minor gunshot wound on his side before being arrested on suspicion of murder, the outlet reported.  

Among the tributes, “Moana 2” star Auliʻi Cravalho mourned Ah Loo in a heartfelt Instagram post, noting that she often wore his designs, at the movie's May premiere. She wrote on June 16, “There are no words to hold the grief of losing @afa.ahloo.”

A post shared by Auliʻi Cravalho (@auliicravalho)

In Cravalho's tribute, she wrote in full, “As a Samoan fashion designer, Afa's creations are and remain thoughtful, elegant and powerful portrayals of Pacific culture. I am still amazed to have worn his custom designs for the most significant event of my career; the world premiere of Moana 2. Your artistry will never be forgotten; and neither will your peaceful protest. My deepest condolences, sympathies and Aloha to his family, and all who felt his impact. May you rest peacefully with our Father, Afa. Auwe. Auwe. Auwe.”

In a statement released via social media by Utah State Representative Verona Mauga, who'd become a friend, she called his passing “a heartbreaking loss for his family, our Pacific Islander community, the state of Utah, and all who knew him.” 

Another Utah State Representative, Doug Fiefia, tweeted, “Heartbroken by the tragic loss of Afa Ah Loo. My prayers are with his family, friends, and all who knew him. He was a bright light in our Polynesian community and will be deeply missed. May his loved ones feel peace and comfort during this difficult time.”

Popular singer Tenelle wrote on one of Ah Loo's recent posts, “WE LOVE YOU AFA!!” 

A fan account for the “Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” also paid tribute to Ah Loo, tweeting that he often worked with former cast members Jen Shah and Danna Bui-Negrete.

According to Bravo, where “Project Runway” aired during Ah Loo's season (it has since moved to Disney+ and Hulu), Ah Loo was born and raised in Samoa and watched his mom sew most of the clothes he and his five siblings wore. He discovered early on that he, too, loved to sew and would design fashions for his sisters. He eventually attended Brigham Young University – Hawaii and later moved to Utah. Representative Mauga told KSL that Ah Loo recently became a U.S. citizen and voted in his first election last November.

Friends have set up a GoFundMe campaign for Ah Loo's family, noting that “more than anything, Afa was proud of the life he built with his wife, Laura, and their two beautiful children, Vera and Isaac.” 

“This unimaginable loss has left a profound void in their lives,” the campaign's description said. “Family and friends are coming together to raise funds to help Laura with funeral expenses and to ease the immediate financial burdens she now faces. Funds raised will be sent directly to Laura via the GoFundMe transfer.” 

At the time of publication, the fund had raised over $174,000 of a $210,000 goal.

In the age of streaming, there's a widespread belief that every movie is available, all the time, everywhere. Don't fall for it! Some of the greatest movies ever made are nowhere to be found due to everything from music rights snafus to corporate negligence. In this column, we take a look at films currently out of print on physical media and unavailable on any streaming platform in an effort to draw attention to them and say to their rights holders, “Release This!”

Michael Dinner is best known now for prestige television — he was a key creative force behind one of the great TV shows of all time, “Justified,” and currently helms “Silo” for Apple TV+ — but 40 years ago, he began his career as the director of a trio of excellent and underrated comedies.

His debut feature, “Heaven Help Us” (1985), was marketed as a broad teen farce but delivered much more as a rich character study with an exquisite sense of time (the 1960s) and place (an all-boys Catholic school). 




			Popular on IndieWire		






Critics excoriated Dinner's third movie, “Hot to Trot” (1988), at the time. But anchoring the ridiculous premise (Bobcat Goldthwait becomes a successful investment banker by teaming up with a talking horse) was a meticulously orchestrated comic structure populated by a wide array of hilarious supporting actors: Dabney Coleman, SNL's Tim Kazurinsky and Mary Gross, John Candy as the voice of the horse, etc.

 










In between his first and third movies, Dinner directed his best film, the mistaken-identity comedy “Off Beat.” Despite a cast that includes Judge Reinhold (in his first leading role coming off “Beverly Hills Cop”), Meg Tilly (post-Oscar-nomination for “Agnes of God”), Joe Mantegna, John Turturro, Harvey Keitel, and a deep bench of recognizable character actors, it has never been released on DVD. As of this writing, the film isn't available to stream anywhere, either. Its unavailability is a shame, because “Off Beat” is one of the sweetest, funniest movies of its era.

“Off Beat” tells the story of Joe Gower (Reinhold), an unassuming New York City librarian whose best friend is cop Abe Washington (Cleavant Derricks). When Gower inadvertently screws up one of Washington's busts, Washington tells Joe he can make amends by taking Washington's place at an audition for a police dance troupe set to perform at an upcoming benefit. Washington's boss is requiring all his officers to participate, but Washington figures Joe can sign in as him, blow the audition, and they can both go back to their normal lives.

Joe fully intends to fail the audition, but when he locks eyes on female officer Rachel Wareham (Tilly) he decides to stick around. He becomes a member of the police dance troupe and begins dating Rachel, who thinks he actually is a cop — a charade he has to sustain both for the sake of his budding romance and to keep himself and Washington out of trouble. 

 










The comic complications that ensue won't surprise anyone who's ever seen a romantic comedy where the protagonist is pretending to be someone they're not (“The Lady Eve,” “Tootsie,” etc.), but “Off Beat” transcends formula through the sheer excellence of its craft on every level. It begins with the screenplay, written by Tony-winning playwright Mark Medoff (“Children of a Lesser God”).

Medoff uses the framework that his mistaken identity premise provides as a springboard for an abundance of delicately calibrated digressions and relationships. He knows the rom-com formula he's working with is rock-solid, and thus will hold together no matter how much extra weight he puts on it. While the Reinhold-Tilly romance is charming and fully realized, it's far from the only compelling storyline in the movie — Medoff crams the film with hilarious sketches, dynamic action, and peripheral relationships that create a vivid tapestry of comedy, romance, and suspense.

It's all deftly handled by Dinner, whose first smart move comes in the casting. “Off Beat” is stacked with great actors fully capable of carrying their own movies who come in and out here for a few minutes at a time. They add weight and flavor to the central love story in the same way that Charles Coburn or William Demarest would have in the days of Preston Sturges (a director to whom “Off Beat” owes a considerable debt). From Mantegna's dance-hating policeman and Turturro's prissy library administrator to the brief but memorable appearances by actors like James Tolkan (the principal in “Back to the Future”), magician Penn Jillette, Fred Gwynne, and others, “Off Beat” is a nonstop parade of delightful comic turns.

 










And I do mean nonstop. Unlike so many comedies that run out of steam, “Off Beat” keeps introducing new pleasures right up to the end, bringing in Scorsese favorites Harvey Keitel and Victor Argo for a very funny climax involving a bank robbery where one of the cops outside is another Scorsese regular, Mike Starr. In hands less adept than Dinner's, that bank robbery could have felt like a perfunctory action climax, but he invests it with so much humor and feeling that it feels like an organic extension of the themes and relationships the movie has so carefully established; it expertly brings the varied plot strands together in a way that feels convincing and earned.

Indeed, one of the most surprising aspects of “Off Beat” is how grounded it feels in spite of the absurdity of its premise. This is thanks partly to Medoff's witty dialogue, partly to a cast that plays every scene with total conviction, and partly to Dinner's ability to provide a colorful but realistic visual context. Bringing up Scorsese's name is not inappropriate, as, like Scorsese, Dinner knows how to utilize New York locations to their greatest potential — every background in the film is lively and carefully chosen, and sometimes artfully manipulated.

For a nighttime basketball scene, for example, Dinner had his crew build a court in a parking lot because it provided the perfect angle from which to capture the skyline in the background; the result is a combination of urban naturalism and slightly elevated artifice that gives what could have been a mundane dialogue scene a magical, entrancing quality. And Dinner works similarly throughout the movie to find ways of staging and lighting that take scenes we expect and present them in unexpected ways.

 










It helps that he's working with cinematographer Carlo Di Palma, a favorite of both Michelangelo Antonioni and Woody Allen. The visual elegance Di Palma brings to “Off Beat” is stunning, particularly in the scenes delineating Reinhold and Tilly's relationship. When their have their final conversation in which Reinhold fully comes clean, it's a moment we've seen in other movies, but never the way Di Palma and Dinner present it: with the characters in silhouette surrounded by a blue darkness behind the curtain of their dance recital, a mood of mystery, romance, and anticipation enveloping them.

The whole film is filled with images like that, and with scenes in which Dinner and Medoff figure out how to do multiple things at once. There's never a car chase just for the sake of a car chase — if a car chase is going to occur, it's also going to serve as a scene to move a relationship forward, as when Mantegna and Tilly argue about their past while in hot pursuit of a suspect. 

This economy makes “Off Beat” feel longer than its 92-minute running time. Not because it drags — to the contrary, it moves like a rocket — but because it provides so many varied satisfactions. Dinner's filmmaking confidence throughout is astonishing, given this was only his second feature. The ability to find dynamic but motivated camera movements that would serve him so well later on television is already on full display here. The scenes in which Reinhold rollerskates through the aisles at the library, for example, are hypnotic in their rhythms; the camera seduces us without ever calling attention to itself, and at every stage, Dinner and Di Palma find just the right perspective to encourage the audience to fall in love with Reinhold and Tilly as they fall in love with each other.

 










“Off Beat” was released by the now-defunct Disney offshoot Touchstone Pictures, and after an inexplicably unsuccessful theatrical run and VHS release, it seems to have fallen into obscurity. In recent years, Disney has started to license some of their lesser-known movies to independent labels like Kino Lorber, so maybe a physical media release could be imminent? One certainly hopes so, because “Off Beat” is, as its title promises, an eccentric pleasure that deserves reconsideration.

	The headquarters of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting in Tehran was hit by an Israeli airstrike during a live broadcast Monday, setting the building on fire and knocking the network off the air for a short time.


	Footage shows a female anchor speaking on-air on the state-run broadcaster as the bomb from an Israeli fighter jet struck. A loud boom was heard, shaking the camera and knocking out the stage lights as the anchor hurriedly left the desk. 


Israel‘s defense minister confirmed the attack on the building, which houses Iran's state TV operations, calling the IRIB a “propaganda and incitement broadcasting authority” in a post on X. Al Jazeera is reporting the anchor on the air at the time of the attack is Sahar Emami, referring to her “one of the most famous state TV presenters in the country.”

	The IRIB said in a statement that “live programs were briefly halted at the IRIB News Network but returned to normal a few minutes afterwards.” It added that “it was not immediately clear if and how many personnel had been wounded or killed.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Video online showed the building on fire.


	Israeli officials and Iranian journalists on the ground confirmed there were evacuation warnings issued for that part of Tehran ahead of the strikes, which come on the fourth day of an Israeli offensive across Iran in response to intelligence that warned of Iran's increasing nuclear capability.


	The two countries have been trading bombing attacks using aircraft, ballistic missiles and drones since Sunday, with air raid sirens heard across Israel and civilians fleeing Tehran.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Paramount Pictures has acquired an original comedic pitch, inspired by the classic game MASH, from Emmy-, Grammy- and Golden Globe-nominated comedian Nikki Glaser, who will star in, produce, and co-write the film. 


	The feature is billed as a Sliding Doors-style comedy, inspired by the future-predicting storytelling game from grade school. The MASH game starts off with a player literally writing out the letters ‘M-A-S-H' to predict whether one will live in a mansion, apartment, shack, or house. Categories are then picked based on what you want in your future or story: a spouse, kids, car, pets, etc. Options are crossed off or circled under each category using a magic number, yielding your final resolution in life. In the Glaser project, a woman's childhood MASH game magically becomes reality and she discovers that the perfect life isn't the one she imagined.

	Glaser is co-writing the comedy with Emmy-nominated scribe Sean O'Connor (The Late Late Show With James Corden). This is Glaser's first feature script. O'Connor was a writer for the 82nd Golden Globes, on which Glaser was the first woman solo host.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Following the success of her Critics Choice-nominated HBO standup special Good Clean Filth in 2022, Glaser's second HBO comedy special Someday You'll Die premiered in May 2024 to a record-breaking audience. It set the record for both the best premiere night for an HBO comedy special in more than two years and for the No. 1 largest streaming audience for a comedy special in HBO Max/Max history.

	











	She was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Variety Special (Pre-Recorded), a Grammy for Best Comedy Album, a Golden Globe for Best Performance in a Stand-Up Comedy on Television, a Critics Choice for Best Comedy Special and a WGA Award for Comedy/Variety Special, which she won. Glaser also wrote and performed “Someday You'll Die,” the special's theme song. Glaser can currently be seen on her Alive and Unwell tour across the U.S., Canada and Australia through October 2025 after wrapping her global The Good Girl tour in 2024.


	O'Connor is currently working as a co-executive producer on the Netflix animated show Strip Law. He previously served as a co-EP on Solar Opposites and Star Trek: Lower Decks and Close Enough on HBO Max, head writer and executive producer of Lights Out with David Spade, head writer and co-EP of A Little Late With Lilly Singh. He has also written for The Late Late Show with James Corden, Fox's What Just Happened and Netflix's Hilarity For Charity.


	Glaser is represented by UTA, Brillstein, and Ginsburg Daniels Kallis. O'Connor is represented by CAA, Mosaic and Felker Toczek Suddleson McGinnis Ryan.

The song is her second leader, and first to enter at the summit.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



Sabrina Carpenter's “Manchild” soars onto the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 1. The song is her second leader, and first to debut on top. Her “Please Please Please” spent a week atop the ranking in June 2024, rising from the runner-up spot in its second week on the chart.


	“Manchild,” also Carpenter's fourth Hot 100 top 10, introduces her next album, Man's Best Friend, due Aug. 29. “i can't wait for it to be yours x,” she wrote of the set on Instagram on June 11; it is scheduled to arrive just more than year since her prior LP, Short n' Sweet, which was released Aug. 23, 2024.


	Carpenter notched her first three Hot 100 top 10s from Short n' Sweet, with “Please Please Please” preceded by the No. 3-peaking “Espresso” and followed by “Taste,” which hit No. 2. As those three songs charted in the top five together upon the debut of “Taste,” she became the second act ever to chart her first three top five hits in the region simultaneously – joining only The Beatles for the feat.


	Meanwhile, Carpenter is the only woman artist with multiple Hot 100 No. 1s dating to the coronation of “Please Please Please.” She is also the only woman to reign with a nonseasonal song and with no billed collaborators in that span.


	“Manchild,” on Island Records/Republic, is the 1,182nd No. 1 in the Hot 100's 66-year history, and the 85th to debut at the summit – and the first No. 1 entrance for Island. Carpenter co-produced the song with Jack Antonoff and co-wrote it with Antonoff and Amy Allen. (The trio also co-wrote “Please Please Please,” which Antonoff produced.)


	Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated June 21, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, June 17. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.


Released late on June 5, “Manchild” tallied 27.1 million official streams, 14 million radio airplay audience impressions and 20,000 sold in the United States June 6-12.


	The track debuts at No. 1 on the Streaming Songs chart, where it's Carpenter's third leader, following “Taste” (three weeks on top) and “Please Please Please” (two). It opens at No. 3 on Digital Song Sales with 6,000 downloads sold; it also sold 14,000 copies on 7-inch vinyl, on which it was released with the exclusive instrumental B-side, “Inside of Your Head When You've Just Won an Argument with a Man.” (“Manchild” is the top-selling song of the week overall.) As it bubbles under the Radio Songs chart, “Manchild” launches at No. 22 on Pop Airplay and No. 24 on Adult Pop Airplay.


	“Manchild” is the 19th Hot 100 No. 1 with the word “man” (or a variation) in its title. Here's a look at all such man-ly hits:




	Notably, man-y more Hot 100 No. 1s have included “man” in their titles than “woman” – 19 vs. eight, with the versions of “When a Man Loves a Woman” above contributing to both sides.


	Meanwhile, Billboard's Keith Caulfield notes that funk band Manchild charted in 1977 with Power and Love (No. 29 peak on Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums). The group included musical renaissance man Babyface and accomplished writer and producer Daryl Simmons.


	“Manchild” is also the fourth Hot 100 No. 1 with “child” in its title, and the first since a rock classic 37 years ago:




	No kid-ding: Additionally, Childish Gambino ruled the Hot 100 with “This Is America” in 2018 and Destiny's Child scored four leaders in 1999-2001.


	Alex Warren's “Ordinary” drops to No. 2 on the Hot 100 following two weeks at No. 1. Still, it adds a seventh week at No. 1 on Digital Song Sales (7,000 sold) and gained by 12% to 54 million in airplay audience. It also claims a third week at No. 1 on the Songs of the Summer chart.


	Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, dips 2-3 on the Hot 100, three weeks after it roared in as Wallen's fourth No. 1 and McRae's first. It also tops the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart for a fourth week. Wallen follows on the Hot 100 with the No. 2-peaking “Just in Case” (3-4) and “I'm the Problem” (5-6), as I'm the Problem, the parent set of all three songs, posts a fourth week at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.


	Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” descends 4-5 after 13 weeks atop the Hot 100 beginning in March. It adds a 25th week at No. 1 on both the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts, extending the longest reign on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs (dating to October 1958, when the chart became the genre's all-encompassing songs ranking).


	Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” wobbles 6-7 on the Hot 100, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. 1 beginning last July, and Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” backtracks 7-8 after five weeks at No. 1 starting in January.


	Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and became the year's No. 1 song, falls 8-9. It logs a record-extending 65th week in the top 10 and a record-furthering 95th week on the chart overall.


	Rounding out the Hot 100's top 10, Benson Boone's No. 2-peaking “Beautiful Things” retreats 9-10.

	Said Ramsay, “At the heart of this story is the complexity of love and how it can change and transform over time. I aimed to keep it grounded, human, spontaneous and funny at times, capturing the moments that feel small but carry a lot of weight. This film is for anyone who's ever been in a relationship – there's heartbreak and beauty in vulnerability.”


	Deadline first reported the news about Mubi acquiring Die, My Love. Coming out of the fest, the movie notched 77% fresh with Rotten Tomatoes critics. 


Die, My Love will share the marquee November 7 with Amazon MGM Studios' Sarah's Oil, Paramount's The Running Man, and 20th Century Studios' Predator: Badlands.


Die, My Love was by far the biggest sale out of Cannes this year and Mubi's biggest acquisition ever. The deal was for a full domestic theatrical commitment on 1,500 screens for 45 days. The territories covered are North America, Latin America, UK, Ireland, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Benelux, Turkey, India, Australia and New Zealand.

In Loud and Clear, journalist and Deadhead Brian Anderson chronicles how the legendary band's pursuit of high-quality sound forever changed concert production.

	Eric Renner Brown



This August, Dead & Company will celebrate 60 years of Grateful Dead music with three massive concerts in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. Fans can reasonably assume – as they can with most major touring artists today – that the sound will be impeccable.


	But six decades ago, when the Grateful Dead began gigging around that very same park, quality sound was far from a given. Audiences routinely endured terrible audio, and bands also struggled to parse the noise and play together. Modern cornerstones of concert production, from monitors to digital delay towers, had yet to be invented.


	The Grateful Dead didn't just embrace new advancements in audio technology – as journalist and Deadhead Brian Anderson chronicles in his new book, Loud and Clear: The Grateful Dead's Wall of Sound and the Quest for Audio Perfection, the revered band actively drove concert sound forward, creating many of today's standards in the process.




			Trending on Billboard		







Loud and Clear specifically tackles the first decade of the band's history, from its Bay Area formation in 1965 to the Wall of Sound, the gargantuan sound system worth nearly $2 million in today's dollars that it took on the road in 1974. During those years, the band and the cast of characters in its orbit – from an audiophile LSD chemist to hard-nosed roadies – continually iterated its sound system, introducing numerous innovations in service of creating a deeper performer-listener connection through quality sound. The pinnacle was the Wall of Sound, a technological marvel that towered behind the band and allowed each musician to manipulate their individual mixes in real time.


	“I knew this was for a general audience,” says Anderson, who asked himself, “How do I make it digestible and explain this stuff in a way people are gonna understand?” The son of Deadheads – who saw the band repeatedly in this era and took him as a toddler to see the Dead at Alpine Valley in the late ‘80s – found the answer in those strong personalities within the Dead's organization. Loud and Clear is as much a story about the Dead's audio equipment as it is about the band's musical philosophy and the way money, fame, and excess challenged it. 


	“The wheels came very close to coming off,” Anderson says of the Dead in this era. The band took the Wall of Sound – which, when its almost 600 speakers were assembled, measured 60 feet long and more than three stories tall – on the road for nearly 40 shows in 1974, and the unprecedented production feat came close to bankrupting the Dead and tearing it apart. Plus, at a time with far fewer regulations, transporting, assembling, and disassembling the Wall came with plenty of risks for the (often inebriated) crew tasked with doing so; Loud and Clear's at-times harrowing narrative includes broken arms, nearly-severed toes, falling equipment, electrocutions and flipped trucks. “It's amazing that nobody bit it,” Anderson says.


	The Dead ultimately carried many of the lessons of the Wall of Sound into the proceeding years – but after taking a hiatus in 1975, returned without the advanced system in 1976. “They somehow kept it together,” Anderson says, “but there was a collective sigh of relief at the end of 1974 when they're like, ‘OK, you know what? Let's take a break here.'”


What inspired you to write a book not just about the Dead, but about such a specific topic and period?


	I am the child of early Deadheads who both started seeing the band in the late '60s and early '70s in Chicago and the tri-state area. I grew up hearing them talk about the Wall of Sound and this system's sonic clarity. They would talk about seeing the band perform with this massive assembly of gear behind them – and it's called the Wall of Sound, so it's just captivated me my entire life.


	As time went on, I grew to appreciate the scale of the Wall. When I was at VICE, I was the Features Editor [at science and tech vertical Motherboard], and I thought it would be cool to do a deep dive into the Wall of Sound. I embarked on writing that initial story because I knew that it had more than just the technology component – it's a story about obsession, obsessive people who came from all walks of life. After that story came out, it quickly dawned on me that there's so much more here – like, maybe I could do a full book on this one day.


How did the Dead's pursuit of quality sound differentiate themselves from their peers and ultimately help them amass the following that they did?


	Not long after the band had gotten going, [singer/guitarist] Jerry Garcia's mother, Ruth, purchased her son a pair of Klipsch speakers. That was, basically, the very first iteration of the Dead's sound system. No other bands at the time had their own rig like that, so immediately, they were elevated above most of their peers, at a time when musical PAs didn't exist. Most any club that they were playing at the time, if it did have a sound system, it was just a small little box to like each side of the stage. The famous example, on a bigger level, is the Beatles at Shea Stadium. Live sound presentation in the mid '60s was kind of terrible.


	Then they get hooked up with Owsley Stanley, who was their patron and their original sound man. He was using money that he was making from manufacturing LSD to bankroll the band. He was kitting them out with top-flight gear by early 1966 – and right around that time, the acid tests were getting going. The Dead were basically the in-house band at the acid tests, and the acid tests would be the model that they would follow, really, through the end of their career: During the acid tests, the band and the crowd were all the same organism, everyone was in the same sonic envelope.


	The whole point of putting [all the audio equipment] at the musicians' backs [in the Wall of Sound in 1974] was to ensure that the band and the crowd would all hear the same thing and be in the same sonic envelope together – and that harkened right back to the acid tests. There's also an ethic with the Dead that was there from the very early days: That ethic was to present the sound in such a way that the person in the very back row would experience the exact same thing as someone who was hanging right on the barrier. Part of their righteous approach to sound was to present the sound in such a way that everyone in the space together [would] experience the same high quality.


At its roots, the Dead almost had a punk-like, DIY ethos. What tensions did that introduce as the band's operation grew and professionalized?


	By the early '70s, the sound system that was growing into the Wall of Sound had become the center of the Dead's homegrown world-building project, which included their own record label, in-house travel and booking agencies, a publishing arm, and a whole cottage industry of boutique sound and audio companies that were building kit for the Dead. [The Dead wanted] to do everything their own way; it didn't necessarily make sense to do what they were doing, but they did it anyway. It was super, super punk, super DIY.


	From the very beginning, they would always funnel money back into their sound system – that's basically how the Wall of Sound was able to grow. As early as mid-1973, management was starting to be like, “Hey guys. We can't do things like we did in the very early days.” It became clear that they were hemorrhaging money through this sound system. By mid-'74, it was starting to get through to Garcia and some of the other band members that this was not sustainable. Despite their wanting to continue on in this very punk, DIY fashion where money would just always be funneled back into the sound system, the reality was such that they couldn't do that anymore.


As much as the book is about the band, it's also about the crew that surrounded it. Why emphasize those supporting characters?


	I knew that if I was gonna do this book, I had to push the story forward somehow. I didn't want to just tell this story through old sound bites from Jerry Garcia or Bob Weir or Phil Lesh. There were so many other people who were in the room in this era who helped put this thing together and who made it go on the road, setting it up and tearing it down. I was really interested in illuminating what the day-to-day was like of conceiving [the Wall of Sound] and building it and taking it on the road. I wanted stretches of the book to kind of feel like you're going on tour with them.


Your book outlines several audio innovations by the band, including pioneering the use of on-stage monitors, helping to invent digital delay towers, and using feedback-cancelling microphones to make the Wall of Sound work. What were the most significant lasting impacts the Dead had on modern concert audio?


	There's a number of them. A curved speaker, no one had done that before the Dead. The theory and the mathematics existed, so a curved speaker existed on paper, but the Dead were really the first to fly a curved speaker. Today, you go to see Metallica at a stadium or you go see a local punk band at the dive bar, you're gonna see versions of a curved speaker – and that's the Dead lineage.


	Delay towers, that's not the Wall of Sound, but an adjacent sonic first that the Dead and their crew and their technicians helped forge in that era. Kezar Stadium, RFK, Watkins Glen, those three [big outdoor concerts] in summer of '73 were crucial to figuring out digital delay. That's another convention of modern sound reinforcement at much bigger shows that anyone is familiar with.


	From a philosophical standpoint, a lasting impact of all the Dead's innovations in the audio realm in this era was an elevated presentation. The Dead instilled this awareness of pursuing the highest-quality sound that you can because you owe it to your audience, because these people are coming to see you perform.


And in turn, that reoriented what fans expected of concert audio, not just at the Dead's shows but at any show.


	By the time the Dead came back from their hiatus in 1976, the world of audio had kind of caught up to them. They realized, “We don't need to carry this massive equipment with us anymore, because the state of the art has advanced to a point where we can rent a sound system that sounds just as good, if not better, than the Wall of Sound for a fraction of the price.” A lot of that really owes to the ground that they broke through the Wall of Sound.


At a couple points in the book, you quote Garcia interviews from this period where, when lamenting the challenges of ensuring quality audio on tour, he says he wishes the band could have its own venue tailored to its own production standards. That never came to pass – but today, Dead & Company has played upwards of 40 shows at Sphere in Las Vegas. What would Jerry have thought of Sphere?


	Last year, the first time I went to the Sphere, walking in, I couldn't help but draw all of these connections. In the very early '70s, they were always having conversations about, “Gee, wouldn't it be great if we had our own spot where we could set up our sound system, just exactly perfect, and people can come see us perform?” They started to take some very serious steps to figure out, “OK, what would this space look like?” One of the ideas they were kicking around was a Buckminster Fuller-style geodesic dome – like a sphere. So, you walk into the Sphere to see Dead and Company, it's like, “Oh, here it is.” Inside of the Sphere is basically the Wall of Sound, but taken to an exponential degree. The Wall of Sound walked so the Sphere could run.


	I have to think Garcia would've been tickled to take the Sphere for a ride. There's the public perception of Garcia as this wooly, hippie-type guy, but he was always embracing the cutting edge, from the gear that he was playing and just experimenting with to getting really into computers in the late '80s and early '90s. He just loved, like, f—king around with the newest technology.


What's your favorite Wall of Sound show?


	June 16, 1974, at the Des Moines Fairgrounds, for sonic and setlist reasons as much as personal reasons – my mother was at that show. That show, to me, is the epitome of your outdoor Grateful Dead show in the sun in the summertime. An amazing show. [Editor's note: Selections from this show were officially released in 2009 as Road Trips Volume 2 Number 3, which is available on streaming platforms.]


Loud and Clear: The Grateful Dead's Wall of Sound and the Quest for Audio Perfection will be released by St. Martin's Press on June 17.

Meghan Markle celebrated Father's Day with a rare glimpse into her private family life. On Sunday, June 15, the Duchess of Sussex shared a heartfelt Instagram video tribute to Prince Harry featuring never-before-seen footage of him with their two children, 6-year-old Prince Archie and 4-year-old Princess Lilibet.

Set to Jason Mraz's song “Have It All,” the video captures moments of Harry laughing with his kids, following Archie on a bike ride, and holding both children during their younger years. The tribute marked one of Meghan's most personal posts since returning to social media earlier this year.

“The best,” she wrote in the caption. “Happy Father's Day to our favorite guy 💕.”

The post quickly drew attention, offering a rare look at the family's life in Montecito, California, where Harry and Meghan have lived since stepping back from their royal roles in 2020.

Since their royal exit, Harry and Meghan have raised Archie and Lilibet away from the public eye. Both children share their father's red hair, which Harry has credited to his late mother's family.

“The Spencer gene is very, very strong,” Harry said during a 2023 appearance on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.” He added, “I actually really, genuinely thought at the beginning of my relationship [with Meghan] that should this go the distance and we have kids, that there's no way the ginger gene will stand up to my wife's genes, but I was wrong! Go gingers.”

The Father's Day post also comes amid ongoing tension between Harry and his father, King Charles III. In a BBC interview on May 2, Harry said, “He won't speak to me because of this security stuff,” referring to his legal battle to reinstate U.K. protection for his family.

“I would love reconciliation with my family,” he continued. “There's no point in continuing to fight anymore. Life is precious. I don't know how much longer my father has.”

As reported by People, the palace has denied that King Charles has the power to restore the high-level security Harry is seeking. Since moving to the U.S., the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have returned to the U.K. only once with their children, for Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee in 2022.

As Meghan continues to use her Instagram handle @meghan to spotlight personal moments and professional projects, the Father's Day tribute stood out for its emotional tone and family-first focus.

Nick Cave said Morrissey recently contacted him with an offer to provide vocals on a new song of his. It's something Cave, a longtime fan, said he “would have been happy to do,” were it not for the fact that Morrissey wasn't asking him to sing a verse or provide backing vocals, but intro the track with “an unnecessarily provocative” spoken-word speech. 


	Responding to a fan question on his “Red Hand Files” website regarding his relationship with Morrissey, Cave said the former Smiths frontman reached out to him last year about the song via email. Cave called the track “quite lovely,” but said it “began with a lengthy and entirely irrelevant Greek bouzouki intro.” (A bouzouki is a long-necked string instrument.)


	Over this instrumental intro, Cave continued, Morrissey wanted him to deliver a “slightly silly anti-woke screed [Morrissey] had written.” Cave did not share any details about the salvo, and even admitted, “I suppose I agreed with the sentiment on some level.” But, he said, “it just wasn't my thing,” so he “politely declined” the offer. 

	











	“I try to keep politics, cultural or otherwise, out of the music I am involved with,” Cave said. “I find that it has a diminishing effect and is antithetical to whatever it is I am trying to achieve.”

	Despite not knowing what exactly Morrissey had written for Cave, it's not exactly difficult to imagine. Over the past few years, Morrissey has regularly courted controversy with some of his more far-right views, especially over immigration. Since he released his last solo album, 2020's I Am Not a Dog on a Chain, Morrissey has teased several follow-ups, but none have been released yet. In an interview last year, Morrissey claimed that one LP had been “gagged” and “idiot culture” was preventing its release.

	











	Even without new music, though, Morrissey has remained busy on the road. He completed a run of North American shows earlier this spring, and just kicked off a European trek that'll stretch through August. He has another leg of North American concerts scheduled for September and October.

The juror said he spends the week in his Bronx apartment and weekends with his daughter in New Jersey, which was not made clear previously. 


							By 

	Kevin Dolak



	After a week of arguments between prosecutors and the rap mogul's defense team, a juror in Sean “Diddy” Combs' sex trafficking and racketeering trial has been dismissed after the Southern District of New York judge overseeing proceedings announced there were discrepancies in where the juror resides, saying he showed a “lack of candor” with the court.


	U.S. District Court Judge Arun Subramanian dismissed Juror No. 6 on Monday morning after telling the court that “concerns about his candor and whether he shaded answers to get on and stay on the panel” led to his decision. Whether Juror No. 6, a Black male, lives within New York and, therefore, in the bounds of the Southern District of New York, or lives with his girlfriend in New Jersey, was the question. He had indicated New York residency in jury selection, but was overheard discussing residing in New Jersey at one point. Upon questioning, he said he lives in his Bronx apartment during the week and spends weekends in New Jersey with his daughter and her mother.

	“There are serious questions about the juror's candor and the juror's ability to follow the court's instructions,” Subramanian said, emphasizing that an individual who appears to have a personal agenda must not sit on a jury. “Removal of the juror is required, in this court's view.”

	The dismissal of the juror is another win for federal prosecutors. Last week, lead prosecutor Maurene Comey had requested that the juror be dismissed for what she described as “a lack of candor.” Combs' defense team is crying foul and, for a third time, has asked for a mistrial, pointing out that the dismissed juror is of the same gender and race as the defendant. In a letter to the judge from the entire defense team, they wrote that the jurors' inconsistencies over his residence were “likely completely benign.”

	











	Add their statement, “The government's motion must be evaluated in light of the entire history of this investigation and prosecution, and not in isolation. Unfortunately, when considered against that background, it is impossible to believe that this motion is merely a good-faith attempt to raise a valid question about the juror's integrity rather than an effort to take advantage of an opportunity to strike yet another Black male from the jury.”


	The alternate juror who will replace Juror No. 6 is a 57-year-old white male accountant from Westchester County in New York.


	Meanwhile, questions have arisen around another juror hearing the case, this time over conversations he may have had with a colleague. Judge Subramanian questioned the juror on Friday and gave him his phone. As of Monday morning, no determination has been made on his potential dismissal.


	Combs was arrested in September and is facing five criminal counts in the federal trial, which has now entered its sixth week after a May 5 start date. The charges include one count of racketeering in conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty and denied all charges.


	The trial was originally said to last eight weeks and appears to be running on time, despite this and other setbacks. Prosecutors were expected to rest their case on Wednesday and Judge Subramanian has consistently said he wants to have the case to the jury and ideally have it wrapped up before the July 4 holiday.

	President Donald Trump's family has launched yet another unscrupulous cash grab attempting to profit off the current president's name and public image: Trump Mobile, a wireless phone service. 


	If the crypto companies, branded bibles, social media platforms, colognes, sneakers, and other grifty products branded with the face of President Donald Trump weren't enough of an indication that the Trump family is attempting to milk the presidency for every cent they can, the announcement of Trump Mobile was timed specifically to coincide with “the 10-year anniversary of their father's launch of his historic presidential campaign,” according to a press release issued by the Trump Organization. 


	The Trump Organization is currently in the custody of President Trump's two eldest sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, whose familial ties to the president have led to a surely coincidental explosion of business under the second Trump presidency, one that tests every known ethics and anti-corruption law in the books. Trump Mobile is essentially another licensing deal, and features a disclaimer indicating that “Trump Mobile, its products and services are not designed, developed, manufactured, distributed or sold by The Trump Organization or any of their respective affiliates or principals. T1 Mobile LLC uses the ‘Trump' name and trademark pursuant to the terms of a limited license agreement which may be terminated or revoked according to its terms.”  

	











	Trump Mobile's initial launch features plenty of branding and special offers stacked with indirect references to President Trump without featuring an outright product endorsement by the commander in chief. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The company will sell a golden “T1” smartphone (set to launch in August) and “the 47 plan,” a cell service plan priced at $47.45 a month – a reference to Trump's two presidential terms. One could assume that the decision to reverse the term numbers out of the correct 45-47 order reflects the money-minded family's desire to ensure that the nod to their patriarch nets them an extra $1.98 from their customers every month. 


	So confident are the Trump's that the president's legions of supporters will fork over cash at any opportunity, that they didn't even bother with producing their own images, instead using shoddily edited stock photography to fill out their website.

	“Trump Mobile is going to revolutionize cell phones,” Eric Trump told Fox Business on Monday morning.

The high court finally ends an unsuccessful legal battle over accusations that Sheeran's hit "Thinking Out Loud" infringed Gaye's iconic track.


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



Ed Sheeran's next tour isn't going to include a stop at the U.S. Supreme Court.


	In an order issued Monday, the high court refused to revive a long-running lawsuit that claimed Sheeran's 2014 hit “Thinking Out Loud” infringed Marvin Gaye‘s famed 1973 jam “Let's Get It On.”


	The star's legal accuser — a company that owns a partial stake in Gaye's 1973 song — had asked the justices to hear the case, which was dismissed in November by a lower court that ruled the two tracks share only basic “musical building blocks.”


	But the justices denied that request on Monday, allowing that earlier ruling to stand. As is typical, the Supreme Court did not offer any explanation for why it had refused to hear the case. The high court hears only a tiny fraction of the cases it receives.


	Sheeran has faced multiple lawsuits over “Thinking,” a 2014 track co-written with Amy Wadge that reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and ultimately spent 58 weeks on the chart.




			Trending on Billboard		







	He was first sued by the daughter of Ed Townsend, who co-wrote the famed 1973 tune with Gaye – a case that ended with a high-profile jury verdict clearing Sheeran. He was then hit with a separate case by Structured Asset Sales (SAS), an entity owned by industry executive David Pullman that controls a different stake in Townsend's copyrights to the legendary song.


	That suit was rejected in November by the federal Second Circuit appeals court, which said the lawsuit was essentially seeking “a monopoly over a combination of two fundamental musical building blocks.”


	“The four-chord progression at issue — ubiquitous in pop music — even coupled with a syncopated harmonic rhythm, is too well-explored to meet the originality threshold that copyright law demands,” the appeals court wrote. “Overprotecting such basic elements would threaten to stifle creativity and undermine the purpose of copyright law.”


	In a petition to the Supreme Court in March, SAS argued that the earlier ruling had unfairly restricted the case to written sheet music rather than Gaye's iconic recorded version. It claimed that problem would impact “the rights of thousands of legacy musical composers and artists, of many of the most beloved and enduring pieces of popular music.”


	But in a response filing last month, Sheeran's lawyers said SAS was using a “false premise” and “baseless assertions” to try to get the justices to revive the case: “The petition should be denied.”


	Monday's denial will finally end SAS's lawsuit against Sheeran, but the pop star not quite out of the legal woods just yet. Pullman's company later filed a second, more novel case in which it is seeking to sue Sheeran over the more detailed recorded version of Gaye's song; that case has been paused for years while the earlier lawsuit plays out.


	In a statement to Billboard on Monday, Pullman said that separate case “will now go forward” in federal court: “Defendants fear has always been the sound recording of ‘Let's Get It On',” Pullman said. “The U.S. Supreme Court was aware of this and understands that the case will go forward and may very well be back at the U.S. Supreme Court at a later date.”


	In his own statement Monday, Sheeran's attorney Donald Zakarin praised the justices for rejecting a “false narrative” aimed at reviving the case. And he strongly dismissed Pullman's statements about the remaining case against Sheeran, stressing that a jury found the star had independently created “Thinking.”


	“Pullman's completely unauthorized and improper purported registration of the Marvin Gaye recording of ‘Let's Get It On,' 50 years after it was created, will not change that fact,” Zakarin said. “If he truly believed that the second case he filed was so compelling – which it is not – he would not have spent the last two years pursuing his failed first case.”

The singer said he's "exhausted" by thinking about himself all the time while posting what appeared to be text of a nasty break-up with a former friend.

Justin Bieber has heard all the comments from fans who are worried about his health and well-being, as well as those offering him advice on how to live his life. “People keep telling me to heal,” Bieber wrote on Monday morning (June 16) in a post cued to WizKid's “Blessed.” 


	“Don't you think if I could have fixed myself I would have already? I know I'm broken. I know I have anger issues,” the singer added. “I tried to do the work my whole life to be like the people who told me I needed to be fixed like them. And it just keeps making me more tired and more angry. The harder I try to grow, the more focussed on myself I am.” 

	











	The singer concluded by writing, “Jesus is the only person who keeps me wanting to make my life about others. Because honestly I'm exhausted with thinking about myself lately aren't you?” The post came just hours after the singer shared an image of what appeared to be his hand holding a burning blunt, as well as what appeared to be a back and forth with what appeared to be a now-former friend.

	“I will never suppress my emotions for someone. Conflict is a part of relationship. If you don't like my anger you don't like me,” he wrote. “My anger is a response To pain I have been thru. Asking a traumatized person not to be traumatized is simply mean.” 


	The conversation then got heated when the unidentified other person responded that they were “not used to someone lashing out at me. It's not hat I don't see and feel your anger.” Bieber was non-plussed, quickly calling an end to their relationship. “Ouch. This friendship is officially over,” he wrote. “I will never accept a man calling my anger lashing out. I enjoyed our short lived relationship. I wasn't kidding when I told u I didn't need u as a friend. I have good friends. Who will respect these boundaries.” 


	The singer then got testy, telling the person he always considered them a “p–sy… which is why I alway kept my distance but I was willing to give you the benifit [sic] of the doubt. This confirms u were the p–sy I always thought u were [middle finger emoji].”


	Speaking of the middle finger, Bieber also celebrated Father's Day on Sunday with a salty one-finger salute Instagram post that read, “I'm a dad that's not be be f–ked with [middle finger emoji].”


	He ended by asking the person to leave him alone, noting that he is now blocking them. At press time a spokesperson for Bieber had not returned Billboard‘s request for comment on the posts.


	Bieber has been on a posting spree lately, bouncing between cryptic images and close-up selfies, brief glimpses of the back of his and wife Hailey Biebers' infant son, Jack Blues, and serious posts in which he lashes out at unsolicited advice. “Telling other humans they deserve something is like raising someone else's kids,” he wrote on June 3. “Who are you to tell someone what someone should or shouldn't have. The audacity. That's not your place. God decides what we deserve.”

	











	Back in March, Bieber sparked concern when he told fans he felt like he was “drowning” in “hate” and struggling with feeling “unworthy.” Bieber has been largely off the music radar since canceling a tour in 2022 to deal with the effects of Ramsay Hunt syndrome, which included partial facial paralysis. He appears to be working on the follow-up to his 2021 album Justice, but at press time on additional information was available on that project.

Pope Leo XIV met Al Pacino and film producer Andrea Iervolino to talk about their film 'Maserati: The Brothers,' according to Iervolino.


							By 

	Lily Ford



	Hollywood A-lister Al Pacino became the first movie star to meet with Pope Leo XIV.


	The 85-year-old had an audience with the new American pope, elected after the death of Pope Francis, at the Vatican on Monday. According to reports in Italy, Pacino arrived in Rome by private jet from New York City over the weekend.




	“We are honored to announce that this morning His Holiness Pope Leo XIV received in a private audience at the Holy See a delegation from the film Maserati: The Brothers, including Oscar winner actor Al Pacino and the film's producer Andrea Iervolino,” Iervolino said in a statement given to The Hollywood Reporter.

	The meeting was “a moment of profound spiritual and cultural inspiration,” the producer continued, saying that the discussion centered around “shared values that lie at the heart of both the Catholic Church and the film: family unity, love, compassion and the importance of contributing to the common good.”


	He continued: “These values, which Pope Leo XIV has consistently emphasized in his recent messages to the world, resonate deeply with the story of the Maserati brothers: a family whose legacy was built not only on innovation and excellence but on profound mutual respect, solidarity and a shared vision.”


	Last month, it was confirmed that Pacino had joined the cast of Bobby Moresco's film in the role of Vincenzo Vaccaro, a businessman and early investor in the auto dynasty.


	Gina La Piana, Tatiana Luter, Anthony Hopkins, Andy Garcia, Jessica Alba, Michele Morrone and Salvatore Esposito round off the cast for the film, currently shooting in Italy.

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: Sydney Chandler, star of FX and Noah Hawley's upcoming Alien: Earth, and Shōgun star Takehiro Hira are currently in production on road-trip sci-fi film Anima, which is being produced by celluloid only outfit Kebrado and Fieldhouse Pictures.


	Written and directed by documentarian Brian Tetsuro Ivie (Emanuel) in his narrative directorial debut, the film tells the story of an impulsive young woman and a reclusive older man who launch on a poignant cross‑country road trip. Their mission: to preserve his failing consciousness via an experimental memory‑upload procedure at a cutting‑edge facility.

	Brian Tetsuro Ivie, Harrison Allen, and Gregory Daniel King produce for Kebrado; Kimberly Atwood and Atty Cleworth produce for Fieldhouse Pictures; Alexander Lycette and Chloe Rahal produce for Gilbara; and Jason Pamer and Brev Moss are additional producers for the project. Moss also serves as a co-story writer.

	Brian Tetsuro Ivie is a Japanese-American filmmaker, film producer, and the co-founder of Kebrado, a celluloid-only media company based in New York. All Kebrado pictures are shot exclusively on 70mm, 35mm, or 16mm film stock. He was formerly an executive producer for NBA star Stephen Curry and his Unanimous Media. His most recent producing work includes Wildcat, starring Maya Hawke, Laura Linney, and Cooper Hoffman, which debuted at Telluride and Toronto, and the upcoming Concessions, starring Michael Madsen, Steven Ogg, and Josh Hamilton. As a director, he is in post on Serenity, a documentary about a multi-generational family in the Pacific Northwest.

	











	Chandler will next be seen leading FX's Alien: Earth, directed by Noah Hawley, and launching in August. She recently appeared in Apple TV+'s Sugar opposite Colin Farrell, and is known for playing Chrissie Hynde in FX's Pistol, directed by Danny Boyle, and the movie Don't Worry Darling.


	Hira was most recently seen starring in FX/Hulu hit Shōgun, for which he was nominated for an Emmy and Critic's Choice Award. Earlier this year, he was also seen in Guy Maddin's Rumours opposite Cate Blanchett as well as Marvel's Captain America: Brave New World. Upcoming credits include Lionsgate's Karoshi opposite Cynthia Erivo and Teo Yoo, Searchlight's Rental Family opposite Brendan Fraser, and he'll reprise his role in Apple TV+'s Monarch: Legacy of Monsters. 


	“I've always loved road movies and I'm very thankful to have two brilliant actors on the journey with me. I really think people will be surprised by where the story goes,” said Brian Tetsuro Ivie. 


	“Anima is a dream realized on so many levels. The team—both in front of and behind the camera—represents some of the most fearless, talented, and innovative voices working today. It's the kind of film audiences around the world are yearning for: commercially compelling, emotionally authentic, and unwavering in its artistic vision,” added producer Atwood.


	Chandler is represented by UTA and Jackoway Austen. Hira is represented by Principal Entertainment LA and Jackoway, Austen. Fieldhouse Pictures is repped by Lon Haber & Co.

Justin Bieber has been documenting what appears to be an intense period of self-reflection through a series of Instagram posts for more than three months. In his latest upload, the 31-year-old responded to the people who “keep telling me to heal,” writing: “Don't you think if I could have fixed myself I would have already? I know I'm broken. I know I have anger issues.”


	Bieber added: “I tried to do the work my whole life to be like the people who told me I needed to be fixed like them. And it just keeps making me more tired and more angry. The harder I try to grow, the more focussed on myself I am. Jesus is the only person who keeps me wanting to make my life about others. Because honestly I'm exhausted with thinking about myself lately aren't you?”


	Over the past few weeks, Bieber has found himself at the center of increasingly tense run-ins with paparazzi. Viral footage shows the musician pleading with the swarms of photographers around him, urging them to see him as a human being and respect his privacy. This weekend, one clip surfaced showing him telling paparazzi that he is “not afraid to set boundaries,” adding: “I don't know you. You don't go to people you don't know and say shit out of nowhere with a camera in their face. It doesn't matter if I'm a celebrity or not. It doesn't matter if I'm a public figure.”

	











	These interactions come as Bieber continues to open up online about struggles within his interpersonal relationships and internal battles stemming from fame. A recent Instagram post from the singer shared screenshots of a conversation with an unnamed person who told him, “I'm not used to someone lashing out at me. It's not that I don't see and feel your anger.” Bieber responded with a declaration that his friendship with this person “is officially over.”

	Bieber's posts from earlier this year found him interrogating the weight of growing up in the public eye. “I was always told when I was a kid not to hate,” he wrote in March. “But it made me feel like I wasn't allowed to hate it and so I didn't tell anyone I've had it. Which made me feel like I have been drowning feeling unsafe to acknowledge it. I think we can only let hate go by first acknowledging it's there. How couldn't we feel hate from all of the hurt we have experienced?”


	Bieber recently split from his longtime manager Scooter Braun, who acknowledged that their relationship is “not the same that it was,” and other members of his team. Representatives for the singer have denied reports that the singer is in “alleged financial distress” and slammed public obsession over the singer's mental and physical health as being “exhausting and pitiful.”

Devo and the B-52's are hitting the road for a co-headline tour this autumn. Billed as a continuation of the farewell tours both bands announced earlier in the decade, the Cosmic De-Evolution Tour will take the bands from Toronto to Houston between late September and early November. Lene Lovich supports. Check out the itinerary below.

In a press release, several band members had something to say, starting with the B-52's' Fred Schneider: “In 2022, I swore I'd never get on a tour bus again,” he said. “But we were careful to say to our fans that we would still perform in special situations that don't require all of the awful tour travel. Our Vegas residency is going great, and when we were offered the chance to do a small run of shows with Devo, we all said this is an extraordinary opportunity we couldn't say no to.”

Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh said, “The B-52's had one of the best sounds of any of the bands out there in the late '70s early '80s—‘Rock Lobster' is one of my favorite songs—Devo used to sing it to Booji Boy after Devo shows. It was either fate or luck or the SNL anniversary that brought us all together to create this amazing chance to go out on tour. All I can say is Cosmic Devolution is REAL!”

Added the B-52's' Kate Pierson, “When we first came from Athens to New York City to perform, punk was in full force… and new wave was right on its tail! We loved all the new wave groups, including Patti Smith, Talking Heads, Blondie and the Ramones. We also really dug the far-out weirdness of Devo, which seemed very in tuned to our sensibilities. We remember one of our first shows—amazed that David Bowie, Brian Eno, Frank Zappa, Allen Ginsberg, Talking Heads, and Blondie all came to see us! When we opened the Mudd Club, we partied with Devo and really hit it off on the dance floor. Later, Brian Eno went onto to produce Devo's incredible first album… and now we will align again! So put on your wig hats and Devo bonnets and get ready to party! This is going to be wild.”

Said Cindy Wilson, “When both of our bands performed at the recent SNL 50 concert at Radio City, we started talking and agreed we had to do these shows. Believe or not, we've never done more than a festival or two together in all this time. This will be amazing and I can't wait for the B-52's to share these stages with Devo!”

And Devo's Gerry Casale added, “Devo and the B-52's on tour together! That it took almost 50 years to happen is rather mind-blowing. But better late than never. We each did something right in different ways that withstood the test of time. Now we're here to prove we can still ‘bring it' as they say!'

Smith explains why he turned down the lead role in Christopher Nolan's multi-layered thriller — but he wasn't the only A-lister to reject it. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


	The next time Will Smith gets offered an alternate reality sci-fi thriller, he should seriously consider just saying, “Yes!”


	First, the actor admitted he turned down The Matrix, which cast Keanu Reeves instead.




	Now Smith confirms he also turned down the lead role Christopher Nolan‘s Inception, which starred Leonardo DiCaprio.


	“I don't think I've ever said it publicly before, but I am going to say it now because we are opening up to one another,” Smith told the radio station KISS XTRA, with a fair amount of good humor. “Chris Nolan brought me Inception first and I didn't get it. I've never said that out loud. Now that I think about it, it's those movies that go into those alternate realities they don't pitch well. But I am hurt by those, too … It hurts too bad to talk about.”

	The Independence Day star turning down 1999's The Matrix is actually pretty understandable, as writers-directors The Wachowskis were still an unknown quantity at the time. Rejecting 2010's Inception when Nolan was coming off his blockbuster masterpiece The Dark Knight, however, seems like a more baffling move. Yet he wasn't the only A-list actor to pass on the role — likely due to Nolan's high-pressure casting strategy.


	In Inception, the lead character plants ideas in people's dreams as a novel form of corporate espionage. As The Hollywood Reporter revealed at the time, Nolan first offered the twisty script to Brad Pitt but demanded the actor accept within 48 hours. When Pitt didn't commit, Nolan went to Smith. When Smith didn't accept, Nolan sent it to DiCaprio, who took it.


	“It's never couched as, ‘Hey, I'm more important than you, therefore just say yes,'” said an executive, noting big stars “are used to having people wait a year or more” before they commit and “usually don't have to board a moving train.”

	











Inception went on to gross more than $800 million at the global box office. Needless to say, nowadays the Oscar-winning director can probably get top actors to sign onto a project even without showing them a script.

	As for The Matrix, Smith has candidly detailed the pitch meeting for that project and recently did a music video for “Beautiful Scars” where Smith played a parody version of Neo. 


	“I'm not proud of it, but it's the truth, all right, I did turn down Neo in The Matrix,” Smith said in a YouTube video posted five years ago. “After we made Men in Black, the Wachowskis came in and they'd only done one movie. They did a movie called Bound. And then they made a pitch for The Matrix. And as it turns out, they're geniuses, but there's a fine line in a pitch meeting between genius and what I experienced in the meeting. So this is the actual pitch that they made for The Matrix …”


	At this point in the video, Smith humorously enacted a meeting where the Wachowskis enthuse confusingly about various wild action moves the character would be doing, but didn't discuss the film's plot or character (“And then we'll put in 50 cameras, and you'll see the whole jump while you stop in the middle of the jump …”).


	“So I made Wild Wild West [instead],” Smith admitted, referring to his notorious 1999 sci-fi flop.


	Having said that, Smith added, “Keanu was perfect. Laurence Fishburne was perfect. If I had done it, because I'm Black, [Fishburne's character] Morpheus wouldn't have been Black because they were looking at Val Kilmer [for] Morpheus. So I probably would have messed The Matrix up. I would have ruined it. I did y'all a favor.”

The first season of the Paramount+ series “Tulsa King” was an immediate hit with action fans who were thrilled to see Sylvester Stallone back in his element as tough guy Dwight Manfredi, a New York mobster who finds himself hilariously out of his element in Tulsa, Oklahoma. One of the show's many pleasures was seeing the '80s action icon not only going back to his roots, but doing what he used to do better than ever — the show's irresistible blend of sardonic comedy and visceral set pieces gave Stallone the best part of his career and his most entertaining showcase since Walter Hill‘s “Bullet to the Head” almost 15 years ago.

 










Expectations were therefore high for Season 2 to match or surpass the quality of action that had been established, and “Tulsa King” stunt coordinator Freddie Poole felt the pressure. “Riding on the heels of Season 1's success, I knew we wanted to do something bigger,” Poole told IndieWire, noting that increasing the ambition was no easy task given the show's challenging production schedule. “We're always shooting two episodes at the same time and prepping two others while we're shooting, so that's four episodes you're in charge of at once. It becomes like a puzzle that I'm trying to work out.”

Although Poole may have felt stretched thin — he says the single hardest thing about stunt coordinating on “Tulsa King” is properly allocating his time — the strain doesn't show in any of Season 2's set pieces, which more than deliver on the show's signature blend of dark comedy and shocking violence. In episode 9, for example, there's an elaborate shoot-out at the Fennario horse ranch that involves a rival gang and Manfredi's soldiers going head to head. The combination of gunplay, hand-to-hand combat, slashings, and stabbings happens so quickly that it's funny and disturbing in equal measures.

To stage the scene, Poole looked to a modern action classic for inspiration. “The thing about that sequence is there's not a lot of dialogue,” Poole said. “So what can we do to fill the screen with something that's really cinematic? One of the movies I always reference is ‘Last of the Mohicans,' where in the last nine minutes there's very little dialogue but they tell quite a bit of story.” Once Poole broke down the script and figured out the key story points that needed to be made, he mapped out the action to have each beat of violence build to those points, and all at once — resulting in one of the most exhilarating pieces of action filmmaking this year.

Later in that same episode, Manfredi's main rival Ming is dispatched with a tomahawk to the head in another gory but grimly funny moment. Selling that gag required a close collaboration between Poole, actor Rich Ting, and the special effects department to create a prosthetic appliance that enabled the crew to shoot the moment practically on set. “The special effects makeup team created a life cast of Rich Ting, and then made the prosthetic so we could basically just lay the prop axe in his head,” Poole said. “That allowed us to get really creative with the scene.”

 










Perhaps the most impressive set piece in Season 2 of “Tulsa King” is the fight at the wind farm that takes place in episode five, and it's one that required considerable planning on the part of Poole and his team. “That required a lot because it wasn't just Sylvester Stallone fighting someone else,” Poole said. “It was a big group versus another group.” To prep for the sequence, Poole created two separate pre-viz videos, a preliminary one shot on a stage with marks where the action would be laid out, and a second one that refined the plan once Poole was able to work on the actual location.

“Then we had a rehearsal day with the actors where we rotated the cast as we brought them in to dial in all their action choreography,” Poole said, noting that he wanted to give emphasis to one particular actor, Mike Walden, who plays Manfredi's soldier Bigfoot. “Mike is a wrestler by trade, so I just hit him up and said, ‘Hey, let's spitball here. What kinds of things are you known for? What do you like to do in the ring? Let's incorporate some of that into this fight sequence.' That gave us certain moments that are comedic in the middle of a sequence that's otherwise serious in tone.”

Poole gives Stallone credit for collaborating on the action sequences to work out not only his own beats but those of the other actors. “He always has thoughts and input, and there's a certain level of trust in our relationship,” Poole said, noting that he's been collaborating with Stallone since he first worked as the actor's stunt double on “Bullet to the Head” and “Escape Plan.” Poole said he knew he had something with the wind farm sequence when Stallone stayed on set after his pieces were shot just to watch what was going on.

 










“I said, ‘Sly, you're done. You're wrapped. Thanks for being here,'” Poole said. “And he just pulled up a chair and hung out and watched.” At one point, Poole overheard Stallone making a comment to someone else about him that summed up how he feels protected by the actor when they work together. “He said, ‘He's in his element. Let him be.' There's a huge underlying message in those two little sentences. It means he has my back. This is a cutthroat business, and to have his unwavering support means a lot.”

	Vance Boelter, the man suspected of assassinating a Minnesota Democratic representative and her husband, was taken into custody Sunday after a two-day search.


	As The New York Times reports, Boelter surrendered to police officers after he was found in the woods near his home outside of Green Isle, Minnesota. Boelter was reportedly armed when police confronted him, but no force was used during the arrest. As of Monday morning, June 16, Boelter was being held at the Hennepin County Jail in downtown Minneapolis.


	Boelter was charged with two counts of second-degree murder for allegedly killing Democratic Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark in what Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said “appears to be a politically motivated assassination.” Boelter is also facing two counts of attempted second-degree murder for shooting and wounding Democratic State Senator John A. Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. (Boelter has yet to enter a plea in court.)


	Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said on social media that Boelter would also face first-degree murder charges, but those require a grand jury indictment first. The FBI and federal prosecutors are also discussing whether to bring federal charges against Boelter, too.

	Authorities said Boelter disguised himself as a police officer during the attacks, wearing a rubber mask and fake badge. Boelter allegedly attacked the Hoffmans first early Saturday morning, June 14, with their daughter calling the police about the shooting not long after 2 a.m. local time. 

	











	After learning that a politician was targeted, authorities sent officers to the nearby home of the Hortmans. Police said they arrived in time to see Boelter shoot Mark Hortman. They then exchanged gunfire with the suspect before he was able to flee. When officers entered the house, they found Melissa Hortman dead.

	Upon finding and searching Boelter's car, police recovered a stash of papers and a notebook that reportedly lists about 70 potential targets. These included numerous prominent Democratic politicians in Minnesota, including U.S. Senator Tina Smith and Representatives Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison, and Angie Craig. Other targets included politicians from neighboring states, civic and business leaders, and Planned Parenthood centers. Police also said some of the documents indicated that Boelter may have been planning to target the anti-Trump “No Kings” protests that took place on Saturday.


	Boelter and his wife, Jenny, appeared to run a private security company. They also appeared to lead a Christian nonprofit called Revoformation Ministries, as well as a company called Red Lion Group that claimed to create jobs for people in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A friend of Boelter's told the Times he voted for Donald Trump in the 2024 election and was particularly opposed to abortion.

Cass McCombs has announced his first solo studio album in three years: Interior Live Oak is out August 15 via Domino. The singer-songwriter's follow-up to 2022's Heartmind features the new single “Peace.” Check it out below.

After a streak of records with the record label Anti-, McCombs returned to his longtime home of Domino for Interior Live Oak and reunited with old collaborators from his catalog, like Matt Sweeney, Chris Cohen, and Papercuts' Jason Quever. “Peace” is the second preview from the LP, too, following “Priestess.”

Last year, McCombs surprise-released the album Seed Cake on Leap Year, a collection of previously unreleased music that he recorded at Jason Quever's apartment in San Francisco from 1999 and 2000 while he was living in Berkeley, California. Prior to that, he put out the collaborative effort Mr. Greg & Cass McCombs Sing and Play New Folk Songs for Children in 2023.

EXCLUSIVE: Tommy and Tuppence, Agatha Christie‘s crime-fighting couple, are returning to the screen.


BritBox has greenlit a six-part series that will reimagine Tommy and Tuppence Beresford in the modern world, more than a century after they first appeared together in Christie's The Secret Adversary.


	The series will be made by Lookout Point, the UK producer behind Happy Valley. Phoebe Eclair-Powell (The Road Trip) has penned the drama, her first series commission for television.


	Casting for Tommy & Tuppence, which is produced in association with Agatha Christie Limited, is yet to be confirmed. Filming gets underway later this year.

	Tapping into the cosy crime phenomenon, the series will be set in Hampstead, a leafy and affluent corner of north London, which will become the scene of murder and mystery.


	Tommy and Tuppence have appeared in numerous adaptations over the years, most recently being played by David Walliams and Jessica Raine in Partners in Crime, the 2015 BBC series.


	A 1983 series, titled Agatha Christie's Partners in Crime, aired on ITV, starring James Warwick and Francesca Annis in the title roles. The series won an Emmy for Outstanding Graphic and Title Design.


Tommy & Tuppence was greenlit by Robert Schildhouse, Jon Farrar, and Stephen Nye for BritBox. They executive produce alongside Laura Lankester, Katie Draper, and Louise Mutter for Lookout Point. James Prichard executive produces for Agatha Christie Limited. BBC Studios, which owns Lookout Point, handles global sales.


	Draper said: “Phoebe's wonderful scripts combine screwball comedy, playful romance and thrilling murder to bring an exhilarating modern-day twist to Christie's iconic detective duo.”


	Schildhouse added that the series promises to deliver a “fun blend of romance and mystery.” Eclair-Powell said writing the drama was a “dream come true” for a Christie superfan. “Christie's detective duo are witty, sharp and raring to solve lots and lots of murders whilst asking if they should really be more than just partners in crime,” she added.

	











Tommy & Tuppence joins BritBox's collection of Agatha Christie adaptations, including Towards Zero, Why Didn't They Ask Evans?, and Poirot. BritBox has carried Partners in Crime in the past.

The singer and songwriter whose family has a long tradition of service took time to thank military members for their service.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



OneRepublic singer and producer Ryan Tedder was not among the celebrities who joined in the protests against the Trump administration at the thousands of “No Kings” protests across the U.S. on Saturday. In fact, the songwriter who has worked with Beyoncé and Taylor Swift took to Instagram to protest against the protests, lamenting that they were taking away from the celebration of the nation's armed services.


	“I have around 20 family members & grandparents that all fought in wars from the revolutionary war (actually) through to WWII/Korea.. all politics & parties and righteous indignation aside it's a super bummer that instead of celebrating the 250th anniversary of the US Army and all those who have fought and died on our behalf… we're protesting,” Tedder wrote in a since-expired Instagram Story according to NME.

	











	“I haven't been a card carrying political member of either side for 20 years & think at this point everything is absurd 99% of the time…” Tedder added. “But I'd like to say THANKYOU to all of the Army service members active and retired and those who have given their lives to protect our freedom…to protest.”

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Tedder's comments came on the same weekend that President Trump oversaw his long-desired military parade on Washington, D.C. streets, during which 6,000 soldiers marched alongside 128 tanks in a show of force to celebrate the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary; the unusual display also coincided with Trump's 79th birthday. 


	To counter the Trump event, an estimated three to five million Americans flooded the streets as part of more than 2,100 “No Kings” protest events across the nation, waving often profane signs and listening to speeches decrying what critics call the nation's slip into authoritarianism under Trump.


	Earlier this year, former OneRepublic bassist Tim Myers announced a run for a California House seat held by longtime GOP Rep. Ken Calvert in what he said was an attempt to slow the Trump agenda. “The people in charge are screwing us over just to make a buck. Trump, Musk and these clowns in Washington are cutting cancer research, veterans health care and getting into trade wars, making everything we buy more expensive. All while giving billionaires another tax cut they don't need,” he said in the announcement of his run.

	Close will play Drusilla Sickle, the cruel escort to the District 12 Tributes,  while Porter is Magno Stift, her estranged husband and the Tributes' uninspired designer.


	Close and Porter join Joseph Zada, Whitney Peak, Mckenna Grace, Jesse Plemons, Kelvin Harrison Jr., Maya Hawke, Lili Taylor, Ben Wang, Ralph Fiennes, Elle Fanning and Kieran Culkin in the Francis Lawrence-directed adaptation of the bestselling book by Suzanne Collins.

	The casting news was made official during Lionsgate's presentation here at CineEurope.




			Watch on Deadline		







Sunrise on the Reaping will be released on November 20, 2026. Lawrence is directing from a screenplay adaptation by Billy Ray. Color Force's Nina Jacobson and Brad Simpson will produce. Cameron MacConomy will executive produce. The five films in the franchise have taken in over $3.3 billion at the global box office.


	Producer Nina Jacobson said, “Glenn Close is a dream Drusilla. She brings so much of her intellect and imagination to each role, creating characters who are unforgettable and iconic. I think Glenn and Francis will have a ball bringing Drusilla from the page to the screen.”


	Regarding Porter, Jacobson added, “Billy is one of those rare performers who can dazzle and devastate in equal measure on stage and screen. He made an indelible impression on me when we worked together on Pose, both as an actor and a human being. Casting this show has felt like winning the lottery every time one of our idols said yes to us. To be able to announce Glenn Close and Billy Porter together is an embarrassment of riches that we can all celebrate.” 


	Published on March 18, Sunrise on the Reaping revisits the world of Panem 24 years before the events of The Hunger Games, starting on the morning of the reaping of the Fiftieth Hunger Games, also known as the Second Quarter Quell.

	











Sunrise on the Reaping sold 1.5 million copies in its first week on sale in the U.S., UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The 1.2 million copies sold in the U.S. are twice the first week sales of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes and three times the first week sales of Mockingjay.


	Along with her eight Oscar noms, Close is a three-time Emmy winner, three-time Tony winner, and three-time Golden Globe winner. Her screen credits include Fatal Attraction, Dangerous Liaisons, Albert Nobbs, The Wife, 101 Dalmatians and the acclaimed series Damages, for which she won two Emmys.


	She recently starred in Netflix's Back in Action, Lee Daniels The Deliverance and Apple TV+'s international thriller Tehran. Upcoming projects include Rian Johnson's Knives Out mystery Wake Up Dead Man for Netflix, the Hulu legal drama All's Fair and The Summer Book from Music Box Films. Close is repped by CAA, MGMT Entertainment and Loeb & Loeb.


	Porter won a Tony and a Grammy for Kinky Boots and Tonys for his production of the Best Musical winner A Strange Loop, and the Isabelle Stevenson Award for his humanitarian efforts. Porter just made his West End debut as the Emcee in Cabaret, and is making his London directorial debut with the play This Bitter Earth at Soho Theatre. He won the Emmy Award for Lead Actor in a Drama Series for his role on Pose. Upcoming, he will star for director Gurinder Chandha in Christmas Karma. He is represented by CAA, Amplified and Felker Toczek Suddleson McGinnis Ryan LLP.  


	Meredith Wieck and Scott O'Brien are overseeing the project for Lionsgate. Robert Melnik negotiated the deal for the studio.

From the files of the Police Squad, “The Naked Gun” is back on August 1 in theaters everywhere — the rebooted Liam Neeson version that is. Paramount Pictures has released the theatrical trailer for the continuation of the series from which the similarly-named Leslie Nielsen mined box office gold. 

In the new film, Neeson plays Lt. Frank Drebin, Jr., son of Nielsen's Frank Drebin character. Along for the sure-to-be-wacky ride are Pamela Anderson, Paul Walter Hauser, CCH Pounder, Kevin Durand, Cody Rhodes, Liza Koshy, Eddie Yu, and Danny Huston. Written by Dan Gregor, Doug Maud, and Akiva Schaffer, the movie was directed by Schaffer and produced by Seth MacFarlane and Erica Huggins.

Neeson is not known for playing comedy — although Nielsen wasn't either prior to his straight-faced “Don't Call Me Shirley” turn in 1980's “Airplane!” Neeson told ComingSoon.com last year that he needed to prove his comedic chops.

“I'm slightly nervous of it. A little Stephen Colbert sketch or Ricky Gervais, I'm OK because it's short. But a whole film, we'll see. We'll see,” the action star said. In 2022, after it was announced the movie was in development, Neeson cracked, “It'll either finish my career or bring it in another direction. I honestly don't know.”

 










The last “Naked Gun” entry was released in 1994, just months before co-star O.J. Simpson's became embroiled in controversy after Simpson faced trial — something the first teaser trailer for the reboot cheekily referenced. The original trilogy was based off a failed ABC TV series titled “Police Squad,” also starring Nielsen.

Anderson makes her first big screen appearance since her much-heralded movie comeback “The Last Showgirl,” which netted her SAG and Golden Globes nominations. She told Seth Meyers in January that the “high comedy” of “The Naked Gun” was something she'd “always wanted to do.”

“And Liam is such a gentleman. He's such a sweetheart, such a love, and we just had a great connection. And Akiva is a wonderful director,” Anderson said. “But what a difference, going from an indie film to a Paramount ‘Naked Gun.'”

Anderson added that the “Saturday Night Live” crew was on the set, throwing out new jokes throughout the shoot. “Some were funny, some weren't, but some were — most of them were funny. Liam is hysterical. You're not going to see it coming. That's how good he is.”

“The Naked Gun” blasts into theaters on August 1. Check out the trailer below.

Hallmark fans were thrilled when the network announced in March 2025 that legendary actress Jane Seymour was filming a new holiday series in Ireland, with a working title of “The Twelve Dates of Christmas.” 

When the series, which also stars “Parenthood” alum Mae Whitman and two-time Oscar nominee Mary McDonnell, premieres during Hallmark Channel's Countdown to Christmas programming in late 2025, it will mark Seymour's first new project with Hallmark since she co-starred with Lacey Chabert in 2014's “A Royal Christmas.” 

But she certainly hasn't been missing from Hallmark. Reruns of Seymour's hit 90s series “Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman” air regularly on Hallmark Family and are available to stream on Hallmark+. On June 14, 2025, the actress told Swooon she'd love to revisit the show with her fprmer co-star, Joe Lando. Could Hallmark be the right home for a reboot?

A post shared by Dr.Quinn, Medicine Woman (@dr.quinn_medicine_woman)

The period romance series “Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman” aired on CBS from 1993 to 1997, with Seymour as Dr. Michaela Quinn, a.k.a. Dr. Mike, and Joe Lando as her romantic interest, Byron Sully. The setting was 1860 in Colorado Springs. 

In the nearly 30 years since the show went off the air, Seymour and Lando have remained close friends. So close, in fact, that in January, she welcomed him and his family into her house for several weeks, per Variety, after his home burned to the ground in the Los Angeles wildfires. According to Los Angeles Magazine, she took in Lando, six other members of his family, including his wife, two German Shepherds, and two pet birds.

Telling Swooon they would both love to work together again, Seymour said it could be on “literally anything,” but that no networks have picked up on the idea of a “Dr. Quinn” reboot yet. She noted that she'd jump at the chance “if somebody wanted to, but we haven't found anyone that wants to, which I find astounding since they brought every show that's ever been made back.” 

“Somebody has to put Joe and I together in something,” she continued, noting that her posts often go viral when she features him in them. ”I mean, even looking it up, apparently we don't have to really do anything terribly interesting. It's like seeing us together.” 

The duo did film a Christmas movie called “A Christmas Spark” for Lifetime “a few years ago” she said, but added that “Joe and I are actively looking for something to do just because we love working together, but also because we know the fan base would really be hungry for it.”

In December 2023, Seymour told The Messenger blog — according to Deadline — that despite the popularity of shows like “Yellowstone,” no networks had wanted to pick up her new idea for a reboot of “Dr. Quinn.”

“We've actually got one written, and we've got the whole series planned out,” Seymour said. “We just took it to one of the networks, and they said that they weren't interested in Westerns.”

“I think it's really crazy,” she continued. “There seems to be a lot of very successful Westerns, so I didn't get that at all.”

Hallmark did try a modern-day, Western-infused production with “RIDE” in 2023, but it lasted only one season despite its star-studded cast including Nancy Travis and Marcus Rosner.

The Rock Hall of Famer said the song is a "powerful piece of music that was never intended for political use."

Heart‘s Nancy Wilson and her bandmate and sister Ann Wilson are proud daughters of a Marine Corps major, but the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame guitarist said in a pointed Instagram post on Saturday (June 14) that their band's music is not meant for political purposes. “Earlier today, during a parade held in support of our nation's military and organized by President Donald Trump, the song ‘Barracuda' by Heart was played without permission or authorization from us,” she said of the playing of the group's Billboard Hot 100 No. 11 1977 hit during the military showcase.

	“‘Barracuda,' written and performed by Ann and I, is a powerful piece of music that was never intended for political use,” continued Wilson, who drove home her point by wearing a “No Kings But Us” hat on a day when a historic number of Americans took to the streets from coast to coast to protest against what they called the creeping authoritarianism of the second Trump administration in a series of “No Kings” protests. 


	“As daughters of a U.S. Marine Corps major, we hold a deep and abiding respect for the men and women who serve in our Armed Forces,” wrote Wilson. “On a day meant to honor that service, it's important that music used in such settings reflects not only the tone of the event but also the wishes of the artists who created it.🤘🏻”

	











	According to reports. instrumental versions of Heart's “Barracuda” and Journey's “Separate Ways (World's Apart)” were among the songs played at the event that appeared to draw modest crowds at a reported price of $25-$45 million, while the ACLU said that an estimated five million people took part in more than 2,100 “No Kings” rallies across the nation, making it the largest protest in the nation's history.


	Trump's military parade, which was intended to celebrate the U.S. Army's 250th birthday, also fell on the president's 79th birthday. The parading of military hardware through the streets of the nation's capital is an unusual site in the U.S., though Trump has long mused out loud about wanting to hold such an event. The D.C. event came amidst a day of dramatic news, including Iran and Israel battering each other with missiles in what is ramping up to be a major escalation of hostilities between the two nations. In addition, officials in Minnesota launched a massive manhunt for the suspected shooter who assassinated a Democratic state legislator in that state and attempted assassination of another; the now-captured 57-year-old man, Vance Boelter, allegedly had a list of 70 other potential targets in his car.


	Nancy Wilson has long objected to politicians using her band's music at their rallies, and earlier this year she said she feels “embarrassed” to call herself an American at this time. “We were kind of embarrassed at that time to call ourselves American because of the dirty politics of the Vietnam War,” Wilson said of the period that inspired some of the band's most beloved hits, including the anti-Vietnam war single “Crazy On You,” whose lyrics she added are relevant again. “To be as subtle as possible, it's more embarrassing now.”

	











	She noted that “Barracuda” was initially written about a sleazy industry figure at the time, though Wilson twisted it to fit the current commander in chief, saying the song is “even more relevant in the salacious billionaire culture with the grab-them-by-the-(expletive) mentality,” the latter phrase a reference to an infamous sexist comment from Trump.


	The Wilsons were also peeved when Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin played “Barracuda” at the 2008 Republican National Convention, sending a cease and desist order to the former Alaska governor demanding she stop using the track as her unofficial theme song. In 2018, singer Ann Wilson told The Hill that any politician was free to use “Barracuda” on the campaign trail in 2020. “I think anybody but Trump,” she added.

	Two titans of New Wave, the B-52's and Devo, will team up this fall for the co-headlining Cosmic De-Evolution Tour.


	Although the B-52's embarked on a farewell tour three years ago — they've since confined themselves to a Las Vegas residency — the idea of joining the “Whip It” troupe on the road proved too enticing to ignore. The two bands recently linked up (alongside Fred Armisen) at the all-star SNL 50 concert and discussed the venture.


	“In 2022, I swore I'd never get on a tour bus again, but we were careful to say to our fans that we would still perform in special situations that don't require all of the awful tour travel,” the B-52's Fred Schneider said in a statement. “Our Vegas residency is going great, and when we were offered the chance to do a small run of shows with Devo, we all said this is an extraordinary opportunity we couldn't say no to.”


	The B-52's Cindy Wilson added, “When both of our bands performed at the recent SNL 50 concert at Radio City, we started talking and agreed we had to do these shows. Believe or not, we've never done more than a festival or two together in all this time. This will be amazing and I can't wait for The B-52s to share these stages with Devo!”

	The 11-date Cosmic De-Evolution Tour kicks off September 24 in Toronto and runs through November 2 in Houston. Fellow New Waver Lene Lovich will serve as the trek's opening act before the two headliners take the stage. Tickets for the tour go on sale to the public on June 20 at Live Nation, with pre-sales beginning June 16.

	











	As both bands said in statements, the two acts have long shared a mutual admiration for each other's music.


	“The B-52s had one of the best sounds of any of the bands out there in the late seventies and early eighties – ‘Rock Lobster' is one of my favorite songs – Devo used to sing it to Booji Boy after Devo shows,” Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh said in a statement. “It was either fate or luck or the SNL anniversary that brought us all together to create this amazing chance to go out on tour. All I can say is Cosmic Devolution is REAL!”

	The B-52's Kate Pierson added, “When we first came from Athens to New York City to perform, punk was in full force…and New Wave was right on its tail! We loved all the New Wave groups, including Patti Smith, Talking Heads, Blondie and the Ramones. We also really dug the far-out weirdness of Devo, which seemed very in tuned to our sensibilities. We remember one of our first shows — amazed that David Bowie, Brian Eno, Frank Zappa, Allen Ginsberg, Talking Heads and Blondie all came to see us!  When we opened the Mudd Club, we partied with Devo and really hit it off on the dance floor. Later, Brian Eno went onto to produce Devo's incredible first album…and now we will align again! So put on your wig hats and Devo bonnets and get ready to party! This is going to be wild.”

The 'Last Week Tonight' host criticized the president for sending National Guard troops and Marines into Los Angeles: "Why would you send troops if there is nothing for them to do?"


							By 

	Kimberly Nordyke


Managing Editor, Digital


John Oliver again criticized President Trump on Last Week Tonight, this time over the latter's response to increasing protests against immigration raids across the country.


	“As you undoubtedly know, last weekend, ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] conducted sweeping raids across the country as part of an escalation ordered by Stephen Miller,” the White House deputy chief of staff, Oliver said on Sunday's edition of his show. “Miller reportedly told ICE officials to just go out there and arrest illegal aliens, suggesting they target Home Depots or 7-Eleven convenience stores. So that's what happened, and from the start, it was a mess.”

	Oliver showed a news segment featuring footage of people getting detained by Homeland Security in Los Angeles. A man who was interviewed on camera said, “My friends started yelling ICE, ICE, ICE. I thought he was joking, but he wasn't. Then I saw all the day laborers starting to run.”


	Said Oliver: “That is awful. Someone yelling ICE is almost never going to be a positive thing. Best-case scenario, you've somehow time traveled back to 2014 and have to do an ice bucket challenge, something, by the way, that [Trump] did because he was nominated by, this is true, Mike Tyson, Vince McMahon and Homer Simpson. It was a simpler time,” he quipped.


	Oliver then mentioned the escalating protests in Los Angeles, which prompted Trump to send in thousands of National Guard troops and hundreds of Marines “to protect federal law enforcement from the attacks of a vicious and violent mob,” as Trump put it. 


	“And some of the radical left, they say, ‘Oh, that's not nice,'” Trump added. “Well, if we didn't do it, there wouldn't be a Los Angeles. It'd be burning today, just like the houses were burning a number of months ago” in the devastating fires that swept through areas of L.A. including Pacific Palisades and Altadena.

	











	Said Oliver: “OK, I know I'm not saying anything new right now, but he is such a dick. There is just no reason to bring up the traumatic fires that are still very much on people's minds in L.A. for the same reason you shouldn't open a toast at a retirement party with, ‘Wow, [the] only milestone left after this is death.' Yeah, everyone knows that and we're all trying not to think about it.”


	Oliver then noted that Trump's move was opposed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, among other officials.


	“Why would you send troops if there is nothing for them to do?” Oliver asked. “You're just gonna have 4,000 soldiers wandering around L.A., swinging by the Hollywood Walk of Fame and going, ‘Oh, Christian Slater. OK.'” (The actor received a star on the Walk of Fame earlier this month.)


	Oliver then acknowledged that there was “sporadic vandalism and rock throwing and some Waymo cars were set on fire.”


	“But those were isolated incidents not at all representative of the protest as a whole,” he continued. “And I'm not saying that those aren't striking visuals. I'm just saying setting a driverless car on fire is not the same thing as assaulting someone, unless we're somehow living in the Pixar Cars universe where burning one is murder, and you'd be condemned to hell by the car pope — a real character from Cars 2, by the way, implying there's car Catholicism, car Jesus and presumably a decades-long car cover-up of car sexual abuse.”


	Oliver opined that Trump's response to the protests “felt completely over-the-top, especially when you consider troops will apparently be there for 60 days at a cost to taxpayers of roughly $134 million. And usually when that much is spent on something completely pointless, we at least get to see one of the Avengers in it,” he joked.

Alexis Bellino, known for her role on “The Real Housewives of Orange County,” is entering a new chapter both personally and financially. As she gears up to marry fiancé John Janssen, Bellino has listed her home in San Juan Capistrano for $2.95 million—about $1.65 million more than she originally paid for the property in 2018, per The Daily Dish.

According to Reality Blurb, the listing reflects Bellino's ongoing transition as she prepares to wed Janssen, whom she got engaged to in August 2024 after nine months of dating. The timing aligns with her recent public statements about “more changes” coming to her life.

According to the property listing, the four-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bathroom residence sits inside the exclusive Marbella Country Club, a guard-gated community known for its luxurious amenities. Spanning 3,952 square feet, the home boasts high-end features such as cathedral ceilings, a wine cellar, and a three-car garage. The in-law floor plan and open kitchen-living area add to the home's flexible layout.

Outside, the estate features a heated in-ground pool and spa, an outdoor bar with a built-in barbecue and refrigerator, and a cozy seating area with a fireplace.

A post shared by Alexis Bellino (@alexis_bellino)

Bellino, a mother of three, purchased the home during her divorce from ex-husband Jim Bellino. 

Although the Bravo star has not disclosed where she and Janssen plan to live after the sale, she previously hinted at their current arrangement in a 2024 interview with The Daily Dish. “I mean, we pretty much live together right now, anyway. We bounce back between both homes,” she said. “We decided we're going to keep both homes. I have twins (Mackenna Bellino and Miles Bellino) in high school still. We don't want to uproot anybody from their normal, so we're gonna keep both homes for a while.”

Bellino has also shared that she and Janssen plan to reassess their real estate situation once her twins graduate in 2026. “We'll decide then,” she added. “Of course, we're gonna buy a home together when we decide to not have both homes, but, until then, we're just back and forth.”

The upcoming wedding is expected to take place later this summer, and Bellino has revealed that it will be “very unconventional.” 

In an April interview with People, she teased ceremony and dress details, saying, “The gown is actually complementing exactly what we want the wedding to be. It is unconventional, head to toe.” She added, “I am this bride that did not want conventional and did not want an ordinary dress.”

Justin Timberlake gushed about being a dad in a heartfelt post on Father's Day!

The “SexyBack” singer expressed his happiness at being a father in a touching Instagram post on Sunday, June 15.

“There's no bigger reward or responsibility that I have ever felt in my life above being a father,” he wrote. “To teach and to learn at the same time… I feel beyond blessed.”

A post shared by Justin Timberlake (@justintimberlake)

The 44-year-old shared a trio of images with his two sons Silas, 10, and Phineas, 4. He shares the two with his wife Jessica Biel.

Timberlake expressed his gratefulness for both his dad and his stepdad.

He continued, “I see my two dads, my grandfathers, my uncles more and more clearly every year that I get to experience this life with them. And I see myself more and more clearly in every moment I have with my sons, watching who they continue to become.”

“The Social Network” actor added his warmest wishes to all fathers. “You can't put a price tag on that type of generational wealth! Here's to all the Dads out there! Cheers! Happy Father's Day!” he concluded.

In 2024, Timberlake penned an equally heartwarming tribute, expressing his happiness at being a father to his two sons.

“My 2 greatest gifts. I learn more about myself everyday just because you both chose me to be your Dad,” he began.

He added, “I will always be there for you through your peaks and valleys… to lift you up and show you how high you can take this life and to pick you up when you fall.”

Timberlake noted there will be plenty of dad jokes.

“And, of course, to flood you with insufferable Dad-jokes all along the way. I love you both so much. Thank you for giving me my biggest purpose,” he concluded.

Biel took to her Instagram story to wish her husband a happy Father's Day.

“Happy Father's Day to the best dad out there. We love you so much,” she wrote with a red heart emoji.

“Celebrating you today and forever,” she added alongside an image of Timberlake holding one of their kids.

The two married in October 2012 after years of dating.

Biel previously spoke on raising kids when speaking with InStyle in May.

 “It really takes a village to raise any kid, let alone in a wild business like this where parents are traveling for long times for work,” she said.

Over fifteen seasons, Supernatural delved into urban legends, myths, and lore from all over the world. Sam and Dean Winchester hunted monsters across the country, saving people from things that go bump in the night. Armed with sawed-off shotguns, silver blades, and holy fire, Sam and Dean took on everything from angels and demons to faeries and dragons.

Five years after Supernatural ended, creator Eric Kripke talked about the story he never got to tell and the one he would never tell. Inspired by Roald Dahl's The Gremlins, Kripke wanted to do a story about mischievous creatures that messed with technology. But Kripke purposefully steered clear of one particular religious figure when writing Supernatural.

 Richard Speight Jr. asked Eric Kripke if there was any story he wanted to do but didn't get to. Kripke said, "The one story that I always really wanted to do under my watch that I never got a chance to do was Gremlins. ‘Cause Gremlins are a real mythology that long predated the movie." Gremlins are most famous from the 1984 film.

The furry creatures wreaked havoc on a small town, blowing up washing machines and movie theaters. While there are a few instances of gremlins affecting technology, those mischievous little creatures weren't based on the gremlins to which Kripke was referring. Gremlins are fictional creatures created to explain otherwise inexplicable malfunctions in aircrafts and other machinery. The idea of gremlins became popular among the Royal Air Force pilots and crew during World War II.

Both sides experienced unexplained accidents, so the gremlins were thought to be unbiased tricksters, causing mischief and mayhem wherever they liked. Posters warning of the invisible mischief-makers depicting gremlins greasing floors and throwing things in people's eyes were made during the war. Kripke's gremlins would be more machine-focused.

And so, the Impala is the bad guy of the episode.

When describing his idea for the episode, Kripke said, "And so my notion was, okay, turns out gremlins are so small, you can't see them. So I don't have to make, like, a bunch of puppets. But they get into the Impala. And so, the Impala is the bad guy of the episode... But like all the other cars and electronics, and whatever, the rule was going to be: the only way to stop them was to destroy them totally." With the love Dean has for Baby, that would definitely be a dilemma for the eldest Winchester.

The original premise of Supernatural lacked important elements, and the show wouldn't be the same if Kripke hadn't made some big changes.

"And so then, in the middle of the episode, it was going to infect the Impala," Kripke described. "And so now Dean's like, ‘I can't destroy it. I can't like—how do I get the gremlins out of this thing? And it's like mowing over people and coming after me. But I can't destroy it. I have to save her.'" How Dean saves Baby is still a mystery, but he discussed some of the visual gags he had in mind. "But like that was a story I—like I always loved, and it was totally doable. Like it wasn't like an impossible story to pull off ... It—you know, the only monsters you ever saw would have been like the blender that someone's hand was in or the car."

It's basically all car gags all day.

When thinking back to why Kripke never made an episode about gremlins, he couldn't quite pinpoint the reason, but he said, "You know, I don't know why we never ended up doing it. Maybe, like the—I think it was, like—because they ended up doing like that great episode, ‘Baby,' that was [the one] Robbie wrote that was all within it. But I think at the time, the feeling was like we don't have enough days in the schedule to do, like, a real Impala-centric episode … It's basically all car gags all day."

While Supernatural never had a gremlin episode, something similar did happen in "Mannequin 3: The Reckoning." While it wasn't about imperceptible creatures, Baby was possessed by a ghost, and the Winchesters had to fight their Impala. "Baby" is one of the series' highest-rated episodes, taking place entirely in the Impala. Kripke's gremlins episode would've probably fallen somewhere in between the two.

When on Supernatural Then and Now, Richard Speight Jr. asked Eric Kripke if he'd ever considered including Jesus in the Supernatural mythology. “I wasn't going to touch that with a 10-foot pole, man,” Kripke responded. “Like I'm not getting, like, super specific about Jesus.” Kripke did mention that comic books like Preacher partly inspired Supernatural.

“You know, the, the comic book sources that a lot of that stuff came from, like Preacher, you know, and Garth Ennis. And they were all—I mean—yes, there is sort of like a whacked-out Jesus character in that. But to me, it was like the binary, like God versus Lucifer without getting, like, too specific. You know, so that there're a lot of religions it could play under rather than, you know, being with any one particular religion.”

I wasn't going to touch that with a 10-foot pole, man.

As non-specific as he tried to keep the mythology of the arching plot line of Supernatural's early seasons, Kripke and the writers did eliminate several belief systems in the season five episode “Hammer of the Gods.” Sam and Dean roll up in their iconic Chevy Imapala to a five-star hotel in the middle of nowhere, called the Elysian Fields.

It turned out the hotel was magically renovated to welcome several gods and deities from other faiths. The gods met to discuss what, if anything, they were going to do about the impending apocalypse. It ended in a slaughter at the hands of Lucifer. There were figures from Greek, Norse, Chinese, and Egyptian mythology, and some Hinduism.

Supernatural's "Swan Song" is hailed as Eric Kripke's perfect finale to the series, but his ending is actually much darker and unsatisfying.

The episode was well-received, but inserting deities from belief systems currently being practiced by millions of people didn't go over well with some viewers—namely the representation of Ganesh and Kali. In addition to poorly portraying the gods and what they represent, they made them appear weak, like the pagan gods that are no longer worshiped—although there are over a billion practicing Hindus worldwide. The episode played very heavily into the idea of Christianity as the absolute religion, offending many fans of the series. 

We wanted to be provocative without being, you know, firebombed.

Kripke also joked about finding the line in their storytelling, saying, “And, you know, we wanted to be provocative without being, you know, firebombed, I think.” The decision not to portray the Christian messiah was probably a good call, as the mythology was already limited to Abrahamic religions. Considering how offended a portion of viewers felt by “Hammer of the Gods,” there's a decent chance they could've alienated even more of their audience.

In the hours after Vance Boelter was named as the suspect in the fatal shooting of Melissa Hortman, a Democratic Minnesota state representative, and her husband Mark Hortman, far-right conspiracists and Republican influencers claimed he was a violent, leftist Democrat.

“The far left is murderously violent,” Elon Musk wrote on X on Saturday, a post that remains on the site and has been viewed over 50 million times.

When the facts of the story emerged—that the alleged shooter had been registered in other states as a Republican, was said to have voted for President Donald Trump and, as WIRED reported, had participated in an evangelical ministry where he preached against abortion and demonized the LGTBQ community—the conspiracy theories didn't stop. Instead, they just changed. Posters then claimed the incident was a false flag conducted by the shadowy deep state, while trying to distance the shooter from any connection to the president and the wider MAGA movement.

For years in the wake of mass shootings or politically-motivated violence, the far-right has sought to portray the perpetrators as leftists, members of antifa, part of the LGBTQ community, or connected in some way to the Democratic party, despite all evidence showing that the extremist violence is usually conducted by far-right actors.

On Saturday, as the manhunt for the alleged shooter was underway, conservatives claimed almost immediately that the suspect was linked in some way to Minnesota governor Tim Walz and that the shooting was part of a grand conspiracy to target a Democrat who had recently voted with Republicans in the Minnesota legislature. The alleged shooter was reappointed to a Workforce Development Board by Walz in 2019. But there is no evidence to suggest a closer link between the pair.

This did not stop the term “Walz appointee” from trending on X on Saturday, with right-wing influencers declaring confidently that the alleged shooter was a Democrat.

“Did Walz have her executed?” right-wing commentator Mike Cernovich wrote on X, quoting a post from a well-known conspiracy theory account that highlighted Hortman had voted with Republicans.

YouTuber Benny Johnson, who has almost 5 million followers on the video-sharing site and more than 3 million followers on X, positioned the shooting as part of a growing trend of left-wing violence in a long screed on X that described the alleged shooter as “a left-wing Tim Walz appointee.“

“Everyone talks about Minnesota, but they don't talk about the guy seems to be a leftist,” Donald Trump Jr. said in an an interview with News Nation. “The guy who committed those atrocities this weekend was a Democrat who worked for Tim Walz.” When pressed by the interviewer, who replied, “he voted for your Dad,” Trump Jr. said, “I'll believe that when I see it.”

On Sunday, David Carlson, who has known the alleged shooter since fourth grade and described the 57-year-old as his best friend, dismissed the claims that the alleged shooter was a Democrat, telling reporters Sunday he “would be offended if people called him a Democrat.”

“He's a Trump supporter, he voted for Trump, he liked Trump,” Carlson said, adding: “He listened to InfoWars.” InfoWars is the far-right conspiracy theory channel operated by Alex Jones, the school shooting conspiracist and Pizzagate conspiracy promoter who filed for bankruptcy in 2022. This did not stop Jones from weighing in: “Evidence mounts that the reported Minnesota assassin Vance Luther Boelter is a patsy who is being framed to cover up a larger false flag deep state operation,” Jones wrote on X.

Despite the clear evidence that the alleged shooter was a Trump supporter, those trying to lay the blame on leftists and Democrats fell back on one of the oldest tricks in the conspiracy theorist handbook: Blame the deep state. “The conspiracism about the Minnesota shooting, particularly the allegations that it's a psy-op or false flag, have become the norm with violent incidents of a political nature,” Mike Rothschild, an author who writes about conspiracy theories and extremists, tells WIRED.

Posters, including elected officials, suggested that the narrative pushed by law enforcement—that the alleged shooter was responsible for the murders of the Hortmans—was actually a ruse and ‘psyop.'

“Is it just me or does the man in the mask who they keep saying is the Minnesota shooter look totally different and about 70 pounds skinnier than the fat slob in a cowboy hat the media keeps saying is the shooter?” conspiracy theorist and close Trump ally Laura Loomer wrote on X.

Arizona state senator Wendy Rogers, who has pushed numerous wild conspiracy theories in the past, added to the confusion by quoting a post on X about the suspected shooter's arrest and writing: “Something(s) don't add up. Just sayin.'”

Others pointed to Carlson's interviews as further proof that this was all a set-up: “This is the most lazy psyop false flag crisis actor I've ever seen,” one conspiracy-focused X account wrote above a picture of Carlson.

“When someone on the far-right commits a violent act, [right-wing conspiracy theorists] have to deflect the blame elsewhere, and do it by constructing convoluted conspiracies about the deep state being involved or the left wanting to ‘distract' from something else—because they've convinced themselves and their followers that nobody in their movement could possibly carry out any act of violence,” says Rothschild.

[NoHo Arts District, CA] – A NoHo Arts theatre review of Tiffany Caputo: A Psychic Evening with Long Island's Other Medium at the Hollywood Fringe Festival 2025. 

Vegas has come to the Hollywood Fringe. Well,  in spirit at least! Tiffany Caputo: A Psychic Evening with Long Island's Other Medium deserves to have a residency at the Aladdin or Stardust Hotels in the city that never sleeps. Charlotte Moroz brings Tiffany Caputo to life in the most extravagant way. Charisma oozes out from her every pore. To say the show is entertaining is an understatement. I enjoyed every minute of this ‘experimental solo.'  Ms. Moroz's character work is exemplary and absolutely hilarious.

The strength of the show is in the audience participation. Several folks were called up to get a psychic reading, of sorts, from Ms. Caputo. Hilarity ensues, and when a guest goes off track, Tiffany skillfully brings them back on track. A master of the medium's trade.

Even though the character of Tiffany Caputo does seems a little familiar, Ms. Moroz keeps it fresh and has our full attention every single minute of this brilliant show and her improv skills are top notch.  

At the opening of the show, Tiffany introduces the love of her life, who is not only Tiffany's husband, but assistant as well. His uncredited contribution to the show was a perfect addition, and he fit the whole aesthetic of the medium as entertainment perfectly.

The specificity of Tiffany Caputo and her rivalry with her imagined and far more successful cousin, Teresa Caputo, brings layers of backstory and intrigue and it is this subtext that gives this show its richness. Attention to detail is Ms. Moroz's' secret ingredient that elevates Tiffany Caputo: A Psychic Evening with Long Island's Other Medium. At one point, the folks who were lucky enough to get readings with her were having so much fun, as were we, the audience, that I secretly wished my name would be called next. Alas, sadly it did not happen…

I really loved Tiffany Caputo: A Psychic Evening with Long Island's Other Medium and I am looking forward to more from Charlotte Moroz. I must mention that this was my fourth Hollywood Fringe show on this day and what a great way to end the evening. 

Tiffany Caputo: A Psychic Evening with Long Island's Other Medium is a highlight of the Hollywood Fringe.

Kevin Bacon and Jennifer Nettles have released a new music video for their song "Our Highway," a driving country-rock track that originated from their collaboration on The Bondsman, a supernatural horror series now streaming on Amazon Prime. The show follows Bacon's character, Hub Halloran, a resurrected bounty hunter tasked with capturing escaped demons, and features Nettles as Maryanne Dice, his ex-wife, and a struggling country musician.

The song is one of two that the duo wrote for the series, drawing on their characters' musical past. "'Our Highway' is the second song that Jennifer and I wrote that is in the show, The Bondsman," Bacon explains. "Our characters are musicians. It was fun to go back and write songs from my character, Hub Halloran's, point of view when he was a young man. This would be a song that they had written together when they were first going out. It's a great driving tune about escaping with the one you love and sticking together."

Nettles adds, "Kevin Bacon is a dream collaborator. Everyone knows he's an iconic storyteller, but his gifts extend far beyond the camera. He shines as a songwriter! We wrote these songs for The Bondsman but quickly came to realize they stood firmly on their own as a studio project. We had a ball bringing these songs to life in the studio, in the way we heard them as musicians (to live outside of and beyond the show)."

The series blends horror, action, and heartfelt drama, grounded in themes of redemption, family, and musical roots. "Our Highway" contemplates the romantic past of the characters and the future they had together and captures the essence of youthful love and the thrill of the road ahead.

As Nettles hints, "'Our Highway" is the story of two people heading out on the road in search of a dream. And who knows? We just may head out on the road to share it!!"

Inspired by a lifelong fascination with the paranormal and a love for filmmaking, Gavin Webb is bringing ghost stories from across Arkansas to the screen in a new 10-part series, “Haunted Arkansas,” set to debut on Amazon Prime this fall.

Webb, who lives in Alma, said the idea grew from watching shows like “Ghost Adventures” and movies like “Ghostbusters.” However, he noticed that most paranormal shows visiting Arkansas focused on the same few locations, such as the Crescent Hotel in Eureka Springs or Fort Chaffee.

“I wanted to do something on my own,” Webb said. “I love this. It combines my passion for filmmaking and the paranormal and makes it into a series.”

The series begins with an episode at the Clayton House in Fort Smith and travels to locations across the state, including the St. Francis County Museum in Forrest City, Arkansas Tech in Russellville, and the Old Statehouse Museum in Little Rock. Some sites, like the Collins Theatre in Paragould and Cosmic Caverns in Berryville, have rarely — if ever — been investigated on camera.

Mickayla Carreker and Emily Ruckman join Webb as they explore each location. He said gaining access to some of the sites was the biggest challenge.

“Some have never been investigated before, and some haven't been investigated in years,” he said. “There were a few places that were somebody's home.”

But the real key, Webb said, is building trust with the people who care for these historic places.

“For me, it's about building trust, being nice and respecting boundaries,” he said. “If you can't do that, they won't let you in.”

Webb's first documentary, which focused on the King Opera House in Van Buren, already is available on Amazon Prime and Tubi. He hopes “Haunted Arkansas” will find a wider audience and be available on other streaming services.

“I'm hoping that it gets picked up and we can do another season,” Webb said. “There are a lot of other places that would be good to investigate. I don't want to give away all of where I'd want to go next, but I really would like to investigate Witches Hollow near Cave City.”

“Haunted Arkansas” is produced by Spider-Webb Productions.

The Red Sox, somehow, had the best and worst weekend at the same time.

While Boston swept the rival Yankees, it was moments after Sunday's matinee game that the joy was ripped away when it was shockingly announced the Red Sox had traded star Rafael Devers to the Giants.

Red Sox fans were not prepared for this rollercoaster of emotions and lambasted the franchise for being  cheap once again.

“Baseball is Dead” podcast host Jared Carrabis took to X to air his feelings about the deal.

“How the f–k do you trade Rafael Devers?” Carrabis said. “For A: That return and B: the moment in which you did it.”

Ringer founder Bill Simmons presented a theory on X about a possible reason for the trade.

The owner of the Red Sox, John Henry, also owns the Premier League-winning soccer team Liverpool.

Simmons hinted on X that the possible motive behind the trade was to help finance the newest transfer to Liverpool, Florian Wirtz. Liverpool reportedly paid his former club $100 million for the midfielder.

Devers is in the third season of a 10-year, $313 million contract and had been at odds with the team this spring training, after he was moved from third base to DH for the newly signed Alex Bregman.

It is not the first time ownership has traded one of its star players, much to the frustration of its fan base.

Mookie Betts was traded to the Dodgers before the 2020 season for three players who did not pan out. 

Betts was in the final year of his contract and would sign a 12-year, $365 million deal with Los Angeles — and he has since helped the franchise win two World Series.

“I woke up still mad [about] the Devers trade,” Barstool founder Dave Portnoy wrote on X. “If you are trying to win you just don't trade your best hitter for nothing in the middle of the season. John Henry and (minority owner) LeBron [James] have turned the Red Sox into the Oakland A's with fancy hubcaps.”

It seems like history has repeated itself yet again in Boston. Hopefully, this time, it will work out better.

The British VarEVolt battery has been granted the certification needed so it can be manufactured on a large scale, meaning more EV makers can use them in their cars.

A British firm has received approval to mass-produce an ultra-high-power-density electric vehicle (EV) battery that can be fully recharged in just 18 seconds.

The RML Group was granted Conformity of Production certification for its VarEVolt battery on June 2. This government approval signifies that the firm can mass-produce the powerful batteries for EV manufacturers.

The certification "underlines our readiness to move from prototyping and niche volumes to supporting larger production contracts," James Arkell, the head of powertrain at RML Group, said in a statement.

RML's battery can deliver lots of power in a short span. The VarEVolt battery can supply 6 kilowatts per kilogram, and it's capable of "dumping all its power really, really quickly," RML board member Michael Mallock told Autocar. The battery has a C rating of 200, meaning it's capable of fully charging or discharging in about 18 seconds.

In comparison, the fully electric Porsche Taycan's battery has a C rating of around 4 to 5, so it takes 12 to 15 minutes to charge or discharge.

The VarEVolt's modular design lets manufacturers tune it for different applications. "We can focus on range, we can focus on power, or we can balance the two," depending on the type of vehicle it will be deployed in, RML Group CEO Paul Dickinson told Autocar.

Some small-scale manufacturers are already using the VarEVolt battery; it helps power the futuristic Czinger 21C hybrid hypercar, which relies on a combination of an electric motor that uses energy stored in the battery and an internal combustion engine that burns gasoline.

—Honda promises solid-state batteries that could double EV range to 620 miles by 2030

Right now, the RML group is producing just a few of the VarEVolt batteries at a time, but future large-scale output wouldn't necessarily be confined to exclusive products like the 21C. (Czinger produced just 80 of the luxury sports cars in the first run.)

The firm is developing a kit to convert the battery packs in older hypercars, such as the LaFerrari or the McLaren P1, to updated versions, according to Mallock.

"For those types of cars, we can do a replacement pack that will significantly increase the range, and if the rest of the hardware within the car would allow it, you could have a version that was eight times the power output," Mallock told Autocar.

The search for alien life remains inconclusive, but sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) continue to stir public interest - often without verifiable evidence. Now, a former US Air Force pilot has shared what he calls his "wildest experience" involving two mysterious objects during his time in service.

Ryan Bodenheimer, who served with the elite Thunderbirds aerobatic team, recounted the sightings in a video on his YouTube channel. He said the stigma around UFO sightings among pilots has faded over the years.

In one incident, while returning from a training exercise near the highly classified Area 51, Bodenheimer claimed an object zipped past his jet at 400 knots (approximately 740 km/h) at 30,000 feet. He described it as "a silver, unpainted, shiny, reflective" craft shaped like a 3D triangle with wing-like structures underneath and a vertical tail.

"It looked like a futuristic fighter jet - too advanced, almost machine-welded," he said, adding that neither he nor his superiors picked up anything on radar.

The second incident, he said, occurred at a similar altitude when a rectangular object slowly approached from the front left. "Its edges were so bright they were pulsing," he said. "The centre was clear and slightly coloured."

Bodenheimer reported the sighting to Air Traffic Control, though no radar confirmation followed.



According to the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), there were 757 new UFO reports between May 2023 and June 2024. Most occurred in controlled airspace, with no underwater sightings.

Roughly 300 cases have been explained, while the rest remain unresolved.

Rushall, Norfolk: It's not an uncommon insect to find in your trap, but its design – and place in the world – is worthy of close consideration

As I sat with my friend at dusk in his garden, it came to me as a revelation. Perhaps he'd like to see who lived here once we've closed the door and gone to bed? So, I set my moth trap, which happened to be in the car and, post-breakfast, we went to meet the locals.

I've long likened opening every moth trap to Christmas morning: a moment when you have no idea what joy will be there. Nowadays there is as much fulfilment in seeing first responses from friends as there is in the magic of the insects themselves. I was engrossed by a lozenge of sunlit straw called a delicate (Mythimna vitellina), which is a scarce migrant from continental Europe. How extraordinary, I thought, that it may have been in Belgium or Holland the week before. It's a journey that vastly expands our idea of what an insect might be.

My friend, however, was more taken with an everyday miracle: the poplar hawk-moth, which is expected in most springtime moth traps. Yet every one is a thing of wonder, with hindwings that look like burgundy-splashed scimitars and a body shaped like a grey-furred corrugated banana. It is, in truth, more extraterrestrial than earthling, and most moth novices respond accordingly.

I logged 34 macro-moth species, which is a fraction of our 880 British list and nothing compared with the wider community of 1,400 micro-moths. The latter are often no more than 5mm in size (and far less inspiring to our gross human senses), but in total our entire moth fauna is at the heart of most British landscapes.

Their four-stage life cycle – egg, caterpillar, pupa, imago – also means that moths are perfect to convey the idea that nature is essentially a fabric of complex interrelationships. The living world cannot be understood only as a collection of separate “things” – birds, plants, moths and so on; it is an indivisible whole.

So, a few days later at the South Downs food and nature festival at Westerlands, West Sussex, my moth trap was a perfect prop to celebrate the 14 bat species living at this nature-friendly farm. Think of bats, I suggested, as little more than moths further along the living web.

Conspiracy theorists and senators alike are baselessly speculating about the brutal shooting spree that left two dead and two injured, Josh Marcus reports

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

Police in Minnesota are grappling with two different chases.

The first, most pressing one, is the arrest of Vance L. Boelter, the man suspected of impersonating a police officer and shooting two state lawmakers and their spouses in a “politically motivated” attack on Saturday.

The other is a race to get in front of feverish conspiracy theories about the incident that are spreading across right-wing corners of the internet. 

It didn't take long for the conjecture to begin after the fatal shootings of state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, as well as the non-fatal shootings of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, hit the headlines.

In regards to Hortman, right-wing conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich wondered aloud on X, “Did [Minnesota Governor] Tim Walz have her executed to send a message?”

Fellow fabulist Alex Jones, meanwhile, used a Saturday broadcast to make a variety of unfounded implications, including that Hortman was killed because she was considering switching parties and joining Republicans, and that suspect Boelter was a “high-level” Walz appointee and “No Kings” protest organizer. 

Jones capped off the a misinformation session by reading from a social media post from a seemingly random, pseudonymous account that called the shooting a “professional hit.”

Such claims reached thousands of people, even as they defied common sense and all evidence that eventually became available about the shootings.

Walz was in fact good friends with Hortman. 

Boelter was not a high-level ally of the governor, but rather a re-upped appointee from a previous administration on an obscure workforce board with about 60 members. 

Hortman was not planning on switching parties, though she did help broker a controversial compromise with Republicans this year to scale back undocumented immigrants' access to a state health program in order to keep the government open.

Further eroding the narrative of the shooting as a Democratic plot against Hortman, Hoffman, the other targeted lawmaker, voted on the opposite side of the immigration issue. 

Evidence found in Boelter's vehicle reportedly contained a hit list of prominent state Democrats and abortion rights supporters. State officials were worried about safety threats to the protests after finding papers marked “No Kings,” rather than the alleged gunman being a protest leader.

The man's roommate also described him as a Trump voter.

Such reactions from a right-wing media ecosystem are no longer a surprise, but the Minnesota crisis revealed the depths to which even mainstream, Republican-aligned U.S. politicians and corporate figures were willing to encourage the notion of a violent left-wing plot well before all the facts had come out. 

Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, less than a day after saying he condemned all “political violence” in America after a fatal shooting at a protest in his home state, appeared to mock the Minnesota tragedy, calling it the “Nightmare on Waltz Street” in an X post, an apparent misspelling of the governor's name.

He also suggested that left-wing ideology had caused the shooting. “Marxism is a deadly mental illness,” he wrote. “This is what happens,” he wrote in a caption for a photograph of the alleged Minnesota shooter, “When Marxists don't get their way.”

Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio took a similar tack, writing on X: “The degree to which the extreme left has become radical, violent, and intolerant is both stunning and terrifying.”

Former White House adviser Elon Musk — who amplified conspiracy theories surrounding the 2022 hammer attack on Paul Pelosi, the husband of Nancy Pelosi — again waded into the fray.

“The far left is murderously violent,” he wrote on X the same day he said he was working to reprogram X's AI program Grok because it was spreading “leftist indoctrination.”

Dan Bongino, a former right-wing broadcaster who joined the numerous voices on the right suggesting something about the official narrative of the Pelosi hammer attack didn't add up, is now the deputy director of the FBI, which is assisting in the Minnesota manhunt. 

“The FBI is fully engaged on the ground in Minnesota and is working in collaboration with our local and state partners,” he said Saturday.

Local officials and media figures called on outside observers to stop speculating about the shooting, given the intense grief surrounding the attack and the many unanswered questions about how a man was able to disguise himself as a police office, shoot four people, and escape.

“In a different, saner world, they would be humiliated and slink away,” wroteJ. Patrick Coolican, editor of the Minnesota Reformer. “But the smart money is that during the next moment of national crisis and mourning, they will again lie for profit.”

Drew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, called on those engaging in such speculation to remember that “we have families that continue to grieve.”

“While everybody wants an easy answer, I would encourage everybody online and in our communities to not speculate on what occurred and what the motivation was for this,” he said during a press conference on Sunday.

“We often want easy answers for complex problems,” he said. “And this is a complex situation that our investigators are going to need time to sift through the information and evidence, and those answers will come as we complete a full picture of our investigation.”

“We must truly focus on what matters beneath all of our differences — political, personal or otherwise,” Mayor Ryan Sabas of Champlin, Minnesota, told reporters at the briefing. “We are all human beings, and every human life has a value.”
