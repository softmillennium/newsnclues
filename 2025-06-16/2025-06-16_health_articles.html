                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first patient enrolled in a planned international clinical trial has been treated at HonorHealth Research Institute with a new type of immune therapy for those with a rare muscle-weakness disease known as Myasthenia Gravis. The disease affects fewer than 200 in every 1 million people. Symptoms range from droopy eyelids, problems chewing, general fatigue, difficulty swallowing and even problems breathing when the muscles surrounding the lungs are weakened. Patients often find it difficult to conduct basic hygiene and grooming; things as simple as brushing their teeth, taking a shower and getting dressed. "It's kind of exciting," said Anne Hatch, D.O., Principal Investigator for this international clinical trial (NTC06744920), which will consider the safety and effectiveness of a drug called Remibrutinib, manufactured by Novartis Pharmaceuticals of Basel, Switzerland. Dr. Hatch explained that, for the first time in this disease, the drug will target B cells, a type of white blood cell that makes antibodies. This new drug blocks a different part of the pathway than before. Hopefully, with this new mechanism of action, the patient's symptoms will improve." The treatment has already been approved for some types of cancer. Trial participants must be 18-75 years old with a confirmed diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis. A Patient's progress could be followed for up to 5 years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Babies born to mothers potentially exposed to low levels of arsenic in public drinking water-even at levels below the federal safety standard-were more likely to be born preterm, with lower birthweight, or be smaller than expected, according to a study at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and funded by the National Institutes of Health's Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Program. The findings are published in JAMA Network Open. While the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sets a maximum contaminant level of 10 micrograms per liter for arsenic in public water systems, this study examines how even lower-level arsenic exposures may still affect pregnancy outcomes in a large population. Previous research largely focused on private wells or smaller study groups. Because arsenic occurs naturally, water that comes in contact with certain rocks and soils may contain it. Contamination from various industrial processes also contributes to increased levels of arsenic in some areas. Most U.S. residents rely on public drinking water, and our findings suggest that further reducing arsenic in public water systems could be an important step to improve infant health across the U.S. Even low levels of arsenic in public drinking water were associated with low birthweight and other adverse birth outcomes in U.S. Anne Nigra, PhD, assistant professor of Environmental Health Sciences at Columbia Mailman School Arsenic exposures during pregnancy were estimated by combining water quality data with the residential histories of participants. No actual arsenic levels were tested for these participants.

Housing is a basic life necessity for everyone. With rising numbers of pregnant and parenting people experiencing homelessness in Canada, more children are being put at risk of negative health outcomes. Adequate housing that interfaces with supportive health and mental health services is a fundamental first step to counter the effects of poverty, family fragmentation, and displacement for this vulnerable group." Recent data show that the number of people experiencing homelessness increased by 20% from 2018 to 2022, with 10% indicating they are part of a family. "The health and developmental implications of homelessness for infants and young children are profound," the authors write. It has been found that infants born to people experiencing homelessness have lower birth weights, higher risk of needing neonatal intensive care, and increased likelihood of infections and negative mental health and cognitive development. They urge federal and provincial funding to provide access to safe and affordable housing with integrated services to support families, with support from municipal governments, social services and other providers. "Reducing service fragmentation by enhancing collaboration and communication between housing services, mental health and addiction services, and health services optimizes the continuity of service delivery. However, few services or programs currently have the capacity or funding to provide longer-term services to clients."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are increasingly present in the population. Brown adipose tissue has a protective function against these prevalent diseases, as it burns calories and can produce body heat from fat. This inactivation of brown adipose tissue — also typical of obese people — remains poorly studied in the scientific literature. The paper opens new paths to understand why and how the inactivation of this key tissue for metabolizing fat in the body takes place, and especially to determine wether this repressor function can be reversed and help design strategies for the treatment of obesity and cardiometabolic diseases. The study, published in Molecular Metabolism, is led by Professor Francesc Villarroya, from the UB's Faculty of Biology and the UB Institute of Biomedicine (IBUB) — headquartered at the Barcelona Science Park (PCB) —, Sant Joan de Déu Research Institute (IRSJD) and the CIBER area for Pathophysiology of Obesity (CIBEROBN). There are two types of adipose tissue in the body: white adipose tissue (it stores energy in the form of lipids) and brown adipose tissue (the main heat-generating organ in the body through thermogenesis). "As a result, it was generally assumed that the low activity of brown fat in ageing and obesity could be explained by the fact that its activators do not work properly". The new study, conducted in animal models, describes a repressor factor that blocks brown fat activity: the ACBP protein. Under normal conditions, this protein would regulate when brown fat activity is not needed (e.g. in a warm environment). However, this molecule would also be involved in ageing and in the pathological blocking of brown adipose tissue that leads to obesity. The ACBP protein's control activity reveals further biomedical implications in the fight against diseases such as cancer. "In some cancers, brown adipose tissue becomes pathologically overactive and causes uncontrolled metabolic energy expenditure, leading to cachexia (extreme malnutrition and muscle wasting). In this case, the function of the ACBP protein as a repressor factor could become a therapeutic tool of interest in cancer patients", says Villarroya. In another context, it is also known that global warming caused by climate change is contributing to rising obesity rates, as an increasingly warmer environment leads to inactive brown adipose tissue. Once this factor has been identified, we can design intervention tools to promote a healthier lifestyle", concludes the researcher. Acyl CoA-binding protein in brown adipose tissue acts as a negative regulator of adaptive thermogenesis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New results from a clinical trial reveal that a single dose of psilocybin-a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in mushrooms-can provide sustained reductions in depression and anxiety in individuals with cancer suffering from major depressive disorder. The findings are published by Wiley online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society. In this phase 2 trial, 28 patients with cancer and major depressive disorder received psychological support from a therapist prior to, during, and following a single 25-mg dose of psilocybin. During clinical interviews conducted 2 years later, 15 (53.6%) patients demonstrated a significant reduction in depression, and 14 (50%) had sustained depression reduction as well as remission. Similarly, psilocybin reduced anxiety for 12 (42.9%) patients at 2 years. An ongoing randomized, double-blind trial is currently evaluating up to two doses of 25 mg of psilocybin versus placebo as treatment for depression and anxiety in patients with cancer. This study is building on the single-dose study in an effort to bring a larger majority of the patients into remission of depression and anxiety. One dose of psilocybin with psychological support to treat depression has a long-term positive impact on relieving depression for as much as 2 years for a substantial portion of patients with cancer, and we're exploring whether repeating the treatment resolves depression for more than half of the patients. If randomized testing shows similar results, this could lead to greater use of psilocybin to treat depression in patients with cancer."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists at UCLA and the University of Toronto have developed an advanced computational tool, called moPepGen, that helps identify previously invisible genetic mutations in proteins, unlocking new possibilities in cancer research and beyond. The tool, described in Nature Biotechnology, will help understand how changes in our DNA affect proteins and ultimately contribute to cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and other conditions. Existing proteomic tools often fail to capture the full diversity of protein variations. To overcome this challenge, the researchers developed moPepGen, which enables more precise identification of protein variations. We developed moPepGen to help researchers determine which genetic variants are truly expressed at the protein level, addressing a long-standing challenge in the proteogenomic community. Our tool significantly improves the detection of hidden protein variations by using a graph-based approach to efficiently process all types of genetic changes. This provides a more comprehensive view of protein diversity and gives researchers a much more accurate picture of how mutations influence disease." Chenghao Zhu, PhD, postdoctoral scholar at the department of human genetics at UCLA and co-first author of the study Yet, analyzing proteins to detect these changes remains an immense computational challenge. Unlike existing methods, which primarily detect simple genetic changes such as single amino acid substitutions, moPepGen is designed to identify a wide range of protein variations caused by alternative splicing, circular RNAs, gene fusions, RNA editing, and other complex genetic modifications. The tool systematically models how genes are expressed and translated into proteins, significantly expanding the ability to detect disease-associated mutations. "Until now, there hasn't been a practical way to handle the enormous complexity of genetic and transcriptomic variation," said Zhu. "The algorithm works rapidly, even when analyzing massive amounts of data, and is designed to function across multiple technologies and species." To demonstrate its effectiveness, the team used moPepGen to analyze proteogenomic data from five prostate tumors, eight kidney tumors, and 376 cell lines. They found that moPepGen successfully identified previously undetectable protein variations linked to genetic mutations, gene fusions, and other molecular changes. It also proved more sensitive and comprehensive than previous methods, detecting four times more unique protein variants than older approaches. The researchers noted that one of moPepGen's most exciting applications is in immunotherapy, as it can identify cancer-specific variant peptides that may serve as neoantigen candidates, which is key to developing personalized cancer vaccines and cell therapies. "By making it easier to analyze complex protein variations, moPepGen has the potential to advance research in cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and other fields where understanding protein diversity is critical," said Paul Boutros, PhD, professor of urology and human genetics at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, director of cancer data science at the UCLA Health Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center and co-senior author of the study. The tool is freely available for researchers and can integrate with existing proteomics workflows, making it accessible for labs worldwide. A full list of authors is available in the study. Boutros also serves as the interim vice dean for research at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, associate director of cancer informatics at the UCLA Institute for Precision Health and is a member of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study offers insight into the health and lifestyle indicators - including diet, physical activity and weight - that align most closely with healthy brain function across the lifespan. The study used machine learning to determine which variables best predicted a person's ability to quickly complete a task without becoming distracted. Reported in The Journal of Nutrition, the study found that age, blood pressure and body mass index were the strongest predictors of success on a test called the flanker task, which requires participants to focus on a central object without becoming distracted by flanking information. Diet and exercise also played a smaller but relevant role in performance on the test, the team found, sometimes appearing to offset the ill effects of a high BMI or other potentially detrimental factors. "This study used machine learning to evaluate a host of variables at once to help identify those that align most closely with cognitive performance," said Naiman Khan, a professor of health and kinesiology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who led the work with kinesiology Ph.D. student Shreya Verma. "Standard statistical approaches cannot embrace this level of complexity all at once." The data included participant demographics, such as age, BMI, blood pressure and physical activity levels, along with dietary patterns and performance on a flanker test that measured their processing speed and accuracy in determining the orientation of a central arrow flanked by other arrows that pointed in the same or opposite direction. "This is a well-established measure of cognitive function that assesses attention and inhibitory control," Khan said. Previous studies have found that several factors are implicated in the preservation of cognitive function across the lifespan, Khan said. Adherence to the healthy eating index, a measure of diet quality, has been linked to superior executive function and processing speed in older adults. Other studies have found that diets that are rich in antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamins are associated with better cognitive function." Physical factors, such as BMI and blood pressure, along with increased physical activity also are strong predictors of cognitive health, or decline, in aging. "Clearly, cognitive health is driven by a host of factors, but which ones are most important?" Machine learning "offers a promising avenue for analyzing large datasets with multiple variables and identifying patterns that may not be apparent through conventional statistical approaches," the researchers wrote. They found that age was the most influential predictor of performance on the test, followed by diastolic blood pressure, BMI and systolic blood pressure. Adherence to the healthy eating index was less predictive of cognitive performance than blood pressure or BMI but also correlated with better performance on the test. "Physical activity emerged as a moderate predictor of reaction time, with results suggesting it may interact with other lifestyle factors, such as diet and body weight, to influence cognitive performance," Khan said. "This study reveals how machine learning can bring precision and nuance to the field of nutritional neuroscience," he said. "By moving beyond traditional approaches, machine learning could help tailor strategies for aging populations, individuals with metabolic risks or those seeking to enhance cognitive function through lifestyle changes."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Recent tracking polls report that about one in eight people have taken a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, more commonly known as GLP-1 medications. Originally used to help treat type 2 diabetes, these medications have gained in popularity over the last few years for weight loss. Just like any medication, GLP-1 drugs have possible side effects and complications. One potential complication was first reported in July 2024 when a study found people using semaglutide were at a four times higher risk of developing nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). This was followed by research published in January 2025 that discovered people taking either semaglutide or tirzepatide may be at an increased risk for potentially blinding vision issues. Now, a new study recently published in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology reports that older adults with diabetes taking any type of GLP-1 medication may be at a heightened risk for developing neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). “Furthermore, while Wegovy was approved in late 2021, our study focused on patients with diabetes from 2020 to 2023,” he added. “We found that among patients with diabetes aged 66 and older, the incidence of nAMD was approximately 1 in 1,000 in those who had never used GLP-1 receptor agonists, compared to about 2 in 1,000 among those who had been exposed to these medications for at least six months,” Muni said. “While our findings should not prompt alarm, they do warrant increased clinical awareness,” he continued. If any new changes in vision occur while taking these medications, patients should promptly inform their doctor and be referred to an ophthalmologist for further assessment.” “This finding is clinically meaningful because it suggests that the risk may accumulate over time.” “Given that many individuals use these medications chronically, whether for blood sugar control or for weight loss, the long-term ocular safety of GLP-1 RAs requires further investigation,” he continued. “While observational data can't prove causation on its own, seeing a graded relationship like this suggests that prolonged exposure could play a role in increasing risk; however, this needs to be validated in future studies.” MNT also talked to Demetrios Vavvas, MD, PhD, director of the retina service at Mass Eye and Ear in Massachusetts, about this research. However, Vavvas did point out that the study has some limitations. This is because critical risk factors like smoking, obesity (BMI), and sun exposure were not accounted for in the data. This increased medical attention could lead to a higher likelihood of their eye problems being detected and treated, which is what the study measured, creating the appearance of increased risk.” “Thirdly, the actual events were very small — less than 0.2% so despite statistical adjustment results may not be accurate,” he added. MNT spoke with David I. Geffen, OD, FAAO, director of optometric and refractive services at the Gordon Schanzlin New Vision in La Jolla, CA, about this study. Geffen commented that as GLP-1 medications are being prescribed to a huge number of patients — and as it's been observed that not all patients are symptom free and not side effect free — doctors must be very careful to make sure their patients' eye health is not compromised utilizing these medications. “It is important to make sure that we know our patients are taking these medications,” he explained. “This study shows that as new medications are approved we need to be careful as long term side-effects may be seen that we were not aware of.” A new review reports that nine people taking semaglutide and tirzepatide — the active ingredient in GLP-1 medications — experienced vision issues… Ozempic (semaglutide) is a prescription injection that helps manage blood sugar levels and lower risk of cardiovascular problems in adults with type 2… Wegovy (semaglutide) is a brand-name drug used for weight management in certain adults and children.
