                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tributes from celebrities and fans of fashion designer Afa Ah Loo, a contestant on season 17 of Bravo's “Project Runway,” began rolling in on June 16, 2025, after authorities in Salt Lake City identified him as the victim of a shooting at a peaceful protest two days before. Arthur Folasa Ah Loo — known as Afa Ah Loo publicly — was “hit by a stray bullet,” according to Salt Lake City station Fox13, when a “peacekeeping” volunteer at the “No Kings” protest there shot at a suspect, Arturo Roberto Gamboa, who pulled an AR-15 out of his backpack. Among the tributes, “Moana 2” star Auliʻi Cravalho mourned Ah Loo in a heartfelt Instagram post, noting that she often wore his designs, at the movie's May premiere. She wrote on June 16, “There are no words to hold the grief of losing @afa.ahloo.” In Cravalho's tribute, she wrote in full, “As a Samoan fashion designer, Afa's creations are and remain thoughtful, elegant and powerful portrayals of Pacific culture. Another Utah State Representative, Doug Fiefia, tweeted, “Heartbroken by the tragic loss of Afa Ah Loo. My prayers are with his family, friends, and all who knew him. He was a bright light in our Polynesian community and will be deeply missed. May his loved ones feel peace and comfort during this difficult time.” Popular singer Tenelle wrote on one of Ah Loo's recent posts, “WE LOVE YOU AFA! A fan account for the “Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” also paid tribute to Ah Loo, tweeting that he often worked with former cast members Jen Shah and Danna Bui-Negrete. He eventually attended Brigham Young University – Hawaii and later moved to Utah. Representative Mauga told KSL that Ah Loo recently became a U.S. citizen and voted in his first election last November. Friends have set up a GoFundMe campaign for Ah Loo's family, noting that “more than anything, Afa was proud of the life he built with his wife, Laura, and their two beautiful children, Vera and Isaac.” “This unimaginable loss has left a profound void in their lives,” the campaign's description said. Funds raised will be sent directly to Laura via the GoFundMe transfer.”</p>

In this column, we take a look at films currently out of print on physical media and unavailable on any streaming platform in an effort to draw attention to them and say to their rights holders, “Release This!” His debut feature, “Heaven Help Us” (1985), was marketed as a broad teen farce but delivered much more as a rich character study with an exquisite sense of time (the 1960s) and place (an all-boys Catholic school). Critics excoriated Dinner's third movie, “Hot to Trot” (1988), at the time. But anchoring the ridiculous premise (Bobcat Goldthwait becomes a successful investment banker by teaming up with a talking horse) was a meticulously orchestrated comic structure populated by a wide array of hilarious supporting actors: Dabney Coleman, SNL's Tim Kazurinsky and Mary Gross, John Candy as the voice of the horse, etc. In between his first and third movies, Dinner directed his best film, the mistaken-identity comedy “Off Beat.” Despite a cast that includes Judge Reinhold (in his first leading role coming off “Beverly Hills Cop”), Meg Tilly (post-Oscar-nomination for “Agnes of God”), Joe Mantegna, John Turturro, Harvey Keitel, and a deep bench of recognizable character actors, it has never been released on DVD. As of this writing, the film isn't available to stream anywhere, either. “Off Beat” tells the story of Joe Gower (Reinhold), an unassuming New York City librarian whose best friend is cop Abe Washington (Cleavant Derricks). Washington's boss is requiring all his officers to participate, but Washington figures Joe can sign in as him, blow the audition, and they can both go back to their normal lives. Joe fully intends to fail the audition, but when he locks eyes on female officer Rachel Wareham (Tilly) he decides to stick around. He becomes a member of the police dance troupe and begins dating Rachel, who thinks he actually is a cop — a charade he has to sustain both for the sake of his budding romance and to keep himself and Washington out of trouble. ), but “Off Beat” transcends formula through the sheer excellence of its craft on every level. It begins with the screenplay, written by Tony-winning playwright Mark Medoff (“Children of a Lesser God”). Medoff uses the framework that his mistaken identity premise provides as a springboard for an abundance of delicately calibrated digressions and relationships. It's all deftly handled by Dinner, whose first smart move comes in the casting. “Off Beat” is stacked with great actors fully capable of carrying their own movies who come in and out here for a few minutes at a time. They add weight and flavor to the central love story in the same way that Charles Coburn or William Demarest would have in the days of Preston Sturges (a director to whom “Off Beat” owes a considerable debt). From Mantegna's dance-hating policeman and Turturro's prissy library administrator to the brief but memorable appearances by actors like James Tolkan (the principal in “Back to the Future”), magician Penn Jillette, Fred Gwynne, and others, “Off Beat” is a nonstop parade of delightful comic turns. Unlike so many comedies that run out of steam, “Off Beat” keeps introducing new pleasures right up to the end, bringing in Scorsese favorites Harvey Keitel and Victor Argo for a very funny climax involving a bank robbery where one of the cops outside is another Scorsese regular, Mike Starr. In hands less adept than Dinner's, that bank robbery could have felt like a perfunctory action climax, but he invests it with so much humor and feeling that it feels like an organic extension of the themes and relationships the movie has so carefully established; it expertly brings the varied plot strands together in a way that feels convincing and earned. Bringing up Scorsese's name is not inappropriate, as, like Scorsese, Dinner knows how to utilize New York locations to their greatest potential — every background in the film is lively and carefully chosen, and sometimes artfully manipulated. It helps that he's working with cinematographer Carlo Di Palma, a favorite of both Michelangelo Antonioni and Woody Allen. When their have their final conversation in which Reinhold fully comes clean, it's a moment we've seen in other movies, but never the way Di Palma and Dinner present it: with the characters in silhouette surrounded by a blue darkness behind the curtain of their dance recital, a mood of mystery, romance, and anticipation enveloping them. The whole film is filled with images like that, and with scenes in which Dinner and Medoff figure out how to do multiple things at once. This economy makes “Off Beat” feel longer than its 92-minute running time. Dinner's filmmaking confidence throughout is astonishing, given this was only his second feature. The ability to find dynamic but motivated camera movements that would serve him so well later on television is already on full display here. “Off Beat” was released by the now-defunct Disney offshoot Touchstone Pictures, and after an inexplicably unsuccessful theatrical run and VHS release, it seems to have fallen into obscurity. In recent years, Disney has started to license some of their lesser-known movies to independent labels like Kino Lorber, so maybe a physical media release could be imminent? One certainly hopes so, because “Off Beat” is, as its title promises, an eccentric pleasure that deserves reconsideration.

The IRIB said in a statement that “live programs were briefly halted at the IRIB News Network but returned to normal a few minutes afterwards.” It added that “it was not immediately clear if and how many personnel had been wounded or killed.” Israeli officials and Iranian journalists on the ground confirmed there were evacuation warnings issued for that part of Tehran ahead of the strikes, which come on the fourth day of an Israeli offensive across Iran in response to intelligence that warned of Iran's increasing nuclear capability. The two countries have been trading bombing attacks using aircraft, ballistic missiles and drones since Sunday, with air raid sirens heard across Israel and civilians fleeing Tehran.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sabrina Carpenter's “Manchild” soars onto the Billboard Hot 100 at No. The song is her second leader, and first to debut on top. Her “Please Please Please” spent a week atop the ranking in June 2024, rising from the runner-up spot in its second week on the chart. “Manchild,” also Carpenter's fourth Hot 100 top 10, introduces her next album, Man's Best Friend, due Aug. 29. “i can't wait for it to be yours x,” she wrote of the set on Instagram on June 11; it is scheduled to arrive just more than year since her prior LP, Short n' Sweet, which was released Aug. 23, 2024. 3-peaking “Espresso” and followed by “Taste,” which hit No. Meanwhile, Carpenter is the only woman artist with multiple Hot 100 No. 1s dating to the coronation of “Please Please Please.” She is also the only woman to reign with a nonseasonal song and with no billed collaborators in that span. Carpenter co-produced the song with Jack Antonoff and co-wrote it with Antonoff and Amy Allen. Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below. The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations.

As it bubbles under the Radio Songs chart, “Manchild” launches at No. 1 with the word “man” (or a variation) in its title. Here's a look at all such man-ly hits: 1s have included “man” in their titles than “woman” – 19 vs. eight, with the versions of “When a Man Loves a Woman” above contributing to both sides. Meanwhile, Billboard's Keith Caulfield notes that funk band Manchild charted in 1977 with Power and Love (No. “Manchild” is also the fourth Hot 100 No. 1 with “child” in its title, and the first since a rock classic 37 years ago: No kid-ding: Additionally, Childish Gambino ruled the Hot 100 with “This Is America” in 2018 and Destiny's Child scored four leaders in 1999-2001. 2 on the Hot 100 following two weeks at No. Still, it adds a seventh week at No. 1 on Digital Song Sales (7,000 sold) and gained by 12% to 54 million in airplay audience. It also claims a third week at No. Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, dips 2-3 on the Hot 100, three weeks after it roared in as Wallen's fourth No. It also tops the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart for a fourth week. 2-peaking “Just in Case” (3-4) and “I'm the Problem” (5-6), as I'm the Problem, the parent set of all three songs, posts a fourth week at No. Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” descends 4-5 after 13 weeks atop the Hot 100 beginning in March. 1 on both the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts, extending the longest reign on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs (dating to October 1958, when the chart became the genre's all-encompassing songs ranking). Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” wobbles 6-7 on the Hot 100, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. 1 beginning last July, and Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” backtracks 7-8 after five weeks at No. Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and became the year's No. It logs a record-extending 65th week in the top 10 and a record-furthering 95th week on the chart overall.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Loud and Clear, journalist and Deadhead Brian Anderson chronicles how the legendary band's pursuit of high-quality sound forever changed concert production. This August, Dead & Company will celebrate 60 years of Grateful Dead music with three massive concerts in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. Fans can reasonably assume – as they can with most major touring artists today – that the sound will be impeccable. But six decades ago, when the Grateful Dead began gigging around that very same park, quality sound was far from a given. The Grateful Dead didn't just embrace new advancements in audio technology – as journalist and Deadhead Brian Anderson chronicles in his new book, Loud and Clear: The Grateful Dead's Wall of Sound and the Quest for Audio Perfection, the revered band actively drove concert sound forward, creating many of today's standards in the process. During those years, the band and the cast of characters in its orbit – from an audiophile LSD chemist to hard-nosed roadies – continually iterated its sound system, introducing numerous innovations in service of creating a deeper performer-listener connection through quality sound. “I knew this was for a general audience,” says Anderson, who asked himself, “How do I make it digestible and explain this stuff in a way people are gonna understand?” The son of Deadheads – who saw the band repeatedly in this era and took him as a toddler to see the Dead at Alpine Valley in the late ‘80s – found the answer in those strong personalities within the Dead's organization. Loud and Clear is as much a story about the Dead's audio equipment as it is about the band's musical philosophy and the way money, fame, and excess challenged it. Plus, at a time with far fewer regulations, transporting, assembling, and disassembling the Wall came with plenty of risks for the (often inebriated) crew tasked with doing so; Loud and Clear's at-times harrowing narrative includes broken arms, nearly-severed toes, falling equipment, electrocutions and flipped trucks. “They somehow kept it together,” Anderson says, “but there was a collective sigh of relief at the end of 1974 when they're like, ‘OK, you know what? What inspired you to write a book not just about the Dead, but about such a specific topic and period? I grew up hearing them talk about the Wall of Sound and this system's sonic clarity. They would talk about seeing the band perform with this massive assembly of gear behind them – and it's called the Wall of Sound, so it's just captivated me my entire life. When I was at VICE, I was the Features Editor [at science and tech vertical Motherboard], and I thought it would be cool to do a deep dive into the Wall of Sound. I embarked on writing that initial story because I knew that it had more than just the technology component – it's a story about obsession, obsessive people who came from all walks of life. After that story came out, it quickly dawned on me that there's so much more here – like, maybe I could do a full book on this one day. How did the Dead's pursuit of quality sound differentiate themselves from their peers and ultimately help them amass the following that they did? Not long after the band had gotten going, [singer/guitarist] Jerry Garcia's mother, Ruth, purchased her son a pair of Klipsch speakers. No other bands at the time had their own rig like that, so immediately, they were elevated above most of their peers, at a time when musical PAs didn't exist. Most any club that they were playing at the time, if it did have a sound system, it was just a small little box to like each side of the stage. Live sound presentation in the mid '60s was kind of terrible. He was kitting them out with top-flight gear by early 1966 – and right around that time, the acid tests were getting going. Part of their righteous approach to sound was to present the sound in such a way that everyone in the space together [would] experience the same high quality. At its roots, the Dead almost had a punk-like, DIY ethos. What tensions did that introduce as the band's operation grew and professionalized? [The Dead wanted] to do everything their own way; it didn't necessarily make sense to do what they were doing, but they did it anyway. From the very beginning, they would always funnel money back into their sound system – that's basically how the Wall of Sound was able to grow. We can't do things like we did in the very early days.” It became clear that they were hemorrhaging money through this sound system. By mid-'74, it was starting to get through to Garcia and some of the other band members that this was not sustainable. Despite their wanting to continue on in this very punk, DIY fashion where money would just always be funneled back into the sound system, the reality was such that they couldn't do that anymore. I didn't want to just tell this story through old sound bites from Jerry Garcia or Bob Weir or Phil Lesh. There were so many other people who were in the room in this era who helped put this thing together and who made it go on the road, setting it up and tearing it down. Your book outlines several audio innovations by the band, including pioneering the use of on-stage monitors, helping to invent digital delay towers, and using feedback-cancelling microphones to make the Wall of Sound work. A curved speaker, no one had done that before the Dead. Today, you go to see Metallica at a stadium or you go see a local punk band at the dive bar, you're gonna see versions of a curved speaker – and that's the Dead lineage. Delay towers, that's not the Wall of Sound, but an adjacent sonic first that the Dead and their crew and their technicians helped forge in that era. Kezar Stadium, RFK, Watkins Glen, those three [big outdoor concerts] in summer of '73 were crucial to figuring out digital delay. From a philosophical standpoint, a lasting impact of all the Dead's innovations in the audio realm in this era was an elevated presentation. The Dead instilled this awareness of pursuing the highest-quality sound that you can because you owe it to your audience, because these people are coming to see you perform. And in turn, that reoriented what fans expected of concert audio, not just at the Dead's shows but at any show. They realized, “We don't need to carry this massive equipment with us anymore, because the state of the art has advanced to a point where we can rent a sound system that sounds just as good, if not better, than the Wall of Sound for a fraction of the price.” A lot of that really owes to the ground that they broke through the Wall of Sound. At a couple points in the book, you quote Garcia interviews from this period where, when lamenting the challenges of ensuring quality audio on tour, he says he wishes the band could have its own venue tailored to its own production standards. That never came to pass – but today, Dead & Company has played upwards of 40 shows at Sphere in Las Vegas. Last year, the first time I went to the Sphere, walking in, I couldn't help but draw all of these connections. In the very early '70s, they were always having conversations about, “Gee, wouldn't it be great if we had our own spot where we could set up our sound system, just exactly perfect, and people can come see us perform?” They started to take some very serious steps to figure out, “OK, what would this space look like?” One of the ideas they were kicking around was a Buckminster Fuller-style geodesic dome – like a sphere. So, you walk into the Sphere to see Dead and Company, it's like, “Oh, here it is.” Inside of the Sphere is basically the Wall of Sound, but taken to an exponential degree. There's the public perception of Garcia as this wooly, hippie-type guy, but he was always embracing the cutting edge, from the gear that he was playing and just experimenting with to getting really into computers in the late '80s and early '90s. He just loved, like, f—king around with the newest technology. What's your favorite Wall of Sound show? June 16, 1974, at the Des Moines Fairgrounds, for sonic and setlist reasons as much as personal reasons – my mother was at that show. [Editor's note: Selections from this show were officially released in 2009 as Road Trips Volume 2 Number 3, which is available on streaming platforms.] Loud and Clear: The Grateful Dead's Wall of Sound and the Quest for Audio Perfection will be released by St. Martin's Press on June 17.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meghan Markle celebrated Father's Day with a rare glimpse into her private family life. On Sunday, June 15, the Duchess of Sussex shared a heartfelt Instagram video tribute to Prince Harry featuring never-before-seen footage of him with their two children, 6-year-old Prince Archie and 4-year-old Princess Lilibet. Set to Jason Mraz's song “Have It All,” the video captures moments of Harry laughing with his kids, following Archie on a bike ride, and holding both children during their younger years. The tribute marked one of Meghan's most personal posts since returning to social media earlier this year. The post quickly drew attention, offering a rare look at the family's life in Montecito, California, where Harry and Meghan have lived since stepping back from their royal roles in 2020. Both children share their father's red hair, which Harry has credited to his late mother's family. “The Spencer gene is very, very strong,” Harry said during a 2023 appearance on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.” He added, “I actually really, genuinely thought at the beginning of my relationship [with Meghan] that should this go the distance and we have kids, that there's no way the ginger gene will stand up to my wife's genes, but I was wrong! “I would love reconciliation with my family,” he continued. “There's no point in continuing to fight anymore. I don't know how much longer my father has.” As Meghan continues to use her Instagram handle @meghan to spotlight personal moments and professional projects, the Father's Day tribute stood out for its emotional tone and family-first focus.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nick Cave said Morrissey recently contacted him with an offer to provide vocals on a new song of his. It's something Cave, a longtime fan, said he “would have been happy to do,” were it not for the fact that Morrissey wasn't asking him to sing a verse or provide backing vocals, but intro the track with “an unnecessarily provocative” spoken-word speech. Responding to a fan question on his “Red Hand Files” website regarding his relationship with Morrissey, Cave said the former Smiths frontman reached out to him last year about the song via email. Over this instrumental intro, Cave continued, Morrissey wanted him to deliver a “slightly silly anti-woke screed [Morrissey] had written.” Cave did not share any details about the salvo, and even admitted, “I suppose I agreed with the sentiment on some level.” But, he said, “it just wasn't my thing,” so he “politely declined” the offer.

In an interview last year, Morrissey claimed that one LP had been “gagged” and “idiot culture” was preventing its release. Even without new music, though, Morrissey has remained busy on the road. He has another leg of North American concerts scheduled for September and October. Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's family has launched yet another unscrupulous cash grab attempting to profit off the current president's name and public image: Trump Mobile, a wireless phone service. Trump Mobile is essentially another licensing deal, and features a disclaimer indicating that “Trump Mobile, its products and services are not designed, developed, manufactured, distributed or sold by The Trump Organization or any of their respective affiliates or principals. T1 Mobile LLC uses the ‘Trump' name and trademark pursuant to the terms of a limited license agreement which may be terminated or revoked according to its terms.” Trump Mobile's initial launch features plenty of branding and special offers stacked with indirect references to President Trump without featuring an outright product endorsement by the commander in chief. So confident are the Trump's that the president's legions of supporters will fork over cash at any opportunity, that they didn't even bother with producing their own images, instead using shoddily edited stock photography to fill out their website. Internet Trolls Around the World Are Mocking Trump's Military Birthday Parade Pussy Riot at L.A. ‘No Kings' March: ‘It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Russia' Given that the product is a licensing agreement covered in Trump branded gold-plating, it's unlikely that this new venture will produce any industry-wide revolutions, except hopefully eventually a stricter revision of the nation's anti-corruption laws.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a press release, several band members had something to say, starting with the B-52's' Fred Schneider: “In 2022, I swore I'd never get on a tour bus again,” he said. “But we were careful to say to our fans that we would still perform in special situations that don't require all of the awful tour travel. Our Vegas residency is going great, and when we were offered the chance to do a small run of shows with Devo, we all said this is an extraordinary opportunity we couldn't say no to.” It was either fate or luck or the SNL anniversary that brought us all together to create this amazing chance to go out on tour. Added the B-52's' Kate Pierson, “When we first came from Athens to New York City to perform, punk was in full force… and new wave was right on its tail! We also really dug the far-out weirdness of Devo, which seemed very in tuned to our sensibilities. We remember one of our first shows—amazed that David Bowie, Brian Eno, Frank Zappa, Allen Ginsberg, Talking Heads, and Blondie all came to see us! When we opened the Mudd Club, we partied with Devo and really hit it off on the dance floor. Later, Brian Eno went onto to produce Devo's incredible first album… and now we will align again! Said Cindy Wilson, “When both of our bands performed at the recent SNL 50 concert at Radio City, we started talking and agreed we had to do these shows. This will be amazing and I can't wait for the B-52's to share these stages with Devo!” That it took almost 50 years to happen is rather mind-blowing.

The first season of the Paramount+ series “Tulsa King” was an immediate hit with action fans who were thrilled to see Sylvester Stallone back in his element as tough guy Dwight Manfredi, a New York mobster who finds himself hilariously out of his element in Tulsa, Oklahoma. One of the show's many pleasures was seeing the '80s action icon not only going back to his roots, but doing what he used to do better than ever — the show's irresistible blend of sardonic comedy and visceral set pieces gave Stallone the best part of his career and his most entertaining showcase since Walter Hill‘s “Bullet to the Head” almost 15 years ago. Expectations were therefore high for Season 2 to match or surpass the quality of action that had been established, and “Tulsa King” stunt coordinator Freddie Poole felt the pressure. “We're always shooting two episodes at the same time and prepping two others while we're shooting, so that's four episodes you're in charge of at once. It becomes like a puzzle that I'm trying to work out.” Related Stories Adria Arjona Wept Saying Her ‘Andor' Farewell: It ‘Shook My Heart' Rolin Jones Knew ‘Interview with the Vampire' Season 2 Nailed It When He Saw Jacob Anderson's Dramatic Transformation Although Poole may have felt stretched thin — he says the single hardest thing about stunt coordinating on “Tulsa King” is properly allocating his time — the strain doesn't show in any of Season 2's set pieces, which more than deliver on the show's signature blend of dark comedy and shocking violence. In episode 9, for example, there's an elaborate shoot-out at the Fennario horse ranch that involves a rival gang and Manfredi's soldiers going head to head. “The thing about that sequence is there's not a lot of dialogue,” Poole said. “So what can we do to fill the screen with something that's really cinematic? Later in that same episode, Manfredi's main rival Ming is dispatched with a tomahawk to the head in another gory but grimly funny moment. Selling that gag required a close collaboration between Poole, actor Rich Ting, and the special effects department to create a prosthetic appliance that enabled the crew to shoot the moment practically on set. “That allowed us to get really creative with the scene.” “That required a lot because it wasn't just Sylvester Stallone fighting someone else,” Poole said. “It was a big group versus another group.” To prep for the sequence, Poole created two separate pre-viz videos, a preliminary one shot on a stage with marks where the action would be laid out, and a second one that refined the plan once Poole was able to work on the actual location. “Then we had a rehearsal day with the actors where we rotated the cast as we brought them in to dial in all their action choreography,” Poole said, noting that he wanted to give emphasis to one particular actor, Mike Walden, who plays Manfredi's soldier Bigfoot. “Mike is a wrestler by trade, so I just hit him up and said, ‘Hey, let's spitball here. Let's incorporate some of that into this fight sequence.' Poole gives Stallone credit for collaborating on the action sequences to work out not only his own beats but those of the other actors. “He always has thoughts and input, and there's a certain level of trust in our relationship,” Poole said, noting that he's been collaborating with Stallone since he first worked as the actor's stunt double on “Bullet to the Head” and “Escape Plan.” Poole said he knew he had something with the wind farm sequence when Stallone stayed on set after his pieces were shot just to watch what was going on. “And he just pulled up a chair and hung out and watched.” At one point, Poole overheard Stallone making a comment to someone else about him that summed up how he feels protected by the actor when they work together.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cass McCombs has announced his first solo studio album in three years: Interior Live Oak is out August 15 via Domino. After a streak of records with the record label Anti-, McCombs returned to his longtime home of Domino for Interior Live Oak and reunited with old collaborators from his catalog, like Matt Sweeney, Chris Cohen, and Papercuts' Jason Quever. Last year, McCombs surprise-released the album Seed Cake on Leap Year, a collection of previously unreleased music that he recorded at Jason Quever's apartment in San Francisco from 1999 and 2000 while he was living in Berkeley, California. Prior to that, he put out the collaborative effort Mr. Greg & Cass McCombs Sing and Play New Folk Songs for Children in 2023.
