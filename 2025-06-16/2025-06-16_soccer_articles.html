A painful one for Moises Caicedo as he collides with LA's David Martinez, with Marc Cucurella quickly joining the pair. Caicedo and Cucurella are left briefly limping, but no real damage. Michael BrownFormer Tottenham and Man City midfielder on Channel 5 Chelsea have got a really good, healthy squad now. LA left-back Ryan Hollingshead comes forwards and unleashes a piledriver from 25 yards that zips over the crossbar. #bbcfootball, WhatsApp on 03301231826 or text 81111 (UK only, standard message rates apply) Interesting body language from Nicolas Jackson coming off there. He does not look overjoyed for his new team-mate Delap. Michael BrownFormer Tottenham and Man City midfielder on Channel 5 That first run showed you everything about Liam Delap. Liam Delap runs down the right channel, sprints past a defender and pulls it back for Enzo Fernandez, but Chelsea are denied a second goal by some good defending from LA. Chelsea fans outnumber a loud Los Angeles FC ultras section and have made their voices heard when anything big happens. A Chelsea debut for striker Liam Delap, after his £30m move from Ipswich Town earlier this month. He comes on for Nicolas Jackson, with youngster Tyrique George, who featured in Chelsea's Conference League run, replacing Noni Madueke. #bbcfootball, WhatsApp on 03301231826 or text 81111 (UK only, standard message rates apply) Cucurella once again showing what an embarrassment he is. LA substitute David Martinez gets a booking for a push in the face on Marc Cucurella, who crumples to the ground. Michael BrownFormer Tottenham and Man City midfielder on Channel 5 Real quality and power from Denis Bouanga, pushed it back onto his right foot, could he have gone across the goalkeeper? LA's Denis Bouanga gets the wrong side of Pedro Neto in Chelsea's penalty area and strikes low and hard, but Robert Sanchez was able to stick out a foot and keep the ball out. LA have been much improved in this second half. Goalscorer Pedro Neto, this time on the left, twists and turns to create space for a cross, Nicolas Jackson gets his head to the delivery, the ball bounces off an LA defender and just about creeps wide. Michael BrownFormer Tottenham and Man City midfielder on Channel 5 LA have their first real chance of the game and substitute David Martinez has a strike at goal, but it hits fellow replacement Olivier Giroud and that is enough to just about deflect it away from target. Martinez, a 19-year-old Venezuela international, then has another chance, this time from a tight angle, but he can't adjust his feet in time and fires it well wide.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MIAMI – FIFA president Gianni Infantino has a vision that in 100 years people will remember this year's Club World Cup in the United States, and have a centennial celebration for the tournament. The opening weekend of Club World Cup 2025 alone saw: “The FIFA Club World Cup is conquering the world, and soccer is conquering America,” Infantino said in a video posted to his Instagram account Sunday. It's taken some time for brand awareness to register – particularly in a host nation where football (not soccer), basketball, hockey and baseball are the predominant sports garnering fan attention. However, soccer is the prevailing sport above all those worldwide. “There are huge teams coming from all over the world, and that moves a lot of people everywhere. We're talking about great teams with very important players that people love to watch,” Messi said during an interview with FIFA before the tournament. “So, it's a great opportunity to watch the best players play out here in the United States, and it's an amazing opportunity to do this.” The general public has easy accessibility to games with every Club World Cup match is available to live stream for free on DAZN's website or app. Outside of downloading an app and registering login information, there's no need to enter a credit card number – unless you wish to unlock premium features like watching the games in higher definition (1080p instead of 720p). The elaborate basketball-lineup introductions of players before matches, however, have not because they aren't typical in soccer matches. The Club World Cup has drawn criticism for being a cash grab – $1.5 billion of FIFA's $2 billion revenue target has already been grabbed. The other $500 million, if it reaches that, will come from hospitality rights and ticket sales. “When it comes to revenues, everything is perfectly secured,” Infantino said before the tournament. Only two clubs will play seven total matches when they reach the July 13 final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The Sounders admirably pushed for a draw against one of the best clubs in South America before falling 2-1 on their home turf at Lumen Field in Seattle. “We show that not only can we compete, not only from an intensity and an athletic standpoint but from a tactical standpoint … that this league is good enough at the world stage,” Seattle's goal scorer Cristian Roldan said after the loss. "I think that's what this tournament is all about." LAFC coach Steve Cherundolo said he believes this summer's Club World Cup and next year's World Cup will inspire young fans to love the sport – just like watching the 1994 World Cup did for him. "It had a profound effect in 1994, when I was a kid in the stands at the Rose Bowl, watching games live. It really planted the seed for me that has guided my life since that day,” Cherundolo said during a FIFA interview before LAFC plays English Premier League standout Chelsea on Monday in Atlanta. “It should have a very profound effect and positive effect on our sport – or the world sport – in our country.”</p>

Enzo Maresca's side open their tournament against the MLS club With a trophy in tow after Conference League success capped a solid first season under Enzo Maresca, Chelsea will now hope to build and mount a more realistic title challenge in the Premier League next season. First, though, they will look to negotiate this competition, beginning with an encounter with an LAFC that will feature Olivier Giroud up front against his former club. The expanded competition is being held at 12 venues across the United States, with 32 entrants ranging from some of Europe's biggest clubs to semi-professional Auckland City. Follow all of the latest from Mercedes-Benz Stadium with our live blog below. Watch every Fifa Club World Cup game free on DAZN. In fact, Enzo Maresca isn't going to risk Reece James - Malo Gusto has been introduced, while Enzo Fernandez is on in midfield, too. Reece James was in the thick of things, I think playing peace-maker - both he and Tosin Adarabioyo are on bookings, of course. A few handbags after the half-time whistle is blown for...some reason. Anyway, Chelsea in control and not out of the low gears. Tosin Adarabioyo joins fellow defender Reece James in the book after sliding through the back of a would-be recipient of a pass. An unfortunate slip from Jeremy Ebobisse, studs not quite catching in the turf as he tries to retrieve a knock-down in the Chelsea box. A delay as Nathan Ordaz is seen to by the LAFC medics having taken a bang to the head. A change will be made, but not before the free kick...which is tipped over the bar by Robert Sanchez. A tidy finish and the Premier League side are in front. Bright work from Pedro Neto again, zipping past Ryan Hollingshead and swinging in another delivery. Too deep and tall for Noni Madueke to make anything of it. Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This new generation of the U.S. Men's National Team hasn't exactly taken over the world like we were told they would. Either way, the so-called “golden generation” hasn't delivered. At this point, disappointment feels like the only real tradition. Alexi Lalas thinks — again — that we should attribute it to diversity. “We oftentimes talk about our diversity and we talk about it in the fact that it is one of the advantages we have, and of the great things about our country,” Lalas said on First Things First. I'm going to get a hundred different answers. And it might be based on ethnicity, where you grew up, even geography. “So I've argued that the homogenous nature of some other countries and cultures just in population in terms of size are much more manageable. And there is a collective understanding and, more importantly, an agreement in this is how we're going to play. But getting 11 men to represent this great country of 350 million people, and all be on the same page, that is very, very difficult.” Lalas doubled down, arguing that the team might be better off being less inclusive. “In that if you went to the New York metropolitan area or Southern California and you just took players that all grew up in the same area, had all this shared experiences, maybe that would be better in terms of an understanding. And I'm not saying it can't happen. That theory falls apart when you consider that one of the most dominant international teams of this generation — France — won the 2018 World Cup with a roster made up of players from wildly different backgrounds, ethnicities, and life experiences. Kylian Mbappé, Paul Pogba, N'Golo Kanté, and countless others didn't grow up in some shared suburb with the same coach and identical worldview. Lalas' argument doesn't explain why diversity works elsewhere. Maybe the issue isn't too many perspectives, it's the lack of a clear plan to unify them. He also has a love/hate relationship with the New York Mets and Jets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA bosses have been left red-faced after Chelsea's Club World Cup opener against LAFC was played in front of a half-empty stadium. There were huge swathes of empty red seats in the 71,000 capacity Mercedes Benz Stadium in Atlanta as ticket sales appeared to have flopped. Tickets for general admission were on sale for £38 ($51) but the spectacular £1billion stadium did not look even half full at kick-off. FIFA had reduced prices for matches in the States after a poor take up - and attendances over the weekend had been better than first feared. Inter Miami's opening match of the tournament - with Lionel Messi the star attraction - drew 60,927 for their game with Al Ahly. More than 80,000 were in the Rose Bowl on Sunday to watch Paris-Saint Germain's 4-0 win over Atletico Madrid. But the game in Atlanta failed to have the same attraction although it was played at 3pm on a normal work day Monday. A peak of 560,000 watched Bayern's win over no-hopers Auckland City on Channel 5 as the new tournament drew in viewers. There was an average audience of 392,000 for the 10-0 thumping while England's under-21s averaged 562,000 and peaked at 840,000 on Channel 4. Channel 5 are showing live games from the tournament in the United States after striking a deal with DAZN and it remains to be seen whether it will be a hit with viewers. Ahead of Chelsea's first match, Enzo Maresca said Liam Delap can become England's next No9. Maresca insists his new £30m signing has got all the attributes to succeed Harry Kane as England's first choice centre forward. Chelsea boss Maresca worked with Delap while an academy coach at Manchester City and that was a major factor in why they were able to persuade him to move to Stamford Bridge from Ipswich this summer. Maresca said: “When we faced Ipswich, before we faced Ipswich, so Liam was not a Chelsea player, I said that for me, Liam, potentially he can be England number nine. “Liam knows quite well how important the number nine is for this club. “We know each other from years ago, so I know what Liam can give us, he knows what we can give to him to improve and to become a better player. And again in terms of number nine, hopefully he can score goals for us.” Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

 By: Quinn Schmidt

ATLANTA, Ga. -- Ellie Fife of the University of Michigan women's soccer team has been named to the 42-player roster for the first-ever Women's College Talent ID Camp, U.S. Soccer announced on Monday afternoon (June 16).

The camp is the first step in building the U.S. Youth National Teams' scouting strategy of increasing programming opportunities for high-potential college players. The Talent ID Camp, hosted at McCurry Park in Atlanta from June 18-22, has the goal of expanding the Under-18, U19, and U20 Women's National Team player pools.

An Ann Arbor native, Fife has picked up three previous invites to U.S. Talent ID Camps, most recently in 2022. She transferred from Vanderbilt for the upcoming 2025 season, appearing in seven contests for the Commodores and was named to the 2024 SEC Fall Academic Honor Roll.

She was ranked as the 32nd best player in the United States by Prep Soccer in 2024 while playing club soccer for the Michigan Hawks.</p>

Why this weekend alone we've had Gold Cup and Club World Cup, both of which will go careening on into this week and beyond. I'm James Benge, let's take a look back at what you might have missed this weekend: Tuesday, June 17🏆 CWC: Fluminense vs. Borussia Dortmund, 12 p.m. ➡️ DAZN🇪🇺 U21 Euros: Spain vs. Italy, 3 p.m. ➡️ Vix🌎 Gold Cup: Canada vs. Honduras, 10:30 p.m. ➡️ FS1 In his report on last night's game, Chuck Booth was at pains to warn you all "don't get carried away." I'm here to tell you the exact opposite. The US men's national team have won a soccer match! The Soca Warriors had never won on American soil before and they didn't get close on Sunday night, Malik Tillman scoring the first two in what wound up being a comprehensive 5-0 win for Mauricio Pochettino's men. Across the pitch, the US looked stronger and more incisive, dominating possession on their way to 21 shots and 3.6 expected goals. Meanwhile the starriest of stars, Christian Pulisic, was jabbing at Mauricio Pochettino about the games he might wish to pick and choose. Now there is an opportunity to build real momentum and for a few of those fringe players to carve out bigger roles. Tillman translating his PSV Eindhoven form to the national team suggests he should not even be in the fringe category. Perhaps the same was true of Diego Luna, impressive once more on his way to two assists. Up next in Austin is Saudi Arabia, another faltering future World Cup host albeit with plenty more time to build something. After a trying few months, that would go down very nicely for USMNT. FIFA was at great pains on Saturday morning to pronounce the kick off of the tournament a "resounding success" as 60,927 spectators at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium (that's about 93% capacity) were treated to Robbie Williams, Lionel Messi and, well, no goals. Trezeguet saw his penalty saved, Lionel Messi hit the woodwork and the Herons had to settle for a point. Bayern Munich did what you would expect they would do an amateur side from New Zealand, only to the max, winning 10-0 against Auckland City. Seattle Sounders were not so outclassed but their defeat for Botafogo means they are right on the edge of elimination from an extremely tough group. Their best hope might come in the faltering of Atletico Madrid, reduced to 10 men and crushed 4-0 by Paris Saint-Germain. Diego Simeone's side looked heavy legged, like a team that were supposed to be on the beach after a 56 game season. The sheer heft of that defeat means they are going to have quite the match on their hands when they face Botafogo in the final round of group stage games. With Group A up in the air and Group B also intriguingly set, there does at least to seem to be bubbling intrigue around knockout stage qualification. The same could be true as Boca Juniors face off against Benfica tonight. Here's everything you need to know about the Club World Cup. 🇳🇿 About that 10-0 loss: Yes it's not a great look for the Club World Cup or indeed for Auckland City that they just lost by double digits to Bayern Munich. Still, it probably was even more of a freak result than you might think. ❌ Taremi stuck in Iran: As tensions mount between Iran and Israel, Inter striker Mehdi Taremi finds himself stuck in Tehran. He will not travel to the Club World Cup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mauricio Pochettino gives his thoughts after the USMNT's 5-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago in the Concacaf Gold Cup (0:31) SAN JOSE, Calif. -- After a turbulent run-up to this summer's Gold Cup, the U.S. men's national team can breathe again. In the throes of a four-game home losing streak under new-ish manager Mauricio Pochettino, the U.S. began the Gold Cup on Sunday with a resounding 5-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago. The scoreline was by no means a fluke, either. It made for the kind of comfortable win that seemed beyond this group of players just last Tuesday following its 4-0 humbling against Switzerland. It hadn't lost four consecutive games at home since 1988, when it dropped two games each to Chile and Ecuador. That was at the tail end of a 40-year barren spell between World Cup appearances. It couldn't entirely be blamed on youth. Among the dominant storylines surrounding the side was Christian Pulisic's decision to take the summer off and not play in the Gold Cup, which resulted in a chorus of criticism from fans as well as former U.S. internationals such as Landon Donovan. Pulisic's father, Mark, then came to his son's defense with the help of ChatGPT. It didn't really matter that the victory came over the 100th-ranked team in the world -- one shorn of key forward Levi García who, in an only-in-Concacaf move, picked this weekend to get married. This youthful side, with seven starters having fewer than seven caps entering the match, needed to start building a foundation somehow, and it did precisely that. "I think [Sunday's win] is about [congratulating] them, and I think the first half there's a lot of positive things, that we need to keep evolving in different areas," Pochettino said. "But I think overall it was a good game and three points. "Nothing is done, but yes, to feel the victory and being more positive in the next few days, I think it's important to grow that confidence in between us." Center backs Tim Ream and Chris Richards gave outside backs Alex Freeman and Max Arfsten the security to perform their two-way roles on offense and defense with confidence, Arfsten in particular pushing higher up the field. Luca de la Torre provided stability to Sebastian Berhalter in midfield, while Tillman led the attack, allowing Luna to buzz around defensively and provide two assists, with Jack McGlynn making attacking contributions as well. It will make for a greater level of confidence when the tougher moments arrive, and could apply to team veterans and youngsters alike. For Tillman, this kind of performance has been a long time coming, so much so that Richards was shocked that the goals were Tillman's first with the national team. But more is being asked of the PSV attacker in this environment than in previous camps with the national team. I had a good season at PSV," said Tillman, who notched 16 goals and five assists for his Dutch team in 2024-25 (34 games, all competitions). That dynamic between youth and experience was also visible through a more unsung contribution deeper in midfield. Tyler Adams was out because of a foot injury and Johnny Cardoso was sidelined due to an illness, which meant Pochettino had to mine the depth chart. In this instance, he opted for De la Torre and Berhalter. The latter sat in a deeper role, allowing de la Torre to sniff out opportunities while also tracking back when needed. Overall, the combination showed promise and is the latest sign that De la Torre is another player making an impression on Pochettino. But in this case, he has picked his moments to push farther upfield when the situation demands it. Kasey Keller breaks down the situation between Christian Pulisic and Mauricio Pochettino, in which Pochettino said Pulisic isn't allowed to dictate games he plays in. Pochettino liked what he saw out of both players, and is pleased that another midfield combination is emerging. "I think the football relationship between Luca and [Sebastian], it was fantastic and they controlled the game," Pochettino said. "Of course, we didn't have the help of Tyler and Johnny, but this is a good thing -- a period of opportunity to see [the other two] players. But sometimes [they] surprise you and say, 'OK, they take the opportunity,' and that is good because the competition is going to be higher now." "It allows me to get the ball and combine," Luna said about playing with Tillman and De la Torre. [Having] good players around you always allows you to be more confident and have trust within the team." Luna's two-assist performance, including a steal and feed to Tillman for the USMNT's second goal, was another step forward for the native of nearby Sunnyvale. The extent to which this mix of youth and experience can move forward will get its next test in four days against Saudi Arabia in Austin, Texas. That is bound to be a much tougher assignment than Sunday's match.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Like a movie with three endings, Chelsea's 2024-25 season just keeps going. Now we have at least three more games to play, and perhaps a few more if (when) we get to the knockout stages of FIFA's newfangled Club World Cup. Our first group stage game sees us face late-entrants Los Angeles FC, who were granted the opportunity to get Club León's spot after the Liga MX side were kicked due to their shared ownership structure with fellow qualifiers Club Pachuca. LAFC beat Club América in a one-game playoff to earn their chance against Chelsea, Flamengo, and ES Tunis. For us, it might not mean that much. But we play to win every game and every competition, and this one is about as competitive as you can get for a summer tournament. If FIFA have it their way, this thing will grow to become as big of a deal as the Champions League or maybe even the World Cup. I doubt that's going to be the case — the old format, which we won in 2021 (well, 2022), certainly never took off — but I've been wrong before. Date / Time: Monday, June 16, 2025, 20.00 BST; 3pm EDT; 12:30am IST (next day)Venue: Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta, GA, USAReferee: Jesús Valenzuela Sáez, with VAR — the new 8-second rule will be in effect for goalkeepers, while assistant referees will be alerted to obvious offsides through their headsets by the semi-automated technology so that they can raise the flag earlier (and hopefully avoid unnecessary situations like Taiwo Awoniyi's collision with the post); also, there's a ref-cam that for some reason doesn't use image stabilization so it's incredibly shaky when shown on the broadcastForecast: Humid and hot, with the usual afternoon thunderstorm; the stadium does have a retractable roof so it's always comfortable and playable On TV: Channel 5 (UK); TBS, TUDN (USA); none (India); SuperSport Premier League (NGA); elsewhereStreaming: DAZN is streaming ALL the games globally; you do have to watch through their website or their App (mobile or smart TV). The games are all free (with a free DAZN account) with the occasional in-game split screen ad, though they will push paid plans in your face and that can be tricky to navigate around sometimes. Here's a link (USA) that should skip past the annoying signup splash page and go directly to their CWC hub. Chelsea team news: For logistical, competitive, and transfer-market reasons, we've decided to not make too many changes to the squad from the second half of the season, adding only the four new signings that we been already made: Liam Delap, Dário Essugo, Mamadou Sarr, and Mike Penders. Penders replaces Marcus Bettinelli as the third goalkeeper, with Betts leaving for Manchester City. Fourth goalkeeper Lucas Bergström was released and his place has gone to Gaga Slonina. Chelsea wanted to bring Đorđe Petrović along at first, but Petro has decided to explore his transfer options instead. Other notable absentees from the 28-man squad registered for the group stage include Wesley Fofana, who's currently recovering from hamstring surgery, and Mykhailo Mudryk, who's serving his (officially still just provisional) suspension for a doping ban. And Jadon Sancho has gone back to Manchester United after failing to agree a (lower-paying) contract with Chelsea. About a third of the squad had been involved in internationals in the last couple weeks, so they've had practically no break at all since the Conference League final. That might actually be helpful in avoiding “pre-season mode”. Their main threat is a man named Denis Bouanga, once of AS Saint-Étienee, who's scored 20 league goals in back-to-back seasons and is on track for a third consecutive. A more familiar, though these days far less threatening name will be Olivier Giroud. He does have three goals in MLS this season, which is three more than last season, but he's struggled since joining from AC Milan last summer. Fellow 38-year-old veteran Hugo Lloris will be another familiar name: the former Spurs goalkeeper was an MLS All-Star last season. We might also remember ex-Roma striker Cengiz Ünder from the season he spent on loan at Leicester City a few years ago. Head coach Steve Cherundolo made over 300 appearances in the Bundesliga (all for Hannover 96 in a remarkable 15-year career at the club) so he's not blind to the reality of this situation. But he will certainly do his utmost to prepare his team, who will be fired up for the occasion. “I know our players are competitive, I know our players really want to be here, and I know our players want to show well, and we are prepared for this. But yes [...] it's very clear who the underdog is, and who the favourite is, but we feel fine with that, and we're comfortable with that. Previously: LAFC have only been in existence for eight years, so this is unsurprisingly our first ever game against them. This is however the third straight year that we've played in Atlanta, after a 1-1 draw against Newcastle United in the Premier League Summer Series two years ago and a 3-0 win against Club América in a friendly last year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MetLife Stadium will host eight Club World Cup matches this summer, including both semi-finals and the final, before hosting the men's World Cup final next summer in a tournament which will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico. Playing surfaces were a cause for complaint at last summer's Copa America in the U.S. and the Argentine head coach Lionel Scaloni described the field at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta as not being up to standard while goalkeeper Emi Martinez said it was a “disaster” and “like a trampoline.” Brown patches were also visible on the sides of the pitch at MetLife during last summer's tournament, which was organised by CONMEBOL rather than FIFA. Estevao, who has already agreed to join Premier League team Chelsea after this tournament, said: “I think the pitch should have been watered a little more as the ball was a little slow which interferes with the pace of the game. Over the past year, FIFA has studied which grass type would be best for MetLife, before deciding upon a “warm-season grass” it believed would endure the local conditions. The Athletic has previously reported that grass was grown at Tuckahoe Turf Farms, which is also responsible for the grass being grown for the men's World Cup in 2026. The stadium, shared by the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets, usually has a synthetic turf but the FIFA competitions this year and next summer require natural grass. This week has been inconsistent in terms of weather, with boiling temperatures midweek before dropping closer to 60 degrees Fahrenheit over the weekend. I don't know who is the patron saint for rain but after it rained it then enabled us to play our game.” This was particularly when we wanted to accelerate the game. There were some mistakes that happened (as a result) but the grass is the same for both teams. This match had a creditable attendance of 46,275, largely made up of passionate Palmeiras fans and while the lower rings appeared close to full, supporters were scattered across three tiers which does not make for the best atmosphere. Forty-six thousand is a big number but maybe they could have closed the third ring and placed everyone in the first and second (to bring it closer).. But with the amount of Palmeiras fans, it was like we were playing at home and this was a strength for Palmeiras. The stadium is too big but 46,000 is very good when people from Brazil and Portugal had to come and fly in and it's not so easy to do that.” FIFA did provide QR codes to fans attending the game on boards outside the stadium which offered 20 per cent discount on other group stage games being played at MetLife Stadium. Thursday's fixture for Palmeiras against Al-Ahly at MetLife has now dropped down to $45 on Ticketmaster for standard admission while Tuesday's noon kick off between Borussia Dortmund and Fluminense is now down to $33 at the same venue.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>His order includes grilled onions and yellow banana peppers. Murray, who moved to Seattle from New Orleans less than two years ago, remains unconvinced by the proposition of adding cream cheese. “I haven't tried it yet,” he said. Murray is one of the announced 30,151 fans who showed up to watch the Sounders fall 2-1 to Brazilian club Botafogo in Sunday's Club World Cup match. Murray, a Sounders season-ticket holder, held off on buying tickets to the match until Friday to avoid paying the high prices enforced by FIFA's dynamic-pricing model, but said he empathized with fans who bought tickets early only to see prices tumble. “I waited to buy and they still ended up expensive,” he said. “But this is a rare event to be coming here, so I just figured let me just blow the money and see it anyway. And you can probably tell from the crowd turnout, if you go on Ticketmaster right now, a lot of seats are still empty.” FIFA's dynamic pricing model factors demand into ticket cost, causing prices to plummet during the weeks before the tournament's opening. A 300-level ticket to Sunday's game cost more than $153 during the December presale period. Three days before the match, a 300-level ticket was just $62 after taxes and fees. Dynamic pricing will become even more relevant next summer, when Seattle hosts six games during the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Steve DeBroux, another Sounders fan, called the dynamic pricing “disappointing” and said it was making him rethink his strategy for buying World Cup tickets next year. DeBroux said this experience erased any thoughts he'd had about purchasing one of the World Cup hospitality packages being offered. DeBroux's wariness following his Club World Cup ticketing experience, however, is countered by a simple desire to make sure he gets to see a World Cup game in Seattle. It was a similar sentiment echoed by Ben Allen-White, another Sounders season-ticket holder. Allen-White also bought Club World Cup tickets during the presale period before prices tumbled, but described himself as just mildly disappointed about the eventual outcome. He also still plans to buy World Cup tickets as early as possible, because he feels there will be more demand for that tournament and he doesn't want to miss it. “I'm going to be just as foolish next time, too,” he said. The Sounders tried to get free tickets from FIFA to each of their three games at Lumen Field as additional compensation for fans who bought the presale tickets, but were only able to get them for the Botafogo game, a source with knowledge of the situation said. Allycea Weil and Wayne Liou are more casual Sounders fans. “I appreciate that the Sounders stepped up to help us,” Liu said. Weil, Liou, Allen-White and his brother Lawrence White, DeBroux and Jed Feltis, a season-ticket holder since 2009 — the club's first MLS season — all said they'd be more interested and invested in the tournament if the players received a larger share of the Club World Cup's prize money. Sounders players wore shirts emblazoned with the phrase “Club World Ca$h Grab” before their game against Minnesota United on June 1 to call attention to MLS owners refusal to formally negotiate about how the nearly $9.55 million prize pool each MLS club will earn for participating in the Club World Cup will be split with the players. “I wish Hanauer would step behind the players and say ‘They deserve more,'” Feltis said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SAN JOSE, Calif. (June 15, 2025) - Seeking an eighth Concacaf Gold Cup trophy, the United States Men's National Team kicked off its 2025 campaign on a resounding high note Sunday afternoon, winning the first match of group play with a 5-0 victory against Trinidad and Tobago at PayPal Park in San Jose, Calif., behind an energetic team performance that will build momentum into the next two group stage matches. Like Mauricio Pochettino's lineups for the June friendlies, tonight's starting XI was relatively inexperienced in global competition. The lineup Sunday averaged 15 caps and seven in official competition. Midfielder Sebastian Berhalter, defender Alex Freeman and goalkeeper Matt Freese all earned their first caps in official competition. Midfielder Jack McGlynn also collected his first start in official competition. Every player in the starting XI besides Ream made their Gold Cup debuts. Trinidad and Tobago began the match sitting in a deep block, which allowed the United States to control possession and play some exciting soccer. His lovely one-touch pass into space for Patrick Agyemang led to the first shot attempt of the match. Moments later, the midfielder was part of a beautiful combination that eventually led to a disciplined, one-touch strike from Sebastian Berhalter that was on frame but deflected out-of-bounds for a U.S. corner kick. Agyemang would have another good look at goal in the 12th minute. Agyemang nodded a fierce header toward the far post, but it bounced just wide. Agyemang won the ball deep in the Americans' attacking third and played it ahead to McGlynn to his right. In the 25th minute, McGlynn played a terrific 40-yard ball across the field on a rope to Diego Luna. With space, the native of nearby Sunnyvale, Calif. took a good first touch, but Phillip won the battle, leaving his line swiftly to block Luna's attempted chip. Again, in the 36th minute, after a hard foul gave the United States a free kick, Phillip stopped Alex Freeman's header from McGlynn's left-footed service. Alvin Jones attempted to get out of pressure with a pass back to his goalkeeper, but he didn't see Luna in the area. On the breakaway, Luna sent a rolling ball along the six-yard box line to Tillman, making a dead sprint into the box, who hammered it home to record a first-half brace. Luna, showing his relentless work rate all throughout the first half, would soon record his second assist in three minutes.Tillman played a long ball out of the USA's defensive half deep into space for Luna, and the midfielder, fresh off assisting Tillman's second goal, decided to take it himself this time. Playing with a three-goal lead did not mean the United States would sit back in the second half. In the 50th minute, McGlynn nearly capitalized following a cross from Arfsten. Moments later, Agyemang used his physicality and speed to create a chance for himself, a smashing strike that required a push over the crossbar from Philip, his fifth of six saves on the day. Trinidad and Tobago nearly got on the scoresheet in the 58th minute when Tyrese Spicer dribbled into dangerous territory and took a shot that was headed toward goal. The play called Matt Freese into action, and the United States goalkeeper, making just his second career appearance, came up with a crucial touch to preserve his clean sheet. Pochettino sent on subs for three of the match's biggest contributors. Making a run, Aaronson received the ball at the end line and made a decisive cut with the outside of his right foot to set up his shot. Just two minutes later, Wright added a goal of his own. The outcome follows Saturday's tournament opener, where defending Gold Cup champion Mexico beat Dominican Republic 3-2 at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif. The United States will carry the momentum from Sunday's win to Texas for their remaining group stages matches. The team will next face guest side Saudi Arabia on Thursday, June 19 at Q2 Stadium in Austin, Texas (9:15 p.m. ET; FS1, TUDN, ViX, FDP Radio) and conclude group play Sunday, June 22 against Haiti at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas (7 p.m. USA – MALIK TILLMAN (JACK MCGLYNN), 16th minute: Following two shot attempts of his own, Patrick Agyemang produced a takeaway that ignited a quick United States counter. Agyemang sent the ball ahead to Jack McGlynn, who crossed the ball far post to Malik Tillman. USA – MALIK TILLMAN (DIEGO LUNA), 41st minute: Diego Luna took advantage of a costly mistake from Trinidad and Tobago when he intercepted a pass back to the goalkeeper. The midfielder finished it off to record his second international goal and first brace. USA – BRENDEN AARONSON (MAX ARFSTEN), 82nd minute: Moments after entering the match as a substitute, Brenden Aaronson received a pass from Max Arfsten near the end line. Aaronson beat his defender one-on-one and delivered a right-footed shot near post to extend the lead for the United States. USA – HAJI WRIGHT (MAX ARFSTEN), 84th minute: Max Arfsten found success working the right side of the pitch. Just after assisting Aaronson's goal, he found Wright making a run on the right side. Lineups:USA: 25-Matt Freese; 16-Alex Freeman, 3-Chris Richards (12-Miles Robinson, 87), 13-Tim Ream (Capt. ), 18-Max Arfsten; 14-Luca de la Torre (21-Paxten Aaronson 83), 8-Sebastian Berhalter; 6-Jack McGlynn (22-Mark McKenzie, 74), 17-Malik Tillman, 10-Diego Luna (11-Brenden Aaronson, 74); 24-Patrick Agyemang (19-Haji Wright, 73)Substitutes not used: 1-Matt Turner, 26-Chris Brady, 2-John Tolkin, 4-Tyler Adams, 5-Walker Zimmerman, 7-Quinn Sullivan, 9-Damion Downs, 20-Nathan Harriel, 23-Brian WhiteNot Dressed: 4-Tyler Adams, 9-Damion Downs, 15-Johnny CardosoHead coach: Mauricio Pochettino Substitutes not used: 2-Darnell Hospedales, 7-Steffen Yeates, 14-Wayne Frederick II, 18-Andre Rampersad, 20-Real Gill, 21-Jabari St. Hillaire, 22-Denzil SmithHead coach: Dwight Yorke</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Men's National Team boss Mauricio Pochettino isn't letting a single player “dictate the plan” he has for the American squad, even if that player is Christian Pulisic. The ongoing controversy surrounding Pulisic's absence from the squad after deciding not to play in this summer's Gold Cup has been the focal point of American soccer. It's led to a number of former USMNT players, most notably Landon Donovan, to criticise Pulisic, who has said he's taking a step back after a grueling season with his club team, AC Milan. Pulisic added to the controversy when he appeared on CBS Sports Golazo Network last week and revealed that he had wanted to play in a pair of exhibition matches before the Gold Cup, but Pochettino declined the request, wanting to play the same squad all summer. That didn't seem to bother Pochettino. “He explained why he only wanted to be involved in two games and not the Gold Cup, and I respect that. But I do need that he understands our decision. A loss to Switzerland last week sent the US into the Gold Cup on a down note, but it rebounded by beating Trinidad and Tobago 5-0 in its group stage opener on Sunday. Pulisic had noted in his interview that he had only had one conversation with Pochettino, but the coach brushed that aside, asserting that he tries to maintain the same level of communication with all his players. “I love to be in communication with my players,” he said.</p>
