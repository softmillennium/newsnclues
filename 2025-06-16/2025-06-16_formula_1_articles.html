                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kubica, Phil Hanson and Yifei Ye won in the satellite #83 AF Corse Ferrari 499P LMH, with the former F1 star completing a mighty final stint to ensure victory for his team. His win at Le Mans follows that of Alonso himself, who triumphed back in 2018 and 2019 when he took a hiatus from F1 racing. And the Spaniard was swift to congratulate his former rival on social media. “Bravo Robert,” Alonso posted, with Russell – fresh from triumphing in Canada – adding his own praise. “Congrats mate on winning Le Mans, so happy for you! The British star was Kubica's team mate at Williams when the Pole attempted an F1 comeback in 2019 following his rally crash, which severely injured his right arm. Kubica's career has always been one of huge highs and crushing lows. He suffered a shocking crash in Canada in 2007 when driving for BMW, before going on to win that race the following season – which ended up being his only F1 victory. So, it seemed apt that his Le Mans win coincided with the Canadian Grand Prix, and that his last team mate in F1 managed to take the win in Montreal. “An all time moment for Robert Kubica,” F1 commentator Alex Jacques wrote, echoing the sentiments of many. “I have a close relationship with Robert, he stayed with me a couple of years at Alfa Romeo and before in F3 Formula Renault,” Vasseur explained after the Canadian Grand Prix. He had a chaotic career in motorsport, and when you see the level of effort that he put into his career, I'm very, very pleased for him to have this kind of result today.” Don't miss your chance to experience F1 at the beautiful Red Bull Ring...
