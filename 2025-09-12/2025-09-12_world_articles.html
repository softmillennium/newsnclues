                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Full report: Utah governor confirms arrest of suspect In an interview on Fox & Friends on Friday morning, the US president was asked what he intended to do to heal the wounds of Kirk's shooting in Utah. How do we come back together?” he was asked by the show's co-host Ainsley Earhardt, who commented that there were radicals operating on the left and right of US politics. Less than 48 hours after Kirk was shot in broad daylight on the campus of Utah Valley University, Trump replied: “I tell you something that is going to get me in trouble, but I couldn't care less.” The worst thing that happened to this country.” In more recent times, Joe Biden used his inaugural address in 2021, just days after the insurrection by Trump supporters at the US Capitol on January 6, to call for unity, without which, he said, “there is no peace, only bitterness and fury”. Trump's appearance on Fox News made clear he has no intention of following that rhetorical tradition. In Friday's comments, he threatened the philanthropist George Soros with a Rico investigation of the sort normally reserved for organised crime. He accused Soros of funding “professional agitators” who were engaging in “more than protest, this is real agitation, this is riots on the streets”. In an Oval Office address delivered hours after Kirk was pronounced dead, Trump made menacing remarks indicating he would seek revenge against “organizations that fund and support” political violence. He has authorised an investigation into the main fundraising channel for the Democratic party, ActBlue, and threatened to rescind the tax-exempt status of progressive groups such as Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew) and environmental groups.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mike Kehoe first unveiled the map and ordered a special legislative session to approve it. It targets longtime Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver by carving up his Kansas City-area district and stretching its boundaries into rural, Republican-friendly areas of central Missouri. They have 90 days after the map is signed into law to collect the signatures needed to force a statewide vote. “Together, in the courts and in the streets, we will continue pushing to ensure the law is upheld, justice prevails, and this unconstitutional gerrymander is defeated,” Cleaver said in a statement. Missouri is the latest state to undertake a mid-decade redistricting as part of an extraordinary, multi-state campaign by President Donald Trump and his allies to  preserve the balance of power in the House by changing district lines. Republicans hope to win seven of Missouri's eight congressional seats under the new map in next year's midterm elections. The GOP currently controls six seats, and Democrats hold two. Trump celebrated the new map Friday afternoon, writing on Truth Social that he hoped it would yield an additional GOP seat. “It is wonderful to see Republicans in the “Show Me State” standing up to Save our Country, and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,” he said. Democrats in the state legislature fiercely opposed the changes but could do little to stop or slow its passage because Republicans hold supermajorities in both chambers. Democratic state Sen. Stephen Webber argued during floor debate Friday that Republicans were surrendering their independence and bending to Trump's will. Democratic state Sen. Barbara Washington of Kansas City called the map a “blatant political attack.” “Carving up Kansas City and silencing our constituents is terrible.” They repeatedly maintained it had originated with Kehoe's office. A group called People Not Politicians said they would file paperwork to kick off the referendum process Friday. Missouri voters — not politicians — will have the final say,” spokesperson Elsa Rainey said in a statement. Missouri is the third state in recent weeks to undertake a redistricting effort. Last month, the GOP-controlled legislature in Texas redrew lines with the goal of helping Republicans pick up five additional seats. Democrats in California have responded with their own revised map that aims to flip five Republican-held seats. It must be approved by voters this fall. Trump's allies are weighing new maps in other states, including Florida, Kansas and Indiana. Democratic governors in Illinois, New York and Maryland, meanwhile, have indicated they might respond with changes of their own to benefit their party. Typically, states carry out redistricting once every decade after the Census to account for population shifts and ensure that each congressional and state legislative district holds roughly the same number of people.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The attack in Doha upended a decades-old assumption – and left Arab leaders questioning how much they can still rely on Washington On Thursday, Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, led a funeral at the state mosque. Flanked by officials in white thobes, he prayed over six caskets – one draped in a Qatari flag and five bearing Palestinian flags. Israel's strike on Hamas leaders in Doha on Tuesday, which also killed a Qatari officer, marked an unprecedented moment for the Gulf kingdom. The US supplied arms, parked its aircraft carrier in the Gulf and provided political cover internationally. That changed when the US failed to stop the strike on Qatar this week, despite Israel being one of its closest allies. Donald Trump said he tried to give warning, but Qatar said it was only notified after the strike. Doha strongly condemned the strike, with al-Thani calling it “state terror” in an interview with CNN. “I have no words to express how enraged we are from such an action … This is state terror. “This has real repercussions for the relationship,” said Patrick Theros, a former US ambassador to Qatar who helped build the Al Udeid base. “The Gulf states, beginning with Saudi Arabia, believe that their security and stability still depend on America. For them, preventing an Israeli attack on Qatar was a no-brainer – the US could have done it without barely lifting a finger,” he added. The message taken from the strike was not that Washington cannot control Israel, which it arms and equips to the tune of tens of billions of dollars, but it does not want to rein it in. “The perception in the Gulf is that at worst is that the US didn't want to stop Israel and gave it a green light, or at best, that it doesn't care about the sovereignty of its Gulf allies,” said Yasmine Farouk, project director at the International Crisis Group. The reaction among Gulf states has been immediate. Despite past rifts with Qatar, its neighbours viewed the attack as an assault on all of their collective sovereignty. Qatar has welcomed Jordan's crown prince, the UAE president and Egypt's foreign minister. On Sunday, Doha will host an emergency Arab-Islamic summit. But Gulf states may quietly start turning down American requests. Getting more Arab states to sign up for the Abraham Accords – Trump's major initiative in the region – is farther off than ever. US access to Gulf capital could also be in jeopardy. We won't notice at first, but Qatar will stop taking chances on our behalf,” said Theros.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer fatally shot a man who resisted arrest and dragged the officer during a vehicle stop in a Chicago suburb Friday morning, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The man, Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, was an undocumented immigrant, according to DHS. The officer, whose name was not immediately released, suffered severe injuries but is in stable condition, a Homeland Security official told CNN. Villegas-Gonzalez drove his car at law enforcement officers, hitting one of them and dragging that officer a “significant distance,” according to the department. “We are praying for the speedy recovery of our law enforcement officer. He followed his training, used appropriate force, and properly enforced the law to protect the public and law enforcement,” Tricia McLaughlin, Homeland Security assistant secretary, said in a release. “Viral social media videos and activists encouraging illegal aliens to resist law enforcement not only spread misinformation, but also undermine public safety, as well as the safety of our officers and those being apprehended,” she said. Immigration enforcement operations have been ramping up in the Chicago area over recent days, marking one of the latest escalations between the Trump administration and Democratic-led cities that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. This week, the administration announced “Operation Midway Blitz,” which Homeland Security officials have described as intended to target undocumented immigrants in Illinois with criminal records. FBI agents were processing the scene on Friday afternoon, a CNN crew observed. This story has been updated with additional information.</p>

Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. Democratic senators are calling for a congressional hearing on JPMorgan Chase and other banks' ties to accused child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. “The American people deserve to know what happened at JPMorgan and other banks that financed Mr. Epstein,” 10 Democratic members of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee wrote to Committee Chair Tim Scott (R-South Carolina). “The Committee should hold a public hearing as soon as possible to examine failures and advance reforms that protect our communities,” they continued. The letter was signed by Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts), Jack Reed (Rhode Island), Tina Smith (Minnesota), Catherine Cortez Masto (Nevada), Chris Van Hollen (Maryland), Raphael Warnock (Georgia), Andy Kim (New Jersey), Ruben Gallego (Arizona), Lisa Blunt Rochester (Delaware), and Angela Alsobrooks (Maryland). The Times reported that JPMorgan may have enabled Epstein's crimes by continuing to work with him despite repeated warnings from employees as early as 2006. “During a time when Epstein was regularly sexually abusing teenage girls and young women, JPMorgan processed more than 4,700 transactions, totaling more than $1.1 billion, for him, including payments to his victims,” the Times reported. The bank subsequently paid victims of Epstein and regulators more than $100 million in settlements. “So, despite repeated warnings from their employees, JPMorgan — and other financial institutions like Deutsche Bank — continued to do business with Mr. Epstein, potentially enabling his significant crimes.” “As the Trump Administration takes steps to loosen safeguards — such as rolling back anti-money laundering rules, halting enforcement of laws to combat anonymous shell companies, and firing bank examiners — our understanding of these vulnerabilities is more important than ever,” they wrote. JPMorgan has faced multiple lawsuits over its relationship with Epstein. Also that year, JPMorgan settled a lawsuit filed by about 200 victims for $290 million. Haley Robson, who was sexually abused by Epstein when she was in high school, contacted CEO Dimon directly about the bank's integral role in Epstein's crimes. “I don't understand how so many people, colleagues, knew what was going on, or had evidence and information that could have helped us, and chose not to speak up,” Haley Robson wrote in a letter to Dimon, The Daily Beast reported in 2023. “I may not be as smart as you, but we should at least agree that the information you withheld has hurt me and many others,” she continued. Trump has denied he authored the note signed “Donald Trump,” which features what appears to be the outline of a woman or girl's body. “Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret,” Trump allegedly wrote. One of the women has Epstein's initials tattooed on her exposed buttocks. As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

The Sept. 10 death of Charlie Kirk—the highest-profile American political figure to be assassinated in nearly six decades—represents a tipping point for the nation, legal scholars and others told The Epoch Times. How leaders and the populace react to it could determine whether the tide of political violence continues to rise—or recedes.

The 31-year-old father of two was fatally shot in the neck as he spoke on a Utah college campus. As of Sept. 11, the gunman remained unidentified and on the loose; police detained two people but released both after questioning.

Susan MacManus, a Florida political scholar for a half-century, said Kirk's slaying could spark important changes.

Two universities have terminated employees who made what they described as inappropriate remarks about the murder of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk.

“The comments by this employee, who worked in a position of trust directly with students, were inconsistent with our values and have undermined the university's credibility and reputation with our students, faculty, staff and the community at large,” McPhee added. “This employee has been fired effective immediately. We extend our deepest sympathies to the Kirk family.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. “The [FDA's] new recommendations are acting as a bureaucratic deterrent against people getting the vaccine, exacerbating the problem of record lows in rates of COVID vaccination last year,” evolutionary epidemiologist and fellow Truthout contributor Rob Wallace told me. The new guidelines officially limit vaccine approval to people older than 65 and those older than 6 months who are immunocompromised or live with another qualifying health condition, such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease. Previously, the vaccines were recommended for most adults to protect against severe illness, hospitalization, and death. The change means fewer people will get vaccinated and more will die of COVID-19, a preventable disease that has killed more than 1.2 million Americans since January 2020, according to the CDC. “We are feeling very dehumanized and like our lives don't matter,” Debra, a Missouri resident who lives with chronic illness and is using only her first name to protect the identities of her children, told Truthout. Getting the updated COVID-19 vaccine is one important way to limit your risk of contracting the virus or transmitting it to others in your community, who may be at higher risk of severe illness, according to medical researchers. Research has shown that available vaccines are not a perfect solution and work best when paired with other preventative measures, especially wearing an N95 or KN95 mask during surges, in medical settings, while traveling, or in other crowded or poorly-ventilated settings. “We are feeling very dehumanized and like our lives don't matter.” The FDA's new prohibitive guidelines around COVID-19 vaccines are the latest in a series of moves furthering Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s anti-vaccine and eugenicist agenda. Kennedy took to X/Twitter on August 27, 2025, to laud the new vaccine guidance, claiming it fulfilled his promise to “end covid vaccine mandates.” He has also installed anti-vaccine activists in important positions within his administration, ordered a review of the child vaccine schedule, and often repeated disinformation about vaccines and autism. Kennedy also claimed in his August 27 post to X/Twitter that COVID-19 vaccines would remain “available to people who want them, especially the vulnerable.” But the reality is that even those labeled high-risk, including disabled and aging Americans, are now struggling to access a vaccine. “I have been inquiring at Walgreens, CVS, and Albertsons about availability, [and] the vague answer is ‘two to three weeks' based on the ‘lack of approvals,' even though [the vaccines] have been approved for my age group,” Dane Madsen, a 67-year-old resident of Nevada, told Truthout. Stephanie, a North Carolina resident who is using only her first name to avoid harassment from anti-vaccine relatives and neighbors, told Truthout she was unable to find the vaccines at any local branch of six department stores and retail pharmacies, including CVS, Walgreens, and Walmart: “Ultimately, this year, nobody in my family is likely to get a COVID vaccine.” Debra told Truthout her local CVS refused to vaccinate her 5-year-old, even though the child has asthma, which is on the CDC's list of qualifying conditions. “There's a lot of misinformation, and nobody seems to know what's going on,” she said. She now plans to take her child to a CVS MinuteClinic, where others have reported that the on-site nurse practitioners have helped them overcome access barriers. Some patients are seeking Nuvaxovid, a non-mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 developed by Novavax, which has been shown to produce fewer and milder short-term side effects than Pfizer's mRNA vaccine. Christina Gleason, who takes immunosuppressant medications for Sjogren's disease, told Truthout she experienced “lengthy symptom flares that have lasted up to a month” after receiving mRNA vaccines in the past, but only mild discomfort with Nuvaxovid. On September 10, 2025, New York Times reporter Maggie Astor shared on Bluesky that Sanofi had not yet shipped Nuvaxovid, but the company planned to begin doing so the following week. “It is completely unclear when any pharmacies will have it in [and] the communications have been so poor,” Elana Levin, who is looking for Nuvaxovid in New York, told Truthout. Novavax and Sanofi did not respond to Truthout's requests for comment. Even if Gleason were willing to risk a symptom flare, she said she has been unable to schedule a vaccine appointment at her local Walmart in Upstate New York. “It's been a major stressor, wondering if, when, and how I can get the updated vaccine,” she told Truthout. Matthew Cortland, a public health expert who has published a series of explainers on COVID-19 access issues in their newsletter, wrote in one that, in the vast majority of cases, pharmacies will not ask patients how they meet the criteria or to provide documentation. Those who are uninsured or underinsured can expect to be charged around $200 for the vaccine after the Bridge Access Program, which had helped cover those costs, sunset last year. A course of Paxlovid, an antiviral medication prescribed to treat COVID-19 in those at high risk of severe illness, now costs more than $1,400 out-of-pocket. The costs of vaccines and treatments fall hardest on those in low-income communities, who already face a higher risk of serious illness if infected. Instead of booking an appointment at Walgreens, she plans to wait to see if the Minnesota Department of Health will offer a free vaccine clinic near her. Finley is eager to find an updated vaccine after she contracted COVID-19 twice in 2020, before vaccines were available, which developed into long COVID. She is one of more than 20 million Americans who have been diagnosed with the illness, which can present with various symptoms, including chronic fatigue, brain fog, heart palpitations, and joint pain. Coalitions of states on the West Coast and across New England also plan to issue their own guidance. On September 4, 2025, during a Senate Finance Committee hearing, federal lawmakers on either side of the aisle also condemned Kennedy's efforts to limit vaccine access. Meanwhile, state lawmakers in several states, including Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, and Pennsylvania, have issued orders for health insurers to cover state-endorsed vaccines or for pharmacies to waive prescription requirements, or taken other measures to ameliorate barriers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's note: The story was updated with a statement by an SBU source. Primorsk in Leningrad Oblast serves as a key hub for Russia's "shadow fleet" of aging tankers used to avoid sanctions, the source said. Roughly 60 million tons of oil pass through the port every year, bringing Russia roughly $15 billion, the source added. This could allegedly cost Russia up to $41 million a day. SBU drones also successfully struck three oil pumping stations that are part of a pipeline system funneling crude to the Ust-Luga port terminal in Leningrad Oblast, the source claimed. The statement comes after Russian officials and media reported a large-scale drone attack targeting Leningrad Oblast, Moscow, and other areas overnight on Sept. 12. Around 30 drones were shot down over Leningrad Oblast, regional Governor Alexander Drozdenko said. Drone debris crashed at separate locations in Tosno, a town 53 kilometers (33 miles) southwest of St. Petersburg, but caused no casualties or damage, he claimed. He claimed the fire was extinguished and that there is no threat of flooding or oil spills. The drone threat in the region forced St. Petersburg's Pulkovo Airport to shut down — an increasingly common procedure amid intensifying Ukrainian drone strikes. Nearly 50 flights have been disrupted or canceled due to the closure. At least nine Ukrainian drones have been shot down near Moscow, Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said. The mayor did not provide details as to where the drones were shot down or provide information on any damage. Smolensk Oblast Governor Vasily Anokhin said air defense units were repelling a drone attack over the region, but gave no further information. In footage posted to social media, eyewitnesses claimed that the drones targeted a nearby Lukoil facility. Video shows smoke and flames rising from a large fire at an undisclosed site. Anokhin did not mention oil facilities or any possible targets in his report. Drones were also shot down over Belgorod, Rostov, Tver, Pskov, Tula, and Kursk oblasts, the ministry said. Ukraine has also deliberately shifted its drone strategy in recent months to disrupt Russian aviation operations and make the war visible to the Russian population. The attack on Russia comes just days after Russia launched a record drone and missile attack on Kyiv, killing a woman and her newborn child and injuring 20 others. Russia has increased drone attacks on Ukrainian cities in recent months, regularly launching over 500 attack drones in one night. Overnight on Sept. 10, Russian drones violated Polish airspace, forcing Poland's Air Force to down the drones for the first time since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began. Nineteen Russian drones were recorded crossing into Poland, in what Polish officials describe as a "deliberately targeted" attack. German media outlets Spiegel and Welt reported on Sept. 11 that the Russian drones shot down were reportedly headed for Rzeszow Airport, a key logistics hub for aid to Ukraine. "Every time you are here, General, we can sleep a little more. We would like you to travel to all Ukrainian cities," Zelensky said at the annual Yalta European Strategy meeting. The Russian attack on Poland exposed serious holes in NATO's air defenses. "(Russian President Vladimir) Putin's bombardment of Ukrainian civilians, his stalling and delaying in internationally-backed peace talks, and his blatant disregard for human life must end," U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said. The Kyiv Independent has been awarded the Online Journalism Award for Innovation in Revenue Strategy for building a sustainable business model during wartime. But you should not be close to Poland anyway," U.S. President Donald Trump  said. The Kyiv Independent's Dominic Culverwell explains how Ukraine's drone campaign targets the high-tech equipment Russia cannot easily replace under sanctions. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski's visit came days after the largest Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace during a mass strike on Ukraine, in what Polish officials describe as a "deliberately targeted" strike and provocation. When asked about the Ukraine-Russia talks, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov replied that communication channels have been established and exist, but as of now, "it's more accurate to say there is a pause" in dialogue. Primorsk in Leningrad Oblast serves as a key hub for Russia's "shadow fleet" of aging tankers used to avoid sanctions, the source said. Roughly 60 million tons of oil pass through the port every year, bringing Russia roughly $15 billion, the source added. The German Army needs an additional 100,000 troops to meet NATO targets and prepare for a possible Russian aggression, Reuters reported on Sept. 11, citing a confidential letter from a top army commander. When asked by reporters what his reaction was to the incursion, Trump responded: "It could have been a mistake.</p>

BRUSSELS, September 12. /TASS/. The European Union is finalizing its work on the 19th package of sanctions against Russia, with restrictions set to target Russian oil supplies and the banking sector, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas said.

"We just extended our sanctions on Russia. At the same time, we are finalizing work on the 19th package - looking into additional curbs on Russian oil sales, shadow oil tankers, and banks," she wrote on the social network X.

According to the EUObserver portal, the EU may present the new set of anti-Russian restrictions as early as September 12. Meanwhile, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot stated that the new sanctions would be announced on September 15.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As manhunt enters its third day, questions are being raised about bureau's ability to deal with a political assassination of this magnitude Charlie Kirk's assassination in Utah has irrevocably shaken America's political landscape. Yet as the manhunt for Kirk's killer enters its third day, serious questions about their ability to deal with a case of this magnitude have been raised. However, he was soon released because he was “not an accurate person of interest”, according to Utah law enforcement. Then at around 4.30pm local time on Wednesday – four hours after the attack – Kash Patel said that the gunman had been arrested, only to admit an hour and a half later that the suspect, Zachariah Qureshi, had been released after an interrogation. Eventually, on Thursday evening the first CCTV footage was released, showing the gunman haring across a rooftop to escape, making Mr Zinn's initial arrest an increasingly improbable line of inquiry. At a morning press conference on Thursday, investigators had said they were using AI to analyse grainy footage of a “person of interest”, said to be of “college age”, and would release the images publicly if their efforts proved fruitless. Hours later, two still images were made public showing a skinny white man dressed in a black cap, sweatshirt, jeans and sunglasses. They came with the offer of a $100,000 (£73,000) reward for anyone with information that would lead to the suspect's arrest. At Thursday's hastily organised evening press conference, officials doubled down on their plea, imploring the public to send in tips to help track down “this evil human being”. And despite flying in specially, in an apparent effort to show the FBI is getting a grip on the situation, Mr Patel did not say a word, standing sheepishly to the side as Spence Cox, Utah's governor, updated the world's media. Mr Patel's team have gone about purging the FBI since he was appointed chief by the US president, including firing Mehtab Syed, the special agent in charge of Utah's FBI division a month before Mr Kirk's assassination. Mr Patel has repeatedly alleged that the bureau had become politicised under Joe Biden's presidency, but has himself launched investigations into Mr Trump's rivals while enforcing the new administration's anti-immigration agenda. He is facing criticism for his inaccurate statement that a suspect had been caught in the wake of Wednesday's shooting, causing confusion in the early stages of the investigation. A White House source, speaking anonymously to Reuters, called Mr Patel's announcement unprofessional and said “his performance is really not acceptable to the White House or the American public” and will be addressed. Reports have also emerged that Mr Patel held an expletive-laden conference call with more than 200 FBI agents in which he described the manhunt as a “Mickey Mouse operation”, accused employees of not keeping him up-to-date, and said local FBI officials kept a photo of the suspect from him for 12 hours. Other students pleaded with officers to allow them through police cordons to retrieve their belongings, left behind as they escaped Wednesday's carnage. The Wall Street Journal reported that the gunman's bullet casings and rifle, discovered in a nearby “wooded area”, were engraved with “wording” in support of transgender and Antifa ideology. The Telegraph has not been able to independently verify these reports. Rumours swirled that the killer may have high-tailed it in a private jet from nearby Provo Airport, as authorities failed to close airspace in the surrounding area despite launching a large-scale manhunt. At the wooded area to the east of campus where the gunman discarded his older-model .30 calibre hunting rifle, FBI evidence response teams were still knocking door-to-door on Thursday afternoon, long after reporters had been and gone. With a promising lead materialising, an afternoon press conference was abruptly postponed owing to “rapid developments”, fuelling speculation of an imminent breakthrough. Late on Thursday, it was TMZ, rather than the FBI, who shared the first alleged footage of the subject: a doorbell video showing him dressed in black and limping – possibly a result of jumping down from his rooftop perch. Republicans and Democrats have traded recriminations online, as schadenfreude from those on the Left was met with heavy criticism from conservatives, condemning them as “radical Left terrorists” and, in the case of Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state, calling for deportation of foreigners celebrating Kirk's death. Left behind is a community of vulnerable students reeling from the tragedy. Hours after an evening vigil at Utah State Capitol on Wednesday, a small group of mourners gathered around a flagpole in contemplation, there to pay their final respects at a makeshift shrine to Kirk. “It was fight or flight,” said Chip Anderson, 19, a political science student at Utah Valley University who was standing 15 feet from Kirk when the gunshot rang out. Mr Anderson came to pay tribute to “Charlie the Great”, whom he credits with introducing him to the conservative movement, and whose death, he fears, will further silence conservative voices on college campuses. “I stand fearless for myself, but I feel a responsibility to protect others in any way I can, knowing people on my campus may not feel safe to return to school on Monday,” he said. Mariah Petersen, 18, was also at the rally and said that when Kirk was shot, “there were cheers from the balcony” from liberal protesters. “It was horrific to be a part of. There was just no human empathy,” she said. With his death, she worries people will “feel like they can't share their political opinions”. “I think that's a terrifying thing,” she added. “How are you meant to go back to normal after seeing someone die right in front of you?” Ms Dean said she was sitting in front of two “little kids”, a two-year-old and a one-year-old, when the shot rang out. I don't know what they saw,” she said.</p>

MOSCOW, September 12. /TASS/. The Zapad 2025 joint strategic maneuvers involving Belarusian and Russian troops kicked off on Friday, Russia's Defense Ministry said in a report.

"On September 12, the Zapad 2025 joint strategic exercise began between the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation. This exercise is the final stage of this year's joint training between the two countries' armies," the report reads.

According to Russia's top brass, the troops will practice actions "at firing ranges in the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation and in the Baltic Sea and the Barents Sea."

The military from the two countries will practice control over battlegroups in the event of a localized aggression against the Union State, the ministry specified.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All border crossings between Poland and Belarus were closed overnight on Sept. 12, ahead of the start of joint Russian-Belarusian military exercises, Polish news outlet Onet reported. Traffic across the border was suspended in both directions, including cars and cargo trains. The Zapad-2025 (meaning "west" in Russian) drills, which begin on Sept. 12 in Belarus and western Russia, have heightened concerns among NATO's eastern member states, such as Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia. Poland has previously closed most border crossings with Belarus, leaving only two in operation. He also referred to the recent Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace. Nineteen Russian drones were recorded crossing into Poland, in what Polish officials describe as a "deliberately targeted" strike and provocation. In response to Russia's drone incursion, Poland activated NATO's Article 4, which allows member states to request consultations when they believe their security is under threat. Western officials say the exercises, though presented as defensive, have long strained Minsk's relations with its neighbors and in 2021 masked preparations for Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The Zapad drills, staged every four years, have been watched warily in Europe for more than a decade. Kateryna Denisova works as a News Editor at the Kyiv Independent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Michael Mallinson had never met Charlie Kirk, nor had he ever heard the name of the American right-wing commentator who was shot dead in broad daylight at a Utah college event on Wednesday. But the retired Torontonian has done some research about him after his death. They would never have come across each other, but a piece of viral online misinformation has tied Mallinson to Kirk's story. Mallinson said he and his family are horrified to see his name and likeness falsely connected on a variety of social media platforms to a “heinous crime” he did not commit. I wasn't quite believing it,” the retiree said. He found out about his weird newfound fame after waking up from a post-shopping trip nap on Wednesday to a call from his daughter. She was begging him to delete his social media accounts. After the call, Mallinson said he Googled his name and came across posts that wrongly labelled him as a Utah Democrat who had shot and killed Kirk. What to know about the Trump ally shot dead in Utah It seems to have spread from a fake news account that misidentified him as a man whom police arrested and then released in the wake of the shooting. Why anyone would make that link is a mystery to Mallinson. The person who actually assassinated Kirk remained unidentified and a manhunt was still underway Thursday evening. Authorities announced they recovered a high-powered rifle that may have been used in the deadly attack, and released photos of an alleged gunman whom investigators believe blended into the campus crowd because he looked “college-age.” Prime Minister Mark Carney offered condolences to Kirk's family, and the Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre also strongly denounced his shooting. One person wrote to tell him he was a “savage.” His daughter began to receive ugly messages, too, like one that said something to the effect of, “may God make him live in pain for the rest of his life,” Mallinson recalled. He made lots of friends from around the world in his role engaging online as volunteer president. Friends from as far as Poland, India and the United Kingdom have sent him emails to check in on him after the fake news spread, he said, adding he has had to reach out to individual loved ones and explain he was not the shooter. A full 24 hours after his pictures were shared widely in connection to Kirk's death, Mallinson's face was still appearing next to posts bearing the misinformation. Instead, he has been trying to get the word out as widely as possible that the narrative that has taken over his life is “totally false.” In the end, he said, “I'm hoping it's going to blow over.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

Bessent also will meet with government counterparts in Madrid and London during the trip and will later join President Donald Trump for his official Sept. 17-19 state visit with Britain's King Charles, the Treasury said. Foreign TikTok influencers shaped Canadian news feeds during spring election, report says Trump administration has backup plan if Supreme Court rules tariffs are illegal, Bessent says The world's two largest economies have struggled to reach a more comprehensive trade agreement that could reduce Trump's still-hefty import tariffs on Chinese goods that stand at about 55%, including those imposed over fentanyl. Instead, they say China has been shifting purchases to Brazil and Argentina. Traders and analysts say U.S. soybean farmers are largely missing out on sales to China halfway through their prime marketing season, as South American exporters grab the lion's share. It's unclear whether the Madrid meeting could produce progress on agriculture or tariff reductions. Bessent had said earlier that TikTok was not discussed during the July meetings. Treasury has the authority to sanction Chinese banks that facilitate such transactions on Russia's behalf, a step it has not taken, but one which would block those institutions from dollar access.
