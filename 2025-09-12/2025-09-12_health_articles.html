                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BioDlink, a leading global CDMO, extends its congratulations to Junshi Biosciences (HKEX-1877; SSE-688180), on receiving Investigational New Drug (IND) approval from China's National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for JS212, a bispecific antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) designed to target both EGFR and HER3 receptors. JS212 represents a new class of bispecific ADCs that combine the humanized epidermal growth factor receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 bispecific antibody-drug conjugate to target both EGFR and HER3 — two proteins highly expressed in a variety of tumor cells, such as lung cancer, breast cancer, and head and neck cancer. As a bispecific ADC, JS212 has a key advantage over traditional ADCs that only target one protein: it can attack tumors via either EGFR or HER3, potentially increasing its effectiveness against a wider range of cancers and helping to overcome drug resistance. "As a leader in ADC technology, BioDlink remains committed to technology innovation and one-stop solution platform for complex biologics. Our collaboration with Junshi Biosciences is built on mutual trust and deep experience in ADC research, development and manufacturing. The IND approval of JS212 — a technically demanding bispecific ADC —­ highlights our strong capabilities and strategic value we bring to partners pursuing next-generation biologics. We're honored to support the advancement of this important program."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are an estimated 2.7 million Indigenous people living in the Amazon, predominantly in Indigenous territories (ITs), which constitute approximately 2.4 million of the roughly 7 million square kilometres the Amazon covers. A growing body of evidence has shown that ITs are linked to decreased deforestation and biodiversity loss, but we do not currently understand the relationship between ITs and human health. Julia Barreto and colleagues investigated how the number of cases of zoonotic and fire-related diseases between 2000 and 2019 was affected by the presence of ITs, using data from administrative regions in the nine countries the Amazon spans. In regions with more than 45% forest cover containing an IT, there was a reduction in the number of cases of both fire-related diseases (such as pneumonia) and zoonotic diseases (such as malaria). However, for regions with low forest cover or highly fragmented forests, the effect was lessened, or even reversed. The authors argue that their work shows that ITs may help protect human health in both the IT itself and the surrounding area, but only if high levels of forest cover are maintained. They link this potential protective effect to increased pollution absorption by trees, reduced human-animal contact, and increased biodiversity within ITs. The authors also note that the effect was more pronounced when ITs were legally protected, emphasising the importance both of maintaining Amazonian forests and of protecting Amazonian ITs' legal status.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New national data reveal that food insecurity worsens long COVID outcomes, but access to nutrition support programs like SNAP could break the cycle. Study: Long COVID and Food Insecurity in US Adults, 2022-2023. In a recent study published in the JAMA Network Open, researchers utilized a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey-based study of United States (US) adults to investigate the associations between food insecurity and the risk of reporting current Long COVID or recovering from it. Study findings revealed that in participants who had ever had Long COVID, food insecurity was associated with 73% higher odds of having current Long COVID (aOR 1.73) and 30% lower odds of recovery (aOR 0.70; sensitivity analysis aOR 0.76). Encouragingly, participation in food assistance programs like SNAP appeared to attenuate this association, suggesting that addressing food insecurity could be a powerful tool in reducing the burden of Long COVID. Commonly called "Long COVID", post-COVID-19 condition is a recently discovered but globally prevalent condition characterized by COVID-19 symptoms (fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, shortness of breath) that persist or develop three or more months following recovery from the original infection. While intensive medical research has focused on the biological mechanisms of the disease, less is known about how social and economic factors (such as poverty and food insecurity) influence the risk and progression of Long COVID. Food insecurity – the lack of reliable access to sufficient, affordable, and nutritious food – is a known risk factor for a host of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease, as it can lead to poor nutrition, chronic stress, and difficulty managing health conditions. While associations between food insecurity and Long COVID have never formally been investigated, Long COVID is itself a chronic condition, leading researchers to hypothesize that the same food-insecurity pressures driving diabetes and heart disease could make individuals more vulnerable to Long COVID's long-term effects. The present study aims to address this knowledge gap and inform future public health policy by analyzing data from a large, nationally representative dataset: the 2022–2023 US National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The study leveraged the validated 10-item National Center for Health Statistics food insecurity scale to categorize participants into two main cohorts: 1. The primary outcomes of interest were the qualitative measure of whether an individual had "current Long COVID" (symptoms lasting three months or more and still present) or had "recovered from Long COVID" (a history of Long COVID but no current symptoms). The study analysis included logistic regression models to calculate the odds of Long COVID as a function of food security status. Regression models were adjusted for confounding sociodemographic variables (age, sex, race/ethnicity, employment status) and preexisting medical conditions (particularly chronic diseases). The present study revealed that food insecurity and Long COVID are statistically linked, with participants in the food-insecure cohort demonstrating a 73% higher likelihood of current Long COVID (aOR 1.73; 95% CI 1.39–2.15) and a 30% lower chance of Long COVID recovery (aOR 0.70; 95% CI 0.54–0.92). These outcomes suggest that food insecurity simultaneously exacerbates both the risk of ongoing symptoms and reduces the likelihood of recovery. Encouragingly, the study found that social safety nets substantially improved outcomes for food-insecure participants by mitigating the risk of Long COVID and enhancing recovery. Specifically, while the association between food insecurity and Long COVID was substantial for individuals who were not receiving SNAP benefits (aOR 2.04) and for those who were employed (aOR 2.32), these links were attenuated and not statistically significant in participants receiving SNAP benefits (aOR 1.23) or in unemployed individuals (aOR 1.28). A notable dose–response pattern was observed: individuals with more COVID-19 vaccine doses had progressively lower odds of current Long COVID, supporting the model's validity. The association between food insecurity and Long COVID was present across income strata, and the authors noted that about 40% of food-insecure adults living below the federal poverty level were not enrolled in SNAP, underscoring enrollment barriers. The present study validates the previously hypothesized link between social (food) insecurity (a modifiable risk factor) and Long COVID outcomes (risks of persistence and recovery). Furthermore, as food insecurity worsens Long COVID, the latter's debilitating nature could impair a person's ability to work, exacerbating both conditions and triggering a sinister positive feedback loop. By mitigating the effects of food insecurity, these programs may serve as a crucial public health intervention against this chronic disease. However, because this was a cross-sectional survey based on self-reported data, causality cannot be inferred, and the likelihood of relapse over time cannot be determined.
