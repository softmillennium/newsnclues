            Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old in custody as the suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, registered to vote with no party affiliation and hadn't cast a ballot in the two most recent elections.
    


            But a family member told investigators that Robinson “had become more political in recent years,” Utah Governor Spencer Cox said at a press conference Friday morning – and in particular had lashed out at Kirk, the family member said.
    


            Authorities, who have described Kirk's killing as a “political assassination,” discovered anti-fascist messages engraved on ammunition with a rifle near the site of the shooting that hint at that political transformation, Cox said.
    


            Those messages included one that said, “Hey fascist! Catch!” and another that appeared to reference an Italian anti-fascist song.
    


            Robinson grew up in Washington, Utah, and earned a scholarship to attend Utah State University after a strong academic record in high school, but dropped out after just one semester, according to public records, social media and a university statement.
    


            Voter registration records  show that Robinson is registered to vote unaffiliated with any party, although he is also listed as an “inactive” voter, meaning he hadn't voted in at least the most recent two general elections.
    


            Social media photos show Robinson wearing grey Converse shoes     and sunglasses  that appear similar to those worn by the shooting suspect in photos released by law enforcement earlier this week.
    


            Cox said at the press conference that a family member of Robinson had reached out to a family friend Thursday night, and the family friend told the Washington County Sheriff's Office that “Robinson had confessed to them or implied that he had committed the incident.”
    


            Robinson was taken into custody around 10 p.m. Thursday night, after a 33-hour manhunt, FBI Director Kash Patel said Friday.
    


            Robinson's hometown is a quiet suburb of St. George, a city in the southwest corner of the state. It's about a three-and-a-half-hour drive from Utah Valley University, where Kirk was gunned down on Wednesday afternoon while holding a campus event.
    


            Cox said that a family member of Robinson had told investigators that at a recent family dinner, Robinson had mentioned Kirk's upcoming Utah Valley event, and “they talked about why they didn't like him and the viewpoints that he had,” Cox said. “The family member also stated Kirk was full of hate and spreading hate.”
    


            The bolt-action rifle Robinson used and left in a wooded area near the campus had various phrases engraved on the bullet casings, Cox said, including “Oh bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao ciao,” which appeared to reference an Italian anti-fascist song.
    


            Other engravings hinted more at connections to online trolling and memes, including one that said, “If you read this, you are gay LMAO.”
    


            Robinson graduated from Pine View High School in St. George in 2021, a spokesperson for the school confirmed. He received a resident presidential scholarship to attend Utah State University, according to a Facebook video his mother posted of him reading a letter about the award.
    


            A spokesperson for the university said in statement Friday that Robinson “briefly attended Utah State University for one semester in 2021.”
    


            Kirk's American Comeback Tour had an event scheduled  at Utah State University on September 30.

            Severed pigs' heads dumped outside mosques, red hands daubed on a Holocaust memorial, Stars of David sprayed in Paris neighborhoods: French authorities suspect foreign - and plausibly Russian - interference in a chain of acts looking to stoke internal tensions in France.
    


            The pigs' heads, discovered outside nine mosques in and around Paris during the night of September 8, according to Paris Police Chief Laurent Nunez on Wednesday, is the latest incident to stir these suspicions, with the Paris prosecutor's office investigating the alleged hate crime as being possibly sponsored by a foreign country.
    


            CCTV footage showed two men driving into Paris and then depositing the porcine remains, according to the Paris prosecutor's office.
    


            The men allegedly responsible were foreigners who had since left France, according to a statement on Thursday, with the acts having, “the clear intention to cause unrest within the nation.”
    


            A farmer in Normandy sold about 10 heads to two people traveling in a car bearing a Serbian number plate, prosecutors said, adding that authorities tracked a Croatian SIM card the men reportedly used to the Franco-Belgian border.
    


            The farmer, speaking to CNN affiliate France 2, said they were “two foreigners who didn't speak French, spoke bad English.”
    


            While he is used to selling pigs' heads to chefs, the farmer said it was unusual to sell 10 at a time, additionally the men put the heads directly into the trunk of their car, raising his suspicions.
    


            “Keeping them cold, you can forget it,” he said of the heads in the trunk, and later alerted the authorities, he told France 2.
    


            A French defense intelligence source told CNN that these acts were a “maneuver by the pro-Russian sphere,” but because of a lack of support from pro-Russian media and online outlets, the interference did not “work as well as anticipated.”
    


            The incidents come at a time of stark confrontation between Russia and France, with French President Emmanuel Macron a vocal supporter of robust security guarantees for Ukraine as part of any potential peace deal. While Russia denies meddling in the affairs of other states, Russian state-controlled media like to cast European countries like France as tottering on the brink of anarchy over hot-button issues such as immigration and culture clash.
    


            Paris Police Chief Nunez, speaking in an interview with CNews on Thursday, said the intention behind the pigs' heads was “to divide, to actually fan the flames of division.”
    


            This incident has striking similarities with past hate acts in France.
    


            Foreign perpetrators have been linked to previous acts intended to incite hatred. Three Bulgarians were suspected of painting red hands on Paris' Holocaust Memorial in May 2024, with the Paris prosecutor suggesting Russia was behind the crime.
    


            A Moldovan man believed to have masterminded the painting of some 60 blue Stars of David on walls in and around Paris was detained in France, with authorities investigating possible links with Russia, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV.
    


            France has been the target of an “unprecedented disinformation campaign, orchestrated by pro-Russian circles” since January 2025, according to the French Defense Ministry, including the use of fake news sites and social media bots.  A 2025 European Union report found that over one in three incidents from “hostile actors” in 2024 targeted France, with 152 cases originating in Russia and China.
    


            Authorities in the Paris region have investigated nine cases of crimes suspected of being sponsored by foreign powers since 2023, Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said.
    


            She told BFMTV the alleged perpetrators often spend little time in France, sometimes sending proof of their acts to their handlers.
    


            While earlier incidents against Jewish sites, coming amid the backlash over the soaring death toll in Israel's conflict in Gaza, sparked a media frenzy around this particularly act of brazen antisemitism, the pigs' heads did not have the same effect.
    


            “It is also notable that French society has shown great resilience, with, from the outset, doubts about the origin,” the French defense intelligence source told CNN.
    


            France has seen a spike in antisemitism since Israel's war in Gaza, with 1,570 such acts recorded in 2024, according to the French government and 646 in the first six months of 2025, per CNN affiliate BFMTV.
    


            There was also a 72% increase in Islamophobic acts in France in the first three months of 2025 compared to the previous year, according to French government figures.

US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has held his first phone call with China's minister of national defense, Admiral Dong Jun, telling him that Washington does not seek conflict, the Pentagon announced on Wednesday.

The conversation comes amid strained ties as Washington has described Beijing as its main geopolitical rival. In May, Hegseth claimed that “the threat China poses is real, and it could be imminent,” and urged countries in the Asia-Pacific to boost military spending.

In Tuesday's call, Hegseth stressed the US is not pursuing confrontation, regime change, or “strangulation” of China. At the same time, he emphasized that Washington has “vital interests in the Asia-Pacific, the priority theater, and will resolutely protect those interests,” according to a readout of the conversation. The Pentagon described the exchange as “candid.”

China's Xinhua news agency reported that the call was held at Hegseth's request and that Dong urged continued communication and an open attitude to foster stable and positive military ties based on “equal respect, peaceful coexistence, and mutual respect.” Xinhua also cited Dong as saying China seeks peace and stability in the South China Sea and opposes “infringement and provocation” by non-regional countries.

Last month, Washington and Beijing extended a 90-day tariff truce, keeping planned increases on hold until November 10.

At the same time, several media outlets reported earlier this week that the US has allegedly been urging the EU to impose steep tariffs on imports from China and India, potentially up to 100%, over the Ukraine conflict and their ties with Russia. Washington is reportedly prepared to mirror the measures if adopted.

China and India have pushed back on tariff pressure. Chinese officials said they will ensure the country's energy supply “in line with national interests” and warned that “tariff wars have no winners,” while India called the new US tariffs “unfair, unjustified, and unreasonable.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin has also cautioned the West against using a “colonial tone” toward Beijing and New Delhi, suggesting that such actions are aimed at slowing their economic rise.

The suspected assassin of US conservative activist Charlie Kirk is now in custody, President Donald Trump has claimed.

""I think with a high degree of certainty, we have him in custody,"" he told Fox News on Friday.

Trump said he had been informed of the suspect's arrest just minutes before going on air. “Essentially, somebody that was very close to him turned him in,” the president said, without revealing any further details.

NBC News has also reported that a suspect in the high-profile murder case has been taken into custody, citing senior law enforcement officials. The person was reportedly turned in to the police by a family member, who saw his photos released by the authorities.

US law enforcement has not officially confirmed the arrest or revealed the suspect's identity. The FBI released images of the alleged suspect on Thursday: A man wearing sunglasses, a black hat, and a long-sleeve black shirt featuring an American flag. The agency also offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the identification and arrest of the assassin.

The authorities received over 7,000 tips and leads and held some 200 interviews linked to the case, according to Utah Governor Spencer Cox. Investigators also recovered a “high-powered, bolt-action rifle” along the route allegedly used by the suspect to escape the crime scene, according to Robert Bohls, special agent in charge at the FBI's Salt Lake City field office.

The New York Post reported, citing law enforcement sources, that the suspect is a Utah resident named Tyler Robinson, 22.

Kirk, 31, was struck by a single rifle round as he was addressing thousands of students during a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University. He was rushed to Timpanogos Regional Hospital but later died. Officials described the killing as a targeted political assassination.

Trump has vowed to pursue not only Kirk's killer but also what he called the “radical left” networks that fuel political violence. Speaking to Fox News on Friday, the president said he hopes Kirk's murderer would be subject to capital punishment. Cox announced on Thursday that Utah would seek the death penalty for the conservative activist's assassin.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is facing two new motions of no confidence following her State of the Union address to the European Parliament this week.

The Left faction filed its censure proposal on Thursday, a day after the right-wing Patriots for Europe group submitted a separate bid. Von der Leyen survived a previous no-confidence vote in July.

Renewed efforts to remove the EU chief came after she urged stronger military support for Ukraine and proposed allowing foreign policy decisions without unanimous member-state approval – which dissenting member states, such as Hungary, view as a ploy to dismiss their objections.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who backs the no-confidence motion, views von der Leyen's remarks as “hardcore pro-war,” according to governmental spokesman Zoltan Kovacs. In her address, “the word ‘Ukraine' was mentioned 35 times, and threats were made to cut EU funds from anyone refusing to follow Brussels' line,” he said on social media.

The Patriots' motion argued the president “has failed on trade, abandoned transparency, and rejected accountability,” while the Left – joined by some Greens/EFA MEPs – accused her of having “sold out workers and farmers, funneled billions into arms and war, shredded climate and social protection” and being “complicit in genocide” in Gaza.

“There is a tendency within the European Commission to push things through by force” at the EU's expense, Left co-leader Manon Aubry told Euronews. She cited a recent deal with the United States that she said “will literally reduce the EU to a Donald Trump vassal.”

During the previous attempt to unseat her, von der Leyen dismissed her critics as “conspiracy theorists” and claimed they acted on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying there was “ample proof that many are supported by our enemies and by their puppet masters in Russia or elsewhere.”

The current commission is trying to launch a multibillion-euro military expansion program across member states, arguing the EU should fund it through loans to counter the threat from Russia – an assessment Moscow calls baseless.

TEL AVIV, September 12. /TASS/. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has approved plans to build thousands of housing units for settlers in the E-1 zone of the West Bank while declaring that Israel considers this land its own and will not allow the creation of a separate Palestinian state.

The statement was made during a ceremony in the city of Maale Adumim, located in the West Bank, a few kilometers from Jerusalem and disseminated by the prime minister's office.

""The city of Maale Adumim will double in size. Within five years, 70,000 people will live here. These are monumental changes,"" he stated.

Netanyahu recalled that he had previously promised to approve new construction in this area and that this promise is now being fulfilled. ""There is another promise we will keep. We said: there will be no Palestinian state, and indeed, there will not be! This land belongs to us. We will safeguard our heritage, our land and our security,"" the Israeli prime minister asserted.

According to the human rights organization Shalom Akhshav (The World is Now), Israel has approved plans for the construction of 3,400 housing units for settlers in the E-1 area near the city of Maale Adumim to the east of Jerusalem. Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, the leader of the far-right Religious Zionism party, said on August 8 that Israel now aims to ""erase the Palestinian state."" The politician, who concurrently oversees settlement activities in the West Bank of the Jordan River in the Israeli Defense Ministry, promised to restore several Jewish settlements withdrawn from there. On August 14, he said the project to expand the Maale Adumim settlement complex and build new housing in the E-1 zone will be resumed.

In 2016, the UN Security Council passed a resolution demanding an end to Israeli settlement activities, but Israel refused to comply.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Brian Gavidia, plaintiff in lawsuit alleging ‘blatant racial profiling', says encounter with agent has left lasting scars

Brian Gavidia can't sleep. It's been three months since federal immigration agents accosted him, twisting his arm and pushing him into a metal fence outside a Los Angeles tow yard as he tried to tell them he is a US citizen.

Now, he frequently finds himself awake late into the night, wondering: are they coming for me?

Gavidia, 29, is a plaintiff in a major lawsuit filed by the ACLU and immigrant advocacy groups, accusing Donald Trump's administration of “blatant racial profiling” in operations in Los Angeles as part of the president's mass deportation campaign. Gavidia felt some relief in July when a judge found that federal agents were stopping people based on their race, language or job, and ordered the government to halt its indiscriminate raids.

But this week the US supreme court's conservative majority lifted those restrictions, allowing federal agents to stop people if they appear Latino or speak Spanish, in a decision that immigration advocates warn has “effectively legalized racial profiling”.

The news was a blow to Gavidia.

“They didn't hear our pleas. They disregarded humanity. They disregarded the people,” he said. “We fought for these rights many years ago, and apparently we're going back in time.

“It is not OK. Racial profiling is not OK.”

He is one of countless LA residents who have been swept up in Trump's immigration crackdown, as the Trump administration has made California a center of its deportation campaign. Federal agents have descended near schools and workplaces and Home Depot stores, leaving southern California communities in fear.

Gavidia, who owns a small car dealership, was at a tow yard he rents to work on vehicles on 12 June when a friend came to him and said there were immigration agents outside. At first he thought it might be a joke – as children, Gavidia and his friends would play a game where someone would shout La Migra and they would all run.

As he went to go see, an agent appeared and told him to stop.

“I'm a law-abiding citizen. An officer, an agent, tells me to stop, I'm going to stop,” he said.

Another agent approached, grabbing him by the arm, and demanding Gavidia tell him which hospital he was born in. In video of the incident, Gavidia can be heard insisting: “I'm American, bro.” When he couldn't recall the hospital he was born in, an agent threw Gavidia against a wall, lifting his arm and twisting it, he said.

They kept him for about 20 minutes until viewing his ID, and eventually left. They later returned in greater numbers. During the incident, the agents, masked and carrying military-style rifles, laughed at Gavidia and others on scene.

“I was helpless. What can you do to a federal agent, even if at that moment they're breaking the law?” he said. “At that moment, I was the worst of the worst. So what can I say? What can I do to him? I told him I was American. He didn't care.”

Gavidia describes himself as a proud American. He has a tattoo that reads “We the people” on his back. But what happened that day in June shook him.

As a small business owner, he had hoped Trump would improve the economy. Instead, Gavidia said, the administration is destroying communities and going after day laborers, farm workers and even US citizens like him, rather than pursuing criminals.

His mother was scared and didn't want him to join the lawsuit. “She was like, no, no, mijo, like, we can't win against the government,” he recalled. “I told her, Mom, how do I let them attack our people?”

The temporary restraining order issued in response to the lawsuit brought hope to the area, Gavidia, and people were feeling more comfortable going to work and resuming their day to day lives. The supreme court action has left people scared again.

In a concurring opinion, Brett Kavanaugh wrote that immigration officers may briefly stop people to investigate their immigration status. “If the person is a US citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, that individual will be free to go after the brief encounter.”

Gavidia's “brief encounter” left lasting consequences. “I responded to him every question he had to the best of my abilities, in a nice manner,” he said. “He still threw me to the wall. He still twisted my arm and in a violent manner.”

His business remains closed because he fears agents might return, and worries he is being watched. But as the case continues to wind its way through the courts, Gavidia plans to continue the fight, he said.

“I'm doing this with my legs shaking and my voice cracking because I'm scared, but I will not stay quiet.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

As Hyundai-LG workers fly home after visa ordeal, Koreans bristle at ‘humiliation' and sense of betrayal by Seoul's ally

More than 300 South Korean workers arrived at Incheon international airport on Friday afternoon, ending a week-long ordeal that began with the US Department of Homeland Security's largest ever single-site raid by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, and has left South Korea questioning whether it can trust its closest ally.

The 316 Koreans, along with 14 workers of other nationalities, landed shortly after 3pm local time on a chartered Korean Air flight after being detained since 4 September at a Hyundai-LG battery plant construction site in Georgia.

There was widespread anger across the political spectrum in South Korea at the behaviour of the US authorities, with one newspaper referring to the workers being treated like “prisoners of war” and another describing Koreans as feeling stabbed in the back by their closest ally.

The workers had requested privacy, and the assembled media kept their distance as the returnees emerged in small groups to board waiting buses. Most wore face masks and carried only small bags; many looking worn out but bearing the weary relief of people whose ordeal had finally ended.

Addressing reporters, the presidential chief of staff, Kang Hoon-sik, said he had come to offer words of encouragement. “We did our best, but I'm sorry we couldn't bring them back to their homeland sooner,” he said.

“We're in an age of new normal in dealing with the United States,” Kang said. “The standard changes every time and constantly there has to be deal-making, not only on tariffs, but it'll also be the case with security issues.”

The workers had been building a $4.3bn (£3.2bn) battery plant, which is crucial to Hyundai's electric vehicle ambitions in the US. Most were employed by LG Energy Solution or its subcontractors.

The detention stemmed from workers using B1 business visas and the 90-day visa waiver programme (Esta) for what US authorities deemed actual employment rather than permitted activities such as meetings or training.

Korean companies have long relied on this “grey zone” because the official H-1B work visas take months to obtain and South Korea lacks the dedicated quota allocations that other US trade partners enjoy. Previous US administrations had largely turned a blind eye to the practice.

The South Korean president, Lee Jae Myung, delivered his sharpest warning yet to Washington on Thursday, stating that Korean businesses would “hesitate to make direct investments” if the US failed to resolve visa issues quickly.

“Korean businesses that have entered the United States are likely in a state of serious bewilderment,” he said. “This isn't long-term permanent employment, but to establish facilities and equipment for factories; we need technicians to install machinery and equipment. The US doesn't have such personnel, and they won't give visas for [our workers] to stay and work.”

The workers' departure from Georgia was delayed by a day after President Donald Trump offered to let them stay and train Americans, but only one person chose to remain.

South Korea's foreign minister, Cho Hyun, flew to the US to meet his counterpart, Marco Rubio, securing assurances that workers would not be restrained while being transported.

The concession addressed a particularly sensitive grievance after ICE's release of video footage showing Korean workers being led away in chains, evoking historical experiences of subjugation by foreign powers.

The episode has generated unprecedented public anger. A survey by the local broadcaster MBC found 68% of respondents believed the US government “did not show consideration for South Korea as an ally” in handling the situation.

Korean media responses were scathing across the political spectrum. Seoul Economic Daily described workers being treated like “prisoners of war”; the conservative Chosun Ilbo called it a “merciless arrest operation” representing a “breach of trust”; while the progressive Hankyoreh asked: “Is this what you do to an ally?” and described Koreans feeling “backstabbed” after Lee's recent meeting with Trump.

At the airport, a 75-year-old protester, Hong Jung-sik, reflected a nation's anger when he said the detention of fellow citizens had left him feeling betrayed. “Trump, who do you think you are?” he shouted, describing the episode as a “national humiliation” and “evil behaviour”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Editor's note: The story was updated with a statement by an SBU source.

Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) drones struck Primorsk, Russia's largest oil-loading port on the Baltic Sea, overnight on Sept. 12, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent.

Primorsk in Leningrad Oblast serves as a key hub for Russia's ""shadow fleet"" of aging tankers used to avoid sanctions, the source said. Roughly 60 million tons of oil pass through the port every year, bringing Russia roughly $15 billion, the source added.

After the Ukrainian drone strike, fires broke out at one of the vessels and a pumping station, forcing the suspension of oil shipments, according to the source. This could allegedly cost Russia up to $41 million a day.

SBU drones also successfully struck three oil pumping stations that are part of a pipeline system funneling crude to the Ust-Luga port terminal in Leningrad Oblast, the source claimed.

Primorsk lies roughly 100 kilometers (60 miles) from St. Petersburg and over 900 kilometers (550 miles) north of the Ukrainian border.

The statement comes after Russian officials and media reported a large-scale drone attack targeting Leningrad Oblast, Moscow, and other areas overnight on Sept. 12.

Russian air defenses intercepted 221 Ukrainian drones across the country, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed the morning after the strike. 

Residents of Leningrad Oblast reportedly said the attack was one of the most massive strikes on the region since the start of the full-scale war in 2022.

Around 30 drones were shot down over Leningrad Oblast, regional Governor Alexander Drozdenko said. 

Drone debris crashed at separate locations in Tosno, a town 53 kilometers (33 miles) southwest of St. Petersburg, but caused no casualties or damage, he claimed. Fragments and wreckage also landed in other villages in the region, including Vsevolozhsk, Pokrovskoye, and Uzmino.

Earlier in the night, Drozdenko said that air defenses were at work over the Pushkinsky district of St. Petersburg. 

The attack caused a fire on a vessel in the Primorsk Port, Drozdenko reported. He claimed the fire was extinguished and that there is no threat of flooding or oil spills. 

Drozdenko later reported that the attack caused a fire to break out at a pumping station in Primorsk. He said it was extinguished without casualties. 

The drone threat in the region forced St. Petersburg's Pulkovo Airport to shut down — an increasingly common procedure amid intensifying Ukrainian drone strikes. Nearly 50 flights have been disrupted or canceled due to the closure.  

Drones also targeted the Russian capital. At least nine Ukrainian drones have been shot down near Moscow, Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said.

Sobyanin said on Telegram that emergency crews were headed to the site where the drone debris fell. The mayor did not provide details as to where the drones were shot down or provide information on any damage.

Russian Telegram channels, citing resident accounts, reported explosions in the communities of Mozhaysk and Dedovsk in Moscow Oblast, located just west of the outskirts of the capital.

Another wave of drones attacked the Russian city of Smolensk, according to officials and local residents. Smolensk Oblast Governor Vasily Anokhin said air defense units were repelling a drone attack over the region, but gave no further information. 

Smolensk residents reported explosions in the city. In footage posted to social media, eyewitnesses claimed that the drones targeted a nearby Lukoil facility. Video shows smoke and flames rising from a large fire at an undisclosed site. 

Anokhin did not mention oil facilities or any possible targets in his report. 

The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that 85 drones were downed over Bryansk Oblast, 42 over Smolensk Oblast, 28 over Leningrad Oblast, 18 over Kaluga Oblast, 14 over Novgorod Oblast, and nine over the Moscow and Oryol oblasts. 

Drones were also shot down over Belgorod, Rostov, Tver, Pskov, Tula, and Kursk oblasts, the ministry said. 

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

Ukraine has previously launched drones towards Moscow with limited success in engaging military targets in the region. Ukraine has also deliberately shifted its drone strategy in recent months to disrupt Russian aviation operations and make the war visible to the Russian population.

The attack on Russia comes just days after Russia launched a record drone and missile attack on Kyiv, killing a woman and her newborn child and injuring 20 others. The attack also damaged Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers building in central Kyiv for the first time in the full-scale war. 

Russia has increased drone attacks on Ukrainian cities in recent months, regularly launching over 500 attack drones in one night.

Overnight on Sept. 10, Russian drones violated Polish airspace, forcing Poland's Air Force to down the drones for the first time since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began. Nineteen Russian drones were recorded crossing into Poland, in what Polish officials describe as a ""deliberately targeted"" attack.

German media outlets Spiegel and Welt reported on Sept. 11 that the Russian drones shot down were reportedly headed for Rzeszow Airport, a key logistics hub for aid to Ukraine.

All border crossings between Poland and Belarus were closed overnight on Sept. 12, ahead of the start of joint Russian-Belarusian military exercises, Polish news outlet Onet reported. 

Traffic across the border was suspended in both directions, including cars and cargo trains.

The Zapad-2025 (meaning ""west"" in Russian) drills, which begin on Sept. 12 in Belarus and western Russia, have heightened concerns among NATO's eastern member states, such as Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia.

Warsaw said it is deploying 40,000 troops along its borders with Belarus and the Russian Kaliningrad exclave as the drills take off.

Poland has previously closed most border crossings with Belarus, leaving only two in operation.

Speaking at a midnight briefing near the Belarusian border, Polish Interior Minister Marcin Kierwinski said that the drills were directly aimed at Poland and the European Union. He also referred to the recent Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace.

Russia breached Polish airspace on an unprecedented scale overnight on Sept. 10, prompting Poland's Air Force to down Russian drones for the first time since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Nineteen Russian drones were recorded crossing into Poland, in what Polish officials describe as a ""deliberately targeted"" strike and provocation.

In response to Russia's drone incursion, Poland activated NATO's Article 4, which allows member states to request consultations when they believe their security is under threat.

According to Kierwinski, the decision to close the borders ""should be assessed in terms of ensuring security.""

The border closure was announced on Sept. 9, a few days before the Russian drone incursion.

Western officials say the exercises, though presented as defensive, have long strained Minsk's relations with its neighbors and in 2021 masked preparations for Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

The Zapad drills, staged every four years, have been watched warily in Europe for more than a decade.

Editor's note: The story was updated to include additional details.

Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, and other European officials, as well as Prince Harry, arrived in Kyiv on Sept. 12.

Sikorski's visit came days after the largest Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace during a mass strike on Ukraine, in what Polish officials describe as a ""deliberately targeted"" strike and provocation.

""We will hold substantial talks today about our shared security, Ukraine's EU and NATO accession, and pressure on Moscow,"" Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said. 

Later in the day, Sikorski met with President Volodymyr Zelensky, discussing cooperation in drone technology and between countries' defense industries, and the use of EU funds under the Security Action for Europe (SAFE) program.

""We discussed the attack of Russian drones on Poland. Ukraine is ready to share its experience, assist with the training of Polish military personnel, and jointly build a defense system,"" Zelensky said after the meeting. 

Zelensky added that the leaders also discussed additional pressure on Russia, joint defense production, and Ukraine's EU membership.

""It is very important to open the first negotiating cluster for Ukraine and Moldova with the support of all 27 votes,"" Zelensky said. 

French, German, and Italian officials are also visiting Kyiv, Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak announced.

""These countries stand at the forefront of the 'coalition of the willing,' which is shaping a new security system for the European continent,"" Yermak said on X.

According to the Guardian, Prince Harry made an unannounced visit to Ukraine at the invitation of the Ukrainian government, saying that he wants to do ""everything possible"" to support the recovery of thousands of Ukrainian service members injured in the war.

Prince Harry and his Invictus Games Foundation team are planning to present new initiatives to support the rehabilitation of the wounded. They aim to provide aid across all regions of Ukraine, the newspaper reported. 

During his visit, Prince Harry met with Ukrainian veterans at the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in World War II, Reuters reported. 

He is also scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko.

Michael Mallinson had never met Charlie Kirk, nor had he ever heard the name of the American right-wing commentator who was shot dead in broad daylight at a Utah college event on Wednesday. 

But the retired Torontonian has done some research about him after his death. 

“I gather that he appeals to young conservatives. I'm an old socialist. I guess that's the best way I could put it,” Mallinson said in a phone interview.

FBI releases images of person of interest in Charlie Kirk fatal shooting

They would never have come across each other, but a piece of viral online misinformation has tied Mallinson to Kirk's story. Now the former banker, 77, is fighting to make the truth understood: he is decidedly not the person who put a bullet in the controversial commentator's neck. 

Mallinson said he and his family are horrified to see his name and likeness falsely connected on a variety of social media platforms to a “heinous crime” he did not commit. 

“I just felt shocked and in horror. I was bemused. I wasn't quite believing it,” the retiree said. “I was bewildered why this would have happened.”

U.S. investigators said on Thursday they had found the bolt-action rifle they believed was used to kill the influential conservative activist Charlie Kirk and released images of a person of interest as they searched for the shooter they described as college age.

Reuters

He found out about his weird newfound fame after waking up from a post-shopping trip nap on Wednesday to a call from his daughter. She was begging him to delete his social media accounts. 

“She was a bit panicked and she was, you know, kind of shouting at me that I had to do it now, now, and I didn't quite understand what was happening,” he said. 

After the call, Mallinson said he Googled his name and came across posts that wrongly labelled him as a Utah Democrat who had shot and killed Kirk. 

Who was Charlie Kirk? What to know about the Trump ally shot dead in Utah

It seems to have spread from a fake news account that misidentified him as a man whom police arrested and then released in the wake of the shooting. Why anyone would make that link is a mystery to Mallinson. 

“We're both old, we're both bald, we're both spectacled, but otherwise I don't think we look alike at all,” he said. 

The person who actually assassinated Kirk remained unidentified and a manhunt was still underway Thursday evening. Authorities announced they recovered a high-powered rifle that may have been used in the deadly attack, and released photos of an alleged gunman whom investigators believe blended into the campus crowd because he looked “college-age.” 

The slaying of the 31-year-old influencer, who was a close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump's, drew widespread condemnation in Canada. Prime Minister Mark Carney offered condolences to Kirk's family, and the Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre also strongly denounced his shooting.

Analysis: Charlie Kirk's name joins the litany of those associated with an American history of violence

As his name and face went viral, Mallinson said that he and his family started getting hate online. One person wrote to tell him he was a “savage.” 

His daughter began to receive ugly messages, too, like one that said something to the effect of, “may God make him live in pain for the rest of his life,” Mallinson recalled. 

“I'm not happy about it and my family is, especially my wife, is quite distressed about it all,” he said. 

Mallinson lost access to important connections in the scramble to delete his social media accounts, he said. In retirement, he helped found the Canadian Spondyloarthritis Association, an organization that supports people with the chronic arthritic disease. He made lots of friends from around the world in his role engaging online as volunteer president.

Friends from as far as Poland, India and the United Kingdom have sent him emails to check in on him after the fake news spread, he said, adding he has had to reach out to individual loved ones and explain he was not the shooter.

“It's a pain having to do it. It would be much easier to do it on social media, but I deleted my accounts.”

A full 24 hours after his pictures were shared widely in connection to Kirk's death, Mallinson's face was still appearing next to posts bearing the misinformation. He said he has not contacted any social media companies to take down the posts.

Instead, he has been trying to get the word out as widely as possible that the narrative that has taken over his life is “totally false.” 

In the end, he said, “I'm hoping it's going to blow over.”

The upcoming meeting between U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng will be the fourth this year as they seek to maintain a trade truce.KEYSTONE/EDA/Martial Trezzini/Reuters

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent plans to meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and other senior officials next week in Madrid to continue their discussions on trade, economic and national security issues, the Treasury said on Thursday.

The meetings, which will also cover the status of the Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok and joint efforts to combat money laundering, are part of a Sept. 12-18 trip that Bessent is making to Spain and Britain, the Treasury said in a statement to Reuters.

Bessent also will meet with government counterparts in Madrid and London during the trip and will later join President Donald Trump for his official Sept. 17-19 state visit with Britain's King Charles, the Treasury said.

The Bessent-He discussion in Spain will be the fourth major in-person meeting between the two top economic officials this year as they seek to maintain a trade truce that reduced retaliatory tariffs on both sides and restored the flow of Chinese rare earth minerals to the U.S.

Foreign TikTok influencers shaped Canadian news feeds during spring election, report says

Trump administration has backup plan if Supreme Court rules tariffs are illegal, Bessent says

After meetings in Geneva and London, the two sides largely agreed in late July in Stockholm to extend their tariff pause for another 90 days. Trump approved the extension on Aug. 12 until November 10.

The world's two largest economies have struggled to reach a more comprehensive trade agreement that could reduce Trump's still-hefty import tariffs on Chinese goods that stand at about 55%, including those imposed over fentanyl.

The two sides have sparred over agriculture issues, with Beijing decrying “rampant” U.S. protectionism as threatening American farmers, and Trump administration officials criticizing China for failing to live up to a 2020 agreement with Trump to vastly increase purchases of American farm goods. Instead, they say China has been shifting purchases to Brazil and Argentina.

Traders and analysts say U.S. soybean farmers are largely missing out on sales to China halfway through their prime marketing season, as South American exporters grab the lion's share.

It's unclear whether the Madrid meeting could produce progress on agriculture or tariff reductions.

The Treasury also said ByteDance's short video app TikTok, which faces a potential ban in the U.S. unless it moves to U.S. ownership, will be on the agenda. Bessent had said earlier that TikTok was not discussed during the July meetings.

Trump, who launched a TikTok account last month, has extended a deadline for TikTok to divest its U.S. assets until September 17.

The Treasury said money laundering threatens both the U.S. and Chinese economies and co-operation to combat it will be on the agenda for the Madrid meeting as well.

The U.S. has been seeking to pressure China to better combat illicit finance, partly to slow the flow of military and dual-use technologies to Russia for its war in Ukraine. Treasury has the authority to sanction Chinese banks that facilitate such transactions on Russia's behalf, a step it has not taken, but one which would block those institutions from dollar access.

The German government has reacted angrily after a Belgian festival canceled a performance by the Munich Philharmonic. Festival organizers cited concerns over its Israeli conductor's political attitude.

German Culture Minister Wolfram Weimer has spoken of a ""disgrace for Europe"" after a Belgian festival canceled a performance by a top German orchestra to be given with an Israeli conductor.

Organizers of the Flanders Festival Ghent late on Wednesday announced that the Munich Philharmonic would no longer perform on September 18 as planned, saying they were concerned about conductor Lahav Shani's attitude to the Israeli government.

In a statement, the organizers said they were ""unable to provide sufficient clarity about his [Shani's] attitude"" towards the Israeli government, which they referred to as a ""genocidal regime."" Several human rights NGOs and the International Association of Genocide Scholars have declared Israel's war in Gaza a genocide, an accusation which Israel and Germany reject.

""We have chosen to refrain from collaboration with partners who have not distanced themselves unequivocally from that regime,"" the organizers said, though they noted that Shani had ""spoken out in favor of peace and reconciliation several times in the past.""

Shani, who is to officially take over as conductor of the orchestra for the 2026/27 season, currently serves as music director of the famous Israel Philharmonic Orchestra

Culture Minister Weimer accused the festival of carrying out ""a cultural boycott"" disguised as criticism of Israel.

""This is pure antisemitism and an attack on the fundamentals of our culture,"" he said, calling the affair ""a dangerous precedent.""

Weimer said a red line would have been crossed if it became acceptable to collectively disinvite German orchestras and Jewish artists.

""European cultural venues must not become places where antisemites dictate the programs. Germany will not accept this,"" he added.

Weimer also praised the Munich Philharmonic as a ""flagship of German culture and world-class quality.""

""People who refuse it and its future chief conductor a venue do not harm Israel, but Europe and their own credibility,"" he said.

""Germany stands unequivocally at the side of the Munich Philharmonic and Lahav Shani. Our message is clear: We will not let either our orchestra or our Jewish artists be marginalized.""

The orchestra and the city of Munich also criticized the festival's move, calling it a collective punishment of Israeli artists and saying that excluding people from cultural venues because of their origin or religion was ""an attack on fundamental European and democratic values.""

In March 2022, the orchestra itself dropped Russian maestro Valery Gergiev as its chief conductor after he failed to denounce Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Peter Mandelson has been removed from his post over his close relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer fired UK Ambassador to the US Peter Mandelson on Thursday over Mandelson's ties with disgraced New York financier Jeffrey Epstein.  

Pressure had been mounting on Starmer to remove Mandelson, 71, following the publication of a series of emails between the ambassador and the convicted sex offender, who is now deceased. 

James Roscoe, the UK deputy head of mission in Washington, will serve as interim ambassador.

Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty said in response to a question in parliament that ""[i]n light of the additional information in the emails written by Peter Mandelson, the prime minister has asked the foreign secretary to withdraw him as ambassador to the United States.""

""The emails show ... that the depth and extent of Lord Mandelson's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein is materially different from that known at the time of his appointment.""

A Foreign Office statement said that ""[i]n particular Peter Mandelson's suggestion that Jeffrey Epstein's first conviction was wrongful and should be challenged is new information. In light of that, and mindful of the victims of Epstein's crimes, he has been withdrawn as ambassador with immediate effect.""

Mandelson is a Labour politician who played leading roles in the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.

He was widely dubbed the ""Prince of Darkness"" while he was Labour's director of communications from 1985 and 1990 because of his alleged ruthlessness in dealing with the press and was twice forced to resign from Blair's Labour government in the late 1990s and early 2000s over allegations of misconduct.

On Wednesday, The Sun newspaper published emails that it said showed Mandelson telling Epstein to ""fight for early release"" shortly before Epstein was sentenced to 18 months in prison.

Mandelson also told Epstein ""I think the world of you "" before the financier began a sentence for soliciting prostitution from a minor in June 2008.

A note from Mandelson also appears in a 50th birthday album compiled for Epstein in 2003 in which the British politician calls Epstein ""my best pal.""

On Wednesday, Mandelson said he deeply regretted ever meeting Epstein and that he had kept up his association with the latter ""for far longer than I should have done."" 

He also told the BBC that he ""relied on assurances of his [Epstein's] innocence that turned out later to be horrendously false.""

Two islands were affected by flash floods, including tourist hotspot Bali. At least 19 people have been killed, with the authorities still carrying out search and rescue operations to find several people missing.

Flash floods in two Indonesian islands resulted in at least 19 deaths, officials said Thursday, with several others still missing.

One of the islands affected is Bali, a tourist hotspot, with seven districts across the island being affected by floods and landslides.

Fourteen people have been confirmed dead in Bali, while two are still missing. The death toll in Flores island rose to five as a young child was found dead, according to local authorities.

In the Flores island region of Nagekeo, excavators and a thermal drone were part of the rescue operation in a bid to locate three people still missing.

According to National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Abdul Muhari, emergency response efforts are still ongoing in search for victims.

More than 500 people were evacuated due to the floods, with schools and mosques turning into makeshift shelters.

Indonesia typically experiences a monsoon season between November and April, which includes landslides and floods.

However, storm patterns and the length and severity of the season has been affected by climate change, resulting in heavier rain and flash flooding.

Anti-fascist slogans were inscribed on two of the unused bullet casings found after the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, US authorities have confirmed.

One cartridge had written on it, “Hey, fascist! Catch!”, and another featured “Bella ciao,” apparently a reference to a World War II-era Italian anti-fascist song, said Utah governor Spencer Cox.

Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old from south-west Utah, has been detained over the shooting of Kirk, a conservative activist and close ally of Donald Trump.

Cox said one of Mr Robinson's family members told police he had become “more political” in recent months.

At a family dinner, Mr Robinson spoke about how much he did not like Kirk, the 31-year-old Maga influencer, and how he was “spreading hate”.

Charlie Kirk's alleged killer changed his clothes to evade detection, officials said.

Tyler Robinson was pictured on CCTV arriving at Utah Valley University on Wednesday morning dressed in a plain maroon t-shirt, light-coloured shorts, a black hat with a white logo and light-coloured shoes, Utah governor Spencer Cox said earlier.

Pictures shared by the FBI later showed that he had changed into a black t-shirt with blue jeans and blue converse.

When encountered by investigators on Thursday evening, Robinson was wearing clothes “consistent” with those on video, the governor said.

Alleged killer Tyler Robinson's father told him to turn himself in, reports suggest.

Law enforcement sources said that Matt Robinson recognised his son from images released by the FBI.

They added that his father urged him to turn himself in after he confessed to the killing.

Kash Patel the FBI director earlier announced that Robinson was taken into custody on Thursday evening.

Gabby Giffords, the Democratic congresswoman who was shot in 2011, pleaded for tighter gun laws in a Time magazine oped following Charlie Kirk's murder.

She recalled the attempt on Donald Trump's life and the murder of Democrat politician Melissa Hortman.

“Our stories are unique, but what Charlie Kirk, president Trump, Melissa Hortman and I all have in common is that someone who wanted to kill us had a gun,” she wrote.

“I was gutted to learn that Charlie Kirk died yesterday in Utah – and it's also true that in Utah, someone dies from gun violence every 20 hours. Too many families know the pain of having a loved one killed by guns, in that state and across the country.”

Utah, she added, had lax gun laws and had seen fatal shootings increase by 45 per cent between 2014 and 2023.

More details are emerging about Tyler Robinson, the alleged killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

He does not appear to have any criminal history, according to state records reviewed by Reuters. He was a registered voter but was not affiliated with a political party, according to state voter records.

Records show he was an “inactive” voter, which means he had not cast a ballot in recent elections and had not responded to a mailing from the county clerk's office.

Robinson briefly attended Utah State University in Logan for one semester in 2021, the school confirmed to Reuters. It was not immediately clear why he left the college.

In a video posted by his mother on Facebook, Robinson can be seen reading aloud from a letter offering him a four-year scholarship from Utah State University. Another post said Robinson had earned a score of 34 on the ACT college entrance exam, which would put him in the top 1 per cent of test takers, according to the Princeton Review test preparation company.

At the time of his arrest, he was living at his family's home in Washington County, in the south-west corner of Utah near the Nevada border, Utah governor Spencer Cox said.

He has two younger brothers, according to his parents' Facebook posts. His mother is a social worker at a non-profit healthcare company, while his father's occupation was not immediately clear.

The parents of the alleged killer of Charlie Kirk were Republicans voters, records shows.

Voter registration records seen by the Telegraph show that Tyler Robinson's mother, Amber, registered as a Republican voter in 2018, during Joe Biden's presidency.

His father, Matt, registered as a Republican voter in 2000, records show.

Both registrations allegedly remain active.

US president Trump has said his 19-year-old son Barron “was very hurt” by the death of Charlie Kirk.

“He was very hurt when he saw this. But, I mean, everybody was,” Mr Trump said on “Fox & Friends.”

Mr Trump said his youngest child had admired Kirk and once asked for an introduction.

“Barron came to me and he said, ‘Dad, I'd like to meet somebody that you know, Charlie Kirk.' … I thought he was gonna say he wanted to meet like King Charles or something… and he came back said, ‘That guy's great, Dad. That guy's great.' It was cute,” Mr Trump said.

US vice president JD Vance has been pictured carrying Charlie Kirk's coffin.

Mr Vance flew to Utah to meet with Kirk's family and to fly his casket to Arizona, where he lived with his wife and family, on Air Force Two.

US vice president JD Vance has said that a “big step” was taken this morning in “getting justice for Charlie”.

Mr Vance thanked Utah officials and the FBI for their efforts to track down a suspect in Charlie Kirk's killing.

“This is a big breakthrough, and everyone who helped – from the law enforcement professionals to the people giving tips – deserves our credit and gratitude,” he wrote on X.

“We took a big step this morning in getting justice for Charlie, and for his family,” he added. “Thanks be to God for that.”

Anti-fascist slogans were inscribed on two of the unused bullet casings found after the fatal shooting of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, US authorities said Friday.

One cartridge had written on it, “Hey, fascist! Catch!”, and another featured “Bella ciao,” apparently a reference to a World War II-era Italian anti-fascist song, said Utah governor Spencer Cox.

Charlie Kirk's assassination in Utah has irrevocably shaken America's political landscape.

Yet despite the glare of the world's media on the killing – described by Republicans as America's most significant political assassination victim since Robert F Kennedy – the gunman was able to vanish in a puff of smoke.

The slaying of Kirk at a Turning Point USA student summit is the most prominent investigation the FBI has handled since Donald Trump installed Kash Patel to run the bureau. Yet as the manhunt for Kirk's killer enters its third day, serious questions about their ability to deal with a case of this magnitude have been raised.

In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, an elderly man named George Zinn was wrestled to the ground by officers, leading to widespread speculation that the killer had been detained. However, he was soon released because he was “not an accurate person of interest”, according to Utah law enforcement.

Then at around 4.30pm local time on Wednesday – four hours after the attack – Kash Patel said that the gunman had been arrested, only to admit an hour and a half later that the suspect, Zachariah Qureshi, had been released after an interrogation.

Eventually, on Thursday evening the first CCTV footage was released, showing the gunman haring across a rooftop to escape, making Mr Zinn's initial arrest an increasingly improbable line of inquiry.

At a morning press conference on Thursday, investigators had said they were using AI to analyse grainy footage of a “person of interest”, said to be of “college age”, and would release the images publicly if their efforts proved fruitless.

Yet this policy was soon abandoned, as the bureau called on the public for support.

Hours later, two still images were made public showing a skinny white man dressed in a black cap, sweatshirt, jeans and sunglasses. They came with the offer of a $100,000 (£73,000) reward for anyone with information that would lead to the suspect's arrest.

At Thursday's hastily organised evening press conference, officials doubled down on their plea, imploring the public to send in tips to help track down “this evil human being”.

Local enforcement had promised “rapid developments”, but the briefing yielded little in the way of information.

And despite flying in specially, in an apparent effort to show the FBI is getting a grip on the situation, Mr Patel did not say a word, standing sheepishly to the side as Spence Cox, Utah's governor, updated the world's media.

Mr Patel's team have gone about purging the FBI since he was appointed chief by the US president, including firing Mehtab Syed, the special agent in charge of Utah's FBI division a month before Mr Kirk's assassination.

Ms Syed has been described as “absolutely the best” in the bureau and would have played an integral part in the investigation into the shooting.

Mr Patel has repeatedly alleged that the bureau had become politicised under Joe Biden's presidency, but has himself launched investigations into Mr Trump's rivals while enforcing the new administration's anti-immigration agenda.

He is facing criticism for his inaccurate statement that a suspect had been caught in the wake of Wednesday's shooting, causing confusion in the early stages of the investigation.

A White House source, speaking anonymously to Reuters, called Mr Patel's announcement unprofessional and said “his performance is really not acceptable to the White House or the American public” and will be addressed.

Reports have also emerged that Mr Patel held an expletive-laden conference call with more than 200 FBI agents in which he described the manhunt as a “Mickey Mouse operation”, accused employees of not keeping him up-to-date, and said local FBI officials kept a photo of the suspect from him for 12 hours.

The concerning pattern has left survivors of the attack in limbo, unable to come to terms with the tragedy.

Shaken by the attack and unclear how to help, Sean, a student at the university, drove his black SUV round the neighbourhood close to the university handing out A4 fliers of the suspect's face. “I don't know what else to do,” he said.

Other students pleaded with officers to allow them through police cordons to retrieve their belongings, left behind as they escaped Wednesday's carnage.

Initial theories that the killer was a trained marksman also came under scrutiny, with one expert telling NBC that even a person with “minimal training and a scope would be able to easily hit a small target”.

The Wall Street Journal reported that the gunman's bullet casings and rifle, discovered in a nearby “wooded area”, were engraved with “wording” in support of transgender and Antifa ideology. The Telegraph has not been able to independently verify these reports.

Amid the chaos, a chasm of conspiracies has opened up because of the lack of concrete information.

Rumours swirled that the killer may have high-tailed it in a private jet from nearby Provo Airport, as authorities failed to close airspace in the surrounding area despite launching a large-scale manhunt.

A plane took off shortly after 2pm on Wednesday and flew south to Arizona before disappearing from radars, only to re-emerge and return to Provo roughly one hour later, according to flight tracking data seen by The Daily Mail.

The company who chartered the jet was approached for comment.

At the wooded area to the east of campus where the gunman discarded his older-model .30 calibre hunting rifle, FBI evidence response teams were still knocking door-to-door on Thursday afternoon, long after reporters had been and gone.

Dylan Hope, 26, an electrician working at a property next to the university, told The Telegraph that a SWAT team of 30 officers descended on the site at around 2pm on Wednesday and searched the wooded area with dogs before scouring the home.

Multiple sources added that a man matching the description of the suspect had run across the building site and disappeared into the adjacent neighbourhood.

With a promising lead materialising, an afternoon press conference was abruptly postponed owing to “rapid developments”, fuelling speculation of an imminent breakthrough.

However, the briefing was eventually pushed back until late in the evening, where no major disclosures were revealed.

Late on Thursday, it was TMZ, rather than the FBI, who shared the first alleged footage of the subject: a doorbell video showing him dressed in black and limping – possibly a result of jumping down from his rooftop perch.

Every hour that passes, the search to track down the killer becomes more challenging for law enforcement. With pressure mounting, the FBI called on the US Marshals Service for help, according to CNN.

The vacuum left behind by the absence of leads has been filled with blame and retribution.

Republicans and Democrats have traded recriminations online, as schadenfreude from those on the Left was met with heavy criticism from conservatives, condemning them as “radical Left terrorists” and, in the case of Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state, calling for deportation of foreigners celebrating Kirk's death.

Left behind is a community of vulnerable students reeling from the tragedy.

Hours after an evening vigil at Utah State Capitol on Wednesday, a small group of mourners gathered around a flagpole in contemplation, there to pay their final respects at a makeshift shrine to Kirk.

“It was fight or flight,” said Chip Anderson, 19, a political science student at Utah Valley University who was standing 15 feet from Kirk when the gunshot rang out.

Mr Anderson came to pay tribute to “Charlie the Great”, whom he credits with introducing him to the conservative movement, and whose death, he fears, will further silence conservative voices on college campuses.

“I stand fearless for myself, but I feel a responsibility to protect others in any way I can, knowing people on my campus may not feel safe to return to school on Monday,” he said.

Mariah Petersen, 18, was also at the rally and said that when Kirk was shot, “there were cheers from the balcony” from liberal protesters.

“It was horrific to be a part of. There was just no human empathy,” she said.

For Ms Petersen, Kirk embodied the right to freedom of expression granted by the First Amendment. With his death, she worries people will “feel like they can't share their political opinions”.

“I think that's a terrifying thing,” she added.

Kelly Dean, 21, a daycare teacher from Orem, said she has suffered from panic attacks after witnessing the shooting.

“When you see it online, it's like a video game. It's not like that in real life. I saw him bleed out,” she said. “How are you meant to go back to normal after seeing someone die right in front of you?”

Ms Dean said she was sitting in front of two “little kids”, a two-year-old and a one-year-old, when the shot rang out.

“Those poor kids. I don't know what they saw,” she said. “Now when I go back to work and see the children, all I'm going to be able to think is, I'm so thankful that you weren't there.”

“The American people deserve to know what happened at JPMorgan and other banks that financed Mr. Epstein,” they wrote.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

Democratic senators are calling for a congressional hearing on JPMorgan Chase and other banks' ties to accused child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.

“The American people deserve to know what happened at JPMorgan and other banks that financed Mr. Epstein,” 10 Democratic members of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee wrote to Committee Chair Tim Scott (R-South Carolina). 

“The Committee should hold a public hearing as soon as possible to examine failures and advance reforms that protect our communities,” they continued.  

The letter was signed by Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts), Jack Reed (Rhode Island), Tina Smith (Minnesota), Catherine Cortez Masto (Nevada), Chris Van Hollen (Maryland), Raphael Warnock (Georgia), Andy Kim (New Jersey), Ruben Gallego (Arizona), Lisa Blunt Rochester (Delaware), and Angela Alsobrooks (Maryland).

The senators called for JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon to testify before the committee under oath. 

The letter was spurred by an investigation published on September 8 in The New York Times Magazine. The Times reported that JPMorgan may have enabled Epstein's crimes by continuing to work with him despite repeated warnings from employees as early as 2006. 

Over the course of the bank's relationship with Epstein, JPMorgan processed over $1 billion in transactions and opened at least 134 accounts for victims of his sex trafficking operation, according to the Times. The bank made more than $8 million in fees off of Epstein in one year alone. 

“During a time when Epstein was regularly sexually abusing teenage girls and young women, JPMorgan processed more than 4,700 transactions, totaling more than $1.1 billion, for him, including payments to his victims,” the Times reported. “It also wired his money to Russian and Eastern European banks that appeared connected to Epstein's sex-trafficking operations.”

Deutsche Bank, where Epstein was also a client, has also been accused of enabling Epstein's sex trafficking operation. The bank subsequently paid victims of Epstein and regulators more than $100 million in settlements. 

“Deutsche Bank executives, meanwhile, similarly estimated that Mr. Epstein could generate up to $4 million in annual revenues for the bank and decided to bank him in spite of his record,” the senators wrote. “So, despite repeated warnings from their employees, JPMorgan — and other financial institutions like Deutsche Bank — continued to do business with Mr. Epstein, potentially enabling his significant crimes.”

The Trump administration has moved to weaken regulations for the banking industry, but the senators say the Times investigation shows “we need more transparency, not less.”

“As the Trump Administration takes steps to loosen safeguards — such as rolling back anti-money laundering rules, halting enforcement of laws to combat anonymous shell companies, and firing bank examiners — our understanding of these vulnerabilities is more important than ever,” they wrote. 

JPMorgan has faced multiple lawsuits over its relationship with Epstein. The U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein owned two islands, sued JPMorgan, arguing that the bank was “indispensable to the operation and concealment of the Epstein trafficking enterprise.” Epstein allegedly trapped and abused many of his victims on his Virgin Islands compound. The bank settled the case in 2023 for $75 million. 

Also that year, JPMorgan settled a lawsuit filed by about 200 victims for $290 million. 

Haley Robson, who was sexually abused by Epstein when she was in high school, contacted CEO Dimon directly about the bank's integral role in Epstein's crimes. 

“I don't understand how so many people, colleagues, knew what was going on, or had evidence and information that could have helped us, and chose not to speak up,” Haley Robson wrote in a letter to Dimon, The Daily Beast reported in 2023.

“I may not be as smart as you, but we should at least agree that the information you withheld has hurt me and many others,” she continued. 

This week, federal lawmakers published a book of notes and drawings made for Epstein's 50th birthday that was turned over by Epstein's estate. The book reportedly includes contributions from former President Bill Clinton, Harvard law professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz, and President Donald Trump. Trump has denied he authored the note signed “Donald Trump,” which features what appears to be the outline of a woman or girl's body. 

“Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret,” Trump allegedly wrote.

Another contribution to the book, which is unsigned, shows a drawing of Epstein at a child's birthday party, giving three young girls balloons, and a second drawing of women in bikinis massaging him. The first picture is labeled 1983 and the second is labeled 2003. One of the women has Epstein's initials tattooed on her exposed buttocks.

“What a great country,” the contributor wrote. 

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

The country's former Chief Justice Sushila Karki looks set to become interim prime minister.

Following massive, youth-led anti-corruption demonstrations in Nepal, the country's former Chief Justice Sushila Karki looks set to become interim prime minister. This week, protesters set fire to the Parliament and other government buildings, and at least 21 people were killed in a police crackdown. The protests continued even after the government lifted its ban on social media platforms and Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli resigned.

“We don't really know what is happening at the moment … since most of our state institutions have been either destroyed or are nonfunctional,” says Pranaya Rana, a writer and journalist based in Kathmandu. “We really are counting on the new generation, the Gen Z, who led the protests, to take us forward.”

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman.

We end today's show in Nepal, where the country's former Chief Justice Sushila Karki looks set to become the interim prime minister, following massive, youth-led anti-corruption demonstrations. Protesters set fire to the Parliament and other government buildings Tuesday amidst a police crackdown. Officials said today, at least 51 people have been killed, including 21 protesters. The protests continued even after the government lifted its ban on social media platforms and after Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli resigned.

PROTESTER: [translated] Everything that has happened is not because of the social ban. We need a young leader now. We are looking for change. Time is up for these old leaders. We don't need them. We need the youth.

AMY GOODMAN: For more, we go to the capital of Nepal, to Kathmandu, where we're joined by journalist Pranaya Rana.

Thank you so much for being with us. Can you describe the scene right now in the streets, and the significance of what has happened in these youth-led protests, but also this terrible death toll of at least 51 people?

PRANAYA RANA: Hi, Amy. Thank you for having me.

So, right now I'm in Kathmandu. We are still under curfew and prohibitory orders. The Nepal Army is out on the streets patrolling. And we are really in a state of confusion, as we don't really know what is happening at the moment or where the [inaudible] direction the country will go in, since most of our state institutions have been either destroyed or are nonfunctional.

So, we really are counting on the new generation, the Gen Z, who led the protests, to take us forward. Right now negotiations are going on between former Chief Justice Sushila Karki and President Ram Chandra Poudel. They are expected to hash out a deal by today for Madam Karki to become the interim prime minister and lead the country towards fresh elections within six months.

AMY GOODMAN: And who is she? Who is this new interim prime minister? And how do the students feel, the youth feel, about her?

PRANAYA RANA: So, Madam Sushila Karki, she's a former chief justice. She's the only female chief justice in Nepal's history. She resigned — I mean, not resigned. She retired in 2017 after facing an impeachment motion by the political parties who have been kicked out of power right now. The impeachment motion did go through Parliament, but it was nullified by the Supreme Court for not being in line with the Constitution.

So, Madam Karki has always — she has cultivated a reputation for being very anti-corruption, and she also believes that the political parties should hand over leadership to the next generation. So, that's why her stances resonate with the younger generation, the Gen Z, who have led these protests. She was also one of the few senior leaders of the country who came to the streets to protest the 19, now 21, young protesters who were killed on September 8th.

AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk about the government shutting down some 26 social media platforms and how that intensified the protests, and why they focused on social media?

PRANAYA RANA: Well, the social media ban has been in the works for a number of years now. The successive Nepal governments have tried to get social media networks to register within Nepal and appoint a local representative here so that they can reach out easier when they need to take down offensive material. Most of the tech giants — Meta, Alphabet and all the other ones — they've all refused. Either they've ignored the request, or they've straight-up refused, saying that there is no law. So, the Nepal government has been trying to get them registered based on a directive that the executive issued, with — the directive is not an act passed by Parliament. So, a few social media companies have argued that if there is no law in place, we can't register.

So, most recently, what happened was that the Nepal government gave the social media companies a seven-day ultimatum, a seven-day deadline to register, threatening to ban them if they did not. The seven-day deadline passed with no one registering, so the government moved ahead with the ban.

The ban happened to coincide with a widely youth-led movement on social media against corruption and against nepotism, especially of the children of the politicians who are currently in power. So, the youth felt that the social media ban was one more attempt by the government to suppress their voices, take away their free speech, especially because they were criticizing the politicians' families. So, that was the immediate trigger for the protests.

AMY GOODMAN: Pranaya, finally, can you talk about the economy, the economic despair felt by so many in Nepal today? For most Nepalis, the main source of income is remittances from their relatives working abroad. And then put it in a regional context, over these years these youth-led rebellions, particularly also around the economy. You have Sri Lanka in 2022; Bangladesh, its July Revolution, throwing out Sheikh Hasina; most recently, Indonesia, and the spark being the killing of a 21-year-old delivery driver, that led to so much protest. Talk first about Nepal.

PRANAYA RANA: Yes. So, as you said, the Nepali economy basically depends completely on remittances that are sent back by migrant workers, most of whom are in the Gulf states or in Malaysia or in South Korea, where they work labor jobs. Remittances equal about 25% of our GDP. So, that's how important remittances are to this country.

But sadly, most youth feel that they have no future here. They cannot make the amount of money that they would make doing a manual labor job in, say, Qatar or Saudi Arabia. They cannot make the same amount of money working even a [inaudible] job or a white-collar job here in Nepal. So, that resentment has been building. Even students feel that they cannot get a job here in Nepal, so they choose to migrate to foreign lands immediately upon graduating high school or graduating college. So, that is —

AMY GOODMAN: I want to thank you so much, Pranaya. We're going to have to leave it there, but we'll continue these discussions, because this regional context is so important. Pranaya Rana is a writer and journalist based in Kathmandu, Nepal.

And as we wrap up our broadcast, the late breaking news on the murder of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk: CNN has confirmed law enforcement has a man in custody who confessed to his father about shooting Kirk. The father reportedly told authorities and said he had secured his son until he could be formally detained. This morning, President Trump said on Fox News, quote, “Somebody very close to him turned him in. The person was involved with law enforcement, but was a person of faith, a minister, and brought him to a US Marshal who was fantastic. They drove into the police headquarters, and he's there now,” Trump said. I'm Amy Goodman. Thanks for joining us.

“There's a lot of misinformation, and nobody seems to know what's going on,” a resident of Missouri said.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

When the Food and Drug Administration approved updated COVID-19 vaccines on August 27, 2025, it also imposed new restrictions on who is eligible to get them. The new restrictions have created widespread confusion and concern, as well as a series of shakeups in government and public health institutions.

“The [FDA's] new recommendations are acting as a bureaucratic deterrent against people getting the vaccine, exacerbating the problem of record lows in rates of COVID vaccination last year,” evolutionary epidemiologist and fellow Truthout contributor Rob Wallace told me. The changes come as COVID-19 infections are rising, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The new guidelines officially limit vaccine approval to people older than 65 and those older than 6 months who are immunocompromised or live with another qualifying health condition, such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease. Previously, the vaccines were recommended for most adults to protect against severe illness, hospitalization, and death. The change means fewer people will get vaccinated and more will die of COVID-19, a preventable disease that has killed more than 1.2 million Americans since January 2020, according to the CDC.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

Disabled and aging Americans, communities of color, and low-income communities are the most vulnerable to premature death under the new guidance. “We are feeling very dehumanized and like our lives don't matter,” Debra, a Missouri resident who lives with chronic illness and is using only her first name to protect the identities of her children, told Truthout.

Getting the updated COVID-19 vaccine is one important way to limit your risk of contracting the virus or transmitting it to others in your community, who may be at higher risk of severe illness, according to medical researchers. Even if you have been vaccinated against COVID-19 in the past, “The SARS-CoV-2 virus regularly lurches in evolution out from underneath the coverage of a previous year's vaccine,” Wallace explained to Truthout. “That's why we need regular boosters, including this year's.”

Research has shown that available vaccines are not a perfect solution and work best when paired with other preventative measures, especially wearing an N95 or KN95 mask during surges, in medical settings, while traveling, or in other crowded or poorly-ventilated settings.

“We are feeling very dehumanized and like our lives don't matter.”

The FDA's new prohibitive guidelines around COVID-19 vaccines are the latest in a series of moves furthering Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s anti-vaccine and eugenicist agenda. Kennedy took to X/Twitter on August 27, 2025, to laud the new vaccine guidance, claiming it fulfilled his promise to “end covid vaccine mandates.” He has also installed anti-vaccine activists in important positions within his administration, ordered a review of the child vaccine schedule, and often repeated disinformation about vaccines and autism.

Kennedy also claimed in his August 27 post to X/Twitter that COVID-19 vaccines would remain “available to people who want them, especially the vulnerable.” But the reality is that even those labeled high-risk, including disabled and aging Americans, are now struggling to access a vaccine. “I have been inquiring at Walgreens, CVS, and Albertsons about availability, [and] the vague answer is ‘two to three weeks' based on the ‘lack of approvals,' even though [the vaccines] have been approved for my age group,” Dane Madsen, a 67-year-old resident of Nevada, told Truthout.

Many of the nation's largest retail pharmacies are not offering the vaccines at all or are only administering them to individuals with a prescription in dozens of states and Washington, D.C. CVS Pharmacy cited the “current regulatory environment” as the reason for these policies at its stores. Stephanie, a North Carolina resident who is using only her first name to avoid harassment from anti-vaccine relatives and neighbors, told Truthout she was unable to find the vaccines at any local branch of six department stores and retail pharmacies, including CVS, Walgreens, and Walmart: “Ultimately, this year, nobody in my family is likely to get a COVID vaccine.”

Debra told Truthout her local CVS refused to vaccinate her 5-year-old, even though the child has asthma, which is on the CDC's list of qualifying conditions. “There's a lot of misinformation, and nobody seems to know what's going on,” she said. She now plans to take her child to a CVS MinuteClinic, where others have reported that the on-site nurse practitioners have helped them overcome access barriers.

Some patients are seeking Nuvaxovid, a non-mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 developed by Novavax, which has been shown to produce fewer and milder short-term side effects than Pfizer's mRNA vaccine. Christina Gleason, who takes immunosuppressant medications for Sjogren's disease, told Truthout she experienced “lengthy symptom flares that have lasted up to a month” after receiving mRNA vaccines in the past, but only mild discomfort with Nuvaxovid.

This year, Novavax and Sanofi, the company responsible for Nuvaxovid commercialization in the U.S., have provided little information on when the updated Nuvaxovid vaccine will be available. On September 10, 2025, New York Times reporter Maggie Astor shared on Bluesky that Sanofi had not yet shipped Nuvaxovid, but the company planned to begin doing so the following week.

“It is completely unclear when any pharmacies will have it in [and] the communications have been so poor,” Elana Levin, who is looking for Nuvaxovid in New York, told Truthout. Novavax and Sanofi did not respond to Truthout's requests for comment.

Even if Gleason were willing to risk a symptom flare, she said she has been unable to schedule a vaccine appointment at her local Walmart in Upstate New York. There is no way to indicate that she is immunocompromised using the store's online scheduler, and the site tells her she is ineligible based on her age. “It's been a major stressor, wondering if, when, and how I can get the updated vaccine,” she told Truthout.

Some who spoke to Truthout said they feared they could suffer consequences for checking a box to confirm they meet the criteria to receive a COVID-19 vaccine if they misunderstood the requirements. Matthew Cortland, a public health expert who has published a series of explainers on COVID-19 access issues in their newsletter, wrote in one that, in the vast majority of cases, pharmacies will not ask patients how they meet the criteria or to provide documentation.

“A pharmacy is not a court of law,” Wallace, the epidemiologist, echoed to Truthout.

Once a person has located an updated COVID-19 vaccine and secured an appointment, there's the issue of cost. Those who are uninsured or underinsured can expect to be charged around $200 for the vaccine after the Bridge Access Program, which had helped cover those costs, sunset last year. A course of Paxlovid, an antiviral medication prescribed to treat COVID-19 in those at high risk of severe illness, now costs more than $1,400 out-of-pocket. The costs of vaccines and treatments fall hardest on those in low-income communities, who already face a higher risk of serious illness if infected.

The risk of developing long COVID increases with every COVID-19 infection, and vaccines reduce long COVID risk.

“I can't afford it,” Amanda Finley told Truthout. Finley has been uninsured since her position at the Internal Revenue Service was eliminated in one of the supposed cost-cutting sprees of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Instead of booking an appointment at Walgreens, she plans to wait to see if the Minnesota Department of Health will offer a free vaccine clinic near her. She does not drive, meaning she cannot easily travel to find a vaccine.

Finley is eager to find an updated vaccine after she contracted COVID-19 twice in 2020, before vaccines were available, which developed into long COVID. She is one of more than 20 million Americans who have been diagnosed with the illness, which can present with various symptoms, including chronic fatigue, brain fog, heart palpitations, and joint pain. Scientists are only beginning to understand the condition, and most doctors struggle to treat it. The risk of developing long COVID increases with every COVID-19 infection, and vaccines reduce long COVID risk.

Recognizing the potential harm to patients and the nation's public health, the announcement of this year's more restrictive guidelines around COVID-19 vaccines sparked outrage among CDC staff. President Donald Trump fired Director Susan Monarez the same day the guidance was announced, although she had been on the job less than a month, after she accused Kennedy of “sabotage.”

Some medical societies have also voiced opposition to the new rules or issued their own recommendations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists. A group of infectious disease experts at the University of Minnesota is developing alternative vaccine recommendations. Coalitions of states on the West Coast and across New England also plan to issue their own guidance.

On September 4, 2025, during a Senate Finance Committee hearing, federal lawmakers on either side of the aisle also condemned Kennedy's efforts to limit vaccine access. Many called for his resignation. Meanwhile, state lawmakers in several states, including Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, and Pennsylvania, have issued orders for health insurers to cover state-endorsed vaccines or for pharmacies to waive prescription requirements, or taken other measures to ameliorate barriers.

For those in states that have not taken action, some public health experts, including Cortland, have suggested individuals contact their governor and state representatives to urge them to do so, as well as call Senators and Members of Congress to pressure them to force Kennedy's resignation. The People's CDC, a coalition of scientists and public health experts, has urged individuals to submit personalized comment to the CDC before a deadline on the evening of September 13, 2025, to advocate for expanding vaccine access in face of “one of the largest public crises in decades.”

The Sept. 10 death of Charlie Kirk—the highest-profile American political figure to be assassinated in nearly six decades—represents a tipping point for the nation, legal scholars and others told The Epoch Times. How leaders and the populace react to it could determine whether the tide of political violence continues to rise—or recedes.

The 31-year-old father of two was fatally shot in the neck as he spoke on a Utah college campus. As of Sept. 11, the gunman remained unidentified and on the loose; police detained two people but released both after questioning.

Susan MacManus, a Florida political scholar for a half-century, said Kirk's slaying could spark important changes.

Two universities have terminated employees who made what they described as inappropriate remarks about the murder of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk.

“The comments by this employee, who worked in a position of trust directly with students, were inconsistent with our values and have undermined the university's credibility and reputation with our students, faculty, staff and the community at large,” McPhee added. “This employee has been fired effective immediately.

 Even If China Avoids a War of Choice, a Miscalculation Could Spark a War of Chance

 Joel Wuthnow

Tension across the Taiwan Strait has raised fears that Beijing and Taipei could soon find themselves at war. Most observers imagine two possible avenues that could lead to conflict. In a so-called war of choice, Beijing could try to capture Taiwan by force after careful consideration of the economic, military, and political risks. Such an aggressive action without explicit provocation would reflect Chinese leaders' judgment that the island could be taken at minimal cost. Alternately, Beijing might launch a so-called war of necessity if it felt that Taiwan had crossed a political redline that permanently threatened China's control of the island. A formal declaration of independence in Taipei, for example, would likely trigger a military response from Beijing regardless of the costs.

A third possibility, however, has received much less attention—yet may be even more likely. A war between China and Taiwan could result from an accident or miscalculation that spirals out of control. The risks of such a war of chance are high compared with other parts of the world, in part because both military forces operate in close proximity. Domestic political dynamics on both sides of the Taiwan Strait make backing down difficult. And the possibility of U.S. intervention on Taiwan's behalf raises the stakes, which means that a chance encounter could escalate a small skirmish into a larger war.

Unlike a war of choice or a war of perceived political necessity, which can be avoided by strengthening deterrence against China and preventing Taiwan's pursuit of de jure independence, respectively, China, Taiwan, and the United States cannot eliminate the risk of a war of chance. But shrewd statesmanship by leaders can manage it. China and Taiwan need to maintain ongoing backchannel communications to discuss crisis prevention and establish off-ramps. The United States and Taiwan, too, must increase dialogue on how to make decisions in the event of a crisis and preserve U.S. strategic ambiguity that provides space for flexible responses to potential Chinese aggression. China must also exercise military restraint and rein in fighters whose aggressive tactics could provoke further conflict. Wars of chance are by nature sudden and unpredictable, often with devastating consequences. Careful coordination could prevent one in the Taiwan Strait.

It is not difficult to envision how a war of chance could start in the Taiwan Strait. Imagine that a People's Liberation Army (PLA) fighter jet ventures too close to Taiwan. After the aircraft fails to heed repeated warnings, Taiwan's forces shoot down the plane with surface-to-air missiles, killing the pilot. Enraged, Beijing orders the destruction of air defense batteries in retaliation, which results in the deaths of dozens of servicemembers in Taiwan's armed forces. The United States, unsure of Beijing's intentions, begins to mobilize for a larger conflict in the region, prompting China to ramp up mobilization of its own forces. With no party willing to back down and each interpreting the other's moves as signs of aggression, the crisis quickly escalates.

Such a sequence has numerous historical precedents. World War I, which was triggered by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by a Serbian nationalist in 1914, is a classic example of how a war of chance can develop. The Austro-Hungarian Empire's retributive demands against Serbia led Russia, a Serbian ally, to mobilize its forces, which in turn provoked Germany to build up troops against Russia and England, another Russian ally. Within a month, a single act of violence had engulfed the entire world in war.

Wars of chance do not require acts of political violence as triggers; minor military and diplomatic incidents, too, can set them in motion. The Revolutionary War in the United States began when a British soldier in Concord, Massachusetts, opened fire on local militia forces, against orders. This accidental “shot heard ‘round the world'” launched the war that led to U.S. independence. The Peloponnesian War of the fifth century BC began with a quarrel between opposing factions in the city-state of Epidamnos, in modern-day Albania, which snowballed into a clash involving the major rivals Athens and Sparta. And the Second Opium War began in 1856 when Chinese officials boarded a British vessel and arrested the crew. Unwilling to suffer the indignity of the arrest, England responded with attacks against Chinese coastal forts near Canton, culminating in a blow to the Qing dynasty remembered as a key episode in China's “century of humiliation.”

History suggests that three main factors combine to increase the risks of a war of chance. Frequent contact between opposing military forces, such as that between British soldiers and colonial militiamen on the eve of the American Revolution, increases the chance of an incident. Internal political dynamics can make de-escalation difficult, particularly when leaders value intangibles such as prestige, honor, or preserving their or their nation's reputation. In the 1856 incident that led to the Second Opium War, sensationalist press coverage in Britain sparked public outrage that contributed to London's heavy-handed reprisal against the Qing empire. And mobilization by allied nations concerned about the credibility of their commitments can turn a dispute into something much more serious, as occurred between rival alliances in the Peloponnesian War and at the outbreak of World War I.

All three of these factors are present in cross-strait relations today. Chinese air and naval forces are operating increasingly close to the main island of Taiwan to gradually erode the informal boundaries between China and Taiwan. In January, Chinese jets crossed the center line of the Taiwan Strait 248 times, compared with 72 times in January 2024. In April 2024, a Chinese fighter came within about 40 miles of the island—a five-minute flight to downtown Taipei. As part of the Strait Thunder military exercise in April, Chinese navy ships entered Taiwan's 24-nautical-mile contiguous zone for the first time. Chinese coast guard ships have been venturing closer to territory held by Taiwan, as well, and in 2024 they arrested the crew of a Taiwan-flagged vessel near Kinmen, which is part of Taiwan but sits just off the coast of China's Fujian Province—the exact type of incident that could spark a war of chance.

Chinese forces are likely to exert greater pressure on Taiwan in the years ahead. As Taiwan becomes accustomed to aggressive maneuvers, and such actions lose their desired effect of pressuring the island, the PLA will need to add to its coercive repertoire by taking progressively greater risks. Chinese air force sorties may encroach farther on Taiwan's territorial airspace, and ships may close in on the island's territorial seas, raising the risk of collisions or misperceptions of Chinese intent among Taiwan's defenders.

If an accident does occur, finding an off-ramp will be difficult because of political considerations for leaders on both sides of the strait. No Chinese leader will want to suffer the embarrassment of backing down against what the Chinese Communist Party has long framed as a rogue secessionist movement. Nor will Beijing want to lose face by withdrawing if the United States or other foreign powers line up to defend Taiwan, because doing so would roil nationalist sentiment among a population taught that the party will defend the nation's core interests. Taiwan's leaders might want to be cautious in escalating tensions with China, given the relative weakness of their military force, but they would also face a political price at home if they backed down too easily, given support in Taiwan for autonomy from the mainland. (About a quarter of the island's residents want independence now or in the future.) Anti-Chinese protests could break out in Taiwan's cities and embolden independence activists to press their agenda more forcefully, which would alarm Beijing.

Finally, although Taiwan has no official military allies, U.S. involvement could expand the crisis. Washington might not be able to distinguish between an accident and a provocation, or it could interpret the events as a pretext for an invasion and begin sending its own forces into the area. Strong bipartisan pressure on the White House to intervene could force the president's hand. Worried that failure to act would make the administration look weak, embolden China, and undercut the credibility of U.S. commitment among East Asian allies such as Japan and the Philippines, the U.S. president could order rapid mobilization, which could lead to escalation and even preemptive strikes if Beijing believes it is about to face a U.S. attack.

China's reckless military actions have created another hazard that is increasing the probability of a war of chance. Beijing may intend for encroaching flights and ship transits to exert psychological pressure on Taiwan's government, led by the independence-leaning President William Lai, without causing a war, but the actions of individual aviators and sailors could unintentionally cross a line. They might veer too close to areas that Taiwan has pledged to defend or accidentally collide with Taiwan-flagged planes or boats. Beijing would then be stuck in an unintentional escalatory spiral from which it cannot escape.

The 2001 collision between a J-8 fighter from the Chinese navy and a U.S. EP-3 reconnaissance plane in the South China Sea is instructive. The Chinese pilot died and the U.S. plane made an emergency landing on Hainan, an island province of China in the South China Sea. Although the Chinese pilot's poor airmanship was responsible for the crash, Beijing could not easily back down because of nationalist outrage among the Chinese population. China detained the U.S. crew for ten days and released them only when the United States issued a formal statement of “regret.”

The incident might have served as a cautionary tale for Beijing. Yet similar encounters have continued across the region, many of them driven by the brashness or arrogance of individual PLA pilots or crews. In October 2023, a J-11 fighter flew within ten feet of a U.S. B-52 bomber at night and in poor visibility over the South China Sea. In June 2024, Chinese sailors boarded a Philippine naval vessel that was attempting to resupply troops at the disputed Second Thomas Shoal, destroying the ship's communications and navigation equipment and seriously injuring a Philippine marine in the process. In August, a Chinese coast guard ship collided with a ship from China's own navy as both pursued a Philippine coast guard vessel in the South China Sea.

Perhaps the most serious clash in recent memory was the brutal melee that broke out along the disputed Chinese-Indian border in the Galwan Valley, high in the Himalayan Mountains, in 2020. Chinese and Indian forces accused each other of precipitating the clash by engaging in what each side saw as aggressive infrastructure-building and troop movements. Twenty Indian soldiers and more than 40 Chinese soldiers were killed.

Fortunately, none of these near misses triggered a war. Yet with the uniquely fraught geography, history, and politics of the strait, a similar incident involving Taiwan and China could.

Preventing a war of chance between China and Taiwan requires reducing the opportunities for interactions that could be misinterpreted as aggressive acts. The PLA needs to exercise caution in how close airplanes and naval and coast guard ships come to Taiwan and its offshore islands such as Kinmen and Matsu. The PLA should assume that probing Taiwan's defenses is a dangerous game with potentially fatal consequences. Meanwhile, Taiwan's military should exercise prudence in its rules of engagement and not assume that every close call is intentional. Leaders on both sides of the strait, especially Chinese President Xi Jinping, can help by giving clear internal messages to their forces that they will not tolerate rogue displays of showmanship from service members.

In even the best-case scenario, however, incidents are likely to occur. Establishing a feedback mechanism whereby information on dangerous encounters or stunts by individual Chinese operators get high-level attention would ensure that Beijing is more aware of individuals' extreme actions that might cause conflict. In the 2023 B-52 incident, the U.S. Department of Defense suggested that the Chinese pilot himself was “unaware of how close he came to causing a collision.” There may be no direct contact between defense officials from China and Taiwan for the time being, but U.S. officials can pass along information about the antics of individual aviators or units to Beijing. Chinese leaders have a stake in controlling escalation, which would allow the PLA to rein in its worst offenders and reduce the prospects of a war of chance.

China and Taiwan do ultimately need some level of communication to discuss crisis prevention and find off-ramps that both sides can accept without losing face. Chinese officials will not condone direct discussions with Lai because of what they perceive as his ardent pro-independence beliefs, but there is still room for backchannel conversations between Taipei and Beijing. Research institutes, for example, could be designated to pass information and offers across the strait. These channels need to be established and safeguarded in peacetime so that they can be quickly activated in a crisis, just as informal U.S.-Soviet contacts helped avert catastrophe during the Cuban missile crisis.

Washington, for its part, needs to address concerns that an alliance-like commitment to Taiwan could galvanize a much larger conflict. The United States should uphold its long-standing policy of strategic ambiguity with respect to Taiwan's defense. The alternative, a policy of “strategic clarity” in which the United States would commit to providing immediate military assistance in a cross-strait crisis, would increase the likelihood of a war of chance by limiting Washington's ability to determine whether an incident is intentional or accidental and force the United States into an immediate and potentially escalatory response. It is thus encouraging that U.S. President Donald Trump has declined to offer specific guarantees to Taiwan.

Prevention, of course, can go only so far. The United States and Taiwan will still need to be prepared with a credible plan to prevent escalation if and when an incident occurs. What is alarming is that almost all public wargames are premised on an intentional use of force by Beijing, with little focus on how the United States and Taiwan should respond to a crisis triggered by accident. Improvisation, necessitated by a lack of preparation, would be more than dangerous. It could lead to another world-historic calamity of chance.

 The World's Democracies Must Work Together—and Constrain Washington

 Phillips P. O'Brien

The United States used to be known as the “leader of the free world”—a mostly self-proclaimed but still widely resonant title that revealed how Americans viewed themselves and how allies judged their country. Although major democracies in Europe and East Asia at times chafed under U.S. dominance, they accepted Washington's strategic supremacy. Starting in 1945, the United States' allies adjusted to living in a U.S.-dominated world and believed that the country would protect them in the event of war.

Those days might be over. In the first seven months of U.S. President Donald Trump's second administration, Washington has weakened its defense commitments around the world. It has, for example, questioned NATO's Article 5 (which requires NATO members to assist others under attack), launched a tariff war with practically every country, and repeatedly threatened to cut off support for Ukraine. Before, U.S. allies tailored their defense plans and many of their international policy positions to curry favor with American officials. Today, Washington's allies are contemplating a world where the United States can no longer be trusted to provide for their security or to uphold the rules-based order it spent almost a century constructing.

The risks emanating from Washington go beyond abandonment. Trump is not only pulling away from the United States' traditional partners; he is flirting with working directly against them. Trump has made it known for years that he often prefers engaging with dictators—including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping—to engaging with democracies. Since returning to office, for instance, he has routinely spoken with Putin and discussed carving up Ukraine. The summit in August in Anchorage, at which Trump welcomed Putin on a red carpet and with warm remarks, is only the most recent example. Other major voices in the Republican Party are making it clear that, at a minimum, they no longer feel bound to defend democracy around the world. U.S. Vice President JD Vance has said the United States is “done with the funding of the Ukraine war business” and openly called for Europeans to support far-right forces across their continent. Republicans are also weakening the foundations of democratic rule in the United States. Trump and his allies are redrawing the boundaries of House seats to protect their congressional majorities, firing government employees because they do not like the results of nonpartisan research, constantly issuing unlawful executive orders, and bullying the media and universities. This, too, can hardly be comforting for the democratic allies that believed Washington led the “free world.”

Many of these states have tried to pretend that this problem will go away. They have worked to ingratiate themselves with the Trump administration, lavishly praising the president. But Trump has continued to threaten them and weaken their bonds with Washington. The strategy of appeasing Trump, in other words, could well fail. Instead, it might make sense for states committed to democracy and what is left of the old rules-based order to reimagine their international relations, insulate themselves from the United States' whims, and try to generally protect their own freedoms in this deeply unstable time. Such an effort would require that they build far stronger economic and defense ties with each other than they have now and make a much greater (and more expensive) commitment to their own security. It will be a tough endeavor. But it could be the only way for these countries to save democracy at home—and perhaps help it spread again.

In both his terms in office, Trump has been enthusiastic about authoritarian leaders. He has repeatedly praised North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. He has cheered on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. All the while, he has blasted democratic heads of state. He repeatedly denigrated former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, for example, whom he labeled “governor” of the United States' “fifty-first state.” And he appears to see authoritarian governance as the model he wants to emulate. In August, Trump went so far as to say that he believes many Americans would prefer to have a dictator in charge of their country.

The biggest beneficiaries of Trump's decision to reorient the United States away from its historic allies are China and Russia. Although one of the justifications for his desire to improve relations with Putin is that he might drive China and Russia apart, Trump seems more keen to work with the two autocracies than to try to split them. Recently, Trump has signaled this to Beijing in several ways. He has said, for example, that he expects China and the United States will develop a “great relationship.” He frequently praises Xi. And although Trump was happy to heap tariffs on India for buying too much discounted Russian oil, he has not used this reasoning to impose similarly sizable tariffs on China, which buys even more.

There is a seeming logic behind Trump's decision to turn away from democratic states and toward dictatorial ones: a desire to establish three spheres of influence that encompass most of the world. The first is the Americas, where Trump has been avowedly expansionist. (Democratic Denmark accused him of trying to destabilize Danish rule in Greenland earlier this year.) The second is China and the eastern Pacific. And the third is Russia and Europe.



The result would be a new Dreikaiserbund, or Three Emperors League—the pact between Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Germany in the 1870s and 1880s. It presents perhaps the greatest change to the global balance of power since World War II. Washington's democratic allies in Asia, Europe, and North America would no longer be protected by the United States. As a result, they would have to remake everything about their foreign policies (and probably their economic and political systems) to survive, especially as Washington becomes an active agent in attempts to destroy their democratic independence. Between China and the United States, liberal states would have to protect themselves against the two largest economies in the world and the two most powerful militaries. Add Russia to the mix, and democracies would be confronting three powers with many more nuclear weapons than the rest of the world combined.

Moreover, the surviving democratic states would in no way be a coherent bloc. The Pacific democracies—Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan—often collaborate but also experience bouts of tension. Canada stands alone. The democracies of the developing world, such as Brazil, frequently disagree with all the wealthy ones. The only truly organized bloc is what might best be termed European NATO.

The rich and technologically advanced democracies of Europe, North America, and the Pacific have a history of cooperation. But that is to a large degree because of their common links to the United States. It is hard to imagine them acting as an alliance. European states, for example, would find it all but impossible to deploy adequate military forces to the Pacific to help defend Taiwan. It is also hard to see the Pacific democracies fighting to defend Canada, even though that country is geographically much closer to many of them than is Europe. In fact, the different groupings all have more economic ties with illiberal states than they do with each other. Japan, South Korea, and even Taiwan trade much more with China than with any other country.

But even if the wealthy democratic states do not act as members of one alliance, they can better coordinate their actions to provide each other with both immediate and longer-term support. They can, for instance, help each other construct the kinds of armed forces required to deter antidemocratic forces. They can begin by addressing one enormous weakness—their deficit of nuclear weapons. Without Washington's arsenal, the only nuclear weapons liberal democracies possess are in the hands of the British and the French. And both these arsenals are very small and very much based on U.S. technology.

Other liberal states will need to construct nuclear deterrents of their own. To do so, they will have to cooperate. Consider Europe. The continent will be able to build nuclear warheads quite easily. But it will struggle to build delivery systems without outside help. The Pacific democracies, however, have been working on different conventional missile systems that could easily be repurposed for nuclear weapons. Japan, for instance, is constructing a long-range conventional strike capacity. By quietly working together, the Pacific democracies could help the European ones construct an effective nuclear deterrent. In exchange, the European democracies could help the Asia-Pacific states develop nuclear warheads and nuclear weapons maintenance programs, as well as share best practices on how to keep such weapons secure.

Nuclear cooperation could then expand into cooperation on conventional military systems, which would exponentially increase the value of the massive investments in defense that all the democratic states will have to make. (Right now, these countries are dangerously reliant on the United States for advanced weaponry.) In certain areas, such as shipbuilding, both the European and the Pacific democracies are superior to the United States, and they could help each other keep pace with the shifting nature of war. Right now, the shape of militaries seems to be changing from a reliance on expensive legacy systems, such as tanks and big warships, toward smaller, cheaper ones. Warships, accordingly, may need to be reduced in size and become platforms for launching large numbers of smaller, autonomous weapons. In that case, European and Pacific democracies can use their expertise to develop new ships in tandem.



Democracies could also help each other secure more of the raw materials essential for building strong armed forces. Illiberal leaders are fond of cutting off raw materials to bend states to their will; China, for example, dominates the supply chains for rare-earth minerals and has repeatedly threatened to stop sending them to states that undermine its interests. The only way democratic states can contest such power is to make their resources available to each other. Fortunately, three geographically big democracies—Australia, Canada, and Ukraine—are well endowed with raw materials, including rare-earth minerals. These countries could strike trade deals with other liberal states that help everyone involved build up their militaries and grow richer.

When it comes to economic cooperation, democracies should not limit themselves to raw materials. Trade helps economies grow, and trade between liberal democracies can prove especially valuable because these states have something illiberal ones don't: the rule of law. Democratic states have contracts enforced by their judiciaries, relatively reliable patent systems, and other checks to provide for a more trustworthy business environment. As a result, they will have an easier time attracting investment. If liberal states invest more in each other and less in autocracies, the rule of law could give them an even greater material advantage, as corruption in other authoritarian countries slows growth. That is most apparent in China and Russia, where graft is already routine and thus already suppresses economic activity. But even the United States has recently been weakening its anticorruption laws, and top American officials are becoming easier to pay. Trump, for instance, has created a cryptocurrency that people hoping for presidential favors can purchase. As such dealings become regularized in Washington, democratic states that support legal standards will become better options for commerce.

Not all democracies will benefit equally from this new economic geography—or be equally resilient to authoritarian attacks. The Canadian economy, for instance, is enmeshed with that of the United States: Canada does about two-thirds of all its international trade with its southern neighbor. Ottawa is also extremely vulnerable to U.S. pressure, given that Canada's long land border is impossible to defend with conventional forces. Canada should thus try to avoid provoking the United States, such as by developing nuclear weapons. (If Washington continues down its current dark path, however, Ottawa will have to consider the nuclear option.) But although Canadians should probably not go out of their way to antagonize Trump, they must keep strongly rebuffing his attempts to annex their country and must strengthen relations with democratic Asian and European states. Most notably, Canadians have discussed boosting direct defense ties with Europe—bypassing the United States.

Clearly, democratic states have many ways they can cooperate to protect themselves. But in the long term, they should aim beyond simple self-preservation. They should also look for ways to put autocratic states on the back foot. Doing so will not be easy, especially if Washington becomes a real foe. Yet with luck, the United States will eventually emerge from its flirtation with authoritarianism, and they can position themselves well for when that moment occurs.

To succeed, however, the democratic world will have to pick its battles. In practice, that means the most coherent bloc of democracies—Europe—should focus on the weakest of the three main autocratic powers—Russia. Even without the assistance of Asian democracies, Europe has a major economic and technological advantage over Moscow, which is a sclerotic and overrated power. If Europe sensibly and effectively rearms and invests in strategic industries, it can create military forces far superior to those of the Kremlin.

It would therefore behoove this new Europe to do to Russia exactly what Russia has been trying to do to other states (with significant success) over the last few years: destabilize its society and weaken the political legitimacy of its rulers. European states should fund Russian opposition groups and individuals willing to stand up to Putin's dictatorship. They should also consider seizing Russia's shadow fleet of uninsured tankers, which often sail in European waters, and shooting down Russian drones when they encroach on democratic Europe's airspace, as regularly occurs. Most of all, European states need to redouble their efforts to help Ukraine emerge from its war in the best shape possible.

In this way, European states could transform what seems like a weak position into a stronger one. And a vibrant, free, and technologically advanced Europe that can stand on its own two feet will be infinitely more attractive, especially to young Russians, than Putin's corrupt regime. Europe must present itself as being in opposition to everything Putin stands for. If it can do that, the continent might persuade younger Russians to opt for a European future, which could, in time, lead to the fall of the country's current system. And if Europe can break Russia's dictatorship and consolidate democratic rule across the whole continent, it would gain the power to support democracies in other places where it is now in retreat. A strategy of democratic survival, in other words, will eventually be transformed into one of democratic expansion.

If the United States does eventually return to its senses, it can help these states build on the progress they've made by institutionalizing their cooperation. Washington will still be best positioned to bring Asian and European democracies together and turn their loose association into a more formal alliance, given its historical connections to each. But the United States will never again, and should never again, be trusted to lead the free world. It could convene this grouping, but it could not helm it. After all, the world's other democratic countries will not only have saved freedom without the United States. They will have saved democracy from it.

President Donald Trump announced Friday that his administration would target Memphis as part of his efforts to crack down on crime across the nation's major cities.
    


            “I'll be the first to say it right now, again, we're going to Memphis,” Trump told “Fox & Friends” in an interview.
    


            “Memphis is — that's the next thing, deeply troubled, and the mayor is happy, he's a Democrat mayor, the mayor is happy. And the governor, Tennessee, the governor is happy. … We're going to fix that just like we did Washington.”
    


            CNN has reached out to Memphis Mayor Paul Young and Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee.
    


            “I'm just announcing that now, and we'll straighten that out, National Guard and anybody else we need,” Trump said. “And by the way, we'll bring in the military too if we need it, but National Guard, but Memphis is, look, it's a great, music city.”
    


            Trump had previously threatened to send troops to Chicago, and also wrote in a Truth Social post that said that city is “about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR.” But while the Department of Homeland Security has announced an immigration crackdown in that city, the mobilization of troops promised by Trump has not materialized.
    


            In Memphis, a blue city in a state that is governed by a Republican, Trump is likely to find state officials that are more receptive to his efforts to mobilize the National Guard and other resources. The city had the highest violent crime rate last year among US cities with a population over 250,000, according to a CNN review of FBI data.
    


            “Today, President Trump answered my call to do whatever it takes to Make Memphis Safe Again, and I applaud his decision to send the National Guard to Memphis following his tremendous success in reducing violent crime in Washington, D.C.,” GOP Sen. Marsha Blackburn said in a statement.
    


            After the Trump administration federalized the Washington, DC, police department and surged federal law enforcement and troops across the nation's capital last month, crime in the city is down and hundreds of people accused of being in the US illegally have been detained. But tourism numbers have also declined, and some restaurants in the city are hurting for customers, CNN has previously reported.
    


            Trump's emergency order that enabled him to take over DC's police department expired earlier this week, though members of the National Guard are expected to remain in the city, along with a surge of federal law enforcement officers who have been seen patrolling highly touristed areas in the city.
    


            Tennessee was among the states to send members of their National Guard to DC although it is unclear whether those troops will now be removed to patrol their own state.
    


            Local officials in Washington, DC, had suggested the government's efforts were focused on arresting and deporting undocumented immigrants and clearing homeless encampments.
    


            Trump previewed earlier this week that he'd announce the next city his administration was targeting by the end of the week, telling reporters ahead of a dinner in DC on Tuesday, “We're working it out.”
    


            “We'll be announcing another city that we're going to very shortly — we're working it out,” Trump said. “The governor of a certain state would love us to be there, and the mayor of a certain city in that same state would love us to be there. We'll announce it probably tomorrow, and it's going to be something where we'll do like we did here.”
    


            Local officials in Memphis spoke out against Trump's plans.
    


            Lee Harris, the mayor of Shelby County, which includes Memphis, has publicly called for Tennessee's governor to “please reconsider” the National Guard deployments, and said in a Facebook post on Thursday that “the occupation of US cities” puts the country at risk of “losing our democracy.”
    


            Memphis City Council member Jeff Warren, a Democrat, told CNN that the upcoming deployment of troops in his city “is legal” but “not what we need.”
    


            “What we need more than the National Guard is the federal government to continue paying for the violence-prevention programs that have been successful in lowering our murder rate,” Warren said, noting that the Trump administration cancelled $500 million in public safety grants. “We love our National Guard, but we don't think that's going to be a long-term solution.”
    


            Another Democratic councilmember, Jerri Green, said Trump's “unwarranted and undemocratic” deployment could hamper existing efforts to reduce crime because members of the Tennessee National Guard will be pulled away from their day jobs as police officers, firefighters and prison guards.
    


            “They're going to do political theater and terrorize a lot of our community,” said Green, who is running for governor in next year's election. “The last time we had federal troops in Memphis was during the Civil War. I don't think this $1 million-a-day dog and pony show will make our residents feel any safer.”
    


            Trump, meanwhile, credited someone unexpected for his desire to send National Guard troops to Memphis: Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena.
    


            Vena, Trump told Fox News on Friday, asked that National Guard troops be sent to Chicago, St. Louis and Memphis when he met with Trump seeking approval of his deal to buy Norfolk Southern.
    


            According to Trump, the president was meeting with Vena because “they're doing a merger, and he wanted to come see me and all that stuff.” And Trump said Vena mentioned the three cities when he asked Vena where he should send the National Guard to next.
    


            Trump said Vena told him that when Vena was on the FedEx board, he had been told it wasn't safe for him to walk one block to his hotel in Memphis and that he needed to be driven in a bullet-proof limo. Vena left the FedEx board in 2023.
    


            Vena, according to Trump, cited the need for a crime crackdown in St. Louis, which Trump said he described as having “been so badly hit.” And he said there needed to be help for Chicago.
    


            “He said, ‘Sir, please don't lose Chicago. We are about to lose Chicago. It's a great city. You can save Chicago,'” Trump said.
    


            Trump did not say during the Fox interview how he felt about the proposed Union Pacific purchase of Norfolk Southern. The deal is opposed by some rail customers who worry about how the combination would affect their service and the rates they pay.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Secretary of Culture War: How Hegseth wields power at the Pentagon","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/12/politics/secretary-of-war-hegseth-wields-power-pentagon","Fri, 12 Sep 2025 12:00:05 GMT","


            Army Secretary Dan Driscoll had only been in the job for a matter of days before he angered his new boss, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.
    


            Driscoll, an Army veteran and longtime personal friend of Vice President JD Vance, had been floating ideas to get Vance and President Donald Trump to visit the Pentagon — an event he believed would boost morale given the pomp and circumstance that accompanies any presidential visit. Trump expressed interest in the idea, two people with knowledge of the episode told CNN.
    


            Hegseth, however, viewed Driscoll's overtures to the White House in the spring as insubordination, the sources said. Trump was his boss, and Driscoll shouldn't have gone around him and made him look bad, Hegseth told the Army secretary upon learning of the plans. Driscoll replied that that wasn't his intention, and the two — at least outwardly — moved on.
    


            Hegseth's wariness of Driscoll is emblematic of his larger fixation with undermining or removing anyone he perceives as a threat to his public image and standing with Trump, regardless of their expertise or experience, a dozen current and former officials told CNN.
    


            “If Driscoll starts getting too prominent, or too favored, it makes it a lot easier politically to just let Hegseth go somehow or find an off-ramp,” one of the sources said.
    


            Questions about Hegseth's longevity in the job have swirled almost from the beginning of his tenure. And Driscoll's name was increasingly brought up, including inside the White House, as a possible replacement for Hegseth after a series of high-profile missteps by the defense secretary in the spring — to Hegseth's great irritation, sources said.
    


            Hegseth's tactics can be ruthless. In April, following a series of leaks he believed made him look bad, Hegseth fired three senior Pentagon officials, two of whom were close friends that had worked with him for years, and publicly accused them of being leakers. Those accusations were never proven.
    


            Hegseth also threatened senior Pentagon officials, including then-acting Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Chris Grady, with polygraph tests and leak investigations. Hegseth refused to sign off on a promotion for 34-year Army veteran, Lt. Gen. Doug Sims, who had been serving as the director of the Joint Staff, because he believed he was leaking to undermine him and had been too close to retired Gen. Mark Milley, a fierce Trump critic, sources said. Grady and Sims both denied the accusations, which weren't proven, sources said. Sims is set to retire soon.
    


            Then, in June, right-wing activist Laura Loomer, who sources told CNN has known Hegseth for more than a decade and speaks to him regularly, began attacking Driscoll on X, accusing him of cozying up to “Trump haters” because he had posted a photo on X with retired US Army officer and current Democratic member of Congress Eugene Vindman. His twin brother Alexander was a key witness to Trump's 2019 impeachment over his dealings with Ukraine.
    


            The Army quickly removed the post with Vindman, but the damage had been done.
    


            “We got our assess handed to us” because of Loomer, a person familiar with the conversation recalled.
    


            Loomer launched a similar attack against Driscoll last month, and it took days for Hegseth's spokesperson, Kingsley Wilson, to publicly defend the Army secretary. Even when she did, Wilson made a point to note that Hegseth appreciates Loomer's “important work.”
    


            Driscoll and Hegseth's working relationship has improved since the early days of the Trump administration — with the two men even spending time together socially in recent weeks, one source familiar with their dynamic told CNN. But at the same time, Hegseth's unease about anyone he perceives as a potential rival lingers in the background, they added.
    


            In a statement to CNN, Hegseth denied having any tension with Driscoll.
    


            “It's no surprise that people who know nothing about the strong dynamic between Army Secretary Driscoll and I are shoveling lies to CNN without putting their names to their statements,” Hegseth said. “As said before, I have complete & total confidence in Secretary Driscoll, and we will continue to work together to make our military lethal again. He is doing a fantastic job leading the U.S. Army, and we are fortunate to have his America First leadership.”
    


            Driscoll similarly told CNN in a statement that he is “honored” to serve under Hegseth and any suggestion to the contrary is “fake news.”
    


            “I'm honored to serve under the leadership of Secretary Hegseth as we restore the strength and lethality to the Department of War,” Driscoll said. “His support has been vital as we transform the Army. No amount of media spin will distract us from working together to defend the American people.”
    


            In a statement to CNN, a White House spokesperson said it was “totally bogus to insinuate that anyone in the White House has anything less than extraordinary confidence in both Secretary Hegseth and Secretary Driscoll.”
    


            Since taking office, Hegseth has fired or pushed out at least 11 of the military's most senior officers and ordered a 20% cut in the number of four-star generals across the active duty, accusing most of them of being “woke.”
    


            Meanwhile, Hegseth has grown increasingly insular, officials said. His personal lawyer, Tim Parlatore, now sits directly outside his office — a gatekeeper in the literal sense, sources said. And Hegseth is still on edge about the forthcoming results of a DoD Inspector General investigation into his use of Signal to discuss classified information — the findings of which could be made public in the coming days.
    


            His priorities also strike some officials as especially misplaced given the various crises unfolding globally right now — from Israeli strikes on Qatar and Russian drone incursions into Poland to a possible US military confrontation with Venezuela.
    


Trump signs executive order rebranding Pentagon as the Department of War



            “Renaming the Defense Department to the ‘Department of War' isn't the kind of substantive work that actually changes things here,” a Pentagon official said, referring to Hegseth's campaign to change the department's name. “Being a good leader is about way more than just politics.”
    


            Privately, some Trump allies say Hegseth is aware of his own short-comings when it comes to navigating Pentagon bureaucracy and overseeing effective policy-making — which is why he has intentionally focused most his energy toward social media and more surface-level issues, leaving more substantive tasks to his top deputies.
    


            “He's not dumb,” one source familiar with Hegseth's management style said, adding that Trump's Defense Secretary prioritizes things he knows he can do, while largely deferring to more experienced officials when it comes to executing policy and combat decisions.
    


            Hegseth's most popular initiatives internally have fallen outside the scope of the culture wars, officials said. For example, multiple officials and servicemembers praised a policy he unveiled over the summer aimed at cutting red tape and accelerating timelines for the military to produce thousands of low-cost drones. He also launched an interagency task force last month dedicated to developing and acquiring counter-drone technology — an initiative he put Driscoll in charge of.
    


            Other policies, however, appear to stem solely from Hegseth's own fear of leaks and have actually made people's jobs harder, the sources said. For example, as a way to prevent leaks, Hegseth's office implemented a new policy earlier this year requiring Pentagon officials across the services to sign non-disclosure agreements before being read in on projects, initiatives and other work products, according to a defense official and a copy of the agreement reviewed by CNN.
    


            It's a highly unusual requirement that the official said was never requested under previous administrations for day-to-day department operations, particularly for things that aren't classified. In addition to classified information, the NDA covers any material deemed “confidential, sensitive, for official use only, and controlled unclassified information,” and states that violating it could result in criminal prosecution.
    


            The policy has made communication with colleagues much more difficult, the official said, because it is often unclear which employees, even those within the same office, do or do not have an explicit “need-to-know” the information that is covered by a particular NDA.
    


            Congress, meanwhile, has virtually no engagement with Hegseth, Democratic and Republican congressional staffers told CNN, which has limited their ability to conduct oversight of the Pentagon. Following Hegseth's lead, DoD officials across the board are engaging far less with the Hill than under previous administrations, they said.
    


            “When you fire enough people, purge enough expertise from the military, and just bully enough people into silence, you can get by with that for a while but eventually there may come a moment where the right people are gone, and there's nobody there to make the best decision to protect American lives or keep service members out of a dangerous situation that they didn't need to be in,” said one Senate aide. “It's exciting to break all these things and push the agenda, but there are consequences.”
    


            A recent, unprecedented US military strike on a boat the administration accused of carrying Venezuelan cartel members, for example, was not notified to lawmakers beforehand. In a briefing nearly a week later, defense officials refused to tell lawmakers who assessed the legality of the strike, a source familiar with the matter said. Instead, they repeatedly claimed that the president has the inherent authority, under Article II of the Constitution, to launch such attacks.
    


            The takeaway, this source said, was that the Pentagon's position is now that the president can conduct “extrajudicial killings against civilians anywhere in the world without any congressional authority or oversight.”
    


            Hegseth's focus on his own image is apparent in the ballooning number of public relations staff he has hired in recent months, officials said. He now has more than double the number of spokespeople his predecessor had, and their primary tasks appear to be posting on X in support of Hegseth, producing videos for him, and scanning social media for any signs of servicemembers being disloyal or out of step with the secretary's image for the department, officials said.
    


            Military and civilian officials across the services say they constantly feel like they are walking on eggshells because of a small army of “watchers” both inside Hegseth's office and on X, many of whom say openly they are looking for “wins” in getting people fired.
    


            Two military doctors have been targeted in just the last two weeks following two such online pressure campaigns. On August 29, an Army veteran-turned-conservative podcaster publicly accused an Army colonel and physician of being “an activist for transgender ideology” in a post on X.
    


            Hours later, the podcaster posted that the physician, an Army colonel, had been relieved of command. The podcaster thanked Hegseth for taking action; the Army declined to answer questions on if she had been relieved, saying only that she is currently on active duty.
    


            Last week, the same podcaster posted about a Navy physician who had listed pronouns on her official LinkedIn page and described herself as a deputy medical director for transgender healthcare. The post was amplified by the far-right Libs of TikTok account. Less than 12 hours later, Hegseth responded, “Pronouns UPDATED: She/Her/Fired.”
    


            There had not been an investigation prior to her firing, nor was her removal related to any concerns about her job performance, an official familiar with the situation said.
    


            The podcaster, Chase Spears, and a number of other accounts in the same ecosystem, have continued publicly calling for action against several other officials and service members in the days since, often tagging Hegseth, the military services and even President Trump in an effort to get their attention. Spears said in a lengthy post on X on Tuesday that his efforts are primarily about rooting out “transgender ideology” in the military, though posts shared by him and others have also focused on the military's former Covid-19 vaccine mandate, and broader diversity, equity and inclusion issues.
    


            The Army has been a particular target of Hegseth's ire, multiple sources said, which some officials believe is a result of Hegseth's suspicions of Driscoll. Hegseth is also most familiar with the Army, having served in the Army National Guard for nearly 20 years.
    


            “The tension between Hegseth and Driscoll bleeds down into the staffs,” said one of the sources. “Privately, it's like, ‘Let's find every opportunity we can to pressure the Army.'”
    


            A lot of the pressure is simply about messaging and optics, a top priority for the TV-savvy Hegseth.
    


            Hegseth's office, for example, “chewed out” the Army again when the National Guard began deploying in DC because Army officials sought to emphasize that the Guard was there primarily to help with logistical tasks, the source said. Hegseth, instead, wanted the Army to focus its public messaging on the troops' lethality and strength — and, ultimately, he decided they should be armed, too, because he thought they looked weak without weapons, the sources said.
    


            Many Guardsmen have since been tasked with DC “beautification” projects, like gardening and trash cleanup.
    


            Trump, for his part, has continued to stand behind Hegseth, who he believes has the right look to lead the “war department.” Trump likes Driscoll, sources said, but he isn't a full-throated culture warrior like Hegseth — a possible vulnerability in this administration.
    


            Still, one big reason Driscoll has consistently been named as a possible replacement for Hegseth is because as a Senate-confirmed official, he wouldn't require a new confirmation hearing — a headache that the White House has wanted to avoid.
    


            “He's non-threatening, he's charming, he's not explosive like Hegseth is, he's just a go along to get along kind of guy,” one of the sources said of Driscoll. “The better Driscoll looks, the worse it is for Hegseth.”

            Amid the uncertainty surrounding eligibility for and access to the latest Covid-19 vaccine, a new study has found that a common nasal spray could help prevent infection.
    


            This randomized placebo-controlled trial examined the effectiveness of the nasal spray azelastine in preventing Covid-19 infection, as published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine on September 2. Researchers concluded that the chance of developing Covid-19 was about three times lower in the azelastine group compared with the placebo group.
    


US death rate dropped back to pre-Covid levels in 2024, CDC report says



            What is azelastine, and do these study results mean we should start stocking up on this nasal spray? And, as coronavirus cases are once again rising, what precautions should people take to reduce their chances of infection?
    


            To help with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. Wen previously was Baltimore's health commissioner.
    


CNN: What is azelastine nasal spray, and what is it currently approved for?



Dr. Leana Wen: Azelastine nasal spray, also referred to as the brand names Astelin and Astepro, is an antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergies, including stuffy or runny nose, itching, and sneezing. The medication is approved for both seasonal allergic rhinitis and perennial allergic rhinitis.
    


            Seasonal allergic rhinitis is what most people think of as hay fever — allergy symptoms that flare up at certain times of the year, usually in the spring, summer or fall, when pollen from trees, grasses or weeds is in the air. Perennial allergic rhinitis, on the other hand, causes symptoms year-round. The condition is triggered by things that can be found throughout the year, such as dust mites, pet dander and mold.
    


            First approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1996, this medication is now available in generic forms. A physician's prescription is required, though one brand name called Astepro Allergy can now be purchased over the counter at pharmacies.
    


CNN: Why did researchers test this nasal spray to prevent respiratory illnesses?



Wen: Early in the pandemic, scientists looked at whether medications already on the market could be repurposed to fight Covid-19. Azelastine showed promise in some laboratory studies.
    


One study found that azelastine could bind to a receptor that the coronavirus uses to access human cells. Another report suggested that this antihistamine reduced virus levels in nasal tissue. And a third found that the medication may have a broader antiviral effect against other respiratory viruses, including the influenza virus.
    


            Because this nasal spray is widely available, researchers wanted to test it on human participants in a rigorous setting to see whether azelastine could, in fact, reduce coronavirus infection. If so, this medication could be an inexpensive way to boost protection.
    


Newly approved antibody could offer another option for protecting infants from RSV, a common infection that can be deadly



CNN: How was this new study performed, and what did it show?



Wen: This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial involving 450 healthy adult volunteers in Germany, nearly all of whom (99.1%) had been vaccinated at least once with the Covid-19 vaccine. Participants were randomized to two groups. In one group, azelastine nasal spray was applied to each nostril three times a day for an average of 56 days. The other group received a placebo spray. Participants were tested for Covid-19 infection twice a week by rapid antigen test.
    


            Researchers confirmed positive tests with laboratory polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, testing. Patients who tested positive for Covid-19 continued rapid antigen testing each day until the result was negative, so researchers could see how long the infection lasted. The study team also monitored participants for infection with other respiratory viruses, including the common cold coronaviruses, influenza, rhinovirus and parainfluenza.
    


            Researchers found that the incidence of Covid-19 infection was significantly lower in the azelastine group compared with the placebo group. In the former, five of 227 participants (2.2%) tested positive, compared with 15 of 223 participants (6.7%) in the placebo group. The mean duration of having a positive test was also shorter in the azelastine group (3.40 days) compared with the placebo group (5.14 days).
    


            What's interesting is that the azelastine group was also less likely to contract other respiratory viruses. The total number of participants with a laboratory-confirmed infection of any of the viruses tested was 19 out of 227 (8.4%) in the azelastine group versus 42 out of 223 (18.8%) in the placebo group. Participants in the azelastine group also reported an average of only 1.73 illness days compared with 2.75 days for those in the placebo group.
    


In break with current CDC recommendations, leading pediatrics group recommends Covid-19 shots for young children



CNN: How convincing are these results?



Wen: I think this was a well-designed study that points to a protective effect of azelastine nasal spray against SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. The findings suggest that azelastine could be used as a preventive treatment against infection.
    


            As the authors noted, the percentage reduction in Covid-19 infection is on par with what has been seen for other preventive measures, such as being up-to-date on Covid vaccines. These results are especially encouraging since azelastine nasal spray is inexpensive and widely available — not to mention that it already has decades of safety data. These findings are an important first step and set the stage for other clinical trials to see whether azelastine can reliably reduce the risk of respiratory virus infections.
    


CNN: Should people start using azelastine to prevent infections now?



Wen: Although the results are promising, keep in mind that the study was fairly small. The FDA has not approved azelastine to prevent Covid-19 or any other infection. I certainly would not encourage people to use the spray instead of other preventive measures, such as vaccination and masking.
    


These are the conditions that make you eligible for an updated Covid-19 vaccine



CNN: Speaking of those other measures, what precautions should people consider as coronavirus cases are rising once again?



Wen: If you are able to get the updated Covid-19 vaccine, you should do so. If you are especially vulnerable to severe disease, try to avoid crowded indoor settings. If you must be in these settings though, consider wearing a well-fitting N95 mask or an equivalent. Finally, anyone experiencing respiratory symptoms should stay home to reduce the chance of spreading not only the coronavirus but also other respiratory viruses.

President Donald Trump has approved federal disaster aid for six states and tribes following storms and floods that occurred this spring and summer.

The disaster declarations, announced Thursday, will allow federal funding to flow to Kansas, North Carolina, North Dakota and Wisconsin, and for tribes in Montana and South Dakota. In each case except Wisconsin, it took Trump more than a month to approve the aid requests from local officials, continuing a trend of longer waits for disaster relief noted by a recent Associated Press analysis.

Trump has now approved more than 30 major natural disaster declarations since taking office in January. Before the latest batch, his approvals had averaged a 34-day wait from the time the relief was requested. For his most recent declarations, that wait ranged from just 15 days following an aid request for Wisconsin flooding in August to 56 days following a tribal request for Montana flooding that occurred in May.

The AP's analysis showed that delays in approving federal disaster aid have grown over time, regardless of the party in power. On average, it took less than two weeks for requests for a presidential disaster declaration to be granted in the 1990s and early 2000s. That rose to about three weeks during the past decade under presidents from both major parties. During Trump's first term in office, it took him an average of 24 days to approve requests.

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told the AP that Trump is providing “a more thorough review of disaster declaration requests than any Administration has before him” to make sure that federal tax dollars are spent wisely.




But delays mean individuals must wait to receive federal aid for daily living expenses, temporary lodging and home repairs. Delays in disaster declarations also can hamper recovery efforts by local officials uncertain whether they will receive federal reimbursement for cleaning up debris and rebuilding infrastructure.

Trump's latest declarations approved public assistance for local governments and nonprofits in all cases except Wisconsin, where assistance for individuals was approved. But that doesn't preclude the federal government from later also approving public assistance for Wisconsin.

Preliminary estimates from Democratic Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers' administration said more than 1,500 residential structures were destroyed or suffered major damage in August flooding at a cost of more than $33 million. There was also more than $43 million in public sector damage over six counties, according to the Evers administration.

Evers requested aid for residents in six counties, but Trump approved it only for three.

“I will continue to urge the Trump Administration to approve the remainder of my request, and I will keep fighting to make sure Wisconsin receives every resource that is needed and available,” Evers said in a statement in which he thanked Democratic officeholders for their efforts, but not Trump or any Republicans.

Trump had announced several of the disaster declarations — including Wisconsin's — on his social media site while noting his victories in those states and highlighting their Republican officials. He received thanks from Democratic North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein and Republican officials elsewhere. 

Trump's approval of six major disaster declarations in one day would have been unusual for some presidents but not for him. Trump approved seven disaster requests on July 22 and nine on May 21.

But Trump has not approved requests for hazard mitigation assistance — a once-typical add-on that helps recipients build back with resilience — since February.

President Donald Trump said Friday he'll send the National Guard to Memphis to address crime concerns there with the support of the mayor and the governor.

Since sending the National Guard to Los Angeles and Washington, the Republican president has openly mused about sending troops to other cities, claiming they are needed to crack down on crime.

Other news we're following: 








President Trump said he decided to send troops into Memphis after Union Pacific's CEO Jim Vena, who used to regularly visit the city when he served on the board of FedEx, urged him earlier this week to address crime in the city.

Vena was in the Oval Office to pitch the benefits of Union Pacific's proposed $85 billion acquisition of Norfolk Southern, but Trump said he asked Vena's advice about where the administration should go next to “straighten out crime in the cities.” He said Vena told him Memphis would be good because FedEx wouldn't even let him walk one block in the city to his hotel and insisted he take an armored vehicle.

The railroad said that Vena focused in the meeting on the potential benefits of creating the first coast-to-coast railroad that would speed up cargo delivery. But Union Pacific said Vena and Trump “also addressed the safety and security of all Americans, and that we regularly collaborate with communities to keep our employees and customers' cargo safe.”

Trump said in the interview on Fox News that Vena also recommended that he address crime in St. Louis and Chicago.

President Donald Trump's administration must update its immigration website to reflect that 600,000 Venezuelans with temporary protected status are allowed to live and work in the U.S. after last week's court win, a judge ordered.

U.S. District Judge Edward Chen issued the order late Thursday for the administration to update its U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website after plaintiffs' lawyers said temporary protected status holders were still in detention centers or unable to return to work even after his Sept. 5 judgment in favor of plaintiffs.

Chen said on Thursday his Sept. 5 order in favor of TPS holders went into effect immediately.

The government is appealing Chen's order that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had unlawfully canceled temporary protected status, or TPS, extensions granted by President Joe Biden's Democratic administration for 1.1 million Venezuelans and Haitians.

Bessent will travel to Madrid this weekend for negotiations with his Chinese counterparts over tariffs and national security issues related to the ownership of social media platform TikTok.

Bessent is slated to meet Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Madrid to discuss national security and economic issues, a Treasury news release states.

This will be the fourth round of discussions between U.S. and Chinese counterparts after meetings in London, Geneva and Stockholm. The two governments have agreed to several 90-day pauses on a series of increasing reciprocal tariffs, staving off an all-out trade war.

During the last round of discussions in Stockholm, Bessent described his talks with the Chinese as “very fulsome.”

“We just need to de-risk with certain, strategic industries, whether it's the rare earths, semiconductors, medicines, and we talked about what we could do together to get into balance within the relationship,” Bessent said at the time.

President Trump has approved federal disaster aid for six states and tribes following storms and floods this spring and summer.

The disaster declarations, announced Thursday, will provide federal funding to Kansas, North Carolina, North Dakota, and Wisconsin, as well as tribes in Montana and South Dakota.

In most cases, it took Trump more than a month to approve the aid requests, continuing a trend of longer waits for disaster relief.

An Associated Press analysis shows delays in approving federal disaster aid have grown over time. The White House says Trump is providing a more thorough review of requests.

Karine Jean-Pierre took no questions as she entered the House complex for a closed door interview.

Jean-Pierre served as former President Joe Biden's top spokesperson in the latter half of his term. She consistently defended his mental awareness while in office.

House Republicans are investigating whether there was a “coverup” of Biden's mental state while in office.

Vance is thanking Utah officials and the FBI for their efforts to track down a suspect in Charlie Kirk's killing.

“This is a big breakthrough, and everyone who helped — from the law enforcement professionals to the people giving tips — deserves our credit and gratitude,” he wrote on X.

“We took a big step this morning in getting justice for Charlie, and for his family,” he added. “Thanks be to God for that.”

President Trump's push to revitalize American manufacturing by luring foreign investment into the U.S. has run smack into one of his other priorities: cracking down on illegal immigration.

Hardly a week after immigration authorities raided a sprawling Hyundai battery plant in Georgia, detained more than 300 South Korean workers and showed video of some of them shackled in chains, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung warned the country's other companies may be reluctant to take up Trump's invitation to pour money into the United States.

The detained South Koreans were released Thursday and most were flown home.

If the U.S. can't promptly issue visas to the technicians and other skilled workers needed to launch plants, then “establishing a local factory in the United States will either come with severe disadvantages or become very difficult for our companies,” Lee said Thursday. “They will wonder whether they should even do it.”

Trump was speaking about the fatal stabbing of a Ukrainian refugee on a commuter train in Charlotte, North Carolina, allegedly by a man with a lengthy criminal history.

“They should have a trial the following day,” Trump said on Fox News Channel. “The whole thing is on tape.”

He said China, which is not a democracy, and some other countries have “quick trials.”

The president seemed to lament that it could take years for the case to work through the legal system. He also spoke about the cost of incarcerating and caring for the suspect.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio will visit Israel next week in a show of support for the country ahead of an expected contentious U.N. meeting on the creation of a Palestinian state.

Despite tensions between President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, notably over Israel's attack on Hamas leaders in Qatar, Rubio will arrive in Israel on Sunday for a two-day visit and is expected to travel to a controversial archeological site in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians claim for the capital of an eventual state.

The State Department said Friday that Rubio would “convey America's priorities in the Israel-Hamas conflict and broader issues concerning Middle Eastern security, reaffirming the U.S. commitment to Israeli security” with an emphasis on the Trump administration's commitment “to fight anti-Israel actions including unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state.”

His trip comes as efforts to broker a hostage release and ceasefire deal to end the Israeli-Hamas conflict in Gaza have stalled and Israel has moved ahead with plans to occupy Gaza City.

The president said “we're going to look into” the prominent liberal donor, suggesting his funds support rioting.

RICO, which refers to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, is usually used for organized crime.

Soros' group, Open Society Foundations, has rejected these allegations before.

“We do not pay people to protest or directly train or coordinate protestors,” it said in August.

Near the end of his Fox interview, Trump said he'd been holding a meeting about building a new White House ballroom when his aides interrupted.

“They came in and they said, ‘Charlie Kirk is dead.' I didn't know what they meant. I said, ‘What do you mean, dead?'” Trump said.

“‘Charlie Kirk was shot.' And they thought it was dead because it was so horrific.”

Trump said he swiftly ended his meeting. “I just told these people, “Get out, you gotta go.”

The president once again treaded into the New York City mayoral race, saying he wanted to see a one-on-one race against Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani.

“I call him my little communist,” Trump said in the interview on “Fox and Friends.” He acknowledged Mamdani's strong chances of victory but mused that “maybe one-on-one, somebody could beat him.”

Mamdani is not a communist. He is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.

Trump noted that former Democratic governor Andrew Cuomo, now running as a Democrat, was leading the other non-Mamdani candidates in the race.

And while Trump is a Republican, he said Curtis Sliwa, the eclectic GOP candidate in the race, was “not exactly primetime.”

“He wants cats to be in Gracie Mansion,” Trump said.

He said that if former Presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln “came back from the dead and they wanted to go into the administration,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer wouldn't approve them.

Senate Republicans, who control the chamber, are considering changing the rules to make it easier to get certain nominations to a confirmation vote in batches, instead of one by one.

On the heels of a Thursday inflation report showing inflation increased to 2.9%, Trump is saying high prices aren't a problem and that the biggest risk to the economy would be a Supreme Court ruling that his emergency tariffs are illegal.

“I've already solved inflation,” Trump said on “Fox & Friends” as he continued to verbally attack Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting the central bank's benchmark interest rates.

Trump declared an emergency under a 1977 law to impose tariffs and courts have said he exceeded his legal authority by doing so, putting before the Supreme Court what Trump called “one of the most important cases in the history of our country.”

Trump said he didn't want to discuss the consequences of losing the case, saying, “What we did is right. The president has the power to impose tariffs.”

He said Republicans will likely put together a continuing resolution to keep funding the federal government.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told the AP he was willing to risk a shutdown to protect some healthcare programs.

Trump said it was no use working with Democrats “if you gave them every dream, they would not vote for it.”

Instead, he said, “we will get it through because the Republicans are sticking together.”

“It's running out and running out fast,” Trump said.

However, Trump said, “it does take two to tango,” suggesting that it's been hard to get Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the same page for ending the war in Ukraine.

When Fox hosts indicated Putin was to blame for prolonging the conflict, Trump attributed the problem to “tremendous hatred between him and Zelenskyy.”

Trump said politics has always been a dangerous business and that being president is “the most dangerous career you can have.”

He named Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy and other presidents who were assassinated and said he went into politics aware of the danger.

Trump was the target of two assassination attempts last year.

“You have to go forward,” the president said when asked about appearances getting canceled after Kirk's assassination.

“I didn't want to remember Charlie that way,” Trump said in an interview on Fox News Channel's “Fox & Friends.”

Graphic video of the shooting in Utah has circulated widely online.

President Donald Trump said Friday “with a high degree of certainty” that the suspect in the Charlie Kirk killing has been caught. Federal investigators and state officials on Thursday had released photos and a video of the person they believe is responsible.

The suspect in the Charlie Kirk assassination has been captured, President Trump said Friday in an announcement that appeared to represent a significant breakthrough in an investigation that captivated public attention and spanned nearly two days.

“With a high degree of certainty, we have him,” Trump announced in a live interview on Fox News Chanel on Friday morning.

The FBI and Justice Department did not immediately comment, but a news conference in Utah, where the killing took place on a college campus Wednesday, planned a news conference for later in the morning.

The president said he's sending the National Guard into Memphis to combat crime.

Saying “Memphis is deeply troubled,” Trump said “we're going to fix that just like we did Washington.”

Speculation had centered on Chicago as Trump's next city to send in the National Guard and other federal authorities. But the administration has faced fierce resistance from Illinois J.B. Pritzker and other local authorities.

KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — Nepal ‘s president on Friday appointed former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki as interim prime minister and the first woman to head the Himalayan nation's government, following fiery protests that collapsed the previous administration. 

Karki, a popular figure when serving as the court's only female chief justice in 2016 and 2017, was sworn in by President Ram Chandra Poudel at the presidential residence in a small ceremony broadcast on state-run television. Politicians, officials and foreign diplomats invited at the ceremony congratulated her. 

Karki, 73, was known for her stand against corruption in the government while in office. Some lawmakers tried to impeach her in April 2017, accusing her of bias, but the move was unsuccessful and was criticized at the time as an attack on the judiciary. 

Street demonstrations starting Monday in Kathmandu over a social media ban turned violent, with protesters attacking government buildings and police opening fire. Though the ban was rescinded, the unrest continued over broader grievances, with tens of thousands of protesters attacking and burning the parliament, the presidential residence and businesses.

AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports Nepal's president has appointed a former chief justice as interim premier.

The violence prompted Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli to resign Tuesday and flee his official residence. Nepal's army took control of the capital Tuesday night, and started negotiations among the protesters, army and president over an interim government.

Violence over the past week left at least 51 people dead, police said Friday.

Many of the dead were protesters killed by police fire and some were inmates trying to break out of a jail in the capital, Kathmandu. Three police officers also were among the dead, police said. 




The military has enforced a curfew since late Tuesday, with residents given a few hours per day to leave their homes to buy food and supplies while soldiers guard the streets of Kathmandu. 

The demonstrations — called the protest of Gen Z — originally were sparked by the short-lived ban on platforms including Facebook, X and YouTube, which the government said had failed to register and submit to oversight. 

But they soon reflected broader discontent, with many young people angry about what they call “nepo kids” of political leaders who enjoy luxurious lifestyles while most youth struggle to find work.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The Republican governor of Tennessee said Friday he was working with the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops to Memphis as part of a new crime-fighting mission, hours after the president said the city was the latest target for his unprecedented military deployments.

Gov. Bill Lee said the plan will bring in the National Guard alongside the FBI, state troopers and local police, building on an FBI task force. Lee said he planned to speak with the president on Friday to work out details of the mission. 

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — President Donald Trump said Friday he'll send the National Guard to address crime concerns in Memphis with support from the mayor and Tennessee's governor, making it his latest expansion of military forces into American cities that has tested the limits of presidential power and drawn sharp criticism from local leaders.

Speaking on Fox News, Trump said “the mayor is happy” and “the governor is happy” about the pending deployment. The city is “deeply troubled,” he said, adding, “we're going to fix that just like we did Washington,” where he's sent the National Guard and surged federal law enforcement.

Memphis is a majority-Black city and has a Democratic mayor. Tennessee's governor is a Republican. Both officials' offices did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday.







Since sending the National Guard to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., Trump has openly mused about sending troops to some of the nation's most Democratic cities — including Chicago and Baltimore — even as data shows most violent crime in those places and around the country has declined in recent years.

President Trump says he's looking at western Tennessee for his next anti-crime deployment. The AP's Jennifer King reports.

Trump has also suggested he could send troops to New Orleans, another Democratic-run city in a Republican-leaning state.

The president's announcement came just days after Memphis police reported decreases across all major crime categories in the first eight months of 2025 compared to the same period in previous years. Overall crime hit a 25-year-low, while murder hit a six-year low, police said.

Asked Friday if city and state officials had requested a National Guard deployment -- or had formally signed off on it -- the White House didn't answer. It also didn't offer a possible timeline or say whether federal law enforcement would be surged in connection with a guard deployment to Memphis, as happened when troops were deployed to Washington.

Trump said Friday that he “would have preferred going to Chicago,” where local politicians have fiercely resisted his plans, but suggested the city was too “hostile” with “professional agitators.”

Republican state Sen. Brent Taylor, who backs the Memphis troop deployment, said Friday the National Guard could provide “administrative and logistical support” to law enforcement and allow local officers to focus on policework. Republican U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn also voiced her approval.

The Democratic mayor of Shelby County, which includes the city of Memphis, criticized Trump's proposal. “Mr. President, no one here is ‘happy,'” said Mayor Lee Harris. “Not happy at all with occupation, armored vehicles, semi-automatic weapons, and military personnel in fatigues.”

Republican Gov. Bill Lee said Wednesday that an ongoing FBI operation alongside state and local law enforcement had already made “hundreds of arrests targeting the most violent offenders.” He also said there are record levels of Tennessee Highway Patrol troopers in Shelby County, including a newly announced additional 50 troopers.

“We are actively discussing the next phase of our strategy to accelerate the positive momentum that's already underway, and nothing is off the table,” Lee said in the statement. 

On Thursday, Memphis Mayor Paul Young said he learned earlier this week that the governor and Trump were considering the deployment in Memphis.

“I am committed to working to ensure any efforts strengthen our community and build on our progress,” Young's statement said. What the city needs most, he said, is money for intervention and crime prevention, as well as more officers on patrol and support for bolstering the police department's investigations.

Some Republicans, including Taylor, the state senator, have asked the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation to audit the Memphis Police Department's crime reporting.

Trump first deployed troops to Los Angeles in early June over Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom's objections by putting the California National Guard under federal jurisdiction, known as Title 10, to protect federal property from protests over immigration raids. The guard later helped protect officers during immigration arrests.

Alongside 4,000 guard members, 700 active duty Marines were also sent, and California sued over the intervention. 

In Washington, D.C., where the president directly commands the National Guard, Trump has used troops for everything from armed patrols to trash cleanup without any legal issues.

Trump's comments underscored his shift away from threats to send troops into Chicago. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson, both Democrats, vowed legal action to block any such move. 

Pritzker, a potential 2028 presidential contender, has said a federal intervention is not justified or wanted in Chicago. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi this week accused state leaders of being uncooperative.

“We want Chicago to ask us for the help and they're not going to do that,” she told reporters after an unrelated event near Chicago where federal agents seized vaping products.

Even without National Guard troops, residents in Chicago are expecting more federal immigration enforcement. The Department of Homeland Security launched a new operation this week, with federal officials confirming 13 people with prior criminal arrests had been detained. However, it's still unclear what role that operation would play more broadly.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer weathered backlash from Democrats earlier this year when he voted with Republicans to keep the government open. But he's now willing to risk a shutdown at the end of the month if Republicans don't accede to Democratic demands.

Schumer says he and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries are united in opposing any legislation that doesn't include key health care provisions and a commitment not to roll them back. He argues that the country is in a different place than it was in March, when he vigorously argued against a shutdown, and he says he believes Republicans and President Donald Trump will be held responsible if they don't negotiate a bipartisan deal. 

“Things have changed” since the March vote, Schumer said in an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday. He said Republicans have since passed Trump's massive tax breaks and spending cuts legislation, which trimmed Medicaid and other government programs, and Democrats are now unified — unlike in March, when he voted with Republicans and Jeffries voted against the legislation to fund the government.

A shutdown, Schumer said, wouldn't necessarily worsen an environment in which Trump is already challenging the authority of Congress. “It will get worse with or without it, because Trump is lawless,” Schumer said.




Schumer's threat comes as Republicans are considering a short-term stopgap spending measure to avoid a Sept. 30 shutdown and as Democrats face what most see as two tough choices if the parties can't negotiate a deal — vote with Republicans to keep the government open or let it close indefinitely with no clear exit plan. 

It also comes amid worsening partisan tensions in the Senate, where negotiations between the two parties over the confirmation process broke down for a second time on Thursday and Republicans are changing Senate rules to get around Democratic objections to almost all of Trump's nominees. Democrats are also fuming over the Trump administration's decision to unilaterally claw back $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid just as negotiations over the spending deadline were getting underway in late August.

Republicans say that Democrats clearly will be to blame if they don't vote to keep the government open. 

Trump said Friday to not “even bother” negotiating with Democrats. He said Republicans will likely put together a continuing resolution to keep funding the federal government.

“If you gave them every dream, they would not vote for it,” Trump said, adding “we will get it through because the Republicans are sticking together.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said in an interview with Punchbowl News on Thursday that he believes Democrats see it as “politically advantageous” to have a shutdown.

“But they don't have a good reason to do it,” Thune said in the interview. “And I don't intend to give them a good reason to do it.”

Thune has repeatedly said that Schumer needs to approach Republicans with a specific proposal on health care, including an extension of expanded government tax credits for many Americans who get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Some Republicans are open to extending those credits before they expire at the end of the year, but Thune has indicated that he is unlikely to add an extension to a short-term spending bill, instead favoring a “clean” stopgap for several weeks without any divisive issues while Congress finishes its budget legislation. 

Schumer said he believes his caucus is ready to oppose the stopgap measure if Republicans don't negotiate it with Democrats. “I think the overwhelming majority of our caucus, with a few exceptions, and same with the House, would vote against that,” he said.

Less realistic is Democrats' demand that Republicans roll back Medicaid cuts enacted in their tax breaks and spending cuts legislation this summer, what Trump called his “big, beautiful bill.” 

Schumer said Democrats also want Republicans to commit that the White House won't take back money they have negotiated and Congress has approved after Republicans pushed through a $9 billion cut requested by the White House in July and Trump blocked the additional foreign aid money in August. “How do you pass an appropriations bill and let them undo it down the road?” Schumer said.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)



Congress is facing the funding deadline Sept. 30 because Republicans and Democrats are still working out their differences on several annual budget bills. Intractable partisan differences on an increasing number of issues have stalled those individual bills in recent years, forcing lawmakers to pass one large omnibus package at the end of the year or simply vote to continue current spending. 

A shutdown means federal agencies will stop all actions deemed non-essential, and millions of federal employees, including members of the military, won't receive paychecks. The most recent shutdown — and the longest ever — was during Trump's first term in 2018 and into 2019, when he demanded money for his U.S.-Mexico border wall. It lasted 35 days.

Schumer's move to support the spending legislation in March put him in the rare position of bucking his party's base. He said then that of two bad options, a partial government shutdown was worse because it would give Trump even more control to lay off workers and there would be “no off-ramp” to get out of it. “I think people realize it's a tough choice,” he said.

He faced massive backlash from within the party after the vote, with some activists calling on him to resign. Jeffries temporarily distanced himself from his New York colleague, saying in a statement immediately after Schumer's vote that House Democrats “will not be complicit.” The majority of Senate Democrats also voted against the GOP spending legislation. 

This time, though, Schumer is in lockstep with Jeffries and in messaging within his caucus. In Democrats' closed-door lunch Wednesday, he shared polling that he said suggested most Americans would blame Trump, not Democrats, for a shutdown. 

“I did what I thought was right” in March, Schumer said. “It's a different situation now than then.”

Utah County Sheriff Mike Smith, FBI Director Kash Patel and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox provide details on the 'taxing' investigation and efforts to identify and locate the suspected assassin accused of killing Charlie Kirk.

WASHINGTON, Utah – Tyler Robinson, 22, has been identified as the suspect in Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk's assassination on a Utah college campus.

""We got him on the evening of Sept. 11,"" Utah Gov. Spencer Cox announced in a Friday morning news briefing. 

""A family member of Tyler Robinson reached out to a family friend who contacted the Washington County Sheriff's Office with information that Robinson had confessed to them or implied that he had committed the incident.""

Since-deleted Facebook posts, viewed by Fox News Digital, paint a picture of Robinson's life in Washington County, Utah, filled with family milestones, birthdays and school achievements.

Steven Dunham, director of communications for the Washington County School District, confirmed to Fox News Digital that Robinson was a student in the district from 2008 to May 2021, attending Pine View Middle School and Pine View High School.

By 2021, Robinson was shown moving into Utah State University (USU), with photos outside the Richard and Moonyeen Anderson Engineering Building.

In a statement to Fox News from USU, the public university said: ""Utah State University confirms that Tyler Robinson, the suspect arrested in the killing of Charlie Kirk, briefly attended Utah State University for one semester in 2021.""

""We can also confirm that he was a pre-engineering major and took classes consistent with that major for his one semester,"" the school added.

At a news conference, Cox outlined the timeline leading to Robinson's arrest.

The information was passed to the Utah County Sheriff's Office, investigators at Utah Valley University (UVU) and the FBI.

Investigators said surveillance video showed Robinson arriving at UVU in a gray Dodge Challenger around 8:29 a.m. on Sept. 10, shortly before the shooting. A family member later confirmed to authorities that Robinson owned a vehicle matching that description.

""He is observed on video in a plain maroon T-shirt, light colored shorts, a black hat with a white logo and light colored shoes,"" Cox said.

Fox News Digital captured a gray Dodge Challenger parked in the driveway of Robinson's family home in Washington, Utah.

Family members told investigators Robinson had ""become more political in recent years.""

""The family member referenced a recent incident in which Robinson came to dinner prior to Sept. 10,"" Cox said. ""In that conversation, Robinson mentioned Charlie Kirk was coming to UVU. They talked about why they didn't like him and the viewpoints that he had.""

Investigators also spoke with Robinson's roommate.

""Investigators interviewed that roommate who stated that his roommate, referring to Robinson, made a joke on Discord,"" Cox explained. ""The content of these messages included… a need to retrieve a rifle from a drop point… messages related to visually watching the area where a rifle was left… engraving bullets… and a message referring to having left the rifle wrapped in a towel.""

The investigation led to the recovery of a rifle north of UVU's Campus Drive Road, where authorities found a rifle wrapped in a ""dark-colored towel.""

""The rifle was determined to be a Mauser Model 98 .30-06 caliber bolt action rifle,"" Cox said. ""The rifle had a scope mounted on top of it. Investigators noted inscriptions that had been engraved on casings found with the rifle.""

Cox credited law enforcement and the public with swiftly closing in on Robinson.

""We are indebted to law enforcement across the state,"" he said. ""We're grateful for everyone who worked together in such a short amount of time to find this person and to bring justice.""

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox provides details on the arrest of Tyler Robinson, who reportedly 'confessed' or 'implied' to a family member that he had commited the assassination of Charlie Kirk.

The rifle that federal investigators believe was used in the shooting that killed conservative activist Charlie Kirk contained ammunition inscribed with anti-fascist messaging, shedding light on the suspect's motive.

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox confirmed the messaging at a news conference Friday, saying investigators discovered inscriptions on casings found with a bolt-action rifle near the Utah Valley University campus, where Kirk was killed during an event.

One used casing and three unused casings contained the writings, Cox said.

News of the ammunition inscriptions was first shared on social media Thursday morning in a preliminary bulletin attributed to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

According to the bulletin, circulated on X by political commentator Steven Crowder, federal officials recovered a .30-06 caliber Mauser rifle in the woods that contained ""engravings,"" including messaging expressing anti-fascist ideology and other messages.

Fox News Digital confirmed the veracity of the ATF bulletin through talking to multiple sources, but the sources stressed on Thursday that the information was preliminary.

The information about the firearm surfaced nearly 24 hours after Kirk, 31, was shot and killed during a speaking engagement in Utah. Both his graphic death and the scant public information revealed in the early hours of the investigation into his killing left the nation reeling and revived heated debate about political violence in the U.S.

Law enforcement officials worked frantically in the aftermath of Kirk's death to track down and arrest the gunman, who they announced Friday was Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old Utah man.

Cox on Friday called the shooting a ""political assassination.""

""This is certainly about the tragic death, assassination, political assassination of Charlie Kirk, but it is also much bigger than an attack on an individual,"" Cox said. ""It is an attack on all of us. It is an attack on the American experiment.""

FBI Director Kash Patel laid out the timeline of the investigation Friday, saying it took the FBI and Utah law enforcement 33 hours to make an arrest. Patel said authorities made ""historic progress"" in such a short duration of time.

The FBI's Salt Lake City Field Office released an image Thursday of a man they had said was a ""person of interest"" in Kirk's death and asked the public for help identifying him. The bureau also announced it was offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to his capture. Cox said a tip from a family friend of Robinson's led to his arrest.

Gaines, the host of OutKick's ""Gaines for Girls"" podcast, mourned Charlie Kirk in an emotional video Thursday after the conservative activist was assassinated during a campus event in Utah.

Riley Gaines mourned the assassination of Charlie Kirk, who she called ""a friend and mentor,"" in a lengthy, emotional video in which she condemned the act of political violence against the popular conservative activist. 

Gaines, the host of OutKick's ""Gaines for Girls"" podcast and a 12-time NCAA All-American swimmer, shared her thoughts in a video posted by OutKick Thursday. The video came after the killing of Kirk, who was fatally struck by a single bullet during a speaking event on the campus of Utah Valley University on Wednesday.

""I've lost a friend, a mentor, the person I go to,"" Gaines began. ""The intellectual mind and genius that is Charlie Kirk, the generational talent, I truthfully believe that his impact alone as one person and what he's been able to do through Turning Point, which I'm a very very proud contributor of, I talk about it on this show all the time, what he's been able to do is transform a nation, revive a culture. A culture of young people, people just like me.""

Gaines, who sat alongside Kirk for the ""American Comeback Tour"" event at San Francisco State University in May, mourned for Kirk's wife and two young children. 

""I lost a friend and a mentor, Erika lost her husband, I can't help but think about her. This is one of the most kind and compassionate women you can possibly imagine. This was her greatest fear, I mean we had talked about it. This is her greatest fear, I won't go into the details there, two children lost their father. They will be haunted forever by the videos that can't be scrubbed from social media.""

TIMELINE OF CHARLIE KIRK ASSASSINATION

""This nation has lost the best and most effective, most influential activist it's ever had and I'm not even just talking about a conservative activist. I'm talking about on both sides,"" she said, later adding, ""We don't have to live like this. We shouldn't have to live like this, in fear of speaking the truth – raw and unfiltered."" 

Gaines said that despite the tragedy of Kirk's killing, her shared faith values with Kirk have kept her ""grounded."" 

""I'm so grateful, that's really like the thing keeping me is – any amount of grounded – is knowing that Charlie knew Jesus. Knowing that he was a man who fought for the hope and the promise of eternal life, nothing of this world mattered to Charlie. Of course he loved his family, of course he loved this nation, he loved the truth, but he was fighting for eternal life and so my message to everyone listening is this: Is to take up the cross, is to live a life like Charlie Kirk did, to live a Christ-like life.""

Gaines went on to commend Kirk for his willingness ""to go into the belly of the beast"" and speak out about the values he cared about. 

Police confirmed Friday that a suspect in Kirk's killing was arrested. He was identified as Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old Utah resident. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox stated that a family member of Robinson's contacted a family friend who then reached out to the Washington County Sheriff's Office ""with information that Robinson had confessed to them or implied that he had committed the incident.""

President Donald Trump discusses the importance of his crime initiative on 'Fox & Friends.'

Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., lauded President Donald Trump's announcement that the National Guard would come to Memphis, Tenn., to ""Make Memphis Safe Again."" 

""Today, President Trump answered my call to do whatever it takes to Make Memphis Safe Again, and I applaud his decision to send the National Guard to Memphis following his tremendous success in reducing violent crime in Washington, D.C.,"" Blackburn said in a statement to Fox News Digital. 

""Time and time again, President Trump has stepped in to restore law and order in blue cities that refuse to protect their own citizens, and I will continue working alongside the Trump administration to hold left-wing officials accountable for the consequences of soft-on-crime agendas,"" she continued.

Trump announced his plan to make Memphis, which the FBI reported had the highest crime rate in the country, the next stop in his plan to crack down on crime in major cities on ""Fox & Friends"" Friday morning.

When asked about violence and Chicago, a city the president has strongly considered bringing the National Guard to next, Trump pivoted and said, ""We're going to Memphis.""

""Memphis is — that's the next city — deeply troubled,"" he said. ""And the mayor is happy. He's a Democrat mayor. The mayor is happy, and the governor of Tennessee, the governor, is happy.""

""Deeply troubled,"" he said of the city. ""We're going to fix that, just like we did Washington."" 

Trump said that he ""would have preferred going to Chicago,"" but it was a conversation with a railroad executive that changed his mind, and attention, to Memphis. 

""I said, ‘So what do you think, where should we go next as the city, because we're going to do one, two, three, and then we'll do a few at a time, but we're going to straighten out the crime in these cities,'"" Trump said. ""And he said, ‘Sir, Memphis would be good.'"" 

He confirmed his intent to send the National Guard, and added, ""And anybody else we need, and by the way, we'll bring in the military too if we need it.""

Chicago had been in the administration's crosshairs for weeks following Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Washington, D.C., a move that came with his federalization of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) last month. 

But his tone on the city shifted earlier this week, when he told reporters, ""We're working it out with the governor of a certain state that would love us to be there, and the mayor of a certain city in that same state would love us to be there.""

Meanwhile, Trump's federalization of the District's police ended on Wednesday. Under the Home Rule Act, Trump was given a 30-day window to control the local police force but was required to get an extension from Congress to maintain his grip. 

That never came, nor did Trump's suggestion that he would skirt Congress by enacting a national emergency to maintain his control of the MPD. The National Guard presence in the city is expected to remain, however. 

Fox News reached out to Mayor Paul Young and Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee for comment but did not immediately hear back.

President Donald Trump announced the capture of a suspect accused of killing Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist, co-founder of Turning Point USA and friend of Vice President JD Vance.

Dozens of Republican House lawmakers, spearheaded by Florida Rep. Cory Mills, co-sponsored a resolution this week condemning political violence and honoring the life of Charlie Kirk following his assassination Wednesday in Utah. 

""Charlie Kirk was a fearless voice for conservative values, God's Word, and a well-known champion of free speech,"" Mills told Fox News Digital of the resolution Thursday. ""He was tragically taken from us in a heinous act of political violence on Sept. 10, 2025, at Utah Valley University. As someone who had the privilege of speaking with Charlie, conducting interviews with him, working alongside him, and addressing audiences at Turning Point USA events, I am saddened by this loss.""

Fifty-two House Republicans co-sponsored the House Resolution titled, ""Honoring Charlie Kirk following his assassination on September 10, 2025, in Orem, Utah,"" which simultaneously condemns the horrific deadly shooting of Kirk, while also honoring the Turning Point USA founder's legacy and reaffirms support for the First Amendment and protecting peaceful assembly. 

Kirk, 31, was shot and killed on Wednesday afternoon in Orem, Utah, while attending an event at Utah Valley University as part of TPUSA's ""American Comeback Tour."" Kirk was chatting with students while sitting under a tent on campus when a single shot rang out and struck him.

Kirk was a massive voice in the conservative movement, championing faith and family policies to youths, most notably on college campuses. He leaves behind his wife, and their two young children, ages 1 and 3. 

""This resolution condemns this horrific act, extends our deepest condolences to Charlie's family and loved ones, and honors the bravery of the security team, first responders, and healthcare professionals who acted swiftly,"" Mills told Fox News Digital of the resolution. 

""We reaffirm the sacred right of all Americans to peaceably assemble, as enshrined in the First Amendment, and stand united in defending a constitutional republic where no voice is silenced by violence or intimidation. Charlie's legacy will endure, we will continue to fight for the principles he held dear,"" he continued.

VIGILS HELD ACROSS US AFTER ASSASSINATION OF CHARLIE KIRK: 'WE MUST HEAL' 

The resolution specifically outlines five key points, including that the House: condemns ""in the strongest possible terms this horrific political assassination;"" extends ""heartfelt condolences to the family, friends, and loved ones of Charlie Kirk;"" recognizes ""the service of the security team, first responders, and the healthcare professionals who jumped into action;"" reaffirms the First Amendment and ""the right of the people peaceably to assemble.""

It concludes that the House ""stands firm in its belief in a democracy in which all can participate and in which intimidation and threats of violence cannot silence the voice of any American.""

A suspect in the case was apprehended and in custody as of Friday morning, President Donald Trump announced during an appearance on ""Fox & Friends.""

""I think with a high-degree of certainty, we have him,"" Trump said on Friday morning. He added that, ""essentially, someone who knew him turned him in.""

""Somebody that was very close to him said, ‘hmm, that's him.' And essentially went to the father, went to a U.S. marshal who was fantastic, by the way, and the person was involved with law enforcement, but was a person of faith, a minister, and brought him to a U.S. Marshal who was fantastic and the father convinced the son, this is it,"" Trump said.

Trump said he hopes the suspect gets the death penalty if found guilty.

Mills added in a comment to Fox News Digital that Kirk did ""so much for our country, with a very unique understanding of America's youth, not only inspiring them but mobilizing them to turn the tide for our nation's future.""

""His tireless efforts to make America great were undeniable,"" he said.

President Donald Trump announced on Friday morning that the suspect in Charlie Kirk‘s murder has been captured. 

“I think with a high degree of certainty, we have him in custody,” Trump told the audience during an appearance on Fox & Friends.

“Everyone did a great job. We worked with the local police, the governor. Everybody did a great job,” Trump added.

The suspect was turned in by those close to him, possibly a minister, Trump added.

“We have the person that we think is the person we're looking for, but they drove into police headquarters and he's there,” Trump said. 

Trump was asked whether the gunman's father was aware of his son's killing of the Turning Point USA founder, but the president declined to answer the question.

“I don't know. I'm going to let you get all those questions later,” Trump answered. “The bottom line is they have somebody that they think did it.” 

Law enforcement is expected to provide an update on the manhunt at 9 a.m. on Friday. 

The president praised Attorney General Pam Bondi's efforts in handling the case during his appearance on Fox & Friends. 

“Pam Bondi is incredible, by the way,” Trump said. “People don't know what a star she is. She's incredible. And it all worked out.” 

The unidentified gunman shot the 31-year-old Kirk while he was speaking at the Utah Valley University campus on Wednesday. The FBI released a photo on Thursday of a “person of interest” and offered a $100,000 award.

PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE WILL ATTEND CHARLIE KIRK'S FUNERAL

Trump appeared to support convicting the suspect of murdering Kirk. 

“I hope he's going to be found guilty, I would imagine, and I hope he gets the death penalty,” the president said.

Authorities identified Tyler Robinson as Charlie Kirk‘s alleged assassin and charged him with murder, which carries the possibility of the death penalty. his arrest Thursday evening after a 33-hour manhunt.

“Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We got him,” Gov. Spencer Cox (R-UT) said Friday morning following a 33-hour manhunt. Robinson was arrested at 10 p.m. local time.

The charges, announced Friday afternoon, include aggravated murder, felony discharge of a weapon causing serious bodily injury, and obstruction of justice, according to the Associated Press. Official release of the charges is expected next week.

Robinson did not have a criminal history.

Cox said a family member told law enforcement that Robinson either confessed or implied that he assassinated Kirk.

Authorities said Robinson had become increasingly political in recent months. At one point, he argued with family members about Kirk at the dinner table, saying he was “full of hate and spreading hate.” Robinson also mentioned Kirk was coming to Utah Valley University and objected to his presence on campus.

Cox confirmed that Robinson engraved the bullet casings with antifascist messages, including “Hey fascist! Catch!” and “Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao,” the lyrics of a famous Italian antifascist song. Cox also described what appeared to be the three-arrow symbol, an antifascist sign made famous during street fights in Weimar Germany.

The fired casings also referenced a nearly decade-old sexual meme, saying, “Notices bulge, OWO, what's this?” The last case was an example of similar trolling: “If you read this, you are gay LMAO.”

Authorities confirmed that Robinson's roommate also assisted law enforcement by showing investigators Discord messages that included him and Robinson. These messages outlined what he did with the rifle used to murder Kirk.

The messages discussed “stating a need to retrieve a rifle from a drop, leaving the rifle in a bush, messages related to a to visually watching the area where a rifle was left, and a message referring to having left the rifle wrapped in a towel,” Cox said. 

Cox said authorities don't have “any information that would lead to any additional arrests,” but the investigation is ongoing.

Robinson was not a student at UVU. Cox also said he gave no indication of having a mental illness.

Robinson was booked at the Utah County Jail. He was a longtime resident of Washington County, Utah, roughly 250 miles away from the UVU campus.

FBI Director Kash Patel praised the public's assistance in narrowing the search. There were 7,000 leads sent to law enforcement Thursday evening. After they released additional footage of the suspect, 4,000 more leads were sent in.

Cox said he “absolutely” believes the assassination is a “watershed” moment in American history, drawing parallels with the political violence of the late 1960s.

“The question is, what kind of watershed and that that chapter remains to be written. Is this the end of a dark chapter in our history or the beginning of a darker chapter in our history?” he asked.

Kirk, the founder and CEO of Turning Point USA, was shot in the neck and killed while speaking at an event at UVU. Authorities said Robinson allegedly sniped Kirk from a position on top of the Sorensen Student Center, several hundred feet away from him, and then made a hasty retreat into a nearby neighborhood.

On Thursday, police recovered the murder weapon: a high-powered, bolt-action rifle. The weapon was left in a wooded area, which has since been swept and secured. Authorities had another breakthrough the same day when they obtained photo and video footage of the alleged shooter. They released it to the public for help in the case.

President Donald Trump broke the news of the shooter's arrest in an appearance on Fox News on Friday morning.

“I think, with a high degree of certainty, we have him in custody. Everyone did a great job,” Trump said.

SUSPECT IN CHARLIE KIRK ASSASSINATION IS IN CUSTODY: TRUMP

The FBI and Utah Department of Public Safety co-led the manhunt “in unison with the Utah County Attorney's Office, the Utah County Sheriff's Office, and the local police departments,” according to a statement from the Utah DPS.

The assassination is one of the most high-profile political killings in modern U.S. history. The shooting and subsequent fallout have drawn international attention and condemnation from leaders around the world. The incident has also sparked comments from nearly all Democratic and Republican lawmakers, though some Democrats focused on openly bashing Kirk or Trump's rhetoric in the aftermath.

What is the greatest threat to American democracy? Easy: hyperpartisanship. Seeing your opponents as enemies. Defining corruption as “holding opinions I dislike”.

All these things were on hideous display in the aftermath of the murder of Charlie Kirk. At the time of writing, it is not clear who pulled the trigger or why, so let me start somewhere else, with the removal of Britain's slippery and sybaritic ambassador to Washington, Peter Mandelson.

Lord Mandelson was fired following the leak of a string of obsequious messages to Jeffrey Epstein, many of them gathered in a scrapbook of birthday greetings. Yes, that scrapbook. No one disputes the authenticity of the Mandelson messages, yet we're supposed to believe that similar messages from President Donald Trump were forged.

I am trying to imagine the scene when the pederast tycoon's personal assistant presented him with the collection.

“Look, sir, I've got a great compilation of birthday greetings for you.”

“Great, make sure I write to thank them all.”

“Yeah, but not Trump, his is a fake.”

Anything is possible, I suppose. Still, it is strikingly hard to find anyone who has complained about both Mandelson and Trump, despite the allegations against the two men being pretty much identical. Sure, Trump might argue that he ended the relationship earlier than Mandelson. Equally, Mandelson, who is gay, might argue that he at least is above suspicion when it comes to Epstein's worst crimes. Yet the fact remains that we have seen similar messages to the same convicted abuser in the same scrapbook, and it seems to be a problem only for one of them.

Tribalism comes to us naturally. We are programmed to excuse from our side what we condemn in the other. Yet the rule of law and representative government depend on our being able to resist that programming. In our very online age, resisting it is hard. Which brings us to the horrible murder of a young man who held no public office and was simply touring the country, inviting people to disagree with him.

As I reeled from the footage of Kirk's assassination, I noticed that the people posting simple messages of sympathy appeared to be vastly outnumbered by those scouring the internet for evidence of inappropriate reactions from the other side.

On the Left, there was some hideous victim-blaming. Perhaps now, the activists declared, these conservatives would understand why their violent rhetoric was so dangerous. Some listed shootings by Rightists. Others pointed, in a tone that stopped just short of sneering, to Kirk's own statement that homicides were a price worth paying for the Second Amendment.

On the Right, people actively sought out a handful of TikTok accounts in which young people celebrated, or at least were presented as celebrating, Kirk's murder. Those children were then presented as “the Left” and held up as what “we” have to “fight.” The fact that former Presidents Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and other public figures put out sober condolence statements was glossed over. Or, rather, it was missed altogether, because all American citizens with access to the internet were being fed by algorithms designed to make them mad.

Political assassinations are not new in the United States — Kirk had a point about the price to be paid for loose gun laws — but, until recently, it was taken for granted that everyone was uncomplicatedly against violence. No one felt the need to tack on disclaimers about how much they disagreed with the deceased. No one followed their condolences with a “but …”

Deaths change everything. We are wired to respond to any loss on our side, to treat it as martyrdom, to blame the murder not on a specific assassin, but on people we dislike more generally.

The Spanish Civil War was sparked by two assassinations. José Castillo, a leftist police officer, was shot by a fascist gang, and the following day, José Calvo Sotelo, a conservative politician, was murdered by socialist militiamen. By the time their funerals were held — clenched fists for Castillo, straight arms for Calvo Sotelo — the slide into armed conflict was inevitable.

WHEN DID ENGLAND GIVE UP ON FREE SPEECH?

Spain in the early 1930s had been marked by increasingly authoritarian attitudes. Both sides came to see elections as contingent, to be accepted only if their parties won. Each began to see the other as a menace. Rightists dismissed their opponents as godless, un-Spanish, in the pay of foreign communists. Leftists dismissed theirs as an oligarchic clique that stood against the people. In the face of such monstrous threats, who cared about election results?

And all this happened before the invention of media platforms designed explicitly to keep us angry and agitated. God help us.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Something profoundly important may, one hopes, have happened to America's understanding of itself when a sniper murdered Charlie Kirk on Sept. 10. This is despite our becoming sadly familiar with political violence, not least because of two assassination attempts against President Donald Trump last year.

Back then, Trump got up quickly from the ground after being hit, pumped his fist, and called on supporters to “fight.” So the attack in Butler, Pennsylvania, shocking though it was, did not have time to produce that sickening feeling of irremediable damage that comes with absolute loss. He and his movement grew stronger after the attack.

But after Kirk was felled, a different feeling of hollow dread settled heavily onto the national consciousness. This was partly due to the circumstances and their transformation. 

Kirk sat at the focus of an amphitheater of open space and surrounding buildings at Utah Valley University. Thousands of people came to see him, listen, and debate. The sun shone, and there was a festive atmosphere under the midday western sky as he threw MAGA hats into the crowd. In other words, and as others have noted, he was engaging in politics as a happy warrior, which is how decent people know it should be. He listened respectfully, tried to change minds, and encouraged people to think.

But the theater of democracy became, in an instant, a theater of execution. The stage on which Kirk sat under a tent was transformed into a scaffold, and the occasion became one of unmitigated horror. Instead of an irregular patter of several gunshots, to which we have become accustomed, there was the sharp snap of a single shot that instantly silenced Kirk's flow of words as he slumped back and to his left. It took some time before Trump announced Kirk's death, but that grim outcome was expected and hung like a sick foreboding over the nation, for the video left no doubt about the massive trauma that had been inflicted on the 31-year-old conservative activist.

Then came politicians' reactions. These were deeply telling and prompted me to believe something profound may have taken place in our political psyche. Most pols seemed to realize that the evil of what we'd all just seen allowed no room for “buts” or “ifs,” nor any statements other than those combining horror, shock, condemnation, and sadness. Responses from Democrats, who have tried to leverage previous shootings to score points against rivals on gun policy, were instead mostly restrained, dignified, and to the point.

Yes, internet freaks celebrated, but elected officials who need the respect, not the contempt, of the public mostly confined themselves to saying the violence was terrible and that they pray for Kirk, his wife, and their two children. 

ON FLAG BURNING, THE RIGHT IS WORKING FOR THE LEFT 

Kirk's organization, which he'd built into a huge conservative movement reaching 100 million people, mostly young, is called Turning Point USA. His death may have forced politicians who purport to be leaders to a turning point. It is fragile and may break down. But perhaps it will be a turning point toward traditional values and civilized restraint.

It is terrible that people are now murdered for seeking the truth and expressing their valid opinions. But if horrific events in Utah brought us to a turning point away from rhetoric dehumanizing opponents, away from calling conservatives fascists, and away from urging violence against them, Kirk will not have lived or died in vain.

President Donald Trump received an ovation from New York Yankees fans as he attended a game on the 24th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

Trump saluted as the crowd cheered him.

The Yankees played an integral part in the remembrance of 9/11. During the first game of the 2001 World Series, which was played at Yankee Stadium, former President George W. Bush delivered a renowned first pitch that riled up the stadium and created an iconic moment.

Trump stopped by to watch the Yankees game with the Detroit Tigers and greeted players such as Aaron Judge, who told Trump that it was nice to meet him. The president complimented him in kind.

“You have that much muscle, you have to hit the ball perfect,” Trump said to Judge. You're a fantastic player. … You're an unbelievable player.”

The Yankees said Trump was in attendance to honor first responders and others killed on 9/11.

“Tonight, we remember those we lost, the heroism of all who bravely sacrificed their own lives to save others, and those who died from illnesses obtained at Ground Zero,” the New York Yankees wrote on X.

“Their spirit lives on today with our First Responders and all who serve our communities and our country. The 45th and 47th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump was in attendance to honor the victims and first responders on the anniversary of September 11th, 2001,” the post added.

After Trump met with Judge, the slugger smashed two homers, a solo shot 413 feet to left field, and slapped another one later in the game for his 46th of the season.

The Yankees led 9-2 going into the bottom of the seventh inning, looking to capture a win over the Tigers with Trump watching.

The skill set required to succeed online may not always translate to effective law enforcement.

Updated at 10:17 a.m. ET on September 12, 2025

About four hours after the right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk was assassinated by an unknown shooter at Utah Valley University Wednesday, FBI Director Kash Patel posted a picture of himself with Kirk on his personal X account. The undated photo shows the two men grinning, apparently about to tape Kirk's daily livestream show; Patel wears a branded shirt with his own name on it, styled as K$H. Roughly five minutes later, Patel's official FBI account published another post on X, this time announcing the good news that the suspected shooter was already in custody. Then, an hour and a half later, that account posted again—alerting the public that the suspect “has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement.” A suspect is now in custody.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

Prominent MAGA-aligned influencers on X were not amused by the initial mistake. “Why is the @FBI speculating like everyone not in the know?” demanded Joe Biggs, a leader of the Proud Boys who was sentenced to 17 years in prison for his role in the January 6 attack on the Capitol. (President Donald Trump commuted his sentence.) “Stop all the click bait shit you keep doing,” he wrote.

Kyle Seraphin, a former FBI agent turned right-wing internet personality after losing his job at the bureau during the Biden administration, put it this way: “These two posts are the most embarrassing thing I have seen from a FBI Director.” X commenters demanded in droves that Patel work more quickly to find the shooter.

Typically, the FBI waits until it's certain before making announcements. It also doesn't normally provide quick successive updates midway through a sensitive investigation before abruptly backtracking. But, as the photo with Kirk suggests, Patel is not a typical FBI director. He posted his way into the job—moving from roles as a congressional staffer and national-security aide in the first Trump administration to a career as a pro-Trump influencer who sold MAGA children's books and called for purges at the FBI to “defeat the Deep State.” Now he's posting through it. After becoming director, according to a recent lawsuit filed by fired FBI officials, he put a twist on challenge coins—a common token in the national-security bureaucracy—by having an oversize coin made that read DIRECTOR KA$H PATEL. Patel's handling of the early stages of the Kirk investigation is a reminder that the skill set required to succeed as an influencer is not the same as what is required to effectively run the FBI. It's not just amateur hour at the FBI, but influencer hour.

Read: The man who will do anything for Trump

Kirk's horrifying murder is the latest escalation in a disturbing uptick in American political violence. In June, a shooter killed Minnesota State Senator Melissa Hortman and her husband and attempted to kill another lawmaker and his family as well. In April, an arsonist firebombed the home of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro after Shapiro's Passover seder. (No one was hurt.) These attacks followed the 2024 assassination attempt against Trump on the campaign trail. Judges, meanwhile, have expressed increasing concern about the rise in threats against them in recent years. This level of fear is poisonous to a democracy. It is in the best interests of everyone for Kirk's killer to be swiftly apprehended and brought to justice.

In this long chain of attacks, Kirk's murder seems to be the first to be fully refracted through the hall of mirrors that is today's influencer culture: Not just the victim, but also the victim's fans and allies, the president he built his career supporting, and now the people leading the agency investigating his death are or were people who cannot stop posting. Over the course of his decade-long career, Kirk himself helped write the playbook that many right-wing figures now use to thrive in a frenetic, adversarial media ecosystem. Almost immediately, graphic videos of his murder circulated on X and other social-media platforms. In one video, an influencer who had been attending Kirk's event films bystanders fleeing from the shooting while repeatedly shouting out his TikTok handle.

Shocking events without immediate explanations tend to generate collaborative, public efforts to sort through evidence and try to figure out what happened, a process that the academic Kate Starbird calls “collective sensemaking.” In Kirk's case, that online process spun into conspiracy theorizing nearly instantly. The identity and motivation of the shooter remain unknown, but MAGA influencers nevertheless rapidly adopted the consensus that the assassin had been aligned with the political left, an idea promoted by Trump as well. Others theorized baselessly, in an anti-Semitic twist typical of the far right, that perhaps Israel was responsible.

If the influencer's job is to baselessly theorize, creating content to feed the internet's gaping maw, then the job of federal law-enforcement agencies is to exercise restraint and provide reliable information about what is actually going on. When the FBI gets out ahead of itself, things often don't end well. Consider, for example, FBI Director James Comey's ill-fated 2016 announcement that he was choosing not to recommend charges against Hillary Clinton after the bureau's investigation into Clinton's email server, which helped spark a frenzy of speculation and dragged the FBI into exactly the political morass that Comey was seeking to avoid. After Patel posted that the initial suspect in Kirk's shooting had been released, one former FBI official texted me a photo of Richard Jewell, the Atlanta security guard who suffered from intense public scrutiny after leaks that the FBI suspected him of having planted pipe bombs during the 1996 Olympics. (Jewell was innocent.) The incident proved to be an enormous and lasting embarrassment for the bureau.

Patel's X posts were practically a model of what not to do. They created confusion among the public and potentially among law-enforcement officers as well—which could undercut the effectiveness of an urgent and fast-moving investigation. They could also risk undermining trust in the FBI's work. The next time Patel announces that someone is in custody, will people believe him? “Can't overstate the incompetence,” one federal law-enforcement officer told The Atlantic. “The guy is a click-bait chaser and that is no way to conduct comms in the initial chaotic phase of an incident.”

Theoretically, Patel could simply stop posting, keep his head down, and let the FBI do the important work of finding the killer. But he and his deputy, the conservative podcaster Dan Bongino, have built their reputations as right-wing firebrands, and they seem desperate to stay in MAGA's good graces. (Bongino, too, posted a photo of himself with Kirk, writing, “We will not rest.”) Both men found themselves struggling over the summer to convince influencers that Jeffrey Epstein really had killed himself, threatening their standing with the MAGA faithful, after having pushed conspiracy theories about Epstein's death before they entered the government. Just hours before Kirk's death, a group of fired FBI agents filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging that the two leaders—Patel and Bongino—had repeatedly made personnel decisions on the basis of angry social-media posts by MAGA influencers. One agent noted Bongino's “intense focus on increasing online engagement through his social media profiles”—which, the agent worried, could “risk outweighing more deliberate analyses of investigations.”

Yesterday, the right-wing podcaster Stephen Crowder posted what he claimed was an internal bulletin from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives reporting that law enforcement had found bullet casings engraved with “transgender and anti-fascist ideology”—in line with the theories promoted by other MAGA influencers. The Wall Street Journal reported the claim. Soon thereafter, The New York Times reported that the bulletin “had not been verified by ATF analysts” and “did not match other summaries of the evidence,” and the Journal later backtracked as well. Crowder's update wasn't helpful either to public understanding of the investigation or, likely, to the investigation itself, but it got clicks. It was, to paraphrase a meme from the 2016 election, “tremendous content.” The general public, meanwhile, still does not know what is true.

Patel has presided over a bureau that is strapped for resources and hemorrhaging expertise. According to a recent analysis by the Cato Institute, roughly one in five FBI agents has been shifted from their previous position to aiding ICE with immigration enforcement, a change that can't help but affect the FBI's ability to carry out other crucial work. It's far too early to say whether this shake-up will turn out to have degraded the bureau's ability to find Kirk's killer, or to have prevented the shooting from occurring in the first place. But the agency is not in fighting form.

This July, I spoke at length with Michael Feinberg, a former FBI agent (and a friend) who was pushed out of the bureau over his friendship with a critic of Trump. “We are in the cosplay era of the FBI,” he told me then. Now the cosplayers have found themselves at the head of an agency charged with solving a real crime. Yesterday afternoon, Patel and Bongino headed to Utah—according to The New York Times, with plans to “more directly oversee” the search for Kirk's killer. At a press conference later in the evening, Patel stood next to the podium as Utah Governor Spencer Cox gently suggested that onlookers remain wary of rumors on social media.

“We give them all A's, and they give us all fives.” 

At the close of the fall semester, professors across the country will grade their students. Based on recent trends, those grades will be higher than ever. Around the same time, students will hand grades right back to their professors in the form of teacher evaluations. Those grades, too, will likely be higher than ever.

These two facts are very much related. American colleges, especially the most selective ones, are confronting the dual problems of rampant grade inflation and declining rigor. At Harvard, as I wrote recently, the percentage of A grades has more than doubled over the past 40 years, but students are doing less work than they used to. Teacher evaluations are a big part of how higher education got to this point. The scores factor into academics' pay, hiring, and chance to get tenure. But maximizing teacher ratings is very different from providing quality instruction. In fact, those aims are largely opposed. Faculty are incentivized to lighten students' workloads and give them better grades, lest they be punished themselves. “To some extent, we are all afraid of our students,” one Harvard history professor told me.

Teacher evaluations were born from a reasonable idea: Professors should get feedback so they can improve their instruction. Academics, particularly at national universities, are hired primarily on the strength of their published research, not their teaching prowess. That means they don't get much direct coaching on how to be a better teacher. In the 1960s and '70s, students and some faculty were enthusiastic about introducing evaluations as a way to democratize the university. By the 2010s, they had become ubiquitous. Universities ask students to judge their professors on a scale of one to five. Evaluations usually include a range of questions, including whether the teacher grades fairly and makes class fun.

The problem is that students are terrible judges of who's a good teacher. Because learning is not always pleasant, they end up punishing teachers who teach the most and rewarding the instructors who challenge them the least. An extensive body of research shows no correlation—or even a negative correlation—between how students do on objective learning assessments and how they score their professors. One experiment found that Harvard physics students learned more from “active learning” instruction but thought they learned more by passively listening to a lecture. Another study demonstrated that Air Force Academy students who were taught by highly rated professors tended to do worse in subsequent classes.

Evaluations are also vulnerable to just about every bias imaginable. Course-evaluation scores are correlated with students' expected grades. Studies have found that, among other things, students score male professors higher than female ones, rate attractive teachers more highly, and reward instructors who bring in cookies. “It's not clear what the evaluations are measuring, but in some sense they're a better instrument for measuring gender or grade expectations than they are for measuring the instructor's actual value added,” Philip Stark, a UC Berkeley statistics professor who has studied the efficacy of teacher evaluations, told me.

Despite their well-documented shortcomings, evaluations matter quite a bit to academics' careers. “Having been on many promotion and tenure committees, this is one of the main ways, if not the main way, that your teaching is evaluated when you're being evaluated for a promotion,” Daniel Willingham, a psychology professor at the University of Virginia, told me. Valen Johnson, a statistics professor and former dean at Texas A&M University, told me that evaluations are a “prominent” factor in tenure decisions.

Evaluations matter most for graduate students and adjunct faculty, who teach the bulk of undergraduate courses at many universities. The scores can wholly determine whether someone gets hired. “It's kind of horrifying when you're an adjunct and your employment depends on a 19-year-old's evaluation of what you're doing in the classroom,” Nathaniel Bump, an adjunct English instructor at Georgetown, told me.

Even tenured faculty have to pay attention to their scores, unless they don't mind lecturing to an empty classroom. Some colleges make evaluations available to students as they select their classes. Yale, for example, allows students to filter out courses if they're rated above a certain difficulty level. Professors with bad ratings will see their course enrollment dwindle. That can affect whether their grad students get teaching opportunities and their department gets new funding and faculty positions.

The inevitable result is that faculty feel pressure to cut workloads and pump up the grades they give in order to boost their own scores. In one study, Valen Johnson found that Duke professors could double their odds of getting high evaluation scores by giving A grades instead of B's or C's. Melani Cammett, a Harvard international-affairs professor, saw her scores slide when she moved from teaching at Brown to Harvard. After deducing that a cluster of students had penalized her for assigning too much reading, she cut several academic articles from her syllabus and raised the grades she gave. (In hindsight, she told me, she feels she went too far in pandering to her students, and added some articles back in.)

From the November 2024 issue: The elite college students who can't read books

“Faculty and instructors can basically adjust their teaching style and methodology to help promote higher scores or ratings at the end of the term,” Richard Freishtat, an administrator at Duke's business school and a co-author of Stark's, told me. “Especially when they know that's what's used to judge their performance and therefore merit, promotion, retention. We're talking about people's jobs.” Kim Lane Scheppele, now a sociology professor at Princeton, recalled a former colleague at Bucknell University who would throw parties right before students filled out their evaluations.

For many professors, this politicking pays off. At Harvard, as professors in many disciplines have inflated grades, students have inflated their evaluation scores. Amanda Claybaugh, Harvard's dean of undergraduate education, recalled what one of her colleagues told her: “The equilibrium here is, we give them all A's, and they give us all fives.”

Some professors told me that they ignore their evaluations. Others said they find the feedback useful as long as they recognize the limitations of the format. Willingham, at the University of Virginia, said that he has learned to ignore the hyperbolic comments and appreciates understanding how students experience his courses. And some rigorous but rewarding courses still get strong ratings. But almost no one claims that evaluations actually improve the quality of instruction, which is the main reason for having them at all.

Accordingly, some schools are trying to reduce their reliance on them. The University of Oregon and the University of Southern California have both recently switched to a modified review process that pairs student evaluations with faculty reviews of one another's courses and professors' own self-reflections. Dartmouth's engineering program is piloting a similar system. Harvard used to give out a prize to instructors with the best course-evaluation scores. Two years ago, the university began instead rewarding teachers for the strength of their syllabi and their students' performance in subsequent classes.

For all their flaws, however, teacher evaluations are hard to kill. The influential tenured professors with the most power to get rid of them tend not to hate evaluations as much, because the existing system has worked for them, Scott Gelber, an education professor at Wheaton College, in Massachusetts, told me. The alternatives also leave much to be desired. Peer reviews are far more time-consuming than having students click through a survey, and faculty can bristle at being judged by their colleagues. Daniel Shore, the former chair of Georgetown's English department, summed up the dilemma. “We know that they're a bad tool for evaluating,” he told me. “But we also need to be held accountable for providing quality instruction.”

There's another reason to keep them around. If universities ever did away with students' ability to grade their professors, college kids—and their tuition-paying parents—might revolt. Families paying tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in college tuition expect the opportunity to critique the service they get. They are, after all, customers. The trouble is that, when it comes to education, the customer is not always right.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

There's one big guardrail left on Trump's ambitions. Democrats are gearing up for a showdown that could destroy it.

Mere hours after the killing of Charlie Kirk, President Donald Trump blamed the “radical left” and signaled a crackdown was coming — despite the killer's identity and motives remaining unknown.

In an Oval Office statement on Wednesday, Trump said his administration would “find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence, including the organizations that fund it and support it.”

What exactly he might mean, and what it will look like in practice, remains to be seen. But several prominent right-wing commentators called for taking action against progressive donors and nonprofit groups that they asserted (with zero evidence) were somehow responsible for the killing. Others called for action against the Democratic Party itself.

It's a dangerous moment, similar to those many other countries — including the United States — have faced in the past. An awful act of violence like Kirk's killing can become the justification for a government campaign of repression against political opponents who had nothing to do with that killing.

One dark way situations like this often play out is that, as outrage is peaking, the ruling party passes “emergency laws” stripping civil liberties protections or giving the government new legal powers to go after its perceived internal enemies.

But, in the US right now, there's a huge obstacle to something like that: the Senate filibuster.

The filibuster — a procedural maneuver with which a bill that lacks the support of 60 senators can be blocked — means Trump and the GOP's 53-seat Senate majority can't pass whatever they want into law. Either they have to abide by the complex and restrictive budget reconciliation process (which is exempt from the filibuster), or else they need to win over some Senate Democrats.

So, as long as the Senate filibuster sticks around, any repression campaign from Trump would have to rely on existing law or executive authority — or get Democratic votes.

Which is why it's ironic that, in the days before the shooting, Democrats were in the midst of psyching themselves up for a confrontation that could very plausibly lead to the filibuster's demise.

For years, the filibuster has been a punching bag for progressives, who blame it for restricting what Democratic presidents can do. Many would be happy to see it go, even now.

And yet, Trump's attempt to centralize power — and this talk about taking action against progressive donors and groups — shows why the filibuster is actually quite valuable in times of authoritarian threat. If it goes, that's one fewer guardrail still holding Trump back.

Before Kirk's killing, the hottest topic among Democrats was whether the party's senators should filibuster to block a new funding bill — and force a federal government shutdown until their demands are met.

Back in March, the last government funding expiration date, Senate Democrats decided not to force a shutdown via filibuster, and the party's base was apoplectic. Now, the new deadline of September 30 is approaching, and Democrats are debating what they should do this time.

The loudest voices calling for a shutdown fight are motivated by deep concern over Trump's authoritarianism and a belief that Democrats need to do more to fight back against it. Demanding new restrictions on Trump's authoritarian moves — and forcing a government shutdown if those demands aren't met — is one way to do that, my former colleague Ezra Klein argues.

It's important, though, to try to think a few steps ahead about how a shutdown fight will play out.

Let's say Senate Democrats really do shut down the government via filibuster, making demands that Trump and Senate Republicans consider unacceptable. And let's assume — a big assumption, but let's go with it — that Democrats actually close ranks, hold firm to their demands, and resolve to keep the government shut down indefinitely.

What happens next? I see no plausible world in which Trump meekly caves. Instead, what will happen is that the Senate GOP will face increasing pressure — from Trump and their base — to ram through a rules change that ends the filibuster and gives them the power to make new laws on their own.

Some might argue that Senate Republicans always cave to Trump when he wants something. But that simply isn't true. Trump has wanted the filibuster gone since the first year of his first term — but Senate Republicans have consistently rejected his demands, preferring to keep it. That's eight years of not caving on this particular topic.

Senate procedure is a funny thing. It takes 60 votes to overcome a filibuster for a typical bill. But, a majority of 51 senators — or 50 plus the vice president — can, if they so desire, ram through a rules change getting rid of that requirement. This is known as the “nuclear option.”As you can tell from the name, the nuclear option is considered extreme, and there are longstanding norms against casually invoking it. Still, Senate leaders from both parties in recent years have from time to time used it to alter the rules around confirming nominees; in fact, Republicans deployed it this very week. But for legislation, the current 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster has remained unchanged since 1975.

However, if Senate Republicans become convinced that Democrats are abusing the filibuster, if they think Democrats have become completely intransigent in forcing a shutdown with no end in sight, and if they face enough pressure from the right, they will be provoked to end it.

That is: Klein's shutdown strategy, intended to resist Trump's authoritarianism, could well result in Trump attaining more power.

Let me spell out this dynamic again. Currently, Senate Republicans do not want to eliminate the filibuster. They're happy to keep it around (it's a convenient excuse for telling Trump that no, they can't do this or that). But, if Senate Democrats use the filibuster in a way they feel is completely unacceptable — like, say, shutting down the government indefinitely if demands they consider unrealistic aren't met — and if they feel sufficient heat from the right, they will change their minds.

Klein argues that Senate Democrats providing their votes to a status quo government funding bill would be “complicity.”

But, if you're highly concerned about the authoritarian threat posed by Trump, why would you stoke a confrontation that could well end in one of the last major constraints on his power being removed?

What does a world without the filibuster look like?

Many progressives have long said it would look quite good, actually — better for the country and better for Democrats, and the progressive agenda specifically.

But they're relying on out-of-date arguments honed in a very different political world — and failing to update their thinking for the threat Trump now poses.

Progressive anti-filibuster sentiment began to congeal in 2009, when Klein and others made the case that the Senate would be better off without it. The immediate context was annoyance that President Barack Obama and Democratic congressional majorities were being hampered from passing the agenda of their liking. The debate roared back in a similar context when President Joe Biden took office in 2021.

The more high-minded argument was that the filibuster is simply bad for democratic accountability. A president and congressional majorities should, the argument goes, be able to actually pass what they want to pass. A majority should get to enact its agenda, and then it will be up to voters to decide whether they like that agenda — and render their verdict in the next election.

Paired with this high-minded argument is an ideologically self-interested one. Progressives believed that ending the filibuster would be more helpful to their ideological and policy aims more than it would be to conservatives' aims. After all, the argument went, all conservatives want to do with the government is cut taxes; progressives actually want to do things to help people, and the filibuster is holding them back.

The opening months of the second Trump administration should dispel this dangerous complacency — and should especially dispel any illusion that the right doesn't want to “do anything” with government.

Trump's appointees have displayed enormous imagination in how they've weaponized federal powers to threaten and coerce various societal actors. But they could do much, much more if they had greater authority to rewrite laws.

The filibuster effectively constricts the horizon of the possible. Trump's retribution agenda is so centered on executive branch powers for that reason. In Project 2025 and other efforts, right-wing thinkers spent years dreaming up ways to enact their agenda through the executive branch, because passing new (non-reconciliation) laws seemed so implausible.

If, all of a sudden, the filibuster went away, and it became possible for Trump to pass whatever new laws he wanted — so long as he bullied enough GOP swing votes into going along — the horizon of the possible would change.

Here's one concrete example: Back in March, Trump issued an executive order making various demands on states to change their voting systems. But the order is dubiously legal, and it's unclear how impactful it will be. A new law would be a much more powerful and effective way for Trump to reshape elections.

That gets to one glaring flaw in the aforementioned high-minded argument for filibuster reform. The argument holds that a majority should get to enact its agenda unchecked by the minority and that it should be up to voters to render their verdict on that agenda in the next election.

But what if a president, free of the filibuster, passes new laws interfering with that next election? What if a president, after a national tragedy, seizes the moment to pass emergency laws cracking down on his political opponents?

At a time when so many guardrails holding Trump back are bending and breaking, it seems quite dangerous for Democrats to risk gambling away one of the biggest ones remaining.

Raising the retirement age does more to hurt poorer people who live less long.

The other day, economist Tyler Cowen made an offhand observation that took me aback a bit: that the French, today, enjoy “the longest financed retirements ever seen in the history of the world.”

Verifying the “history of the world” part is beyond my historical skill level. That said, the OECD's Pensions at a Glance report from 2023 confirms that French retirees are enjoying a lot of years off the job.

French men, per the report, left the labor force at an average age of 60.7. At that point, they have a life expectancy of 84, meaning they can expect 23.3 years in retirement, longer than any of the other countries the OECD examined (mostly rich peer nations plus a few select others). French women can expect 26.1 years in retirement, which is beaten by Luxembourg, Spain, Slovenia, and the world leader, Saudi Arabia, but still very high. (The Saudi case is more about women working fewer and shorter stints than in more liberal polities, as opposed to retirement policy.)

French men and women alike can expect over five additional years in retirement compared to Americans.

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

Incidentally, the French government fell this week in part due to opposition parties demanding that the centrist coalition in power go back on its decision to raise the formal retirement age from 62 to 64. Funding 23 to 26 years of retirement per person is expensive, which is exactly why President Emmanuel Macron raised the age in the first place, but when the elderly voter bloc is only growing in size, failing to pay that money out can be politically suicidal.

As a non-Frenchman, this fight inevitably makes me think about the coming retirement battle in the US. Our Social Security trust fund is due to be depleted in about eight years. Under current law, when that happens, retirees will see an across-the-board cut of about 23 percent in their benefit levels. Everything I know about how the US government works tells me it will not get to that point. The question, then, is what a deal to prevent those cuts would look like.

One obvious way to avoid the French predicament is to do what Macron did: raise the retirement age. There are two components to the aging problem hitting the US and other rich nations' pension systems. One is that, because of the size of the baby boom population, more people are hitting retirement age than ever. The number of retired workers newly receiving Social Security hit 3.4 million in 2022, compared to under 2 million in 2000.

Raising the retirement age doesn't solve this issue. But it does partially address the second issue, which is that the average time spent in retirement has risen as nutrition and medicine have improved. A man born in 1900 and turning 65 in 1965 could expect to live 12.9 more years. The Social Security Administration estimates that a man born in 1960 and turning 65 this year can expect 18.4 more years. Even accounting for the trend of people claiming Social Security later in life, that's a good number of additional years that the program has to pay out per male retiree.

Between 2000 and 2022, the US gradually raised the retirement age for full Social Security benefits from 65 to 67. But most bipartisan proposals to reform Social Security (that is, proposals with any shot of passage) envision some kind of further age increase. Two years ago, Sens. Angus King (I-ME) and Bill Cassidy (R-LA) floated raising the normal retirement age to 70. The Bipartisan Policy Center brought together some ex-politicians and experts in both parties to put together a plan, which wound up advocating an age of 69.

One of the key political virtues of a retirement age increase is that it's a benefit cut that doesn't present itself quite as obviously as a benefit cut.

But it does amount to a cut, and potentially a large one. Right now, a 67-year-old woman can expect to live 18.5 more years. Suppose she has to wait until age 70 to claim the same amount of benefits she can now claim at 67. That eats up three of her 18.5 years of expected benefits, an over 16 percent cut. The cut for men, with our shorter lifespans, is even larger in percentage terms.

The most important question to ask about it, though, is whether it's an across-the-board benefit cut, or in fact a regressive one. There are strong arguments that it is the latter.

The eminent Social Security expert and economist Alice Munnell recently highlighted a chart from the program's actuary's office that underlined a pretty concerning gap and trend:

If you don't speak Social Security jargon, this can be a little hard to parse. Essentially, it's comparing two groups: men born in 1930 considering retirement in 1992 and men born in 1960 considering retirement in 2022. In both groups there is a large gap in life expectancy between the people who earned the least in their careers and those who earned the most. In 1992, the highest-earning men could expect to live 8.4 years longer than the lowest-earning men. In 2022, they could expect 10.3 more years. (“Highest-earning” here means the highest-earning fifth, This is not exactly Elon Musk money: in 2020, being in the top quintile as a man meant an average monthly income of at least $6,391, or $76,692 annually.)

Put differently: not only is there a big life expectancy gap between rich and poor people, but also the gap seems to be growing.

This puts retirement age discussions in a different light. Suppose we're considering raising not the normal retirement age (now 67) but the early age (now 62), at which point retirees can claim reduced benefits. If we raise the age by three years, then men in the highest income bracket get a cut of 3 divided by 25.6, or about 11 percent. Men in the lowest income bracket get a cut of 3 divided by 15.3, or almost 20 percent. The specific numbers are different if you're considering raising the normal retirement age, or looking at female workers, but the overall takeaway is the same: raising the age of retirement amounts to a bigger cut for poorer workers.

Recently, economists Henry Aaron at Brookings and Mark Warshawsky got into a heated dispute about how to make sense of these numbers. Warshawsky argues against using life expectancy numbers like those above on the grounds that they inevitably require one to make projections (we don't know, of course, how long people who retired in 2022 will in fact live, chiefly because most of them haven't died yet), and for restricting analysis to men aged 65-69. Aaron argues that this is too restrictive (everyone, including insurers, relies heavily on life expectancy projections as well) and neglects that women, for instance, have seen lifespan inequality increase.

To my non-expert eye, Aaron has the better of this specific dispute. But it's worth emphasizing that the lifespan gap between rich and poor need not be increasing in order for hiking the retirement age to be regressive on net. If, in 30 years, rich men are still living 10 more years in retirement than poor men, an increase in the retirement age will still hit poor men harder than rich men, even if the gap itself hasn't grown.

The traditional Republican approach to Social Security has been to call for its shortfall to be closed entirely with benefit cuts; the traditional Democratic approach has been to rely entirely on tax hikes. Neither of these has any shot in hell of happening, especially if the Senate filibuster remains in place.

I highly doubt that there are 50 Republicans in the Senate now willing to vote for major benefit cuts, and there certainly aren't the 60 that would actually be needed. Similarly, I put the odds of Democrats ever electing 60 senators willing to pass a huge payroll tax hike, even just on top earners, at near zero.

If there's going to be reform before the trust fund runs out in 2033, it's going to have to be on a bipartisan basis and involve pretty huge concessions by each side. And I suspect some kind of a retirement age increase will be part of the deal.

If that happens, the best option out there is one that Wendell Primus, Tara Watson, and Jack Smalligan outline in their recent Brookings reform plan. They would raise the retirement age — but only for the top 40 percent of earners. Most retirees would not see the age rise at all, while the top fifth of earners would see it rise to 70. Those in the 60th to 80th percentiles would see smaller hikes. Along with other progressive benefit cuts and tax hikes, the plan would fix the program's solvency issue.

This retirement age change would make the system somewhat more complicated, as people would have to look up what their specific retirement age is based on their income. But it's the only plan I've seen that keeps the most popular kind of benefit cut from being painfully regressive.

BROOKLYN, New York — When people imagine what nature looks like, this probably wouldn't be it. On an overcast afternoon in August, I stood next to a strip of plants between the sidewalk and the street in Central Brooklyn, no more than a block from a six-lane highway. An ambulance wailed in the distance. It smelled of exhaust. This was New York City after all.

But this narrow patch of green was full of life — of what you might call nature. Furry bumblebees hovered around clusters of shaggy white flowers. Iridescent flies appeared and then disappeared, like flecks of glitter briefly catching the light. And on the underside of a few leaves were the unmistakable pinhead-sized eggs of a monarch butterfly, which look like tiny lemon candies.

Cities like New York are obviously not known for their wildlife. You won't find wolves or jaguars or other charismatic megafauna strolling the streets or hunting in big city parks. But if you know what to look for and take a moment to observe your surroundings, you can find interesting and even rare animal species everywhere. I recently learned, for example, that NYC has more than 200 species of native bees, including the Gotham sweat bee — a species that scientists first discovered in the city.

In the summer and early fall, NYC is also home to a large number of monarch butterflies, America's most iconic bug. Nationwide, these Halloween-colored insects are imperiled. Their population has declined so much in recent decades that the Biden administration proposed listing them late last year under the Endangered Species Act, a powerful environmental law that's considered a last resort for species facing extinction. Yet in NYC, you can still find them all over — even in tiny patches of plants near a highway. This is a pretty strange situation: A species that may be federally protected in the same category as animals like sea turtles and manatees is fluttering around the largest and most densely populated city in the country.

How are monarchs holding on in New York when they seem to be in such steep declines nationwide?

Over a few weeks in August, I traveled to urban ecosystems across the city to try to answer this question. And along the way, I learned something valuable — that helping wildlife is a lot easier than you might think.

Monarchs aren't just nice to look at. They also lead miraculous, almost improbable, lives. Like many birds, whales, and caribou, monarchs migrate. Each fall, nearly all the butterflies that live east of the Rocky Mountains — including those in New York City — fly to the same grove of fir trees in the mountains of Central Mexico, often traveling some 2,000 miles. They ride out winter clumped together on the trees, often in such great numbers that they cause the branches to droop.

Their springtime behavior is even more remarkable: The butterflies migrate back north for the summer, but it takes them two to three generations to get there. The adults in Mexico will fly to the southern US, lay eggs, and die. Their offspring will complete the next leg, flying a bit further north. That happens again and again until the butterflies reach the northern US and parts of southern Canada, where they breed and their offspring start the process all over.

All kinds of mysteries surround this process — including how tiny-brained insects coordinate an intergenerational relay race — but what's clear is that fewer butterflies are making it to Mexico. Each winter, scientists measure the number of acres occupied by monarchs in those fir trees. Between 1993 and 2002, the first 10 years of monitoring, butterflies were clumped on trees across an average of about 21 acres. That's an area roughly equal to 16 American football fields. During this past winter, however, monarchs occupied just 4.4 acres.

Scientists blame these declines largely on the loss of milkweed, the only plant that monarch caterpillars can eat. Milkweed once grew abundantly throughout the Midwest in places like Iowa and Kansas, the core breeding range for monarchs. Yet in recent decades, herbicides sprayed by farmers on corn and soybean fields, which blanket the region, destroyed an enormous number of milkweed plants. Researchers estimate that between 1999 and 2014, herbicides and the destruction of grasslands for farmland, homes, and other infrastructure killed more than 860 million stems of milkweed in the Midwest. These chemicals — which farmers still use — also kill native wildflowers that provide food for adult monarchs, fueling their long migrations.

It's no surprise, then, that conserving monarchs requires protecting what little milkweed remains, and planting more of it. That's why NYC is important. Even though it's built for humans and full of concrete and traffic, the city has been creating pockets of habitat that sustain monarchs and other native bugs. And if that approach can work here, it can work anywhere.

While monarchs live complicated lives, their needs are fairly simple: milkweed plants for their larvae, or caterpillars, and pesticide-free wildflowers for the adults. “The average insect spends three-quarters of its life as a larva or an egg,” said David Lohman, an insect ecologist at the City University of New York. “The whole habitat for that part of the life for most insects, including monarchs, is a single plant.”

If seeded with the right plants — specifically, with native plants, those that evolved here — even small spaces in cities can meet those needs. For example, the patch of plants I visited in Central Brooklyn, part of a community garden called Prospect Farm, was only four feet wide, but it had more than a dozen stems of common milkweed. That's where I spotted the monarch eggs: They were on the underside of the plants' thick, oblong leaves. It's hard to overstate the value of native plants, like milkweed or bee balm. They're ecosystem anchors, drawing in native insects, which in turn draw in native birds, building out links in the food chain.

“It's amazing that if I plant these plants, I'm automatically supporting pollinators or beneficial insects,” said Matthew Morrow, the head of horticulture at NYC's Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks), who says he's known within the agency as the native plant proselytizer. “Run that up the chain, and I'm supporting bird life and other things that feed on all of these creatures.”

Until recently, native plants, other than trees, weren't common in gardens, parks, and other green city spaces. Professional and home gardeners gravitated toward nonnative ornamentals, like daffodils and tulips, which were widely available in nurseries and bred to fit a conventional aesthetic: tidy and uniform with big flowers, bold colors, and a long bloom. Native plants, meanwhile, tend to have a different look, appearing messier and sporting subtler flowers. As important as common milkweed is for monarchs and other insects, for example, it looks, as its name might suggest, a bit like a weed, especially when it's not flowering.

But attitudes are changing. For many years, scientists and environmental advocacy organizations have been trying to raise awareness about insect declines and the value of locally adapted plants. Those efforts are paying off: Gardeners in parks, suburbs, and city homes are now planting far more native plants. They're also becoming slightly more comfortable with a wild aesthetic, in some cases even leaving sticks and dead leaves around because they know insects nest in them.

“My goal is to remove the invasives and to replant with native plants,” said Emily Stringer, a professional gardener at De Matti Park, a small green space in Staten Island. Native plants like mountain mint, a perennial with pale lavender flowers and mint-scented leaves, offer much more ecological value than some ornamentals, said Stringer, who works for NYC Parks.

She's been transforming De Matti into a native plant refuge since the start of the pandemic, she told me, when I met her in the park on a hot August afternoon. “There's a lot more life, no doubt about it,” Stringer said, speaking with a strong Staten Island accent.

During a brief walk through the park, I saw a dozen or so monarchs bouncing around the native flowers. At one point, something large and flying appeared in front of a cluster of purple flowers. It was the size of a golf ball, with a green head, a shrimp-like tail, and a comically long proboscis — the straw-like mouth part that insects use to drink nectar. Its wings moved so fast they were a blur, allowing it to hover. I later learned this was a hummingbird moth.

This shift to native plants is happening in all kinds of spaces across the city, including big parks, small parks, community gardens, and backyards. I even met a guy who does what he calls “guerilla gardening” in northern Manhattan. He plants milkweed and other native plants in parks and tree wells, typically without explicit permission from city officials. It's these efforts that are helping sustain monarchs and other native bugs in New York.

“Every little bit counts,” said Keith De Cesare, a guerrilla gardener who also describes himself as an educator, artist, and naturalist. “No spot is too small.”

(I asked NYC Parks about Keith. A spokesperson told me that “guerrilla gardeners are often well-intentioned and deserve recognition,” but some of the species they plant might not be appropriate for the location. “Certain plants can grow too tall and obstruct sight lines, while others may fall over, creating potential slip and trip hazards,” the spokesperson told me.)

On a sunny morning in late August, I visited Brooklyn Bridge Park, an 85-acre public landscape along the East River, which separates Manhattan from Brooklyn. It's one of my favorite spots in the city — a park near the Brooklyn Bridge built atop old shipping docks that looks onto downtown Manhattan.

My first stop was a small field of wildflowers on Pier 6, not far from the water. In the background was the Manhattan skyline, where helicopters buzzed like flies overhead, while in the foreground was a chunky monarch caterpillar. I watched the animal — an accordion of black, white, and yellow — chew its way through a milkweed leaf, and then another. It was seemingly oblivious to the fact that it lives in one of New York's wealthiest areas.

As I moseyed along the edge of the flower field, I watched adult monarchs, too. They flew from flower to flower, moving up and down as if guided by a conductor, occasionally pausing on a milkweed leaf to lay a single egg.

Brooklyn Bridge Park is entirely human-made and built over what was essentially an industrial wasteland. But now it's a complex ecosystem and a refuge for a number of important species, including monarchs. That ecosystem is rooted, unsurprisingly, in native plants: They've been a part of the park since it opened in 2010, and even more so now. During my visit, Evelyn Manlove, a horticulturist at the park, told me she chooses plants based in part on the insects they may attract, like milkweed for monarchs and curly everlasting, a perennial wildflower, for lady butterflies.

These city spaces are essential for animals, but they're not just for them. They clearly help humans, too. Plenty of research shows that spending time in parks can lower stress and the risk of psychiatric disorders. Scientists have also linked listening to birdsong to mental health benefits — and native plants tend to attract more birds. I find that watching butterflies move through space or caterpillars chew through leaves is almost meditative. Maybe it's the experience of awe. Maybe it's the benefit of just drawing your attention to the present.

On another afternoon, I traveled further north in Brooklyn to a small patch of prairie near the Williamsburg neighborhood. The prairie, which is open to the public, is a green dot in an ocean of gray: To the east and south was the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, a major highway, and to the west and north were warehouses, parking lots, and apartment buildings.

This space was once a cemetery for the US Navy. But long after it was decommissioned — the cemetery ran out of space and the Navy decided to close it and moved most but not all of the bodies to another cemetery — a nonprofit called Brooklyn Greenway Initiative turned it into a meadow. It's an oasis of sorts, filled with more than 100 native plant species including common milkweed, coneflowers, and asters. From within the prairie, now known as the Naval Cemetery Landscape, you can hear cars honking and engines revving, but also the trill of a common yellowthroat — a yellow and green warbler — or the high-pitched cheep of a cedar waxwing.

“When the world overwhelms, we can find comfort in nature's resilience. We, too, can be the trees.”

The city-nature dichotomy offers something special, said Avvah Rossi, the head of horticulture for Brooklyn Greenway Initiative. And that something is best captured by a public notebook tethered to a bench in the meadow. It's essentially a guestbook for visitors, and part of a project led by another organization, called Nature Sacred, to study the effect of green spaces on human well-being.

“Grateful for the softness and pause that nature provides us,” one person wrote. “When the world overwhelms, we can find comfort in nature's resilience. We, too, can be the trees.”

“I feel less alone surrounded by nature,” wrote another. “I can feel the trees whispering to each other. I don't understand them, but they make me feel included. It's nice to be part of something.”

“Thank you, tree, for providing a space to piss on,” wrote a third person.

It's not like New York is some kind of insect sanctuary. Like any city, it's full of concrete and traffic and light pollution that can make it hard for monarchs and other native bugs to survive. Monarchs use sunlight to navigate. Some moths, meanwhile, have been shown, rather incredibly, to navigate with the stars. Both of these feats are likely much harder in a city full of artificial light. Research also makes it clear that cities alone can't save monarchs — rural areas, including agricultural lands, also need to play a role.

Yet urban pockets of native plants clearly help. That's what I find so special about monarchs and other native bugs: It doesn't take much to support them. Bringing back California condors or coral reefs is not something that normal people can easily do, or know how to do. But we can all help conserve monarchs and myriad other animals by simply planting some native flowers.

Earlier in the summer, I met a naturalist named Chris Kreussling at his home in Flatbush, a neighborhood in Central Brooklyn below Prospect Park. His place was easy to pick out since his front yard is basically a prairie.

Kreussling's home is perhaps the best example of what one person can do for native insects in New York City. A garden of native plants envelops his home in bright yellows, purples, and pinks, turning it into a hotspot for native insects. “My garden is my main observatory,” said Kreussling, a retired software developer who loves bugs. “You can just see how much biodiversity there is.”

As we walked around the garden, Kreussling, who helps run a local organization to conserve pollinators, pointed out what I would normally miss. Weevils, tiny beetles with large snouts. The nests of cicada-killer wasps. Leaves with perfectly round holes made by leaf-cutter bees (the bees build nest cavities with the pieces). I was struck by the simple realization that this whole tangled world of life is invisible until you pay attention.

Kreussling told me that sometimes people ask him what he does about insect damage on his plants. “I celebrate it,” he told me. It means the garden is doing its job, he continued — it feeds life.

As we searched for critters, a monarch flew by and landed on a plant called ironweed, which has small purple flowers shaped like pom-poms. I hustled over to watch it feed as Kreussling continued looking for less obvious critters. Some scientists call monarchs the pandas of the insect world: They draw a lot of attention, and often overshadow less charismatic species.

That attention, however, is valuable, said Emily Erickson, an urban ecologist and monarch expert. It can inspire people to care about the natural world, she said, and the lesser-known and less charming creatures that inhabit it. “People seem to be more likely to do positive actions if they feel more connected to what they see flying around in their yard,” she said.

I don't have a yard. I don't even have a stoop. Can city-folk like me help, too?

While reporting this story, I learned about an organization called Monarch Watch that runs a butterfly tagging program to help monitor the monarch migration. The group sells tiny, lightweight stickers — the tags, each printed with a unique ID — designed to adhere to monarch wings. And each fall, volunteers around the country apply those stickers to monarchs as they're traveling south. Then in the winter, Monarch Watch records the IDs they find on monarchs in Mexico. The data the group collects helps scientists figure out where monarchs are coming from and how many are dying along the way.

Tagging is a way for anyone to support monarchs, but first, of course, you need a butterfly. Volunteers often catch the insects in the wild with nets. I, however, decided to try to raise one in my apartment, a la elementary school activity.

On an August evening, I went to Central Park and found a monarch egg on a common milkweed leaf. I took it home and put the leaf in a Tupperware container in my kitchen.

By morning, the egg had hatched into a caterpillar. It was no larger than an eyelash, and every day, it doubled in size. When the caterpillar got too big for its exoskeleton, it'd wiggle out of it, eat the remains, and form a new one — a zero-waste bug! The caterpillar chewed through milkweed leaves so quickly that it became hard to keep its crucial food supply stocked. (Let's just say there might be a few leaves and branches missing from milkweed plants in my neighborhood.)

One morning, when it was a little larger than a Tootsie Roll, I noticed the caterpillar hanging upside down from a leaf, like a sleeping bag pinned up to dry. Then it turned into a chrysalis, a hard shell that protects the insect as it transforms into a butterfly. It was like a theatrical costume change: Within minutes, the caterpillar had unzipped its old skin, revealing the emerald green chrysalis underneath.

About 10 days later, there was a butterfly. We — even my bug-unfriendly partner — were surprisingly excited. We had raised a butterfly! Her wings were missing two dots normally found on males, suggesting she was a female.

I delicately picked her up and carefully placed the sticker, which has a strong, pressure-sensitive adhesive, on her wings. We then carried her to a nearby park, hiked to a field of native wildflowers, and let her go.

She's just one butterfly, and her chance of making it to Mexico is slim. A large portion of monarchs die along the way from car strikes, storms, and a lack of pesticide-free flowers from here to Central Mexico, underscoring the point that conserving migratory species can't just happen in one place.

Still, it's pretty remarkable that her journey begins here, in the nation's largest city.

Before there were skyscrapers and parking lots and a crosshatch of city streets, New York was a wild place, a mosaic of coastal forests, prairies, and marshes. We've since changed the landscape in some irreversible ways that make it inhospitable to animals that once lived here. But as city gardeners and naturalists showed me, a little effort — a little green — can go a long way, benefitting us, monarchs, and other wildlife alike.

And if NYC can be a place where monarchs can flourish, so can anywhere. They really just need something to eat.

The debate fueling the bill that's trying to prevent AI from killing us all.

When it comes to AI, as California goes, so goes the nation. The biggest state in the US by population is also the central hub of AI innovation for the entire globe, home to 32 of the world's top 50 AI companies. That size and influence have given the Golden State the weight to become a regulatory trailblazer, setting the tone for the rest of the country on environmental, labor, and consumer protection regulations — and more recently, AI as well. Now, following the dramatic defeat of a proposed federal moratorium on states regulating AI in July, California policymakers see a limited window of opportunity to set the stage for the rest of the country's AI laws.

This week, the California State Assembly is set to vote on SB 53, a bill that would require transparency reports from the developers of highly powerful, “frontier” AI models. The models targeted represent the cutting-edge of AI — extremely adept generative systems that require massive amounts of data and computing power, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, xAI's Grok, and Anthropic's Claude. The bill, which has already passed the state Senate, must pass the California State Assembly before it goes to the governor to either be vetoed or signed into law.

AI can offer tremendous benefits, but as the bill is meant to address, it's not without risks. And while there is no shortage of existing risks from issues like job displacement and bias, SB 53 focuses on possible “catastrophic risks” from AI. Such risks include AI-enabled biological weapons attacks and rogue systems carrying out cyberattacks or other criminal activity that could conceivably bring down critical infrastructure. Such catastrophic risks represent widespread disasters that could plausibly threaten human civilization at local, national, and global levels. They represent risks of the kind of AI-driven disasters that have not yet occurred, rather than already-realized, more personal harms like AI deepfakes.

Exactly what constitutes a catastrophic risk is up for debate, but SB 53 defines it as a “foreseeable and material risk” of an event that causes more than 50 casualties or over $1 billion in damages that a frontier model plays a meaningful role in contributing to. How fault is determined in practice would be up to the courts to interpret. It's hard to define catastrophic risk in law when the definition is far from settled, but doing so can help us protect against both near- and long-term consequences.

By itself, a single state bill focused on increased transparency will probably not be enough to prevent devastating cyberattacks and AI-enabled chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons. But the bill represents an effort to regulate this fast-moving technology before it outpaces our efforts at oversight.

SB 32 is the third state-level bill to try to specifically focus on regulating AI's catastrophic risks, after California's SB 1047, which passed the legislature only to be vetoed by the governor — and New York's Responsible AI Safety and Education (RAISE) Act, which recently passed the New York legislature and is now awaiting Gov. Kathy Hochul's approval.

SB 53, which was introduced by state Sen. Scott Wiener in February, requires frontier AI companies to develop safety frameworks that specifically detail how they approach catastrophic risk reduction. Before deploying their models, companies would have to publish safety and security reports. The bill also gives them 15 days to report “critical safety incidents” to the California Office of Emergency Services, and establishes whistleblower protections for employees who come forward about unsafe model deployment that contributes to catastrophic risk. SB 53 aims to hold companies publicly accountable for their AI safety commitments, with a financial penalty up to $1 million per violation.

In many ways, SB 53 is the spiritual successor to SB 1047, also introduced by Wiener.

Both cover large models that are trained at 10^26 FLOPS, a measurement of very significant computing power used in a variety of AI legislation as a threshold for significant risk, and both bills strengthen whistleblower protections. Where SB 53 departs from SB 1047 is its focus on transparency and prevention

While SB 1047 aimed to hold companies liable for catastrophic harms caused by their AI systems, SB 53 formalizes sharing safety frameworks, which many frontier AI companies, including Anthropic, already do voluntarily. It focuses squarely on the heavy-hitters, with its rules applying only to companies that generate $500 million or more in gross revenue.

“The science of how to make AI safe is rapidly evolving, and it's currently difficult for policymakers to write prescriptive technical rules for how companies should manage safety,” said Thomas Woodside, the co-founder of Secure AI Project, an advocacy group that aims to reduce extreme risks from AI and is a sponsor of the bill, over email. “This light touch policy prevents backsliding on commitments and encourages a race to the top rather than a race to the bottom.”

Part of the logic of SB 53 is the ability to adapt the framework as AI progresses. The bill authorizes the California Attorney General to change the definition of a large developer after January 1, 2027, in response to AI advances.

Proponents of the bill are optimistic about its chances of being signed by the governor should it pass the legislature, which it is expected to. On the same day that Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed SB 1047, he commissioned a working group focusing solely on frontier models. The resulting report by the group provided the foundation for SB 53. “I would guess, with roughly 75 percent confidence, that SB 53 will be signed into law by the end of September,” said Dean Ball — former White House AI policy adviser, vocal SB 1047 critic, and SB 53 supporter — to Transformer.

But several industry organizations have rallied in opposition, arguing that additional compliance regulation would be expensive, given that AI companies should already be incentivized to avoid catastrophic harms. OpenAI has lobbied against it and technology trade group Chamber of Progress argues that the bill would require companies to file unnecessary paperwork and unnecessarily stifle innovation.

“Those compliance costs are merely the beginning,” Neil Chilson, head of AI policy at the Abundance Institute, told me over email. “The bill, if passed, would feed California regulators truckloads of company information that they will use to design a compliance industrial complex.”

By contrast, Anthropic enthusiastically endorsed the bill in its current state on Monday. “The question isn't whether we need AI governance – it's whether we develop it thoughtfully today or reactively tomorrow,” the company explained in a blog post. “SB 53 offers a solid path toward the former.” (Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that have signed partnership agreements with OpenAI, while Future Perfect is funded in part by the BEMC Foundation, whose major funder was also an early investor in Anthropic. Neither organization has editorial input into our content.)

The debate over SB 53 ties into broader disagreements about whether states or the federal government should drive AI safety regulation. But since the vast majority of these companies are based in California, and nearly all do business there, the state's legislation matters for the entire country.

“A federally led transparency approach is far, far, far preferable to the multi-state alternative,” where a patchwork of state regulations can conflict with each other, said Cato Institute technology policy fellow Matthew Mittelsteadt in an email. But “I love that the bill has a provision that would allow companies to defer to a future alternative federal standard.”

“The natural question is whether a federal approach can even happen,” Mittelsteadt continued. “In my opinion, the jury is out on that but the possibility is far more likely that some suggest. It's been less than 3 years since ChatGPT was released. That is hardly a lifetime in public policy.”

But in a time of federal gridlock, frontier AI advancements won't wait for Washington.

The bill's focus on, and framing of, catastrophic risks is not without controversy.

The idea of catastrophic risk comes from the fields of philosophy and quantitative risk assessment. Catastrophic risks are downstream of existential risks, which threaten humanity's actual survival or else permanently reduce our potential as a species. The hope is that if these doomsday scenarios are identified and prepared for, they can be prevented or at least mitigated.

But if existential risks are clear — the end of the world, or at least as we know it — what falls under the catastrophic risk umbrella, and the best way to prioritize those risks, depends on who you ask. There are longtermists, people focused primarily on humanity's far future, who place a premium on things like multiplanetary expansion for human survival. They're often chiefly concerned by risks from rogue AI or extremely lethal pandemics. Neartermists are more preoccupied with existing risks, like climate change, mosquito vector-borne disease, or algorithmic bias. These camps can blend into one another — neartermists would also like to avoid getting hit by asteroids that could wipe out a city, and longtermists don't dismiss risks like climate change — and the best way to think of them is like two ends of a spectrum rather than a strict binary.

You can think of the AI ethics and AI safety frameworks as the near- and longtermism of AI risk, respectively. AI ethics is about the moral implications of the ways the technology is deployed, including things like algorithmic bias and human rights, in the present. AI safety focuses on catastrophic risks and potential existential threats. But, as Vox's Julia Longoria reported in the Good Robot series for Unexplainable, there are inter-personal conflicts leading these two factions to work against each other, much of which has to do with emphasis. (AI ethics people argue that catastrophic risk concerns over-hype AI capabilities and ignores its impact on vulnerable people right now, while AI safety people worry that if we focus too much on the present, we won't have ways to mitigate larger-scale problems down the line.)

But behind the question of near versus long-term risks lies another one: what, exactly, constitutes a catastrophic risk?

SB 53 initially set the standard for catastrophic risk at 100 rather than 50 casualties — similar to New York's RAISE Act — before halving the threshold in an amendment to the bill. While the average person might consider, say, many people driven to suicide after interacting with AI chatbots to be catastrophic, such a risk is outside of the bill's scope. (The California State Assembly just passed a separate bill to regulate AI companion chatbots by preventing them from participating in discussions about suicidal ideation or sexually explicit material.)

SB 53 focuses squarely on harms from “expert-level” frontier AI model assistance in developing or deploying chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons; committing crimes like cyberattacks or fraud; and “loss of control” scenarios where AIs go rogue, behaving deceptively to avoid being shut down and replicating themselves without human oversight. For example, an AI model could be used to guide the creation of a new deadly virus that infects millions and kneecaps the global economy.

“The 50 to 100 deaths or a billion dollars in property damage is just a proxy to capture really widespread and substantial impact,” said Scott Singer, lead author of the California Report for Frontier AI Policy, which helped inform the basis of the bill. “We do look at like AI-enabled or AI potentially [caused] or correlated suicide. I think that's like a very serious set of issues that demands policymaker attention, but I don't think it's the core of what this bill is trying to address.”

Transparency is helpful in preventing such catastrophes because it can help raise the alarm before things get out of hand, allowing AI developers to correct course. And in the event that such efforts fail to prevent a mass casualty incident, enhanced safety transparency can help law enforcement and the courts figure out what went wrong. The challenge there is that it can be difficult to determine how much a model is accountable for a specific outcome, Irene Solaiman, the chief policy officer at Hugging Face, a collaboration platform for AI developers, told me over email.

“These risks are coming and we should be ready for them and have transparency into what the companies are doing,” said Adam Billen, the vice president of public policy at Encode, an organization that advocates for responsible AI leadership and safety. (Encode is another sponsor of SB 53.) “But we don't know exactly what we're going to need to do once the risks themselves appear. But right now, when those things aren't happening at a large scale, it makes sense to be sort of focused on transparency.”

However, a transparency-focused bill like SB 53 is insufficient for addressing already-existing harms. When we already know something is a problem, the focus should be on mitigating it.

“Maybe four years ago, if we had passed some sort of transparency legislation like SB 53 but focused on those harms, we might have had some warning signs and been able to intervene before the widespread harms to kids started happening,” Billen said. “We're trying to kind of correct that mistake on these problems and get some sort of forward-facing information about what's happening before things get crazy, basically.”

SB 53 risks being both overly narrow and unclearly scoped. We have not yet faced these catastrophic harms from frontier AI models, and the most devastating risks might take us entirely by surprise. We don't know what we don't know.

It's also certainly possible that models trained below 10^26 FLOPS, which aren't covered by SB 53, have the potential to cause catastrophic harm under the bill's definition. The EU AI Act sets the threshold for “systemic risk” at the smaller 10^25 FLOPS, and there's disagreement about the utility of computational power as a regulatory standard at all, especially as models become more efficient.

As it stands right now, SB 53 occupies a different niche from bills focused on regulating AI use in mental healthcare or data privacy, reflecting its authors' desire not to step on the toes of other legislation or bite off more than it can reasonably chew. But Chilson, the Abundance Institute's head of AI policy, is part of a camp that sees SB 53's focus on catastrophic harm as a “distraction” from the real near-term benefits and concerns, like AI's potential to accelerate the pace of scientific research or create nonconsensual deepfake imagery, respectively.

That said, deepfakes could certainly cause catastrophic harm. For instance, imagine a hyper-realistic deepfake impersonating a bank employee to commit fraud at a multibillion-dollar scale, said Nathan Calvin, the vice president of state affairs and general counsel at Encode. “I do think some of the lines between these things in practice can be a bit blurry, and I think in some ways…that is not necessarily a bad thing,” he told me.

It could be that the ideological debate around what qualifies as catastrophic risks, and whether that's worthy of our legislative attention, is just noise. The bill is intended to regulate AI before the proverbial horse is out of the barn. The average person isn't going to worry about the likelihood of AI sparking nuclear warfare or biological weapons attacks, but they do think about how algorithmic bias might affect their lives in the present. But in trying to prevent the worst-case scenarios, perhaps we can also avoid the “smaller,” nearer harms. If they're effective, forward-facing safety provisions designed to prevent mass casualty events will also make AI safer for individuals.

If SB 53 passes the legislature and gets signed by Gov. Newsom into law, it could inspire other state attempts at AI regulation through a similar framework, and eventually encourage federal AI safety legislation to move forward.

How we think about risk matters because it determines where we focus our efforts on prevention. I'm a firm believer in the value of defining your terms, in law and debate. If we're not on the same page about what we mean when we talk about risk, we can't have a real conversation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Charlie Kirk shooting suspect in custody","https://www.businessinsider.com/charlie-kirk-shooting-suspect-updates-rifle-recovered-2025-9","Fri, 12 Sep 2025 15:02:00 GMT","

A suspect in the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk is in custody after a multi-day manhunt.

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox confirmed earlier remarks made by President Donald Trump on Friday morning that law enforcement had a suspect in custody.

""Ladies and gentlemen, we got him,"" Cox said during a Friday morning news conference.

Officials said the suspect was named Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old resident of Utah. He was not a student at Utah Valley University, where Kirk was fatally shot. Robinson was taken into custody in Washington County, which is roughly three and a half hours away from where Kirk was shot.

Cox said that family members and a friend helped turn Robinson in. A family member of Robinson said he had become ""more political in recent years,"" he added.

""The family member referenced a recent incident in which Robinson came to dinner prior to September 10, and in that conversation with another family member, Robinson mentioned Charlie Kirk was coming to UVU,"" Cox said. ""They talked about why they didn't like him and the viewpoints that he had. The family member also stated that Kirk was full of hate and spreading hate.""

Investigators obtained casings near a Mauser .30-06 caliber bolt action rifle that was wrapped in a dark colored towel in a wooded area on Utah Valley University's campus. ""The rifle had a scope mounted on top of it,"" Cox said.

A fired casing was inscribed, ""Notices bulges OWO what's this?"" Cox said that among the inscriptions on the unfired casing were the phrases, ""Hey fascist! Catch!"" adding that there were arrow symbols alongside the wording. Additional inscriptions on the unfired casings included, ""If you read this you are gay LMAO."" 

Cox said that on Thursday evening, one of Robinson's family members reached out to a family friend with information that Robinson had ""confessed to them or implied to them"" that he had fatally shot Charlie Kirk. Once law enforcement had Robinson's name, Cox said officers were able to connect him to the crime scene.

Investigators reviewed campus security footage that showed Robinson arriving in a gray Dodge Challenger at roughly 8:29 am local time on September 10, the day Kirk was shot. Footage also showed Robinson wearing ""a plain maroon T-shirt, light-colored shorts, a black hat with a white logo, and light-colored shoes.""

""When encountered in person by investigators in Washington County on September 12 in the early morning hours, Robinson was observed in consistent clothing with those surveillance images,"" Cox said.

In addition to the family friend, Robinson's roommate showed law enforcement messages that the suspect had posted on the online platform Discord. In those messages, Cox said, Robinson said that he needed ""to retrieve a rifle from the drop point."" Other messages referred to having watched the area where the rifle was left.

FBI Director Kash Patel said the suspect was taken into custody on Thursday night at 10 p.m. Utah time.

President Donald Trump first announced earlier on Friday during a ""Fox & Friends"" interview that a suspect was in custody.

Trump said that someone ""very close to"" the suspect had provided information to law enforcement that aided in his capture, adding the tipster was a ""person involved with law enforcement, but was a person of faith. A minister.""

In his remarks, Cox thanked ""the family members of Tyler Robinson who did the right thing in this case and were able to bring him into law enforcement."" He did not specify which family members were involved.

The manhunt for a suspect in Kirk's shooting extended multiple days and saw the FBI ask for the public's assistance in identifying a ""person of interest"" captured on camera.

""We are asking for the public's help identifying this person of interest in connection with the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University,"" the FBI's Salt Lake City field office wrote in a Thursday afternoon post on X.

The FBI also offered a $100,000 reward for information that leads to ""the identification and arrest of the individual(s) responsible"" for Kirk's death.

On Thursday, the agency released six photos of the person of interest as well as video footage. In the video's caption, the agency wrote that ""the subject is seen jumping from the rooftop of a building after the shooting.""

""Around 12 p.m. Mountain Time on September 10, 2025, the subject climbed up to a rooftop; after he shot and killed Charlie Kirk, he jumped off and ran away,"" the agency wrote.

The FBI added that the shooter had left a gun and ammunition in a wooded area near the university, and that officials had traced shoe impressions, a forearm imprint, and a palm print from the rooftop in the video.

Earlier in the day, authorities said they had recovered a ""high-powered, bolt-action rifle"" they believe was used to kill Kirk in a wooded area near the campus. The suspect was able to ""blend in"" well with the Utah Valley University crowd that had gathered to hear Kirk speak, they added.

Kirk was rushed to an area hospital after being shot in the neck but died from his injuries on Wednesday afternoon. President Donald Trump and scores of political and business leaders have praised Kirk's legacy of building youth support for the conservative movement.

Two persons of interest were initially taken into custody on Wednesday but were released after authorities determined they were not involved in Kirk's killing. Mason also asked people to stop harassing the two individuals who had since been released.

Trump said that he would posthumously award Kirk with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. The president said that Kirk's legacy will live on.

""Charlie was a giant of his generation, a champion of liberty, and an inspiration to millions and millions of people,"" Trump said during an event at the Pentagon marking the September 11th anniversary.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","AT&T tracked employee attendance to find 'freeloaders.' Now, it admits the system is driving workers to the 'brink of frustration.'","https://www.businessinsider.com/att-system-for-tracking-employees-rto-compliance-2025-9","Fri, 12 Sep 2025 09:57:00 GMT","

AT&T is reducing its reliance on an employee-attendance tracking system, admitting to workers that it hasn't been fully accurate and is ""driving people to the brink of frustration.""

The system, known internally as presence reporting, automatically tracks the hours workers spend at their assigned office. Most are required to log at least eight hours a day, five days a week, on-site.

The telecom giant is one of several companies, including Amazon, JP Morgan, and Microsoft, tightening return-to-office mandates and using new tech to track employee compliance. Executives at these companies say the moves boost collaboration and productivity.

In a meeting last month, chief marketing and growth officer Kellyn Kenny said her division is reducing its reliance on presence tracking in response to employee concerns about the system and its accuracy. The system was originally introduced to identify employees who weren't showing up in the office.

""We recognize that there's things about the report that are not correct,"" she said, according to audio obtained by Business Insider. ""It is not something that I expect anybody to be looking at on a daily, weekly, or even monthly basis.""

AT&T is also deemphasizing use of the tracking system for salaried employees companywide, a person familiar with the matter said.

CEO John Stankey indicated in a memo to staffers last month (reported exclusively by Business Insider) that AT&T was shifting its use of behavioral data, such as presence reports.

""We analyze patterns of behaviors from broad cohorts,"" he wrote, ""to determine if the behavior being evaluated is consistent with our stated priorities and employment expectations.""

Stankey said that an individual's data must differ ""significantly"" from their peers before their name is attached to the behavior.

""Some may view this approach as a matter of trust, and that perspective is understandable. In several forums, I've expressed concerns that past data indicated more outliers than we'd like,"" he said.

Kenny said during the August meeting that the employee survey (which prompted the blunt memo from Stankey) had ""lots of feedback"" about the presence reports. She said the survey included critiques from workers who said they were struggling to make it to doctors' appointments without running afoul of the system, for example.

Read more about Stankey's memo.

While the survey does not appear to have included a direct question about presence reporting, it did ask whether employees agreed that AT&T's ""policies and systems support me in delivering my best work.""

Kenny said in the meeting that roughly half of the respondents in her organization said ""no,"" and that many voiced their concerns about the RTO mandate and presence reports in the freeform response.

""I now understand the level of anxiety that this report has created,"" Kenny said. ""I also now understand how the fact that it is inaccurate is driving people to the brink of frustration, and it's creating distrust.""

Business Insider has spoken with roughly a dozen employees from multiple divisions of the company this year about the system and its impact on their workplace experience.

A spokesperson for AT&T declined to comment for this story, instead citing Stankey's August memo.

Multiple employees told Business Insider that the system doesn't just log badge swipes at the entrance or exit; the presence report uses laptop network connections and mobile device location data to infer the hours an employee was at their assigned office.

The tool was rolled out in response to the RTO push that began two years ago, and its usage ramped up as the attendance policy grew increasingly strict.

Other companies, like Amazon and JP Morgan in particular, have also closely monitored employee behavior at work. Amazon previously used categories like ""inconsistent badger"" or ""zero badger"" depending on an employee's compliance with a three-day in-office mandate. The company ended up nixing the labels in favor of providing raw badging data to managers to use at their discretion.

A recent survey by commercial real-estate company CBRE found that more than two-thirds of employers track employee compliance with attendance policies, and more than a third have taken some level of enforcement action.

Enforcement that is too strict or error-prone can cause other headaches within an organization — pushing out experienced employees, making it harder to hire new talent, or undermining motivation and trust within the organization. Amazon's internal documents from last year indicated that its RTO policy was hampering its ability to recruit top AI talent, and a Harvard leadership expert said Meta's abruptly shifting RTO effort in 2023 was likely to cause a ""huge amount of distrust"" in the company.

At the AT&T marketing and growth team meeting, Kenny said that the system helped leadership identify ""freeloaders"" who showed up for 30 minutes or two hours per day.

""There were people who badged in for 10 minutes, got themselves a cup of coffee, and then left,"" she said. ""The report was good for identifying the people who were abusing the system. We do not need this report for that purpose anymore, because we took action on the people who were the free riders.""

AT&T did not specify how many workers have been disciplined or dismissed in connection with their presence report information.

AT&T workers told Business Insider that apparent glitches in the system could also be a hassle for employees who were pulling their weight.

They said that in the first few months of this year, while the five-day RTO mandate was phasing in, their reports could be wrong by as many as several hours. In addition, briefly badging into an AT&T facility on a day off could trigger a person's daily average hours to drop below the mandatory eight hours for the week.

""It was at its worst in March and April,"" one worker in New Jersey told Business Insider. ""Sometimes you'd step out for lunch, and then it would stop counting.""

Though there were no immediate consequences from an incorrect report, employees were concerned the erroneous data could make them targets for layoffs.

Some other business leaders have said RTO mandates have ""encouraged"" workers to quit voluntarily, allowing companies to avoid more expensive layoffs.

AT&T previously told Business Insider the goal of its in-office rules is to foster better collaboration. It has also undertaken a multiyear effort to shrink its workforce. The company started this year with around 140,000 employees, down from more than 160,000 at the start of 2023. Telecom competitors Verizon and T-Mobile started 2025 with 99,000 and 70,000, respectively.

Stankey has said that the company is looking to cut some $6 billion in costs as it decommissions its legacy copper-based network in favor of new fiber and 5G technologies.

One worker in Georgia said that the presence reports changed the workplace reality for many salaried managerial workers, who aren't used to such detailed tracking of their workday.

""We're supposed to be able to work a more flexible thing as long as we get our work done,"" he said.

Another effect of the crackdown on underperformers has been the erosion of motivation for some higher performers to put in extra time.

""The attitude has shifted,"" the New Jersey employee said. ""They only count eight hours, so I'm just going to work eight hours.""

The AT&T employees Business Insider spoke with said their presence reports have gotten more accurate over the past few months. One shared their report with annotations that showed such an improvement.

The question of employees' trust could take more than a few months to resolve.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","How a $1 billion TikTok challenger unraveled","https://www.businessinsider.com/how-tiktok-challenger-flip-unraveled-2025-9","Fri, 12 Sep 2025 09:30:00 GMT","

Flip employees were riding high in mid-January.

The TikTok challenger had just cracked the Apple App Store's top-five ranking. Downloads soared 855% month over month, Sensor Tower data showed, fueled by TikTok's imminent ban in the US.

It was a dream scenario for an app that — with over $230 million in funding and a roughly $1.1 billion valuation — promised to reinvent social shopping through a mix of product reviews and entertaining videos.

Raging wildfires had forced Flip's CEO, Noor Agha, to evacuate his Los Angeles home before he had time to retrieve his car or pack an extra pair of underwear. But in a January 15 interview with Agha and COO Eduardo Vivas, the executives sounded upbeat, if not a little frenzied.

""To be in the business that we're in, given all the changes that are happening, is obviously very exciting for us,"" Vivas said at the time.

Seven months later, Flip was dead.

This is the story of how Flip crashed, as told by nine former employees, along with investors, creator partners, talent managers, and brands. Agha, Vivas, and other company representatives did not respond to requests for comment.

Days after Business Insider's interview with Flip's top executives, President Donald Trump halted the TikTok ban. Flip raced to sustain its momentum, pouring money into ads and launching a $100 million equity fund to woo creators. With TikTok back in play, the buzz fizzled.

Things unraveled quickly from there. In April, Trump tariffs raised costs for some Flip vendors and brand partners. Then Flip slashed jobs and began clearing out its LA headquarters. In May, the company received an eviction notice for its LA warehouse.

By June, the company had slipped out of Apple's US App Store top 100, and within weeks, it cut much of its remaining staff without severance, three ex-staffers said. Flip shut down its app in late August.

The company's demise caught many off guard. Employees who had watched a spike in downloads and onboarding of new brands believed business was humming.

""I was as shocked as I could have been when that last round of layoffs came and how quickly it dissolved from there,"" one former Flip worker said. ""This year, there were very optimistic conversations about where we were going and the idea that this was going to become huge.""

Flip's fate showcases the uphill battle that consumer startups face when trying to compete with tech giants like TikTok, Meta, or Google. The company spent millions of dollars to recruit creators and onboard new users via ads and referral credits. But competing with Big Tech companies, which have billions of users and the ability to outspend you at every turn, is no easy task.

""It's actually crazy to build a new complete social platform from scratch,"" Agha told Business Insider in January. ""The amount of pieces to make a social platform work is so insanely hard.""

It also demonstrates how difficult it has been for US companies to blend social video and commerce. TikTok has struggled to live up to its leadership's expectations for its e-commerce platform, Shop. Meta pulled back on some of its e-commerce bets, and Amazon killed its TikTok-like feed, Inspire, earlier this year.

""Changing shopping behaviors is a slow and gradual process,"" said Sky Canaves, a principal analyst on the retail and e-commerce desk at EMARKETER, Business Insider's sister company. ""It takes time.""

Agha, who was born in Iraq, launched Flip in 2019 alongside cofounder Jonathan Ellman.

Like many other founders, Agha is brimming with big ideas.

""This was his app, his dream, his world he wanted to create,"" one former staffer said.

Flip's original business idea was a try-before-you-buy social network where customers would receive clothing in the mail, take photos of the fits, and ask other users to vote on which items they should purchase.

Fashion tech was in vogue, with apps like Snapchat experimenting with virtual try-on technology. Some entrepreneurs were eyeing China's massive social-shopping industry and considering how they might bring the business to the US. Live-shopping platform Whatnot had just kicked off in the US, later raising hundreds of millions of dollars at a roughly $5 billion valuation.

While TikTok hadn't yet launched Shop in the US, it had begun experimenting with e-commerce features like in-video shopping links.

By August 2021, when Flip announced its $28 million Series A round, the company had pivoted from try-ons to user-generated product reviews and live shopping videos.

Flip was ""well-positioned to follow in the footsteps of China and revolutionize social commerce in the US,"" investor Ullas Naik of Streamlined Ventures said at the time.

Flush with cash, the company moved to grow its audience, unveiling a creator program in December 2021 that would pay users commissions on sales generated through their videos. Big social-media stars like Patrick Starrr, Hyram Yarbro, and Addison ""Rae"" Easterling joined the app.

The company was growing quickly, writing in a July 2022 press release that it had expanded its user base by 500% in the first half of that year. Flip fundraised on that growth, announcing in July a $60 million Series B round at a $500 million valuation.

That same year, the company moved into a new three-floor office in the El Segundo neighborhood of LA.

The office had many of the markers of a buzzy tech startup. Workers had access to free coffee and snacks like Uncrustables. There was even a trampoline, which no one used, three former employees said. Music blared over the speakers, with one electronic track on repeat that Agha particularly enjoyed, three ex-staffers said.

""The vibes in the building were always high energy,"" a third ex-employee said.

While the company said it planned to use its 2022 funding to expand its team, it generally kept its head count lean. Much of the company worked in its El Segundo headquarters, where it required staffers to be in person five days a week. Some workers in functions like data entry were asked to work six days a week, with overtime pay.

""It was a very intense startup vibe,"" said the first ex-staffer. ""The people that work here are fully bought in.""

To keep growing in 2023, the company splurged on referrals, offering in-app credits sometimes worth over $100 to get new users signed up and scrolling more, The Information and The Free Press reported.

In April 2024, Flip raised a $144 million round with participation from the adtech firm AppLovin, doubling its valuation to around $1.1 billion. A couple of months earlier, it had formed a partnership with AppLovin to power ads for brands on Flip.

Around the time of the investment, the company also acquired Curated, a platform that connected shoppers with experts for advice on big purchases, for $330 million in stock. Curated's CEO at the time, Vivas, became Flip's chief operating officer. Vivas, a serial entrepreneur and high school dropout who previously sold a startup to LinkedIn, was on AppLovin's board of directors.

The company was racing to expand Flip's user base as it sought to take on the industry's goliath: TikTok Shop. Like social-shopping competitor LTK, the company believed it had to expand beyond pure shopping content. Flip launched a new set of non-shopping videos, called Clips, in July 2024.

""We think of shopping as a form of entertainment,"" Vivas told Business Insider in January. ""People do it to have fun and enjoy themselves, but a feed cannot just be shopping content.""

Riding off the tailwinds of the looming TikTok ban, Flip downloads spiked. The company also invested in a stream of ads on TikTok to lure creators. Inside the company, staffers saw the surge of new users as a breakthrough moment.

""We all thought it was going to take off from there,"" the first former Flip employee said. There was a feeling that ""we made it past all of the hard parts of being a startup,"" they said.

To boost non-shopping content, Flip pledged $100 million to its ""Founding Creators Fund."" It promised creators ""grants"" of up to $100,000 that would scale with Flip's valuation — so long as the creators kept posting to the app. Contracts set a five-year timeline for payouts, unless an acquisition triggered them earlier.

Overall, a mix of user acquisition costs and macroeconomic headwinds stunted Flip's push to take on TikTok Shop.

""It was ultimately just unsustainable because they had these very high customer acquisition costs as well as customer retention costs,"" Canaves said.

And as Trump delayed the TikTok ban multiple times, the desperate hunt for an alternative lost its urgency.

""It is really challenging for new apps to break through,"" Canaves said. ""I think they struggled to scale in the way that they wanted to.""

Flip wrote on its website last month that its mission of building a ""social platform that gave everyone a voice"" had come to a close. It said it had reached 16.5 million people, crossed 5 billion video views, paid $13.4 million to creators, and driven $375 million in sales for brands.

The statement didn't provide a reason for the closure.

The app's shuttering caught some brand partners off guard. Haak Wear, a hat seller, addressed the Flip shutdown in a blog post on its website. ""This situation has reminded us of the importance of having multiple touchpoints with our community,"" the company wrote.

Five former staffers said they felt out of the loop on the health of the business while working at Flip.

Flip is not the only tech platform to make big promises to partners and then shut its doors. Buzzy shopping app Nate abruptly closed its creator program in December 2022, for example.

""It wasn't surprising that the app was going to shut down at some point,"" said Tara Blair Ball, a creator in Flip's Founding Creator Fund. ""I don't think it made sense how they were making money to warrant the pay that they were giving.""

Even as Flip's downloads were surging in January, Agha acknowledged that merging social media with commerce is challenging in the US market.

""It's definitely crazy freaking hard,"" Agha said during the January interview. ""Almost killed us a thousand times. No question.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Anthropic bot crawlers feast on web content and give little back, a new ranking shows","https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-bot-crawlers-feast-on-web-give-little-back-ranking-2025-9","Fri, 12 Sep 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

I was at a party in San Francisco recently where a classic Silicon Valley discussion began.

The topic was which AI models and chatbots are best to use. For some partygoers, an important filter was how ""ethical"" the providers were.

One person said they planned to use Anthropic's Claude service because they said the startup was ethical. This company has done impressive work in the area of AI safety. I mentioned that Anthropic has bot crawlers that seem to regularly scrape data from websites while sending very little traffic back. This partygoer was shocked.

Since then, I've been looking for reliable data that shows this important and under-discussed part of the AI revolution. While tech companies spend lavishly on data centers, GPUs, and talent, they avoid talking about the other key ingredient of AI success: data.

That's because they don't want to pay for the high-quality human data that's needed for AI model training, inference, and AI outputs. Instead, they send out bots to crawl websites and scoop up this information, mostly for free.

In the past, tech companies would send users to the original sources of this information. This formed the grand bargain of the web. Sites would let their data be taken for free on the understanding that they would get referrals in return, and could pay for their efforts through advertising, subscriptions, and other techniques.

In the new generative AI world, this deal is breaking down. Now, AI answer engines and chatbots give users direct answers, making people less likely to visit the websites that created the content in the first place.

Cloudflare, which helps run about 20% of the world's websites, has begun tracking this behavior. It measures Big Tech company bots' requests to crawl websites, and the number of referrals the platforms send to sites.

This crawl-to-refer ratio is a useful guide to how much tech companies are taking from the web and how much they're giving back. For example, a ratio of 100 to 1 would mean a company's bots crawled sites 100 times for every 1 referral they send.

Is this one way to measure how ethical companies are in the AI era? I'll leave you to decide. Here's the data for the first week in September.

As you can see, Anthropic stands out like a sore thumb. According to Cloudflare data, it crawls sites way more than it sends users out to the web.

This aligns with Business Insider reporting from about a year ago. Back then, we told you that bots from Anthropic and OpenAI, especially, were crawling some websites so much that it was causing their traffic costs to spike dramatically.

One web developer saw a client's cloud-computing costs double within a few months due to this AI bot swarm, according to BI reporting last year.

So, not only are AI companies taking from the web and giving less back — they are also leaving some site owners with bigger bills to pay.

I asked Anthropic why it crawls so much and gives so little back to the web. The startup said it couldn't confirm the crawl-to-refer ratios calculated by Cloudflare and said there may be ""issues"" with the methodology.

Anthropic also noted that it launched a web search feature for its popular Claude AI chatbot earlier this year. This is generating more referral traffic for websites now, and this is growing quickly, the startup said.

OpenAI did not respond to requests for comment. Perplexity responded with a detailed and thoughtful response that partly focused on the emerging ability of bots to represent human users' intentions, such as a desire to access knowledge on the web freely.

""In the case of public content, publishers can choose not to make their content public,"" Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer told Business Insider. ""In the case of facts, copyright law, as you know, has always drawn a line between facts and expression. That's a foundation of human inquiry itself.""

A caveat: The numbers that go into the crawl-to-refer ratio focus on the web and exclude native app activity. If app activity were included, the ratios might be lower. However, this methodology applies to all the companies included in this ranking.

Google's relatively low ratio is likely due to its traditional search engine, which still shows website links in many results. However, the company is increasingly weaving in AI chatbot-style answers into its search service, via AI Overviews and AI mode.

According to Cloudflare data, in the first week of January, Google's crawl-to-refer ratio was 3.3 to 1. That ratio jumped to 18 to 1 in the first week of April and then fell slightly to 9 to 1 in the first week of July.

Google says it still sends traffic to the web, and it cares about the health of this ecosystem.

Business Insider will track this Cloudflare data in the coming months and quarters to see how this behavior evolves.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","We got a look at 'Project Maverick,' Dell's top-secret plan to overhaul its systems for the AI future","https://www.businessinsider.com/project-maverick-dell-secretive-plan-overhaul-systems-for-ai-future-2025-9","Fri, 12 Sep 2025 12:54:00 GMT","

There's a top-secret project underway inside Dell.

Most of Dell's employees aren't meant to know about it, and those who do have signed NDAs and been told to keep communications about it to a minimum.

""Do not mention the Project Maverick name,"" reads a NDA agreement seen by Business Insider.

But despite its secrecy, ""Project Maverick,"" as it is codenamed, isn't a revolutionary piece of hardware or groundbreaking new technology. It's Dell's plan to overhaul the company's operations and streamline all systems, data, and processes into a standardized platform.

Dell sees this transformation as ""critical"" for its AI strategy and future success, and the company has brought on a team of Deloitte consultants to help guide the project, internal documents about the project obtained by Business Insider show.

""The 'game' is changing — we must be far more nimble, decisive, and quick,"" one internal document says. ""What made us successful in the past won't take us where we need to go.""

Documents seen by Business Insider include an onboarding presentation and a ""guidance and resources"" document uploaded to the project SharePoint, describing its scope and intended outcomes. Business Insider has also seen an NDA agreement sent to a Dell employee.

""While we're not going to discuss the specifics of our internal processes, we prioritize innovation and service to support our team members, customers, and partners,"" a Dell spokesperson told Business Insider.

Project Maverick's mission is to modernize the 41-year-old company's vast IT sprawl, part of which Dell inherited during its acquisition of EMC in 2015, the second-largest technology merger ever.

According to the onboarding presentation, Dell's operations run on roughly 4,700 applications, 70,000 servers, and more than 10,000 databases. That environment is ""holding us back,"" Dell said in the presentation, because it is so complex and expensive to maintain.

The tangle of systems forces staff into ""manual processes and excessive reporting,"" diverting energy away from pursuing innovation, Dell said.

One slide breaking down specific functions described Dell's subscription capabilities as ""severely outdated,"" its customer resource management as a source of ""confusion and inefficiency,"" and its stock keeping units, or SKUs, as a driver of ""go-to-market delays.""

Two Dell employees told Business Insider that the quality of the tools hampers their daily work. They asked to remain anonymous as they are not permitted to speak publicly, but Business Insider has verified their employment.

""Our tools suck. They're very old,"" said one employee, who has been with the company for more than 10 years.

""It is very hard for us to do our jobs in the Dell ecosystem as it is today,"" said a second Dell employee. ""Many systems don't talk to each other, or only do a small piece of a broader process, requiring users to switch between several tools to complete a task.""

The push to consolidate tools is ""long overdue,"" the person added.

A third employee told Business Insider that while some tools ""aren't very intuitive,"" they had few complaints about the ones they use daily.

Dell has been working on Project Maverick since November 2024 and is set to launch for the client solutions group (CSG) — the part of Dell that sells personal computers, monitors, and other hardware — in February 2026, in line with the start of Dell's financial year, according to a project timeline seen by Business Insider.

An internal FAQ says there will be a single cutover day, after which most existing systems will be decommissioned. ""Friday, it's going to work one way, Monday, it's going to work a different way,"" explained the Dell employee who has been at the company for more than 10 years and who works on Project Maverick.

The company's other key business line, the infrastructure solutions group (ISG) — which provides servers, storage solutions, and other IT infrastructure — is scheduled to be updated in May 2026.

Project Maverick will mean ""less time on manual tasks, better data and insights for decision-making, faster response to customer needs, a more agile, competitive Dell,"" according to the internal documents.

Changes will include creating a single global catalog, consistent lead times, and automated order management capabilities.

""This is a bold opportunity to deliver the benefits our teams have been asking for and a key enabler of Modern Dell,"" the project documents say.

Alongside Project Maverick, major changes have been hitting other parts of Dell's business. In the last two years, the company's global head count has dropped by 25,000, marking a 19% decline in personnel.

In July, Jeff Clarke, the longtime vice chairman and COO, announced in an internal memo that he was stepping in to take on CSG's ""day-to-day leadership.""

CSG is the company's biggest revenue driver, but the division's revenue has declined for the last three years.

Dell announced another major leadership shift this week — Yvonne McGill, the chief financial officer, has stepped down after nearly 30 years at the company.

Michael Dell founded his eponymous brand in 1984, under the name PC's Limited, and it quickly established itself as a trusted maker of office PCs.

Since 1992, Dell has been a Fortune 500 company — barring four years from 2014 when it was taken private — and Dell himself is the world's 11th-richest man, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

The company has evolved into a major server and data storage provider, benefiting from the AI boom as demand surges for the infrastructure required to deploy the new technology.

But Project Maverick demonstrates how successful legacy brands must reorient all their operations for an AI-driven future.

Joe Depa, the global chief innovation officer at the Big Four professional services firm EY, told Business Insider that major transformations are ""inevitable"" as companies implement AI.

""Implementing AI isn't about dropping a tool into old workflows — it requires rethinking processes, systems, and even business models through an 'AI-first' lens,"" he said.

Minimizing your operational complexity is crucial because ""siloed, manual systems can't handle the scale, speed, or intelligence AI enables.""

Companies that re-architect their operating models around AI ""will set the competitive standard,"" Depa added.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","As its Microsoft nightmare nears an end, OpenAI's 'full stack' dream comes into view","https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-full-stack-dream-microsoft-nightmare-2025-9","Fri, 12 Sep 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

OpenAI is about to clear a major hurdle, freeing the startup to pursue an ambitious and expensive ""full stack"" strategy that could catapult it into the Big Tech big leagues or spiral the AI pioneer into a financial ball of flames.

The startup said late Thursday it signed a memorandum of understanding to end a contractual fight with Microsoft. This will create a new corporate structure that helps OpenAI issue traditional equity, making it easier to raise the mountain of cash needed to pursue its dreams.

""Beyond boring corporate governance things, let's talk a little bit about the business,"" OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar said at the Goldman Sachs tech conference this week, after explaining the startup's complex restructuring. ""In terms of where we're going, think of OpenAI in terms of becoming very much a full stack company.""

By full stack, Friar means a tech company that owns and operates every part of its business. Indeed, the startup is already working on its own solutions for almost every ingredient needed for AI success. That includes designing its own chips and building its own data centers, all the way up the stack to a suite of AI-powered software applications beyond ChatGPT.

""The company, as you look forward, will become very much a full stack company, with a lot of places that we can build both moats and really interesting business models,"" Friar explained.

She didn't say it, but the target is most likely Google. The search giant has spent 25 years developing the building blocks it needs to win in AI. That includes energy assets, specialized in-house chips, massive data centers, leading AI models, talent, developer platforms, wide distribution, and billions of consumer and enterprise touchpoints.

OpenAI is a long way from Google's dominance, but the startup has several strategy beachheads from which to expand — both up and down the stack.

OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment.

At the bottom of the AI tech stack, there's energy. GPUs, AI servers, and data centers consume unprecedented amounts of power. OpenAI doesn't have a clear answer here yet; however, CEO Sam Altman has personally backed several energy startups, including Helion, which is trying to use nuclear fusion to generate electricity.

Then, there are AI chips that are essential for training and running AI models. OpenAI hired Richard Ho in late 2023 to lead its efforts here. He worked at Google for almost a decade, helping to develop the tech giant's TPUs, which power its AI models, including Gemini.

Those AI chips go in servers that are stacked inside giant data centers. OpenAI is currently working with all the major cloud providers, renting the computing power needed to train and run its models and chatbot service. However, Friar, the CFO, said on Tuesday that OpenAI will build its own data centers in the future.

""I've rarely seen scaled technology companies that don't own and operate their own infrastructure,"" Goldman Sachs internet analyst Eric Sheridan told Business Insider this week. ""This helps them control more of their own destinies over time.""

At the model layer, OpenAI has already established a beachhead, with a frontier offering, GPT-5, that is among the best. It also recently launched a powerful open-weight model.

On top of that, the startup has APIs that developers use to tap into these models. About 4 million developers have built on this OpenAI platform already.

Without broad distribution, no one will use your AI products. OpenAI is working on new ways to get ChatGPT and other services to consumers. The startup bought Jony Ive's AI gadget startup for more than $6 billion a few months ago, and executives have hinted at form factors that could mean OpenAI's chatbot follows people wherever they go. It also launched a web browser, another powerful distribution tool.

The startup is also trying to reach corporate customers, not just consumers. It already has roughly 5 million paid seats from ChatGPT business products. On Tuesday, Friar suggested that OpenAI might challenge established software companies at some point, or at least the startup's AI technology could support such disruption.

This takes OpenAI into the realm of applications, the software that sits on top of tech stacks and forms direct relationships with end users. ChatGPT has 700 million weekly average users, but the startup is looking beyond that.

In May, OpenAI hired Fidji Simo as CEO of Applications. The former Instacart CEO and Meta executive reports directly to Altman. This month, the startup brought on Vijaye Raji as CTO of Applications and acquired his startup, Statsig, for just over $1 billion.

A few days later, Simo announced the OpenAI Jobs Platform, a new service that will match tech employers with qualified candidates. It looked eerily like LinkedIn, the professional network owned by its partner Microsoft.

Goldman's Sheridan said the ultimate goal would probably look something like Google's suite of apps, which include not just Search, but also Maps, YouTube, Gmail, Calendar, Chrome, Classroom, Translate, Earth, Drive, Meet, Photos, Sheets, Docs, and Slides.

To build this entire AI stack itself and realize its dreams, OpenAI will need a mountain of cash, talent, and luck.

Sorting out its tortured corporate structure should help on the fundraising side. Indeed, without an agreement with Microsoft, OpenAI could miss out on at least $10 billion in funding from SoftBank. That cash infusion is looking a little more likely now.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

Tether, the issuer of the largest stablecoin, has named a CEO for its U.S. business and is launching a new token for U.S. institutions.

The moves underscore Tether's commitment to regulatory engagement and entry into the U.S. The company, once accused of being a criminal's ""go-to cryptocurrency"" has been rebranding itself as a partner to American lawmakers and law enforcement since pro-crypto President Donald Trump's return to the White House.

Bo Hines, who headed the Presidential Council of Advisors for Digital Assets, has been appointed CEO of Tether U.S., whose headquarters will be based in Charlotte, N.C. 

The company is also launching a token called USAT, which will be regulated in the U.S. under the GENIUS Act. While USD Tether (USDT) serves global markets, the new token is designed for businesses and institutions operating under a U.S. regulatory framework.

""For over a decade, Tether – as the creator of the stablecoin industry – has issued USDT, the backbone of the digital economy, and today the U.S dollar stablecoin for hundreds of millions of underserved people living in emerging markets, proving that digital assets can deliver trust, resilience, and freedom on a global scale,"" said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, who teased the new token to CNBC in May.

USAT will employ Tether's proprietary tokenization platform, Hadron. Crypto bank Anchorage Digital will be the issuer of USAT, and Cantor Fitzgerald will act as the reserve custodian and preferred primary dealer.

USDT was created in 2014 to be pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar and was the only stablecoin on the market for years before U.S.-regulated alternatives like Circle's USDC cropped up. It has remained the most popular and dominant stablecoin despite controversy and regulatory scrutiny over the years – largely because of the widespread adoption and liquidity its first mover advantage has afforded it.

Despite Tether's lack of presence in the U.S., the company has long held that USDT strengthens the U.S. dollar by giving people around the world access to it through the stablecoin. It also invests a significant portion of its reserves in U.S. Treasury bonds.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent echoed that earlier this year, when he said at the White House Crypto Summit that ""we are going to keep the U.S. the dominant reserve currency in the world and we're going to use stablecoins to do that.""

USDT ""is already one of the largest holders of U.S. Treasuries,"" Ardoino said. ""USAT is our commitment to ensuring that the dollar not only remains dominant in the digital age, but thrives.""

The market cap for stablecoins has grown about 34% this year, according to CryptoQuant.

In this article

Apple has postponed the launch of its new iPhone Air model in China due to regulatory issues surrounding its eSIM design, the company said.

Wireless carriers in China need a special license from the government before they can sell a new device with an eSIM, and the carriers haven't secured that approval yet, Apple said. The company added that it is working to make the device available in China as soon as possible.

Apple announced the iPhone Air at its annual event on Tuesday. The device, which is 5.6 millimeters thick, marks the first major new iPhone design since the iPhone X was introduced in 2017. The iPhone Air doesn't support a physical SIM card, and instead features an eSIM built into the device.

CEO Tim Cook told CNBC's Jim Cramer on Friday that the eSIM is what allows the device to still have ""great"" battery life.

""It's eSIM only, and so we were able to take the battery and extend the battery to areas that previously had the physical cell,"" Cook said.

The company previously said the iPhone Air would become available for preorder in the region on Friday at 2 a.m. EST before it goes on sale Sept. 19.

As of Friday morning, the iPhone Air product page on Apple's China website stated, ""Release information will be updated later.""

The website notes that China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom will offer eSIM support for the iPhone Air, ""with specific timing subject to regulatory approval.""

President Donald Trump said Friday that he will send the National Guard to Memphis, Tennessee one month after he federalized law enforcement in Washington, D.C. and deployed soldiers across the city in an effort to address crime.

""We're going to Memphis,"" Trump said on Fox News, calling the city ""deeply troubled.""

Trump said both the state's Republican Gov. Bill Lee and the Democratic mayor of Memphis, Paul Young, were ""happy"" with his plan.

""We're going to fix"" the city's troubles, Trump said of Memphis, ""just like we did Washington.""

Local affiliate ABC24 on Wednesday reported that members of the Memphis city council had been briefed on the prospect of a National Guard presence in the city.

Trump said he was inspired to prioritize Memphis by Jim Vena, the CEO of Union Pacific railroad. Vena is a former board member at FedEx, which is headquartered in Memphis. Vena stepped down from the board in 2023, when he was named to lead Union Pacific.

Trump claimed Vena said he needed to use ""an armored vehicle with bulletproof glass"" to go one block in Memphis.

The Memphis Police Department said this week that overall crime in the first eight months of 2025 is at a 25-year low. Murder hit a six-year low, the department said.

Trump said Vena also suggested St. Louis, Mo. and Chicago as potential cities that Trump should look at.

The president has previously said troops would be deployed to Chicago, despite fierce opposition to the idea from the city's mayor and the Illinois governor.

Trump did not explain what legal framework the White House would use to justify a deployment of soldiers to another U.S. city.

Washington, D.C., sued the Trump administration over its deployment of troops in the U.S. capital earlier this month, arguing that the president had exceeded his constitutional authority.

That suit came days after a federal judge blocked the administration from deploying the National Guard in Los Angeles.

During his interview Friday, Trump criticized California Gov. Gavin Newsom and said he expects to win all the court cases related to the National Guard's deployment.

""We think we're going to win all of them,"" Trump said. ""And we have been winning all of them.""

Watchmaker Swatch has launched a special edition model in a dig at U.S. President Donald Trump's punitive 39% tariffs against Switzerland.

Dubbed the ""WHAT IF...TARIFFS?"" model, the watch face switches the position of the three and nine in reference to the 39% U.S. levy imposed on Swiss imports last month.

Retailing for 139 Swiss francs ($174) and launched on Wednesday, the watch is intended as a limited edition product, a company spokesperson told CNBC.

The model, which is only available in Switzerland, was showing as out of stock on the Swiss watchmaker's website Friday.

The spokesperson added that the model was intended as a ""positive provocation"" to authorities and a firm nudge to the Swiss government to secure a better deal.

""It's in the DNA of Swatch to provoke in a positive way,"" they said via email.

""We have played with the 39% tariffs imposed on Switzerland by the United States. We hope that this activation will not last long, but that it will be as short as possible.""

""As soon as the United States changes its customs duties towards Switzerland, we will immediately stop selling this watch,"" they added.

Trump announced shock 39% levies on Switzerland on Aug. 1, among the highest set by the president globally.

The measures provoked dismay from Swiss authorities and domestic businesses who had expected a rate in line with the 10% to 15% applied to other major trading partners like the European Union and the U.K.

Swiss negotiators have since been trying to secure a better deal, with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick telling CNBC Thursday that the two countries were likely to ""get a deal done.""

Swiss watchmakers and the wider luxury industry have been hit especially hard by the duties, given their heavy reliance on U.S. consumers.

The U.S. was the biggest overseas market for Swiss watches in 2024, with exports totaling 4.37 billion Swiss francs ($5.4 billion), according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry.

The limited edition marks an addition to the company's ""WHAT IF..."" collection, which typically features colourful models that retail for around 100 Swiss francs.

Officials on Friday identified the suspected shooter of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk as Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old Utah man, following his arrest overnight.

Robinson has been booked at Utah County Jail, Gov. Spencer Cox announced at a news conference.

The announcement of Robinson's arrest came after President Donald Trump revealed earlier Friday morning on Fox News that Kirk's suspected killer was in custody.

Kirk was fatally shot on Wednesday during an outdoor event at Utah Valley University. 

The president said on Fox of Kirk's killer, ""I hope he gets the death penalty.""

Cox said at the press event that a friend of Robinson's family told the sheriff's office in Utah's Washington County on Thursday evening that Robinson had either confessed or ""implied that he had committed this incident.""

When investigators encountered Robinson in person early Friday morning, he was wearing clothing consistent with what UVU surveillance footage showed when it captured him driving onto campus before the shooting, the governor said. 

A family member told investigators in an interview that Robinson had ""become more political in recent years,"" Cox said.

The Republican governor also identified the gun police found in a wooded area where the gunman fled after shooting Kirk as a Mauser model 98 .30-06 caliber bolt-action rifle with a mounted scope.

Several casings found with the rifle had been engraved with messages, some of which appear to reference online memes and video games, Cox said.

One unfired casing was inscribed, ""hey fascist! CATCH!""

While the governor said he would leave it to others to interpret what the engravings mean, he said that one ""speaks for itself.""

That casing also showed a series of directional arrows, which could be a reference to the button input pattern that triggers a large bomb strike in the video game ""Helldivers 2.""

""This is a very sad day"" for the country, ""but I'm grateful that at this moment, we have an opportunity to bring closure to this very dark chapter in our nation's history,"" Cox said.

Kirk, 31, was the founder of conservative group Turning Point USA, which focuses its political activism on high schools and colleges. He was at UVU in Orem for the first stop on Turning Point's ""American Comeback Tour,"" according to the group's website.

Kirk was in the middle of answering an audience member's question, which was about mass shootings, when a gunman shot him once in the neck, sending thousands of people running and screaming for safety.

While the manhunt was ongoing, the FBI on Thursday released two grainy photos of a ""person of interest"" and video footage showing someone jumping off the rooftop from where Kirk was shot.

The FBI offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the killer's arrest.

Nvidia and OpenAI are in discussions about backing a major investment in Britain focused on boosting artificial intelligence infrastructure in the country.

The two tech firms are discussing a sizable deal to support data center development in the country which could ultimately be worth billions of dollars, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC, confirming earlier reporting from the Financial Times.

The companies are still working through various processes at the moment with Nvidia and cloud computing firm Nscale, said the person, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.

They added that an investment agreement has not yet been finalized. It is expected to be unveiled next week during U.S. President Donald Trump's state visit to the U.K.

Nvidia and Nscale did did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. OpenAI declined to comment on the discussions.

Countries around the world have been courting major U.S. AI players in a bid to boost their own national infrastructure and technological ambitions.

The topic of so-called ""sovereign"" AI — the idea of onshoring the data processing infrastructure behind advanced artificial intelligence systems — has been top of mind for officials as governments look to reduce their dependency on foreign countries for critical technologies.

The U.K. government declined to comment when asked by CNBC about the investment discussions with OpenAI, Nvidia and Nscale. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is set to join Trump on his state visit to Britain next week.

Earlier this year, the Nvidia boss called the U.K. an ""incredible place to invest"" and said his multitrillion-dollar chipmaker would boost investment in the country. ""The U.K. is in a Goldilocks circumstance,"" Huang said at the time in a panel discussion with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

Russia's suspected drone attacks on Poland are widely seen as part of a ""salami-slicing"" strategy designed to test the West's resolve.

Salami-slicing, in geopolitical terms, refers to the process of taking a series of incremental steps to further one's strategic position, without provoking a major counter response.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is said to have frequently deployed this tactic to probe NATO's defensive alliance, with analysts citing the recent violation of Estonia's airspace, the quiet expansion of Russia's border further into Georgia and the invasion of Crimea in 2014.

Moscow's unprecedented violation of Polish airspace is said to be yet another salami-slicing example.

In the early hours of Wednesday, Poland said it scrambled its own and NATO aircraft to take down some of the 19 Russian drones that entered its airspace. It marked the first such instance since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Western allies swiftly condemned what they described as a deliberate provocation, while Russia's Defense Ministry said it did not plan to attack any targets in Poland.

The Kremlin, meanwhile, has said it won't be making any further comment on the situation, dismissing statements by Poland and other European countries about the drone incursion into a NATO ally as ""nothing new.""

The Russian Embassy in London and Russia's Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Benjamin Godwin, partner at risk consultancy PRISM Strategic Intelligence, said it has been quite clear that Russia's war games strategy is to prod, push and test the West.

Part of the problem for NATO, Godwin said, is that it has long been evident that the defensive alliance does not want to get into a direct conflict with Russia, which in turn, has created an asymmetric effect for Russia.

""We've seen incursions, for example into Estonian airspace, obviously this incursion into Poland [and] we've seen electronic warfare all across Europe,"" Godwin told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Friday.

""So, Russia is able to sort of escalate in these very, as we say in the U.K., salami-slicing ways and NATO has proven incapable so far in responding in any effective way to stop these efforts.""

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on Wednesday said a full assessment of Russia's drone incursion into Poland is ongoing, adding that he was ""really impressed"" with how allies responded.

In the wake of Russia's drone incursion into Poland, NATO allies have taken steps to bolster defenses on Europe's eastern flank, touted the prospect of further economic sanctions and convened an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting for Friday.

Analysts, however, have suggested that only a robust political and military response will be enough to deter Putin.

Godwin, for instance, called on NATO to rethink its defensive posture and the kind of assets that it deploys on Europe's eastern flank.

Oksana Nechyporenko, a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center, warned that the softer the West's reaction to Russia's violation of Polish airspace, the harder the next blow will be.

""Ukrainians have been saying for years that Putin is not only waging war against Ukraine, but against the West—Europe in particular,"" Nechyporenko said.

""He is simply testing tactics, always using the 'salami strategy': he tries something outrageous, waits for the world's reaction, and if there is none, he pushes further,"" she added.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday offered an ambiguous response to Russia's drone incursion into Poland this week.

""What's with Russia violating Poland's airspace with drones? Here we go!"" Trump said in a social media post, without elaborating any further.

The U.S. president followed up his comments on Truth Social by telling reporters at the White House that Russia may have made a mistake.

""It could have been a mistake, but regardless, I'm not happy about anything having to do with that whole situation,"" Trump said on Thursday.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk appeared to take exception to Trump's latest remarks. In a social media post, Tusk said on Friday: ""We would also wish that the drone attack on Poland was a mistake. But it wasn't. And we know it.""

Trump has previously asked the EU to hit China and India with tariffs of up to 100% over the countries' Russian oil purchases, seeking to cut off a major source of revenues funding Putin's war machine.

In this article

The European Union on Friday said it has accepted commitments from Microsoft to unbundle its Teams workplace communication platform from its popular productivity apps.

The decision essentially exempts Microsoft from receiving a potentially hefty antitrust fine after the company was last year accused by the European Commission — the executive body of the EU — of breaching competition rules with the ""abusive"" bundling of its Teams and Office products.

""With today's decision, we make binding for seven years or more Microsoft's commitments to put an end to its tying practices that may be preventing rivals from effectively competing with Teams,"" Teresa Ribera, executive vice-president for clean, just and competitive transition, said in a statement.

Under the commitments, which Microsoft first unveiled in May, the U.S. software giant will make versions of its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 software suites available at a reduced price without Teams, as well as allow customers with long-term licenses to switch to suites without Teams.

The company will also provide interoperability between tools that compete with Teams and certain Microsoft products and allow clients to move data out of Teams to competing products.

Microsoft has subsequently also offered to make further commitments to resolve its competition concerns after the European Commission market-tested the firm's initial pledges.

They included increasing the price difference between some Microsoft 365 and Office 365 suites without Teams and those with Teams by 50% and clarifying that Microsoft websites advertising a suite with Teams should display the corresponding offer without it.

""We appreciate the dialogue with the Commission that led to this agreement, and we turn now to implementing these new obligations promptly and fully,"" Nanna-Louise Linde, vice president of European government affairs, said in a statement Friday.

The EU first opened an antitrust investigation into Microsoft in July 2023 following a complaint by Salesforce-owned Slack, which has a rival chat service to Teams. Slack was acquired by Salesforce for $27.7 billion in 2021.

Sabastian Niles, Salesforce's chief legal officer, said the European Commission's announcement sends the message that Microsoft's tying of Teams with Office ""harmed businesses, denied customers fair choice, and resulted in many years of lost competition.""

""This settlement is a meaningful step forward, and we applaud the Commission's efforts to hold Microsoft accountable,"" Niles told CNBC.

In this article

David Ellison is making good on his promises.

A little more than a month into his tenure as the CEO and chairman of the newly merged Paramount Skydance, Ellison has moved quickly to sign creative and C-suite talent, greenlight new franchises, and strike a billion-dollar deal for the rights to bring a lucrative sport to the company's streaming service.

Ellison laid out the strategy in an open letter published in early August, when he told investors that Paramount would invest in ""high-quality storytelling and cutting-edge technology"" to help ""define the next era of entertainment.""

That next era could also include the acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery. On Thursday, CNBC reported that Paramount Skydance is working with an investment bank to make an offer for the company. The deal would likely be a costly one, but would secure Ellison's media empire.

""They are clearly in a very necessary rebuilding mode, but this will take time and a significant amount of investment,"" said Jessica Ehrlich, analyst at Bank of America. ""Paramount was starved, literally starved, for so long under the previous several management teams. So, there's going to be probably a prolonged period of deep investment in content.""

Paramount finally merged with Skydance in early August, a union that was delayed for more than a year as the Federal Communications Commission launched an inquiry into alleged news distortion at Paramount's subsidiary CBS.

The union was approved less than a month after Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to President Donald Trump to settle a lawsuit he filed against the company over the editing of a ""60 Minutes"" interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris.

It also occurred the week after CBS announced it was canceling ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert."" At the time, Paramount and CBS executives released a statement saying the cancellation was ""purely a financial decision against the challenging backdrop in late night.""

Ellison hit the ground running. Within just a few weeks of the merger closing, he announced a seven-year, $7.7 billion deal to make Paramount the exclusive U.S. home for TKO Group's UFC mixed martial arts organization starting in 2026. The agreement means UFC will stop its pay-per-view model and events will be available directly to Paramount+ subscribers and, in some cases on CBS. Notably, this deal was nearly as expensive as the $8 billion merger between Paramount and Skydance.

Sports rights will be scarce in the coming years, as companies have already struck deals for broadcast and streaming for many major leagues. Apple is already expected to be the home of Formula 1, and Major League Baseball is waiting until its deals expire after the 2028 season to reorganize its media packages. That means it's unlikely there will be many other top-shelf sports assets available in the marketplace for Paramount to acquire in the near term.

""UFC is a unicorn asset that comes up about once a decade,"" Ellison said in a statement at the time. He described himself as a UFC fan.

UFC is a desirable asset because events take place year-round, meaning fans will keep paying for monthly subscriptions and have less incentive to cancel seasonally than they do with other sports. There are 43 live events annually, consisting of 350 hours of live programming. Paramount is interested in buying UFC's international rights to pair with U.S. rights.

""They're looking to change the narrative, and the UFC deal alone is a big splash,"" said Robert Fishman, analyst at MoffettNathanson.

And Paramount+ isn't the only division of Paramount getting new content from big franchises. Ellison secured the rights to develop, produce and distribute a live-action feature film based on Activision's Call of Duty video game franchise.

Call of Duty has been the bestselling video game series in the U.S. for 16 consecutive years, with more than 500 million copies sold globally, the companies said.

""I can promise that we are resolute in our mission to deliver a cinematic experience that honors the legacy of this one-in-a-million brand,"" Ellison said when it was announced, noting that he is a ""lifelong fan"" of the first-person shooter video game series, having logged countless hours playing the games.

For decades, studios have tried to capitalize on the financial success and cultural relevance of video games, but it's only been in the past few years that things have clicked. Paramount has already turned Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog into a billion-dollar movie franchise and will also distribute a new Street Fighter adaptation as part of a three-year distribution deal with Legendary.

Legendary is also no stranger to video game franchises, having co-produced Warner Bros.' ""A Minecraft Movie,"" and ""Pokémon: Detective Pikachu."" Notably, the third Dune film due out in 2026 and a new Godzilla and King Kong film slated for 2027 are not part of the Paramount deal and will be distributed by Warner Bros. Discovery.

Paramount will also bring the creative team of Matt and Ross Duffer, known in the industry as the Duffer brothers, into the fold in mid-2026. The duo, best known for being the masterminds behind Netflix's hit ""Stranger Things,"" signed an exclusive four-year agreement for feature films, television and streaming projects.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. The Duffer brothers' producing partner, Hilary Leavitt, will also be on board to develop projects for Paramount Pictures, Paramount Television and Paramount's direct-to-consumer business.

On Wednesday, the company announced it hired Dane Glasgow, who previously worked at Meta, Google, eBay and Microsoft, as Paramount's chief product officer. The company said the appointment underscores its commitment to technological development alongside its entertainment content push.

Bank of America's Ehrlich noted that it will take several years for Paramount to ramp up its production. The number of releases from the studio is expected to double. However, there may not be a noticeable financial difference from these changes right away and, in the meantime, these investments will likely weigh on the stock, she said.

Of course, if Paramount goes ahead with its bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, which CNBC's David Faber reports could come as early as next week, the company's slate could grow even bigger. Bringing Warner Bros. Discovery into the fold would not only add major franchises like DC superheroes, Sonic the Hedgehog, Harry Potter and Game of Thrones to Paramount's collection, but also a laundry list of sports rights like the National Hockey League, Major League Baseball and NASCAR.

Analysts are looking forward to Paramount's November earnings report, when Ellison is expected to address the new company's strategy in more depth. This includes Paramount's cost-cutting measures, in which it is looking to take $2 billion out of the conglomerate amid advertising losses and industrywide struggles with traditional cable networks.

During the company's second-quarter earnings call this year, Andrew Warren, the interim chief financial officer, noted that ""it would be inappropriate"" for the company to outline full-year 2025 financial expectations amid the Skydance transition.

""The economics of the business are changing and so the question is, how are they pivoting their new company to align with the realities of the ecosystem that they're working in?"" Fishman said.

Variety reported last month that the company is expected to lay off between 2,000 and 3,000 employees. These cuts are slated to take place by early November, Variety reported.

Earlier this month, Ellison announced Paramount would be requiring employees to work in the office five days a week starting next year and said employees who did not want to make that transition were offered buyouts. This move could help the company thin the herd ahead of these looming staffing cuts.

""David Ellison's young and he's got a long-term point of view,"" Ehrlich said. ""This is clearly a long-term strategy, as opposed to prior management teams that had very, very, very short-term focus.""

LONDON — It's been a busy week for the European technology sector.

On Tuesday, London-headquartered artificial intelligence startup ElevenLabs announced it would let employees sell shares in a secondary round that doubles its valuation to $6.6 billion.

Then, Dutch chip firm ASML on Wednesday confirmed it was leading French AI firm Mistral's 1.7 billion-euro Series C funding round at a valuation of 11.7 billion euros ($13.7 billion) — up from 5.8 billion euros last year. Mistral is considered a competitor to the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic.

To cap it off, Swedish fintech firm Klarna on Thursday debuted on the New York Stock Exchange after a long-awaited initial public offering. Klarna shares ended the day at $45.82, giving it a market value of over $17 billion.

These developments have revived hopes that Europe is capable of developing a tech industry that can compete with the U.S. and Asia. For the past decade, investors have been talking up Europe's potential to build valuable tech firms, rebuffing the idea that Silicon Valley is the only place to create innovative new ventures.

However, dreams of a ""golden era"" of European tech never quite came to fruition.

A key curveball came in the form of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which caused inflation to soar and global central banks to hike interest rates as a result. Higher rates are considered bad for capital-intensive tech firms, which often need to raise cash to grow.

Ironically, that same year, Klarna — which at one point was valued as much as $45.6 billion in a funding round led by SoftBank — had its market value slashed 85% to $6.7 billion.

Now, Europe's venture capital investors view the recent buzz around the region's tech firms as less of a renaissance and more of a ""growing wave.""

""This started 25 years ago when we saw the first signs of a European tech ecosystem inspired by the original dotcom boom that was very much a Silicon Valley affair,"" Suranga Chandratillake, partner at Balderton Capital, told CNBC.

Balderton has backed a number of notable European tech names including fintech firm Revolut and self-driving vehicle tech developer Wayve.

""There have been temporary setbacks: the 2008 financial crisis, the post-Covid tech slump, but the ecosystem has bounced back stronger each time,"" Chandratillake said.

""Right now, the confluence of a huge new technological opportunity in the form of generative AI, as well as a community that has done it before and has access to the capital required, is, unsurprisingly, yielding a huge number of sector-defining companies,"" he added.

Investors backing the continent's tech startups say there's plenty of money to be made — particularly amid the economic uncertainty caused by President Donald Trump's trade tariffs.

For one, there's a clear discount on European tech right now. Venture firm Atomico's annual ""State of European Tech"" report last year pegged the value of the European tech ecosystem at $3 trillion and predicted it will reach $8 trillion by 2034. Compare that to the story in the U.S., where the tech sector's biggest megacap stocks combined are worth over $20 trillion.

""Ten years ago, there wasn't a single European startup valued at over $50 billion; today, there are several,"" Jan Hammer, partner at Index Ventures, which has backed the likes of Revolut and Adyen, told CNBC.

""Tens of thousands of people now have firsthand experience building and scaling global companies from companies such as Revolut, Alan, Mistral and Adyen,"" Hammer added. ""Crucially, European startups are no longer simply expanding abroad — they are born global from day one.""

Amy Nauikoas, founder and CEO of fintech investor Anthemis, suggested that investors may be viewing Europe as something of a safe haven market amid heightened geopolitical risks and macroeconomic uncertainty.

""This is an investing opportunity for sure,"" Nauikoas told CNBC. ""Macroeconomic dislocation always favors early-stage entrepreneurial disruption and innovation.""

""This time around, trends in family office, capital shifts ... and the general constipation of the U.S. institutional allocation market suggest that there should be a lot more money flowing from ... global investors to U.K. [and] European private markets.""

Despite the bullish sentiment surrounding European tech, there remain systemic challenges that make it harder for the region's tech firms to achieve the scale of their U.S. and Asian counterparts.

Startup investors have been pushing for more allocation from pension funds into venture capital funds in Europe for some time. And the European market is highly fragmented, with regulations varying from country to country.

""There's really nothing that stops European tech companies to scale, to become huge,"" Niklas Zennström. CEO and founding partner of early Klarna investor Atomico, told CNBC.

""However, there's some conditions that make it harder,"" he added. ""We still don't have a single market.""

Several tech entrepreneurs and investors have backed a new initiative called ""EU Inc."" Launched last year, its aim is to boost the European Union's tech sector via the formation of a ""28th regime"" — a proposed pan-European legal framework to simplify the complex regulations across various individual EU member states.

""Europe is in a bad headspace at the moment for quite obvious reasons, but I don't think a lot of the founders who are there really are,"" Bede Moore, chief commercial officer of early-stage investment firm Antler, told CNBC.

""At best, what you can say is that there's this secondary tailwind, which is that people are feeling galvanized by the need for Europe to ... be a bit more self-standing.""

In this article

South Korean memory chipmaker SK Hynix said Friday that it was ready to mass produce its next-generation high-bandwidth memory chips, staying ahead of rivals and sending the company's stock soaring. 

HBM is a type of memory that is used in chipsets for artificial-intelligence computing, including in chips from global AI giant Nvidia — a major client of SK Hynix. 

SK Hynix said earlier this year that it had shipped samples of its HBM4 chips to customers, as it sought to beat competitors including Samsung Electronics and Micron Technologies.

According to its announcement Friday, the company has finished its internal validation and quality assurance process for HBM4 and is ready to manufacture those at scale.

""Completion of HBM4 development will be a new milestone for the industry,"" said Joohwan Cho, head of HBM development at SK Hynix.

HBM4 is the sixth generation of HBM technology — a type of Dynamic Random Access Memory, or DRAM. DRAM can be found in personal computers, workstations and servers and is used to store data and program code.

SK Hynix's latest HBM4 product has doubled bandwidth and increased power efficiency by 40% compared to the previous generation, according to the company.  

Notably, HBM4 is expected to be the main AI memory chip needed for Nvidia's next-generation Rubin architecture — a more powerful AI chip for global data centers — said Dan Nystedt, vice-president at TriOrient, an Asia-based private investment firm with a focus on semiconductors.

""SK Hynix is a key supplier for Nvidia, and the announcement shows it remains far ahead of rivals,"" he said.

Samsung Electronics and Micron have struggled to catch up to SK Hynix in HBM, as it builds on its segment leadership and benefits from being Nvidia's main HBM supplier. 

However, the companies have made some progress. Micron has also shipped samples of its HBM4 products to customers, while Samsung has reportedly been working to get its HBM4 chips certified by Nvidia. 

""Despite the shifting competitive landscape, we anticipate SK Hynix will maintain a commanding position, potentially securing around 50% of the HBM market share by 2026,"" said MS Hwang, research director at Counterpoint Research, covering memory solutions.

SK Hynix shares rose more than 7% Friday to hit their highest since 2000, following its chip announcement, bringing year-to-date gains to nearly 90%. Shares of Samsung Electronics and Micron have risen over 40% and nearly 80% in 2025, respectively.

SK Hynix posted record operating profit and revenue for its June-quarter, thanks to strong HBM demand, which accounted for 77% of its overall revenues. The company's market capitalization has increased by more than $80 billion since the start of the year, according to data from S&P Capital IQ.

The firm expects to double HBM sales for the full year compared to 2024, and for demand from AI to continue to grow into 2026.

Gen Z employees are not only embracing artificial intelligence, but they're also driving adoption of the technology in many workplaces, a new survey showed.

Nearly two-thirds of younger employees are actively helping older colleagues in adopting and learning to use AI tools, according to a June poll of over 2,000 professionals across the United States and the United Kingdom by hybrid workspace operator International Workplace Group.

""This support often takes different forms from hands-on guidance to sharing practical tips to integrate AI into daily workflows,"" founder and CEO of International Workplace Group Mark Dixon told CNBC Make It.

The knowledge exchange is reshaping collaboration. About half of the employees surveyed say AI is helping bridge generational divides.

Four in five senior directors said that the partnership with their younger colleagues allows them to focus on ""higher-value tasks,"" while 82% credited these innovations with unlocking new business opportunities, according to the same report by the Swiss-based company, which was published on Sept. 3.

""Our research shows that older colleagues are showing real openness to AI and, just as importantly, to learning from younger generations,"" said Dixon, whose London-listed company owns brands like Regus, Spaces and HQ.

""What makes this dynamic so impactful is its reciprocity. Younger employees are using their digital fluency to guide colleagues and introduce new ways of working, while senior colleagues contribute their experience, industry knowledge, and more strategic perspectives,"" said Dixon.

By teaching others, Gen Z workers are also building on their own AI skills. ""This two-way exchange not only bridges generational divides but also flattens traditional hierarchies,"" said Dixon.

Overall, many employees are embracing AI's potential to boost efficiency.

Of the 2,016 office workers surveyed, 86% said AI has made them more efficient, and 76% believe it helps their careers, rising to 87% among Gen Z respondents. In addition, most workers surveyed report that the technology is saving them time, with an average of 55 minutes gained each day.

The technology has also become important to how hybrid teams operate, with 69% of hybrid workers saying AI makes teamwork across locations easier. 46% of respondents cited benefits such as improved meeting preparation, while 36% said it improved access to shared insights and stronger post-meeting follow-ups.

Some common areas employees are using AI include drafting emails, taking meeting notes, organizing files, data entry and completing forms. With these tasks automated, employees can spend more time on more high-impact and meaningful work, according to the report.

""In today's digital-first era, AI is emerging as a powerful unifier across generations,"" said Dixon. ""This active exchange of knowledge and skills is bringing generations closer, fostering open collaboration, ultimately helping to build a stronger, more resilient team.""

 Spot Ether ETFs recorded over $230 million in net inflows as of Thursday, recovering from last week's net outflows of nearly $800 million. 

Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw strong demand this week, recording more than $1.7 billion in inflows before the trading week closes on Friday. 

SoSoValue data showed that the ETFs had a strong week, with Wednesday having nearly $800 million in inflows. As of Thursday, the ETF tracker showed that spot Bitcoin ETFs already had $1.7 billion in net inflows this week.

The strong performance marks the ETFs' biggest weekly total in nearly two months, highlighting renewed confidence in the asset class. 

The strong ETF inflows came as Bitcoin (BTC) climbed back to $115,000, up 4.5% from its $110,000 price last Friday. 

Spot Ether ETFs also had a strong week, recording over $230 million in net inflows as of Thursday. This is a sharp asset class recovery after nearly $800 million in outflows last week. 

While ETH ETFs recover, corporate treasury holder BitMine continued to stack up Ether (ETH) purchases this week. On Monday, BitMine purchased 202,500 ETH, which sent its holdings to the 2 million ETH milestone. The company made a follow-up purchase on Wednesday, buying $200 million in ETH from Bitgo. 

Data from the Strategic ETH Reserve website shows that BitMine currently holds over 2 million ETH, worth $9.3 billion at the time of writing. 

The ETH data tracker also shows that in total, ETH reserve companies hold nearly 5 million ETH, worth about $22.1 billion. 

Meanwhile, ETF issuers hold 6.6 million ETH, worth nearly $30 billion, to back the assets. This means that almost 12 million ETH, nearly 10% of the circulating supply are held by institutions.

The broader crypto market also crossed $4.1 trillion again this week, a level previously reached in July and August. 

Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao highlighted the milestone on X, comparing the combined value of the entire crypto space to Nvidia, which stands at roughly $4.3 trillion, according to 8marketcap. 

“The combined market cap of all future money is less than one chip company's market cap. You do the math,” Zhao wrote.

Bitcoin's tight supply and ETF flows signal a massive rally. Watch for sentiment spikes and leverage buildup to catch the parabolic move to $200K+

One of the dominant narratives this cycle has been that “this time is different.” With institutional adoption reshaping Bitcoin's supply and demand dynamics, many argue that we won't see the kind of euphoric blowoff top that defined past cycles. Instead, the idea is that smart money and ETFs will smooth out volatility, replacing mania with maturity. But is that really the case?

Skeptics often dismiss tools like the Fear and Greed Index as too simplistic, arguing that they can't capture the nuance of institutional flows. But writing off sentiment ignores a fundamental truth that institutions are still run by people, and people remain prone to the same cognitive and emotional biases that drive market cycles, regardless of how deep their pockets are!

Even though volatility has dampened compared to earlier cycles, the move from $15,000 to over $120,000 is far from underwhelming. And crucially, Bitcoin has achieved this without the kind of deep, extended drawdowns that marked past bull markets. The ETF boom and corporate treasury accumulation have shifted supply dynamics, but the basic feedback loop of greed, fear, and speculation remains intact.

It's not just Bitcoin that's susceptible to parabolic runs, bubbles have been part of markets for centuries. Asset prices have repeatedly surged beyond fundamentals, fueled by human behavior. Studies consistently show that stability itself often breeds instability, and that  quiet periods encourage leverage, speculation, and eventually runaway price action. Bitcoin has followed this same rhythm. Periods of low volatility see Open Interest climb, leverage build, and speculative bets increase.

Contrary to the belief that “sophisticated” investors are immune, research from the London School of Economics suggests the opposite. Professional capital can accelerate bubbles by piling in late, chasing momentum, and amplifying moves. The 2008 housing crisis and the dot-com bust were not retail-driven, but led by institutions.

ETF flows this cycle provide another powerful example. Periods of net outflows from spot ETFs have actually coincided with local market bottoms. Rather than perfectly timing the cycle, these flows reveal that “smart money” is just as prone to herd behavior and trend following investing as retail traders.

Meanwhile, looking at global markets shows how capital rotation could ignite another parabolic leg. Since January 2024, Gold's market cap has surged by over $10 trillion, from $14T to $24T. For Bitcoin, with a current market cap around $2T, even a fraction of that kind of inflow could have an outsized effect thanks to the money multiplier. With roughly 77% of BTC held by long-term holders, only about 20–25% of supply is readily liquid, resulting in a conservative money multiplier of 4x. That means new inflows of $500 billion, just 5% of gold's recent expansion, could translate into a $2 trillion increase in Bitcoin's market cap, implying prices well over $220,000.

Perhaps the strongest case for a blowoff top is that we've already seen parabolic rallies within this very cycle. Since the 2022 bottom, Bitcoin has staged multiple 60–100%+ runs in under 100 days. Overlaying those fractals onto current price action provides realistic outlines of how price could reach $180,000–$220,000 before year-end.

The narrative that institutional adoption has eliminated parabolic blowoff tops underestimates both Bitcoin's structure and human psychology. Bubbles aren't an accident of retail speculation; they are a recurring feature of markets across history, often accelerated by sophisticated capital.

This doesn't mean certainty, markets never work that way. But dismissing the possibility of a parabolic top ignores centuries of market behavior and the unique supply-demand mechanics that make Bitcoin one of the most reflexive assets in history. If anything, “this time is different” may only mean that the rally could be bigger, faster, and more dramatic than most expect.

U.S. spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have recorded their highest weekly inflows since July after conceding ground to Ethereum funds, which have finally cooled off from a period of record-level activity.

As per SoSoValue data, Bitcoin ETFs tallied $552.78 million  in daily total net inflows on Sept. 11, bringing the weekly total to a square $1.7 billion.

It marks day four of an inflow streak that began with modest figures. On Sept. 10, Bitcoin funds charted $757.14 million in daily net inflows, a two-month high.

From mid-July up until the end of August, Ethereum ETF dominance and mixed macroeconomic signals in the U.S. saw investors move away from BTC.

This certainly played a role in suppressing BTC's price amid a broader market shakeout.

However, with anticipation of positive news from the U.S. Federal Reserve this month, as well as news that leading BTC ETF fund issuer, BlackRock, is considering tokenizing its many ETF offerings, institutional attention has returned to the premier crypto, for now.

Bitcoin's price has responded well to this upward momentum and is trading up 2.22% for the past 7 days at $115,001.

As per SoSoValue, Ethereum ETFs recorded $113.12 million  in daily total net inflows on Sept. 11, marking day four of a modest inflow streak that now totals $328.82 million.

Minus the outflows at the start of the week, this brings ETH ETFs' weekly total net inflows to $232.14.

After a historical 5-month inflow streak that garnered over $11 billion, funds have finally cooled off.

September's figures are currently running red, with $555.6 million in monthly total net outflows so far.

Despite this, the ETH token has held strong and is trading up 2.5% in the past 7 days at $4,512 .","{'href': 'https://www.ccn.com', 'title': 'CCN.com'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Bitcoin in consolidation as treasuries eye altcoins: Novogratz","https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-consolidation-altcoin-treasury-growth-2025","Fri, 12 Sep 2025 06:33:52 GMT","

 Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz says Bitcoin could surge again as the US Federal Reserve restarts its cutting cycle, with momentum also coming from regulatory reform. 

Bitcoin has likely been trading sideways as corporations have focused on stacking altcoins lately, though there could be an upswing coming later in the year, says Mike Novogratz, CEO of asset manager Galaxy Digital.

“Bitcoin's at a consolidation right now. Partly because you're seeing a lot of these treasury companies in other coins take their shot,” said Novogratz during an episode of CNBC's Squawk Box on Thursday.

Blockchain tech firm BitMine Immersion Technologies has been leading the pack among altcoin treasury firms, recently buying $200 million Ether (ETH) and growing its stockpile to over $9 billion in ETH. 

Meanwhile, Nasdaq-listed design and manufacturing company Forward Industries said on Monday it had secured $1.65 billion in cash and stablecoin commitments to launch a Solana (SOL) focused crypto treasury strategy. 

Novogratz said deals like this, led by crypto-native companies Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto and Multicoin Capital, are “bringing energy into the crypto space” and “bringing money into the crypto space.” 

Bitcoin has been drifting between $110,055 and $116,083 in the last seven days, according to CoinGecko.

Novogratz said a Bitcoin surge could come back as the US Federal Reserve starts its “cutting cycle,” and also from the continued positive developments in the space, such as Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins talking about modernizing the securities regulations to help move markets onchain. 

The Galaxy Digital CEO also pointed to the Nasdaq stock market operator filing for a rule change with the SEC on Monday to allow tokenized versions of listed stocks and exchange-traded funds.  

“This blockchain revolution had really just been Bitcoin as a store of value. And then stablecoins as cross-border payments,” Novogratz said.

Novogratz also predicts that despite “healthy competition” between different crypto firms, it's unlikely there will ever be just one company that takes over, which can happen in the traditional finance world.

“Ethereum has its own community and and its own narrative and its own use case. Yes, it will compete against Solana and other blockchains, but it's not like we're going to have one blockchain to rule them all,” he said.

The cryptocurrency market is ending the week largely in the green, backed by Bitcoin (BTC) surging above $116,000 and correcting slightly toward the $115,000 level on Friday. Altcoins, led by Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH), continue to sustain the bullish outlook, hinting at the much-anticipated altcoin season. 

As the crypto market generally edges higher, investors are looking to position themselves amid a wide selection of tokens with the potential to rally.

The cryptocurrency bull cycle is often categorized into two: The Bitcoin bull cycle and an altcoin season. A Bitcoin bull cycle refers to a period characterized by a sustained rally in the price of BTC, backed by increased investor interest, confidence and high trading volume. 

During this period, Bitcoin experiences a significant increase in value, while altcoins generally lag. Bitcoin bull cycles often set the tone for a broader rally in the cryptocurrency market.

As for the altcoin season, this is a period when alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) experience significant price surges, outperforming Bitcoin in terms of market gains. Investors tend to shift their focus from Bitcoin during this period, eyeing higher returns as prices, capitalisations and trading volume increase.

According to CoinGlass, the altcoin season begins when the Altcoin Season Index hits 75. According to the chart below, the index is currently at 78, suggesting that the altcoin season has commenced.

Several 'Made in USA' tokens, including Solana and Chainlink (LINK), are worth watching for potential entry opportunities as the altcoin season commences.

Solana has since increased by 53% from early August to exchange hands at $239 at the time of writing on Friday. The token maintains a robust technical structure, positioned significantly above key moving averages, including the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $195, the 100-day EMA at $182 and the 200-day EMA at $274.

A buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, sustained since Wednesday on the daily chart, implies bullish momentum is building. The subsequent uptrend in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 69 indicates steady buying pressure, with more traders seeking to increase their exposure.

SOL/USDT daily chart

Interest in Solana goes beyond retail traders, with institutions such as Forward Industries raising funds toward SOL-focused treasuries. If demand for Solana steadies in the coming days and weeks, a breakout toward its record high of $296 could be in the offing.

Chainlink bulls are largely in control, supported by multiple bullish signals, including the MACD indicator's buy signal, which is on the cusp of confirmation on the daily chart.

A slightly upward slope of the RSI at 58 reinforces the bullish grip as buying pressure increases. Higher RSI readings toward overbought territory suggest that bullish momentum is building, increasing the chances of a sustainable uptrend.

Key levels for traders include the seller congestion at $27.83, which was tested on August 22, and the supply area at around $30.93, previously tested in mid-December.

LINK/USDT daily chart

Chainlink's position above the upward-facing 50-day EMA at $21.86, the 100-day EMA at $19.74 and the 200-day EMA at $18.08 underpins the strong investor conviction in the current uptrend. These same moving average levels could serve as tentative support if profit-taking causes instability and an extended pullback in the LINK price.

Token launches influence demand and adoption among market participants. Listings on crypto exchanges deepen the liquidity for an asset and add new participants to an asset's network. This is typically bullish for a digital asset. 

A hack is an event in which an attacker captures a large volume of the asset from a DeFi bridge or hot wallet of an exchange or any other crypto platform via exploits, bugs or other methods. The exploiter then transfers these tokens out of the exchange platforms to ultimately sell or swap the assets for other cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. Such events often involve an en masse panic triggering a sell-off in the affected assets.

Macroeconomic events like the US Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates influence crypto assets mainly through the direct impact they have on the US Dollar. An increase in interest rate typically negatively influences Bitcoin and altcoin prices, and vice versa. If the US Dollar index declines, risk assets and associated leverage for trading gets cheaper, in turn driving crypto prices higher.

Halvings are typically considered bullish events as they slash the block reward in half for miners, constricting the supply of the asset. At consistent demand if the supply reduces, the asset's price climbs.

Some of the biggest gainers today as HASH, IP, and PUMP.

Bitcoin's price took a sharp turn for the worse yesterday when it was rejected at $113,000 and pushed south by over two grand. However, the bulls are making a return as of press time.

Most of the larger-cap alts are quite sluggish on a daily scale, but many of the mid and lower caps are exploding.

The primary cryptocurrency has endured enhanced selling pressure around the $113,000 mark for the past several days. Recall that the asset surged to and just over that level last Friday, after the release of the latest US jobs report. However, it was rejected immediately and driven south by over three grand in less than an hour.

After a few days of consolidating around the $110,500 level, the bulls went on the offensive once again on Monday and especially on Tuesday, pushing bitcoin to $113,200. The scenario repeated once again, as the bears reemerged and didn't allow a breakout.

In the following hours, the digital asset dropped to $110,800 (on Bitstamp) before the bulls came back to play. They initiated another leg up on Wednesday morning, which drove BTC to almost $113,000 as of press time.

Its market cap has slipped to just under $2.250 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts sits at 56.1%.

As mentioned above, most of the larger-cap alts have failed to produce any big moves in the past 24 hours. ETH, XRP, ADA, LINK, SUI, and XLM are slightly in the red, while SOL, DOGE, HYPE, TRX, and AVAX are with minor gains.

The situation down the board is much different. HASH has taken the spotlight today with a 33% surge to over $0.037. IP (21%), PUMP (14%), and MNT (12.5%) complete the double-digit price gainers club.

The total crypto market cap has remained at essentially the same level as yesterday at around $4 trillion on CG.

The crypto market is seemingly re-entering a bullish phase, as evidenced by the recent rise of Bitcoin, which reached the $115,000 mark. This is likely going to translate into growth for the altcoins as the weekend comes closer.

BeInCrypto has analysed three such altcoins that are likely going to note gains owing to external developments along with broader market bullishness.

NOBODY's price has shown steady gains since the start of August, currently trading at $0.087. The cryptocurrency remains below the key $1.000 resistance level, which continues to act as a strong barrier. Sustained momentum above this threshold could open the path for broader bullish sentiment among traders.  

Nobody Sausage's collaboration with boxing champion Terrence Crawford is expected to be revealed this weekend, generating anticipation in the crypto market. Such high-profile partnerships often act as catalysts for the altcoin's price. If investor optimism strengthens, NOBODY could attempt a rally toward the $0.1000 resistance, testing long-term breakout potential.

On the downside, profit-taking by investors could weigh on the altcoin, pushing NOBODY toward the $0.070 support. This level remains critical for sustaining the current uptrend. A breakdown below $0.070 would undermine bullish momentum, potentially dragging the price to $0.056, which would significantly weaken the positive market outlook.  

TON price is facing challenges near the $3.18 resistance, a level that has capped gains in recent sessions. Trading at $3.19, if $3.18 is secured as support, it may establish stronger buying pressure and support renewed optimism for sustained growth.  

Toncoin recently revealed plans for a partnership with a major platform, fueling expectations of a breakout. Such developments often serve as catalysts for altcoin rallies. Successfully securing $3.18 as support could drive TON toward $3.34, its highest level in two weeks, potentially opening the door for further bullish momentum.  

However, downside risks remain if investors decide to sell at current levels. In that scenario, TON could slip through $3.18 and consolidate below it, signaling a lack of upward conviction. Extended selling pressure might send the cryptocurrency toward $3.00, a decline that would challenge bullish traders and weaken the positive market outlook.  

MYX price shocked traders this week with a 1,290% surge, setting a new all-time high of $19.98. Despite this rally, the cryptocurrency corrected sharply, dropping 26% in the last 24 hours. Such volatility reflects heightened speculative activity, with investors closely monitoring support and resistance levels for further direction.  

Currently trading at $15.76, MYX shows potential for recovery if it holds above the $11.52 support. A successful rebound from this zone could fuel renewed momentum, helping the altcoin retest its previous peak. 

If selling pressure builds as investors secure profits, MYX could break below $11.52, signaling weakening momentum. This decline may trigger a fall toward $3.45, erasing recent gains and invalidating the bullish outlook.

Newswise — With the rapid development of digital technology, the application of blockchain in construction engineering and management (CEM) is gradually expanding. However, the current presentation of blockchain-based data management processes (DMP) is overly primitive, which restricts the widespread promotion of blockchain technology in the CEM field. To address this issue, Liupengfei WU, Weisheng LU, Louis CHU, and Chen CHEN have jointly conducted a research entitled ""Visualizing blockchain in construction projects: Status quo, challenges, and a guideline for implementation"".

This study aims to provide a set of guidelines for visualizing blockchain-based DMP in CEM. First, a conceptual model was proposed to guide the research design. Then, 49 cases published in scholarly papers were reviewed, revealing that dashboards are increasingly used to visualize blockchain-based DMP. Meanwhile, four challenges in blockchain visualization were identified, including data diversity, visualization tools, visualization mediums, and visualization domain. Finally, guidelines for visualizing blockchain in construction projects were put forward, which include five steps: (1) targeting the visualization domain, (2) planning the blockchain visualization, (3) choosing a visualization tool, (4) selecting a visualization medium, and (5) fine-tuning the visualization solution. The research also demonstrated and assessed the guidelines in a real case of a high-rise residential building project in Hong Kong that adopts modular integrated construction, verifying the effectiveness of the guidelines in enhancing users' trust in blockchain systems and promoting the application of blockchain in CEM.

The paper ""Visualizing blockchain in construction projects: Status quo, challenges, and a guideline for implementation"" is authored by Liupengfei WU, Weisheng LU, Louis CHU, and Chen CHEN. It is published in Front. Eng. Manag. 2025, 12(3): 467–486, with the DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/s42524-024-4034-6 and open access at link.springer.com and journal.hep.com.cn.

Christie's has shuttered its digital art department, ending a short-lived but influential experiment that saw Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have a place alongside paintings, sculptures, and other works in the auction house's art sales, according to a report from Now Media.

Two staffers were let go at the end of August, including vice president of digital art Nicole Sales Giles, while specialist Sebastian Sanchez will remain in New York.

Giles played a prominent role in Christie's Art+Tech Summit in Hong Kong last year, which ran alongside Hong Kong Fintech Week.

Giles had been a prominent face of Christie's digital push, notably at the Art+Tech Summit in Hong Kong last year, which ran alongside Hong Kong Fintech Week.

There she argued that Christie's brought the same valuation discipline to NFTs as it did to paintings or sculptures, but with one critical difference.

""What's unique with digital art is the community engagement aspect, which absolutely comes into play in a way it never has with traditional art,” she said at the time.

Others at the summit acknowledged that the category was still far from mature.

“I do not think at this very moment we have a very standardized understanding of [digital art's] value,” said Angelle Siyang-Le, director of Art Basel Hong Kong last year. “That's why you do see a lot of it all of a sudden coming out, and then obviously created that excitement. That excitement created that awareness. And now from here to the next phase … how do we align such standards of values?”

A year later, the numbers show how fragile that foundation was.

NFT trading volume fell 45% last quarter to $867 million, even as sales counts rose 78% to 12.5 million, according to DappRadar.

Floor prices for blue chip NFT collections have slipped well below their peak levels: CryptoPunks trade around 46.6 ETH ($210,000), Bored Apes hover at 9.1 ETH ($41,000), and Moonbirds sit at 2.8 ETH ($12,600). By contrast, Ethereum itself has rallied 76% in the past three months to $4,509, outpacing the NFT market.

On X, some observers argued that Christie's decision reflects simple economics rather than capitulation, noting that NFTs are increasingly being absorbed into mainstream contemporary sales rather than treated as a separate “collectible” category.

This retreat by Christie's hints that without firmer valuations and clearer standards, NFTs risk remaining an add-on to contemporary art rather than sustaining a market of their own.

12 September 2025 • Share —          

Christie's has ended their romance with NFTs and Digital Art by closing their dedicated digital art department, a unit set up in 2022 with great fanfare at the height of the NFT boom. The move, described as a “strategic reformatting,” signals a recalibration of how the auction house intends to handle digital works in the future. Sales will continue, but folded into the broader twentieth- and twenty-first-century categories. Christie's blockchain sales platform, Christie's 3.0, remains operational.

The shake-up comes with staffing changes. Vice president and head of digital art sales, Nicole Sale Giles, departed the New York–based team in August, while sales manager Sebastian Sanchez will remain as a specialist within the restructured framework. The position of digital art coordinator Anna Roszak has yet to be clarified. The decision leaves questions about Christie's annual Art+Tech Summit, a flagship event launched in 2018. Its July edition went ahead as planned, but the auction house has declined to confirm whether the summit will continue.

Christie's has played a high-profile role in legitimising digital practice within the art market. In 2018, it startled the industry by selling Obvious's AI-generated portrait Le Comte de Belamy for $432,500—forty times its estimate. Then, in 2021, Beeple's Everydays: The First 5000 Days* sold for $69.3 million, propelling NFTs into headlines and drawing a new cohort of collectors. Christie's 3.0 subsequently hosted auctions with artists including Tyler Hobbs, Sasha Stiles, and the Ethiopian collective Yatreda, while museums such as MoMA acquired key NFT (Digital Editions) works.

British artist Robert Alice, whose Portraits of a Mind became the first blockchain-based work to be auctioned by a major house, described Christie's role as “pioneering.” He credits the company with having taken an early leap of faith at a moment when digital art was far from accepted.

Yet despite these milestones, the commercial returns of Christie's digital arm have been modest. Since its launch, the platform has held eleven auctions, averaging just seventeen lots apiece, none surpassing $400,000 in total sales. Even this year's Augmented Intelligence sale, which featured high-profile names such as Refik Anadol and Holly Herndon, fell short of expectations and provoked debate about the value of AI-driven art.

The downturn reflects wider market realities. The NFT sector has endured a steep contraction since its 2021 peak, with speculative buyers retreating and Ethereum prices failing to buoy sales figures. In this context, Christie's retreat is unsurprising: what once appeared to be the future of the art market now demands rethinking.

Reaction from the digital art community has been mixed. Some artists expressed disappointment, seeing the closure as a step back after years of hard-won validation. Others view it more positively—as a sign that digital art no longer requires its own silo, and that collectors increasingly expect to encounter it alongside painting, sculpture, and photography.

Dealer and curator Sofia Garcia suggests Christie's withdrawal might encourage a subtler, more integrated approach from auction houses. Robert Alice goes further, framing the move as evidence of Web3's independence: “The traditional model was never fully aligned with decentralised culture. New institutions are being built elsewhere, and collectors are choosing where they want to be.”

*The digital artist Mike Winkelmann—better known as Beeple—began a discipline that would shape his career and alter the conversation around contemporary art. Each day, he made and posted a new image, refusing to miss a single one, a routine that continued without interruption for over thirteen years. The resulting body of work, more than five thousand separate digital drawings and compositions, eventually coalesced into Everydays: The First 5000 Days.

Christie's took the project into uncharted territory when it offered the entire cycle as a single digital collage in March 2021. Minted as an NFT and sold in a single-lot auction, the work fetched $69.3 million, a figure that stunned even seasoned observers of the market. The sale was unprecedented: it was the first time a major auction house presented a purely digital work underpinned by a blockchain token guaranteeing authenticity, and the first to accept cryptocurrency—Ether—as payment.

Every day quickly became more than a sale. It was a cultural flashpoint, sparking fierce debates around the legitimacy of digital art, the volatility of NFTs, and the spectacle-driven machinery of the art market itself. For some, it marked the belated recognition of a medium long dismissed at the margins; for others, it signalled the arrival of speculation dressed up as progress.

The ICO analyzed 215 personal data breach reports caused by insider attacks from the education sector between January 2022 and August 2024.

It found that more than half of all insider cyberattacks are caused by students and almost a third of these are caused by students guessing weak passwords or finding them written down on paper. Students were responsible for 97 percent of all attacks caused by stolen log in details.

The ICO says that of the 215 incidents it analyzed, 23 percent were caused by poor data protection practices such as devices being left unattended, or students being given access to staff devices. 

Only five percent of incidents were caused by insiders using sophisticated techniques to bypass security and network controls.

The ICO highlighted the example of a school in which three Year 11 students were caught unlawfully accessing its information management system. The students said they had an interest in IT and cybersecurity and were looking to test their skills and knowledge, having downloaded tools from the internet to break passwords.

Another student was caught unlawfully accessing a school's information management system by using a staff member's login in an incident that was reported to the police, the ICO and Action Fraud.

“Whilst education settings are experiencing large numbers of cyber attacks, there is still growing evidence that ‘insider threat' is poorly understood, largely unremedied, and can lead to future risk of harm and criminality,” warns Heather Toomey, Principal Cyber Specialist at the ICO. 

“What starts out as a dare, a challenge, a bit of fun in a school setting can ultimately lead to children taking part in damaging attacks on organizations or critical infrastructure. 

“It's important that we understand the next generation's interests and motivations in the online world to ensure children remain on the right side of the law and progress into rewarding careers in a sector in constant need of specialists.” 

The ICO advises schools to take steps to improve their cybersecurity and data protection practices and remove temptation from students.

Deputy Editor, Infosecurity Magazine

Over half (57%) of insider data breaches in UK schools are caused by students, with many children being set up for “a life of cybercrime,” a new report from the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has found.

The regulator analyzed 215 personal data breach reports caused by insider attacks in the education sector between January 2022 and August 2024.

Around a third (30%) of these incidents were caused by stolen login details. Students were responsible for 97% of such attacks, using tactics such as guessing weak passwords or finding them jotted down on bits of paper.

In one example  highlighted in the investigation, three Year 11 students, which encompasses the ages 15-16, unlawfully accessed a secondary school's information management system, which held personal information of more than 1400 students. The hackers used tools downloaded from the internet to break passwords and security protocols.

When questioned, the students said they wanted to test their cyber skills and knowledge, with two of them admitting that they belong to an online hacker forum.

In another case, a student unlawfully accessed a college's information management system, then viewed, amended or deleted personal information belonging to more than 9000 staff, students and applicants. Access was gained through a staff member's login details.

“Children are hacking into their schools' computer systems – and it may set them up for a life of cybercrime. That's the warning from us, as we have spotted a worrying pattern behind the culprits responsible for personal data breach reports from schools,” the ICO wrote in the study published on September 11.

The findings come after the National Crime Agency (NCA) reported that one in five children aged 10 to 16 have engaged in illegal activity online.

In 2024, the youngest referral to the NCA's Cyber Choices program, an initiative encouraging people to use cyber skills in a legal way, was a seven-year-old child.

The ICO urged parents to have regular conversations with their children about their online activities and the choices they are making.

Heather Toomey, Principal Cyber Specialist at the ICO, commented: “It's important that we understand the next generation's interests and motivations in the online world to ensure children remain on the right side of the law and progress into rewarding careers in a sector in constant need of specialists.” 

Former white hat hacker and chief security evangelist, Veracode, Chris Wysopal, argued that the ICO findings are a consequence of the limited entry-level opportunities in cybersecurity.

""Many of the pupils engaging in this behaviour aren't hardened criminals, but curious minds testing boundaries in a safe environment,"" he said.

""Not every teenager who experiments with passwords or systems should be branded a criminal for life. Instead, schools and the wider industry need to do more to channel this curiosity into legitimate cyber careers. The same curiosity that leads to mischief in the classroom can, with the right guidance, become the foundation of a vital skillset the UK desperately needs in its cyber workforce,"" Wysopal added.

The ICO report found that 23% of insider breaches in schools were caused by poor data protection practices. These include staff accessing or using data without a legitimate need, devices being left unattended and students being allowed to use staff devices.

A fifth (20%) of incidents were caused by staff sending data to personal devices, while 17% were attributed to incorrect set up or access rights to systems such as SharePoint.

Insiders using sophisticated techniques to bypass security and network controls were identified in 5% of insider breaches.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","Vortex FX (VFX Token): The Only Crypto ICO Backed by a $40M Licensed Trading Firm","https://coincentral.com/vortex-fx-vfx-token-the-only-crypto-ico-backed-by-a-40m-licensed-trading-firm-why-is-it-different/","Fri, 12 Sep 2025 14:00:06 GMT","

In a market where 90% of ICOs fail within their first year, VFX Token (VFX) enters with an unprecedented advantage: it's backed by Vortex FX, a licensed trading firm already managing over $40 million in client assets. This isn't another whitepaper dream or venture capital gamble – it's a profitable business expanding into blockchain.

While other presales showcase fancy websites and roadmap promises, Vortex FX presents audited financials and regulatory compliance. Licensed in St. Lucia with operations from London, the firm processes 1,500+ trading lots daily across forex, gold, and cryptocurrency markets. Each trade generates real revenue that flows directly into VFX Token's ecosystem.

Consider what this means: when you invest in VFX Token at $0.06, you're buying into an infrastructure that already exists. The trading terminals? Operational. The payment systems? Processing millions daily. The compliance framework? Approved and active. No other ICO in 2025 offers this level of established business backing.

The difference between Vortex FX and typical crypto projects is like comparing a profitable restaurant chain to someone's food truck idea. One has proven operations, established customers, and consistent revenue. The other has hopes and a business plan.

Vortex FX brings institutional credibility that crypto desperately needs:

What makes VFX Token revolutionary isn't just the backing – it's how Vortex FX bridges traditional finance with DeFi innovation. Token holders gain access to zero-fee premium trading accounts, normally reserved for high-net-worth clients. The integration of Visa and Mastercard functionality means spending your 67.7% APY staking rewards anywhere, instantly.

This isn't the theoretical utility promised for 2026. VFX Token holders can literally trade forex markets, stake for yields that embarrass traditional banking, and spend profits via crypto-powered payment cards – today. While competitors build MVPs, Vortex FX operates a full-scale trading operation.

In crypto's trust crisis, where rug pulls and failed projects dominate headlines, VFX Token offers something invaluable: accountability. Vortex FX has a registered UK office, published company number (15602241), and public-facing executives. They can't disappear overnight because they have a real business, real licenses, and real regulatory oversight.

The recent $500K raised from private investors wasn't based on hype – it was due diligence by professionals who verified the operations, examined the books, and recognized the opportunity. When people who investigate investments for a living choose VFX Token, retail investors should pay attention.

At the presale price of $0.06, targeting a $1.00-$1.20 exchange listing, early investors position for 20-24x returns. But unlike speculative moonshots, this projection is based on comparable valuations of licensed financial service providers entering crypto. When traditional finance meets blockchain, valuations explode – just ask anyone who bought Coinbase at $1.

VFX Token isn't asking you to believe in a vision. It's inviting you to participate in a profitable reality. In a market full of promises, only one ICO has $40 million already at work.

The meme coin project that lets you mine actual meme coins, PepeNode (PEPENODE), has hit the $1 million mark in its ICO.

PepeNode gives users the ability to mine tokens like Pepe (PEPE), Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), and more with its mine-to-earn concept, which is a first for a meme coin.





And unlike most presales, PepeNode gives buyers a way to participate early by staking their allocations and earning an enhanced rewards multiplier that will boost their mining power once the full system launches.

That means early buyers don't just hold tokens and wait; they can actually use the project before the native token PEPENODE officially goes live.

Right now, entry is at $0.0010533 per token – though in 30 hours, that window closes and the price climbs.

The most well-known example of meme coin mining is Dogecoin (DOGE), which runs on proof-of-work. That means buying expensive rigs and paying high electricity costs, only to be outpaced by massive firms with far greater hashpower.

Other meme coins built on chains like Ethereum or Solana aren't mineable at all since both rely on proof-of-stake. In those cases, “earning” usually just means staking tokens for yield – no rigs involved, but also no interaction beyond locking tokens away.

Some projects offer farming or liquidity incentives, but that's still yield farming, not mining.

PepeNode is different. It doesn't need mining rigs, but it's also not the passive lock-and-wait model of staking. Instead, it blends both worlds with the first virtual mine-to-earn system in crypto. Investors can design their own mining setup inside a gamified dashboard, and the way they configure it directly impacts their rewards.

Here's how it works: users buy Miner Nodes with PEPENODE tokens, each node carrying its own properties. Nodes can be combined and upgraded to increase hashpower, and every upgrade triggers a 70% burn of the tokens used, which reduces the token's total supply.

The better the setup, the greater the yield in PEPENODE, and eventually, other meme coins like PEPE and FARTCOIN.



Another way PepeNode breaks the mold is by eliminating the long product lead time that plagues most ICOs. In a typical presale, investors secure allocations but then sit idle for weeks or even months before tokens and associated utility arrive – a lull that kills momentum and often drags prices down after exchange listings.

PepeNode avoids that trap. By staking presale tokens now, buyers earn a dynamic 1,349% APY while also activating a rewards multiplier that carries over into the mine-to-earn system when it launches. Tiered node rewards further amplify early participation, giving those who join earliest the highest mining rates.

Presale buyers may also gain access to bonuses post-TGE, including rewards in meme coins like PEPE and FARTCOIN, adding another incentive layer on top of staking yields.



And that momentum carries into exchange trading. As mentioned, every time tokens are spent to upgrade a virtual mining setup, the burning mechanism is triggered, which permanently removes them from circulation.

Over time, the reduction in supply makes the remaining tokens more valuable, which is a dynamic similar to Ethereum's EIP-1559 upgrade in 2021 that burns the base fee of every transaction.

The difference here, however, is scale because while ETH burns a fraction of each transaction, PepeNode wipes out 70% of tokens used in upgrades, creating much more impactful deflationary pressure.

With only 210 billion PEPENODE minted, each node purchase or facility upgrade compounds the scarcity.

Even under a medium-adoption scenario – for example, 50 billion tokens cycled through the system – roughly 35 billion would be destroyed.

That's a 16–17% supply cut, which alone could mathematically support a 20% price lift from today's presale level of $0.0010533.

No surprise then that Jacob Crypto Bury, one of crypto's better-known influencers, is already calling for a 10x run on PEPENODE.

﻿

Now that the model is clear, it's time to gear up and join the presale. Head to the PepeNode website to buy today using ETH, BNB, USDT (ERC-20 and BEP-20), or even credit/debit cards.

Buyers can connect with the wallet of their choice, such as Best Wallet – a WalletConnect-certified platform widely recognized as one of the best crypto and Bitcoin wallets in the space.

PepeNode is already listed on Best Wallet's Upcoming Tokens screening tool, making it easy to buy, track, and claim directly in-app once the project goes live.

On top of that, the project's smart contract has been fully audited by Coinsult, giving early adopters added confidence in the code's security.

Fraudsters are already using multiple schemes to exploit Russia's new digital ruble, well in advance of its full-scale implementation, scheduled to begin next September.

According to stakeholders quoted by the Russian press, it will take another year or two to develop a working mechanism for banks to return stolen digital cash to their owners, which they are obliged to do.

Fraudsters are usually very quick to take advantage of new financial systems and technologies, and Russia's central bank digital currency (CBDC) is no exception.

As soon as its wider adoption begins, crooks will adapt, employing social engineering, interface forgery and user manipulation, according to Vladimir Chernov, analyst at the Freedom Finance Global brokerage.

Speaking to the Russian daily Izvestia, he elaborated:

“The main focus will not be on hacking the technology, but on psychological pressure, for example, calls allegedly made by bank employees, fake applications or links, suggested transfers to a ‘safe account'.”

While the digital ruble is still being tested, bad actors are already employing several schemes with the new form of national fiat, Meri Valishvili, associate professor at the Department of Public and Municipal Finance of the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics told the newspaper.

Fraudsters are now offering potential victims to convert their regular money into digital currency at a favorable exchange rate, for example, while the digital ruble hasn't yet entered mass circulation.

They are also trying to convince citizens that transferring their savings from their bank account to a digital ruble wallet is mandatory. Others try to make them believe they need the fake digital tokens to make payments.

Another scheme involves a phone call from a criminal who presents themselves as an employee of the Federal Tax Service (FNS), informing the victim of a tax evasion fine that needs to be paid only with digital rubles, added Andrey Barkhota, an independent expert.

At the same time, transactions with Russia's CBDC will be much easier to control, noted Anatoly Aksakov, chair of the Committee on Financial Markets at the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament.

Experts interviewed by Izvestia agree. The design of the digital ruble, as a platform fully controlled by the state, allows all transactions to be permanently recorded and makes it easier to identify fraud-related flows, explained Vladimir Chernov.

Russian banks will have to compensate their clients for damages caused by fraudsters, Aksakov also emphasized. They will be responsible for returning the digital cash to the owners when the coins have been transferred to accounts blacklisted by the Central Bank of Russia (CBR).

While tracking a digital ruble transfer should not be hard, getting the money back from the recipient will still be a difficult task, according to Alexey Lukatsky, an information security consultant at the Moscow-based cybersecurity firm Positive Technologies.

The victim will have to wait for months, if not years, for a court decision. At the same time, a mechanism allowing banks to recover digital rubles they have already sent to fraudsters will most likely be in place in 2027 – 2028 at the earliest, Chernov expects.

Fraudsters stole 6.3 billion rubles (nearly $75 million) from Russians in the second quarter of this year, according to the CBR. New legislation introduced to combat such crime has been criticized for undercutting crypto use and trading in the country.

Trials with the digital ruble, with a limited number of participants, started in 2023. Initially planned for 2025, the full launch of the CBDC was recently rescheduled for next fall, with the approval of the State Duma, and will be carried out in stages starting from September 1, 2026.

						Despite the value proposition of stablecoins, the ability to convert into useable currency remains the biggest hurdle.
					

Opinion on the future of cryptocurrency remains divided and dogmatic. The protagonists see it transforming the global payments system. The sceptics see it as a solution in search of a problem.

Let's leave Bitcoin as a payments vehicle to one side. It has clearly found a substantial niche in catering for the payments requirements of drug gangs, smugglers, scammers, kidnappers, evaders of tax and capital controls, and money launderers – in short, it is the payments system of choice for the very substantial global illegal economy, replacing the cumbersome inefficiency of suitcases of banknotes. But for everyday transactions and transfers, Bitcoin doesn't provide a useful payments function, either domestically or internationally.

The existing range of stablecoins doesn't seem up to the task.

It has been suggested, including on The Interpreter, that stablecoins might provide the crypto-based payments solution. Stablecoins are digital currency with a fixed value against a conventional currency (usually the US dollar), in theory backed by conventional assets such as government securities.

The existing range of stablecoins doesn't seem up to the task. Their value, in theory stable, is not assured. Terra and Luna lost most of their value, and even the largest stablecoin – Tether – has been fined for false statements about its backing. For those who are squeamish about their associations, stablecoins have the same potential for nefarious use as Bitcoin. Tether was the vehicle for a huge UK money-laundering scheme and its proponents laud its privacy and ability to avoid regulation.

As stablecoins currently bypass the requirements of know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering, the authorities will either have to give up on these requirements (which is unlikely) or enforce them on cyber-currencies, which would remove their main attraction of anonymity.

President Trump's Genius Act may possibly address these issues, with regulations for combating money-laundering and other illicit activity. Stablecoins may be issued by institutions with unquestionable integrity: for example, JP Morgan plans to issue one.

If these issues are resolved, stablecoins might seem to have some advantages over the bank-based international payments system. The bank system is, indeed, very complicated. It involves multiple links: SWIFT intermediates a secure transfer message (it is not, itself, a payments system); the sending bank must have a trusted correspondent bank in the foreign country; then there is an exchange rate transaction, which will in turn require a two-way transaction via the US dollar to make the conversion using the deep US foreign-exchange markets and the Fedwire/CHIPS payments systems; and then the usual domestic payments infrastructure completes the transaction by shifting the money from the correspondent bank to the recipient's bank. All this complexity has a cost. As the banks were, until recent years, the only way of making these transfers securely, there was a heavy monopoly levy as well. Big customers got better rates, but small transfers – workers' remittances – paid exorbitantly.

Stablecoins could bypass some of this complexity. If the recipient had a wallet for the same stablecoin as the sender, stablecoins could be purchased and the transfer would be simple and secure. The hitch is that the recipient would still have to convert the stablecoin into local currency before they could make a purchase. Who will exchange a JP Morgan stablecoin for local currency (and what commission will they charge)?

Where crypto could potentially find a useful payments role is in the form of a central bank digital currency.

While the crypto promoters are trying to find an answer for this exchange problem, the bank-based system has taken note of the emerging alternatives. What do monopolists do when they are confronted by competition? They learn to compete. In recent years, commercial banks and other traditional payments systems have given far better exchange rates than formerly. For example, Wise will make a remittance transaction swiftly and with a favourable exchange rate, without going through any stablecoin links.

In short, stablecoins may have other uses (perhaps as a programable currency to facilitate commercial transactions), but are uncompetitive for international transfers.

Where crypto could potentially find a useful payments role is in the form of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Central banks' digital currency is already the key element in the domestic payments system. A CBDC could be used in international transactions to bypass both SWIFT and the need for a foreign correspondent bank. Some central banks are already experimenting with CBDCs to make international transfers to foreign central banks, but no central bank would allow its CBDCs to be held by the general public, as this would present a major threat to the stability of the conventional banking system.

America is, unsurprisingly, not rushing to support an innovation that might undermine the dollar's global role. The Genius Act specifically prohibits the US Federal Reserve from developing a CBDC. Without a US CBDC, it is hard to see how a CBDC-based global payments system could rival the existing arrangements.

The crypto industry's year just keeps getting better and better. Gemini, the firm founded by billionaire twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, is expected to start trading on Nasdaq Friday. It priced its IPO at $28 a share, $2 above the top end of its range, raising $425 million. Gemini probably could've gotten more given investor appetite, but it decided to cap its proceeds.

Written byShigeki Mori

Edited byOihyun Kim

SBI Holdings is overhauling its digital and technology initiatives. It is ending a crypto-custody venture with Zodia Custody and launching a global equity fund targeting Web3, AI, and other transformative sectors. 

The dual move reflects a strategic pivot toward scalable technology-driven opportunities under Japan's evolving regulatory environment.

SBI Holdings and London-based Zodia Custody have agreed to dissolve their joint venture in Japan about two years after its creation. The decision follows internal reviews of priorities by both parties. Zodia Custody, backed by Standard Chartered, had been preparing an application with Japan's Financial Services Agency but never proceeded. 

Japan remains challenging for foreign crypto firms, given strict oversight shaped by past incidents such as the 2024 DMM Bitcoin breach exceeding approximately $2.04 billion and the earlier Mt. Gox collapse.

According to Bloomberg, SBI spokesperson Kosuke Kitamura stated that the decision does not indicate a withdrawal from digital asset services or Asia. Instead, it aims to accelerate group-wide digital strategies. Zodia Custody continues to expand in other markets, including a recent acquisition of Tungsten Custody Solutions in the United Arab Emirates.

SBI Asset Management will begin operating the SBI Next-Generation Technology Strategy Fund on September 17. The fund invests in global equities across emerging sectors, including Web3, blockchain, decentralized finance, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and nuclear-fusion energy. Initially focusing on these themes, the portfolio will adjust as technologies and market conditions evolve.

Offered through SBI Securities, the fund carries an annual trust fee of 0.99%, which ranks among the lowest for comparable actively managed technology funds in Japan. By targeting industries that may reshape global markets, the fund seeks to provide investors with diversified exposure and medium—to long-term capital growth.

These simultaneous actions highlight a broader shift among Japanese financial institutions seeking to balance digital asset risk with opportunities in advanced technology. SBI's exit from a crypto-specific joint venture and its launch of a forward-looking investment vehicle show a calculated strategy to capture technological innovation while operating within a regulated framework. 

The two developments are connected by SBI's broader goal of reallocating resources away from direct crypto custody's high regulatory and security risks toward diversified technology investments that still encompass blockchain and Web3 potential.

Tether, the company behind the world's most popular stablecoin, USDT, unveiled a U.S.-regulated, dollar-backed token called USAT and appointed Bo Hines as head of its American division.

Anchorage Digital, a federally regulated crypto bank, will serve as the token's issuer, while Cantor Fitzgerald will manage the reserves. The token will debut later this year, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said on stage at event in New York on Friday.

Hines, a lawyer and former director of the White House Crypto Council advising President Donald Trump on crypto policies, will lead Tether's new U.S entity.

The move marks Tether's first foray to create a stablecoin for U.S. oversight, aiming to compete with U.S.-based issuers such as Circle (CRCL), Paxos and Ripple. Stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies tied to fiat money like the U.S. dollar, are increasingly popular as a payments alternative and is projected to potentially grow into a trillion-dollar market in the next years from the current $270 billion. The expansion was bolstered by the recently enacted GENIUS Act, the law setting federal rules for stablecoin issuers.

Tether's USDT stablecoin has grown into a $169 billion asset with hundreds of millions of users worldwide. It is particularly popular in emerging markets, where high banking fees and inflation push people toward digital dollars. It has, however, faced questions from regulators and policymakers about oversight and transparency.

The new USAT token is being framed as a product for U.S. businesses and institutions, backed by disclosed reserves and meeting the requirements of U.S. standards.

""By building USAT with compliance, transparency and innovation at its core, we are ensuring that the dollar remains the foundation of trust in the digital asset space,"" Hines said in a statement.

Talking to media, Ardoino and Hines said that Anchorage and Cantor will be shareholders in the newly-established U.S. entity and share the revenue from the USAT token's reserve assets, though details are yet to be finalized.

Tether plans to run U.S. operations in Charlotte, North Carolina, while keeping its international headquarters in El Salvador, they added.

UPDATE (Sep. 12, 16:18 UTC): Adds further details from the New York event.

Solana SOL$239.87 ripped higher on Friday, hitting its strongest price since January as digital asset treasury demand could be taking shape.

The token rallied 5% over the past 24 hours to just shy of $240. It has extended weekly gains to 18% and vastly outperformed bitcoin BTC$115,864.38 and ether (ETH), which advanced just 4%-5% over the same period.

The gains occurred as digital asset manager Galaxy Digital withdrew some 3.1 million in SOL tokens from exchanges, predominantly from Binance and Coinbase, through the last two days, worth a total of $724 million, blockchain data by Arkham Intelligence showed.

The transactions may have to do with Forward Industries (FORD), the digital asset strategy company with a $1.65 billion cash pile to build a Solana treasury. Galaxy was a lead investor in the fundraising round, while its asset management division was tasked to ""actively manage"" Forward's war chest, according to a press release.

Solana's outperformance could continue, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan forecasted earlier this week, as incoming demand from treasury companies and spot ETF anticipation could have an outsized impact and SOL, given its smaller market capitalization compared to bitcoin BTC$115,864.38 and ether (ETH).

Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy, echoed that view in a Thursday CNBC interview, saying that the market could be entering the ""season of SOL."" He pointed to crypto investment firm Pantera's upcoming Solana treasury company and the potential approval of SOL ETFs, bringing in fresh money for the crypto.

His firm also chose the Solana blockchain to tokenize its stock with Superstate earlier this month.

CleanCore Solutions (ZONE) surged in pre-market trading Friday after announcing it purchased more than 200 million dogecoin DOGE$0.2727, pushing its total holdings past 500 million tokens.

At DOGE's current price of $0.26, up 6% in the past 24 hours, those 500 million tokens are worth about $130 million.

The move is part of the company's plan to build a treasury of one billion DOGE within 30 days. The strategy was unveiled earlier this month alongside a $175 million private placement involving over 80 investors. Participants included Pantera Capital, GSR and FalconX, all well-known digital asset firms.

Earlier this week, Cleancore disclosed an initial purchase of 285 million DOGE, signaling the start of its accumulation effort. The latest buy suggests the company is ramping up quickly toward its one billion-token target.

 The former White House crypto adviser, who joined Tether in August, will become CEO of its planned US-regulated, dollar-backed stablecoin project. 

Tether announced a new dollar-backed stablecoin and said former White House crypto adviser Bo Hines will become CEO of Tether USAT. 

The new stablecoin will be consistent with the reserve requirements and compliance standards of the recently passed GENIUS stablecoin bill, and will use Tether's Hadron real-world asset tokenization platform, according to a Friday announcement.

Stablecoins recently crossed the $270 billion milestone, according to RWA.XYZ. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said:

Stablecoins have become a geostrategic policy issue for the administration of US President Donald Trump and are quickly becoming a focus in other countries such as  China.

Bo Hines resigned from the White House Crypto Council in August, signaling his return to the private sector. 

Hines made the announcement days after the White House released its Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology report, outlining the future of crypto policy in the US, which included an entire section on stablecoins and payments.

In March, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that stablecoins are a tool for the US to maintain dollar hegemony by making the dollar easier to access through digital rails.

Overcollateralized stablecoins buy the debt of the government that issues the underlying fiat currencies for their digital tokens.

This allows the government more leeway to cushion the effects of inflation by spreading the currency to more holders to meet the increased demand.

New stablecoin regulations in Hong Kong are attracting a host of banks and financial institutions that want to issue yuan-backed stablecoins. 

A senior adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin recently accused the US  government of using stablecoins to devalue its debt.

 Hacken's Stephen Ajayi told Cointelegraph that basic wallet hygiene and endpoint hardening are essential to defend against threats like ModStealer. 

A newly-discovered malware called ModStealer is targeting crypto users across macOS, Windows and Linux systems, posing risks to wallets and access credentials.

Apple-focused security firm Mosyle uncovered the malware, saying it remained completely undetected by major antivirus engines for almost a month after being uploaded to VirusTotal, an online platform that analyzes files to detect malicious content, 9to5mac reported.

Mosyle said ModStealer is designed to extract data, with pre-loaded code that steals private keys, certificates, credential files and browser-based wallet extensions. The security researchers found targeting logic for different wallets, including extensions on Safari and Chromium-based browsers. 

The security firm said the malware persists on macOS by abusing the system to register as a background agent. The team said the server is hosted in Finland but believes the infrastructure is routed through Germany to mask the operators' origin.

The malware is reportedly being distributed through fake job recruitment ads, a tactic that has been increasingly used to target Web3 developers and builders. 

Once users install the malicious package, ModStealer embeds itself into the system and operates in the background. It captures data from the clipboard, takes screenshots and executes remote commands. 

Stephen Ajayi, DApp and AI audit technical lead at blockchain security firm Hacken, told Cointelegraph that malicious recruitment campaigns using fraudulent “test tasks” as a malware delivery mechanism are becoming increasingly common. He warned developers to take extra precautions when asked to download files or complete assessments. 

“Developers should validate the legitimacy of recruiters and associated domains,” Ajayi told Cointelegraph. “Request that assignments be shared via public repositories, and open any task exclusively in a disposable virtual machine with no wallets, SSH keys or password managers.”

Emphasizing the importance of compartmentalizing sensitive assets, Ajayi advised teams to maintain a strict separation between their development environments and wallet storage. 

“A clear separation between the development environment ‘dev box' and wallet environment ‘wallet box' is essential,” he told Cointelegraph.

Ajayi also stressed the importance of basic wallet hygiene and endpoint hardening to defend against threats like Modstealer. 

“Use hardware wallets and always confirm transaction addresses on the device display, verifying at least the first and last six characters before approving,” he told Cointelegraph.

Ajayi advised users to maintain a dedicated, locked-down browser profile or a separate device exclusively for wallet activity, interacting with only the trusted wallet extensions. 

For account protection, he recommended offline storage of seed phrases, multifactor authentication and the use of FIDO2 passkeys when possible.

 CleanCore's DOGE buy comes as the first DOGE spot ETF was delayed twice and is now expected to launch sometime next week. 

CleanCore Solutions, a maker of aqueous ozone cleaning systems, has reached the halfway point of its 1 billion Dogecoin treasury target after buying $130 million in DOGE on Thursday. 

In an announcement on Thursday, Cleancore said it has now crossed over 500 million Dogecoin (DOGE). It had just bought 285.42 million DOGE on Monday and had previously stated that it intends to purchase 1 billion tokens in total within the next 30 days.

“Crossing the 500 million DOGE threshold demonstrates the speed and scale at which ZONE is executing its treasury strategy,” said CleanCore's chief investment officer, Marco Margiotta.

Margiotta is also the CEO of House of Doge, the commercial arm of the Dogecoin Foundation. 

Margiotta further added that the company intends to “establish Dogecoin as a premier reserve asset while supporting its broader utility across payments, tokenization, staking-like products, and global remittances.”

CleanCore Solutions was the first publicly traded company to establish a DOGE treasury in partnership with the Dogecoin Foundation and House of Doge. 

On Sept. 3, the company announced it will raise $175 million via private placement, with the proceeds being used to buy DOGE for its treasury. The announcement caused CleanCore Solutions' stock to crater by 60%.

The company successfully closed its private placement two days later on Sept. 5.

CleanCore DOGE buy comes as DOGE is up nearly 23% in the past seven days, according to CoinGecko.

Shares of CleanCore Solutions (ZONE) ended Thursday's trading session at $3.98, down 0.25%; however, the stock rallied 11.81% during the after-hours trading session to end at $4.45, according to Google Finance.

Despite the recent price swings, ZONE is up 201.52% year-to-date.

For the June quarter, the company announced its revenue was up 26% year-on-year, while its net profit margin was down 229% during the same period.

Rex-Osprey Doge ETF (DOJE), the first spot DOGE exchange-traded fund, was set to launch on Thursday.

 Despite a marginal recovery in the price of Bitcoin, the majority of bull market indicators for Bitcoin have now turned red, suggesting “momentum is clearly cooling.” 

Bitcoin bull market indicators have turned predominantly bearish despite Bitcoin registering a slight recovery on Friday to $116,000, according to CryptoQuant.  

Eight out of ten of the CryptoQuant Bull Score Index indicators are flashing bearish for Bitcoin, and “Momentum is clearly cooling,” CryptoQuant analyst JA Maartun said on Thursday. 

The blockchain analytics platform's bull score signals are made up of ten indicators, and only two of them are still bullish: “Bitcoin demand growth” and “Technical signal.”

Bitcoin demand growth is a measure of how much demand there is in the market for the asset, and it has been bullish since July, while the “technical signal” appears to track common technical analysis indicators and metrics. 

However, the rest — MVRV-Z score, profit and loss index, bull bear cycle indicator, inter exchange flow pulse, network activity index, stablecoin liquidity, trader onchain profit margin and trader realized price — are all in the red.

The MVRV-Z score is the market value to realized value, which measures the ratio of BTC price compared to its realized value. Profit and loss indexes show how much of the supply is in profit, cycle indicators show current sentiment, and exchange flow pulse indicates how much of the asset is being moved to and from exchanges. 

The last time eight out of ten indicators were bearish was in April when Bitcoin (BTC) tanked to $75,000. In July, eight out of ten of those indicators were in the green when BTC hit its first peak this year of $122,800. 

CryptoQuant's overall Bull Score Index — which measures all of the above indicators combined — has been oscillating between 20 and 30 this month as the correction continues. 

The CoinGlass Crypto Bitcoin Bull Run Index (CBBI), which analyzes nine metrics to ascertain what stage the bull market is at, is currently registering 74, almost three-quarters into the bull market. 

However, only one of the 30 CoinGlass bull market peak indicators has flashed up, and that is the altcoin season index.

Crypto prices treaded water much this week, “but with BTC lagging noticeably both vs its peer group as well as vs equities and spot gold,” Augustine Fan, head of insights at crypto trading software service provider SignalPlus, told Cointelegraph. 

She added that net buying momentum has slowed with digital asset treasury buying falling off substantially, as well as centralized exchanges reporting low levels of new capital on-ramping, “with investors preferring to stay within the equity proxies.”

However, some put it down to the widely anticipated September correction and predicted an extended bull market. 

“Global Liquidity has recovered and is attempting to hit a new high,” observed crypto podcaster Tony Edward, who added, ""Feels like this bull market cycle is extending and we could potentially see a local top in Q4 and blowoff top in Q1 2026.”

Bitcoin has made a move during early trading on Friday, topping $116,000 for the first time in three weeks following a 1.5% daily gain.  

The asset is now just 6.8% away from its all-time high, and the correction so far has been much shallower than in previous cycles.

Why Intermittent Fasting May Do More Harm Than Good

Whether intermittent fasting helps anyone is unclear, but it does have known health risks. Who can try the dieting trend, and who should avoid it?

By Frederik Jötten edited by Lauren J. Young

Allvisionn/Getty Images

Recent headlines warning of concerns such as heart risks or danger to teenagers have put a new spotlight on a diet trend that has long been the popular epitome of a healthy lifestyle: intermittent fasting. “Intermittent fasting's image has been deeply tarnished—and quite rightly so,” says Stefan Kabisch, a physician at the endocrinology and metabolic medicine department at Charité–University Medicine Berlin. “The hype was never really backed up by good data in humans.”

Advocates have claimed that temporarily abstaining from food for long stretches of the day can improve health and longevity. In the most common fasting schedule, people don't eat for 16 hours—often skipping breakfast or dinner—and make up for it in the remaining eight hours (the so-called 16:8 method). Some people may severely limit food intake every other day (alternate-day fasting) or take a fasting day twice a week (the 5:2 method).

The effects of such practices can be difficult to study. “The main problem with randomized controlled trials on intermittent fasting is that there are so many variations,” Kabisch explains. “The data is therefore very heterogeneous, which makes it difficult to assess effects.”

Modern society has given way to lifestyles that encourage overeating, says Tinh-Hai Collet, a diabetologist and a professor at the Geneva University Hospitals. “This promotes obesity and diabetes.” Experts have called diabetes a global epidemic. Approximately 590 million people worldwide have diabetes, according to the latest 2025 reports from the International Diabetes Federation—and more than 90 percent of them have type 2, often called adult-onset diabetes.

One of the main issues in type 2 diabetes is that those who are affected absorb more energy than they use. A hallmark of the disease is insulin resistance, in which cells no longer effectively respond to the hormone insulin. This means cells take in less sugar from the blood, and blood sugar levels rise. “Intermittent fasting almost always improves the cells' response to insulin,” says Stephan Herzig, a professor at the Technical University of Munich and head of the Helmholtz Diabetes Center at Helmholtz Munich. “As a result, the concentrations of sugar, fats and cholesterol in the blood also fall.” A 2023 study, led by Mark Ezpeleta of the University of Illinois Chicago, suggests that alternate-day fasting—especially when combined with exercise—also mitigates fatty liver disease, in which fat builds up on in the liver, unrelated to alcohol consumption.

A closer look at the research, however, shows such statements may not be as clear-cut as they are often presented to be. For example, the researchers on the 2023 liver fat study compared volunteer groups that underwent different eating and exercise schedules: alternating days between a reduced calorie intake and an unrestricted diet; only completing an exercise program; combining the fasting schedule with exercising; or not undergoing any intervention. The group that fasted and exercised at the same time saw the best results. Yet there was no comparison group in which people didn't alternate days but still had the same calorie intake as the fasting participants. “This is an unfair comparison,” Kabisch says. And similar gaps in study design “run through the entire literature on the subject.”

Two meta-analyses of people with diabetes or obesity concluded that intermittent fasting had a positive effect on weight, blood sugar, blood pressure and blood lipids (triglycerides). “In most of the underlying primary studies, however, the fasting subjects were compared with people who did not change their diet,” Kabisch says. As a result, the subjects in the intervention groups lost weight—but, logically, the control groups did not, because the researchers didn't apply any calorie restrictions. “You only see strong effects of intermittent fasting compared to people who were not given any diet or exercise guidelines,” Kabisch explains. “But as soon as you compare it with equivalent calorie reduction, the benefits of intermittent fasting disappear.”

And the supposed improvement in insulin resistance is also not always demonstrable. In another meta-analysis, no effects were found in this regard. In other studies, the improvements were small.

The proven benefits of temporary fasting appear to be that people eat less and lose weight as a result. Scientists at the University of Bath in England tested this explicitly in 2021: they compared intermittent fasting with a diet that had no time restrictions but the same calorie amount. And lo and behold, there was no advantage to fasting in terms of weight or various blood measurements. Abdominal fat actually melted away more in continuous eaters. “This study has a good design for evaluating intermittent fasting in comparison,” Kabisch says. “The finding that [intermittent fasting] is not a superior method for weight loss is consistent with results from other studies.”

“The longer-term studies showed that the positive effects of intermittent fasting are not significantly different from those you would have if you simply ate fewer calories every day,” Herzig adds.

Many people find it easier to skip a meal than to eat less at each one—but eating behaviors and weight tendencies vary greatly among individuals. “It is quite possible that some people reward themselves with particularly high-calorie food after fasting phases and do not significantly reduce their overall energy intake as a result,” Herzig says.

In addition, evidence suggests intermittent fasting makes you hungrier than continuous calorie restriction. A meta-analysis on fasting during Ramadan (a holy month of the Islamic calendar when people don't eat between sunrise and sunset) supported this finding with a blood analysis: the concentration of the hormone ghrelin, which triggers hunger, was significantly higher in the people who fasted.

Ramadan offers a general, tried-and-tested natural experiment in temporary abstinence from food, and researchers have drawn one important conclusion from related studies: intermittent fasting may pose a significant risk for people with type 2 diabetes—a group that should particularly benefit from it, according to popular literature. For example, in a 2023 study of various Arab countries, a third of participants had increased glucose levels during Ramadan fasting compared with the period before the month started. “We see a significant deterioration in blood sugar levels in diabetics during Ramadan,” Kabisch says. “However, this is also due to the fact that very sweetened foods are often eaten at night.”

“Fasting is definitely harmful at an older age because it signals the body to break down muscles.” —Eline Slagboom, epidemiologist

In 2020 a poster by researchers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine in China and their colleagues made headlines when it was presented at an American Heart Association conference in Chicago. (The research has not yet appeared in a peer-reviewed journal.) In it, the scientists postulated an increased risk of death in people who fasted intermittently. They referred to 20,000 people in the U.S. who took part in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) between 2003 and 2018. On average, the participants were observed for eight years. It was found that people who took at least 16-hour breaks from eating were almost twice as likely to die from a cardiovascular event (mainly heart attack or stroke) than those who ate more often. The study has received a lot of criticism, however, partly because its design cannot prove causation. And it is also possible, for example, that people who were already ill abstained from meals in order to lose weight; this group's mortality would then be higher because of underlying diseases, such as diabetes and morbid obesity—not because of breaks in eating.

Nevertheless these results have made proponents of the diet trend more cautious. “Until recently, short-term studies all showed positive effects of intermittent fasting,” Herzig says. “Now there are more and more long-term observations with initial indications that it could also have negative effects, especially on cardiovascular disease.”

Another meta-analysis, covering more than 200,000 participants from Japan and the U.S., examined the extent to which skipping breakfast affected health. Over a 17-year observation period, the risk of cardiovascular disease was 21 percent higher in people who generally did not eat breakfast than in people who ate regularly in the morning. In other studies, those who mostly skipped breakfast showed an increased risk of obesity (48 percent) and type 2 diabetes (between 12 and 21 percent) and a higher mortality rate from cardiovascular diseases or cancer.

Kabisch cautions against extrapolating too much from the findings. “These are epidemiological studies that do not prove causality,” he points out. “Distortions are likely because skipping breakfast is often associated with poverty, smoking, alcohol consumption, poor-quality nutrition and lack of exercise.”

In addition, dietary patterns were often only surveyed selectively—for example, for the last day, the last week or the last few months before the study—and were therefore not necessarily representative. Nevertheless, these studies do not provide good arguments that intermittent fasting could benefit health.

It's often only in studies' fine print that one particular dark side of the intermittent fasting trend is acknowledged: concerns about muscle mass loss. This was the case in a 2025 study. According to the authors, co-led by Manuel Dote-Montero and Antonio Clavero-Jimeno, both at the Sport and Health University Research Institute in Spain, intermittent fasting offers no advantage over a Mediterranean diet in terms of abdominal fat loss, regardless of the time window of the fasting period. One graph showed that those who fasted lost muscle mass—but this was not the case for those who ate the same number of calories throughout the day. The same pattern can be found in a meta-analysis of the effects of different forms of interval fasting: the study participants' fat-free mass (their muscle mass) decreased everywhere.

“Our body utilizes 20 to 40 grams of protein per meal,” Kabisch explains. “But an adult needs 70 to 90 grams per day. So if you pack the entire amount into two or even a single meal, you can easily slip into a protein deficiency.” In some cases, this even results in no weight loss during intermittent fasting, and instead to muscle loss and fat buildup.

“Fasting is definitely harmful at an older age because it gives the body the signal to break down muscle,” says Eline Slagboom, a professor of epidemiology who is focused on aging research at Leiden University in the Netherlands. “That's the last thing you need if you want to stay fit and independent in old age.”

Kabisch generally advises against intermittent fasting for people older than age 50.

“If you're healthy, you won't benefit from intermittent fasting—you can't improve an ideal metabolism.” —Tinh-Hai Collet, diabetologist

People with preexisting conditions should also be careful. “Diabetes patients, for example, have to adjust the dosage and timing of their medication,” Collet says. “They should only practice intermittent fasting in consultation with a doctor.” The same applies to those who take medication for hypertension because breaks between meals can also lower blood pressure.

“People with eating disorders and cancer should also definitely avoid intermittent fasting,” Collet advises. People with tumors often lose a lot of weight, which worsens their prognosis; any food restriction can exacerbate this effect. The German Heart Foundation advises against fasting altogether in the case of pronounced cardiac insufficiency. People with other heart conditions who want to lose weight should aim to reduce their calorie intake by a maximum of 500 to 800 kilocalories.

Experts say that it's only advisable for healthy people up to middle age to try intermittent fasting to lose weight. “However, the positive effects only last as long as you keep up the eating breaks,” Herzig says. Intermittent fasting is by no means a guarantee of a healthy life.

“A balanced diet and plenty of exercise are important,” Collet says. “But if you're healthy, you won't benefit from intermittent fasting—you can't improve your metabolism.”

How Your Brain Constructs—And Sometimes Distorts—Your Experience of the World

 In his new book, Daniel Yon explains how our brain is constantly constructing reality

By Rachel Feltman, Fonda Mwangi & Alex Sugiura

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman.

You probably think you're listening to my voice right now. But what if I told you that you're actually experiencing a sophisticated hallucination?

Perception isn't the passive process that most of us imagine it to be, with our senses simply recording reality and sending it up to our brains for processing. Instead, our brains are constantly constructing theories about what's going on around us—and sometimes our brains get reality wrong.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

Here to explain this mind-bending way of looking at, well, the mind, is Daniel Yon, an associate professor of cognitive neuroscience and director of the Uncertainty Lab at Birkbeck, University of London. Daniel is also the author of a recent book called A Trick of the Mind: How the Brain Invents Your Reality.

Thank you so much for coming on to chat with us.

Daniel Yon: Thank you for having me.

Feltman: So why don't you start by telling me a little bit about your background and how it led you to write your latest book.

Yon: Yeah, so I'm an experimental psychologist and a cognitive neuroscientist, so that means my day job is to try and understand how your mind and brain work and how what happens inside your skull kind of makes the world that you live in.

So the motivation behind my new book, A Trick of the Mind, is that I think that the work that's been going on in my lab and that which colleagues have been working on around the world gives us a brand-new way of thinking about how our brains work: that your brain is like a scientist. And I think this new idea ...

Feltman: Hmm.

Yon: Can shed a lot of light on both the wonderful things [laughs] that your brain gets right but also the ways that our minds and brains can mislead us and get us to perceive and believe things that may not be true.

Feltman: Right. So you, you say that our brains are constantly hallucinating reality and that this is “a feature, not a bug.” Can you explain more what that means for our listeners?

Yon: Yeah [laughs], so I suppose when I say that your brain's like a scientist, I kind of mean it both as an insult and a compliment, in that I think, you know, science is a wonderful thing. I am a scientist, and I think science is maybe the best way we've come up with to make sense of the world around us. But science also isn't infallible, right?

Feltman: Mm.

Yon: The process of science is: you kind of take the data that's been given to you, you come up with theories and paradigms to make sense of it, but then those theories become the lens through which you understand the world. And I think that same process is happening, in a very real sense, inside our brains: that we're taking in the experiences that the world serves up, we're using those to make our own models and theories, but then that becomes the kind of key, the filter, the prism that we use to make sense of our surroundings.

So in that sense you're never really seeing the world exactly as it is, but you're seeing this projection that your brain's models make for you—and that's how you should want to see the world. But it ...

Feltman: Hmm.

Yon: Doesn't mean that, in some sense, it's an invention as much as something that's really out there.

Feltman: Could you walk us through what's going on when we perceive something and maybe how that differs from what most people think our experience of reality [laughs] is like?

Yon: [Laughs] Yeah, sure, so I guess maybe you right now and maybe your sort of listeners on this podcast will be perceiving our voices, and your kind of intuitive picture of how that might work, right, would be, you know, there's some sound waves coming out of my mouth into this microphone and coming out of your speakers or your headphones, and you think that you hear me and you perceive what I'm saying just by kind of taking that information and processing it and kind of extracting the meaning through different circuits through your brain.

What we see when we look inside your actual listening brain [laughs] is something rather different happening. It's not just this incoming information, but there's this kind of two-way traffic happening in your head: at the same time that you're having this incoming signal you also have these predictions descending from higher levels of the brain to lower ones, and they add kind of context and interpretation to what's going on. And that means that what you actually perceive in any given moment is not just the incoming information, but it's this interpretation that resolves that expectation and reality.

One way I think you can kind of experience this [laughs] in everyday life would be when you realize you've been mishearing song lyrics.

Feltman: Mm.

Yon: So some of the sort of classic ones are things like, I dunno, if you hear sort of Jimi Hendrix say, “Excuse me while I kiss this guy ...”

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Yon: Rather than “the sky.” Or, you know, people who hear Bob Dylan sing, “The ants are my friends, and they're blowing in the wind.” [Laughs] You can kind of think that those are happening because you're not really hearing the signal, but you're having this interpretation kind of projected on top there.

It's a pretty reasonable theory for your brain to come up with, right? When you listen to Hendrix and you think he says, you know, “Excuse me while I kiss this guy,” because guys are the kind of thing that you can kiss [laughs] and skies really aren't. And in that sense your kind of brain is coming up with this theory, this hypothesis, that's perfectly reasonable, but that's what you perceive rather than the real words that are coming out of its mouth.

Feltman: And why do you think that we evolved to process information this way? You know, what are the benefits to our brain making these kind of inferences?

Yon: I think, in some sense, you can think that one of the benefits is it makes your perception and your kind of analysis of the world really quick and efficient because often those predictions are gonna let you get a head start on the signals around you. So again, something like natural conversation's a good example: when we take turns when we talk the kind of turns between individual people [last] fractions of seconds. And that's only possible because we aren't really [laughs] waiting for the end of the sentence to come up with our conclusion and interpretation, but we're kind of planning ahead in time and in—kind of interpreting beyond the signal that's arrived so far.

So part of it's speed. But I think there's, in many ways, a much more kind of fundamental reason that our brains have to work this way, which is that we just couldn't perceive the world without this kind of background model, these background predictions. The signals that we get from our environment are just so ambiguous, they're so uncertain, and they're kind of, [in a] sort of mathematical sense, they're kind of an, an ill-posed problem. It's really kind of, in a strict sense, impossible to work out what the world is like just from the signals alone.

Something like vision gives you a good feel for this sometimes. When you think that how you see the kind of three-dimensional world is through light that lands on your eyes, but the surface of your retina in the back of your eye is just a flat, two-dimensional map, right? So you're taking this 3D world, and you're looking at the shadows of it that land on your eye, and in a kind of strict sense there are loads of different shadows that would all look exactly the same on your eye. There's this sort of classic joke about, you know, objects being small and close or big and far away, and it's kind of impossible to tell the difference from your eye alone, right? You need to have this kind of context to make sense of it. And that's the position we're in with everything that we try and perceive ...

Feltman: Mm.

Yon: The signals alone, they can't tell us what it's really like. We need a kind of paradigm to make sense of it, and that's how your brain's configured itself: to take the signals but to always contextualize them with its own model and theory about what's going on.

Feltman: And what are some of the shortcomings that we face with this sort of brain-bound scientist?

Yon: Yeah, well, I suppose [laughs] in the same way that I'm kind of talking about perception as being this kind of theory-laden process, right—you kind of come up with these hypotheses, and then they become the window that you see the world through—just like in science it's possible to arrive at a theory that's not right but nonetheless becomes the way you understand things, you know? The history of science is the history of people who were conscientious and intelligent and tried very hard to carefully interpret their measurements, but, you know, nonetheless they still end up believing that the sun revolves around the Earth.

And there's a sense in which the same thing can happen to you, right? You can arrive at a prediction and a theory, but if that prediction's wrong, you'll end up perceiving things that aren't really there. The sort of song lyrics is a, maybe, a bit of a sort of playful example—you don't mind too much that you kinda mishear a song you're listening to. But at the kind of extreme ends of this process, if you're constantly projecting false theories into your perceptions, you're gonna be experiencing a world that's rather different to the one that everyone else lives in.

And some of the kind of most exciting work in this area, I think, has begun to suggest that you can rethink certain kinds of psychiatric illness, things like schizophrenia and other kinds of psychotic illness, as possibly arising from a difference in this projection process in the brain. That one thing that seems to happen in people who hallucinate in their everyday life, kind of people who hear voices that often say threatening or unpleasant things to them, is we can see within the kind of cortical networks for perception a kind of exaggeration of these top-down predictive kind of theory-laden processes. That kinda begins to make sense 'cause you can think that what the hallucination is, in the clinical case, is it's this extreme projection of an idea into the reality that you're living in without a kind of corresponding signal behind it.

So I think it can explain some kind of quite serious sort of symptoms but also give us a completely different view on what those symptoms really mean. It's not that kind of some people are mad or are perceiving the world in a completely different way to everybody else. We're all points on a kind of sliding continuum, sometimes using the world and sometimes using our own existing models to make sense of our surroundings, and where we lie on that spectrum can have big consequences for how we experience the world around us.

Feltman: What's some of the most exciting research going on in this field right now?

Yon: I think one of the really exciting things that this new way of thinking brings into view is questions about how we might begin to change our own minds. So if you think that your brain is like a scientist, kind of building its own theories and paradigms to make sense of its surroundings, the question then becomes: How does the brain know when those theories should change or those paradigms should shift?

And the solution that psychologists and neuroscientists have kind of landed on is that we should change our minds when the world around us seems to be changing. That there's a sense in which if the world seems stable and predictable, we should stick with what we know because the world's stable and say the past is gonna be a good predictor of the present and the future. But if we think that the world is changing, if we find ourselves living through volatile or unstable times, that should make our points of view and our perspectives and our models and our predictions more flexible.

And what the latest neuroscience begins to unearth is kind of various systems that seems to control that kind of malleability and uncertainty in our heads. That there might be particular neurochemical systems, like the noradrenaline or norepinephrine system, that play a key role in manipulating the kind of flexibility of our brain's paradigms, which makes it easier sometimes for us to stick with what we know, but other times easier to undergo quite a dramatic shift in our sorts of perspectives.

So I think we've sort of seen this happen in recent years through things like the COVID pandemic and the sense that the world around us is a much more unstable place. That's had a measurable impact on these mechanisms that track how stable and unstable the world seems.

But in more recent work it seems that we can begin to manipulate these systems directly. That, you know, there are drugs that already exist—drugs that, you know, some of your listeners might already take—that happen to have effects on these pathways that can change how easy it is for you to stick with your existing predictions and how easy it is for you to discard old ideas and come up with new ones.

So I suppose, in a sense, that we might not be too far [laughs] in the not too distant future from having a prescription to make you more open-minded or more close-minded. But I guess, in the book what I try to explore is whether, even if such drugs were on the market, would you want to take them?

Feltman: Mm.

Yon: Should you want to stick with those predictive models you have or try to change your own mind?

Feltman: Well, in the meantime what can we do to [laughs] avoid misinterpretations of reality that might backfire on us?

Yon: Yeah, well, I suppose one thing that you might think is gonna be important is gonna be making sure that the predictions are based on good samples.

Feltman: Mm.

Yon: So I think, in a sense, one of the things I talk about in the book is the value of diverse experiences in kind of training up the models that your brain is using. That this becomes particularly important, say, in some of the chapters where I talk about how we understand other people—that we try to make sense of the people we interact with based on experiences we have in the past. We kind of never really have a first impression, but instead we bring to bear all of our past impressions on the interpretations we make in the present.

That means that we can read people who are like people we've met before, but we're not so good at understanding the minds of other people if they're quite different to people that we haven't interacted with. So there's a value in having diverse experiences of the world, of other people, even of ourselves that can help to diversify the predictions that the brain deploys and help us to not overfit certain experiences.

I think besides kind of trying to have a sort of diverse range of experience in our brains, I think one thing that we might want to kind of court, if we want to make our predictions more flexible in a changing world, is to try and seek out that kind of uncertainty and change that we know makes the brain more flexible. So while quite dramatic changes like an unprecedented global virus [laughs] are maybe not the sorts of things that I would kind of wish on anybody, the sense that experiencing change in one bit of your life, if this theory's right, should also increase the malleability of other bits of your kind of predictive machinery.

That if you, for instance, travel or spend time with people that you weren't expecting to spend time with, you know, you kind of branch out of your regular routines, the effects of these things should be to increase the kind of surprise signals that emanate through your brain, and that should make it possible for you to have new experiences and new information imprint itself in the predictions your brain's making. That will kind of stop you being stubborn and calcified, seeing the world in one particular way, but instead make it possible for you to experience the world that is around you rather than the one that you might be carrying with you from the more distant past.

Feltman: Well, thank you so much for coming on to chat with us, and I think our listeners will really enjoy your book.

Yon: Great, thank you. Thanks for having me.

Mesmerizing New JWST Image Sharpens Our View of Dark Matter's Intergalactic Playground

A swarm of galaxies called the Bullet Cluster is the biggest, best natural laboratory for studying dark matter that astronomers have ever seen

By Phil Plait edited by Lee Billings

The Bullet Cluster as seen by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) consists of a larger cluster of galaxies (left) and a smaller cluster (right). The hot gas seen by the Chandra X-ray Observatory is shown in magenta, and the mapped dark matter in blue. Note the dark matter surrounds the two clusters, whereas the hot gas lies between them.

For astronomers studying dark matter, the Bullet Cluster is one of the greatest laboratories in the universe.

It was discovered almost by accident, a blip of x-rays in the sky that was detected by NASA's Einstein Observatory in 1992 and given the designation 1E 0657-56. Follow-up observations in visible light confirmed it to be a galaxy cluster—a swarm of dozens or even hundreds of galaxies all bound together by gravity and orbiting a common center. The 1E 0657-56 cluster is decently far away from Earth; the light we see left it about four billion years ago.

The cluster is not just one simple system of galaxies, though. There's a main cluster, big and somewhat elongated, with a more compact and spherical subcluster offset to one side, separated by more than 1.5 million light-years. Note that the nearest big galaxy to our own Milky Way is the Andromeda galaxy, 2.5 million light-years away. Imagine having dozens of galaxies in our sky at less than half that distance!

Deeper observations of 1E 0657-56 taken using the Chandra X-ray Observatory revealed the cluster was loaded with hot gas, and I do mean hot: most of it was tens of millions of degrees Celsius. This is common in galaxy clusters, where such gas is generally assumed to be superheated by radiation spewed out from supermassive black holes, as well as the huge amount of kinetic energy absorbed as galaxies zoom around in the cluster.

But the gas in 1E 0657-56 had an odd structure. Like the cluster itself, it was divided into two main clouds, both located in between the main cluster and the subcluster. The bigger cloud, nearer the main cluster, was elongated and diffuse. But the other one, closer to the compact subcluster, was smaller and had a characteristic bow shock shape, a dull cone similar to the wake left behind as a ship moves through water.

This meant 1E 0657-56 wasn't a single cluster but actually two clusters that recently collided—“recent” on a cosmic scale, that is: about 200 million to 100 million years ago. The collision occurred at breathtakingly high speed, with the two clusters slamming into each other at a relative velocity of about 4,000 kilometers per second. That's more than 1 percent of the speed of light!

The conical shape of the gas gave the system its nickname of the Bullet Cluster, which is also appropriate because the second cluster is smaller than the other one and appears to have blasted right through it.

Galaxies are small compared with the size of the Bullet Cluster, so very few galaxies in it physically collided. In a sense, this cosmic object's two smaller constituent clusters passed right through each other. But the hot gas that suffused the space between the galaxies in each cluster would have crashed head-on. While the galaxies slipped by relatively unscathed, that hot gas was slowed considerably by the collision. That's why most of the gas is located between the two galaxy clusters; it was left behind at the scene of the smashup between the two fleeing systems.

But there's more to the Bullet Cluster than meets the eye.

For decades, astronomers have amassed a lot of evidence for the existence of dark matter—a mysterious substance that has mass and gravity but emits no light and rarely, if ever, interacts with normal matter.

On cosmic scales, dark matter betrays its presence via its gravity. The speed at which stars orbit around in a galaxy depends on the gravity they feel from the galaxy at large, which in turn depends on how much mass it has—that is, how much matter it holds. The more mass, the stronger the gravity, and the faster a star moves. American astronomers Vera Rubin and Kent Ford used this principle in the 1970s to show that stars in the outermost part of the Andromeda galaxy were moving far too rapidly, given Andromeda's measured mass. This implied there was a halo of dark matter in which the galaxy was embedded.

Something similar has been seen in many galaxy clusters: the galaxies are moving far too quickly for the calculated mass of their home cluster. They should fly off into space, but instead they stay in orbit, implying there's a lot more mass to these clusters that we cannot see.

Whatever dark matter is, it isn't thought to interact with normal matter except through gravity, and it is also predicted not to interact well even with itself. That means if you have two colliding objects surrounded by dark matter, those halos will pass right through each other and continue into space.

You probably see where this is going: the Bullet Cluster is exactly that sort of situation, a dark matter experiment just waiting for us to examine. Detecting the dark matter, though, requires a gravitational trick.

When a beam of light passes by an object with mass, the gravity of that object will bend the path of the light ray. For very massive or dense objects, the light can bend significantly. For example, light from a background galaxy can be warped into an arc shape, or be broken up into multiple images. This phenomenon is called strong gravitational lensing because it acts very much like a glass lens.

If the gravity of a lens isn't as strong, it can still mildly distort the image of a background galaxy, but it's hard to know how distorted any individual galaxy might be. This sort of weak gravitational lensing can be detected statistically, however, by looking at a great number of background galaxies and measuring their shapes.

Astronomers mapped the weakly lensed galaxies seen behind the Bullet Cluster, which they then used to trace the position of the cluster's dark matter. What they found was amazing: there was a huge excess of mass surrounding both subclusters! That meant the dark matter halos of the subclusters passed right through each other, just as theory predicted.

Because of this, the Bullet Cluster is considered by nearly all astronomers as the smoking gun (pun very much intended) for dark matter's existence, especially in halos surrounding galaxies and clusters.

But scientists aren't done examining the cluster. An international team of astronomers observed it with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which allowed them to see many more distant background galaxies, which in turn let them map the dark matter using gravitational lensing in far more detail. They published their results inthe Astrophysical Journal Letters in June 2025.

JWST's field of view is somewhat small, so they didn't observe the entire cluster, but they were still able to gauge its mass and find that the whole cluster—stars, hot gas, dark matter and all—contains several hundred trillion times the mass of the sun. That's actually smaller than earlier estimates, which may be linked in part to JWST's smaller field of view but may also be a real result based on its sharper vision. The team is currently working on analyzing data from both JWST and the huge Dark Energy Camera to see if they can refine the mass estimate.

The researchers also note that the JWST data show that the elongated main cluster contains at least three clumps of galaxies, whereas a smoother distribution is expected. This means the main cluster may have undergone other collisions recently, further complicating the Bullet Cluster's already complex history.

Invisible dark matter may be, but that doesn't mean undetectable. And every time we point a new telescope at the Bullet Cluster, we learn more about it. We're closing in on dark matter, and soon, hopefully, its constituents will be illuminated.

How 3D Laser Scanning Could Reconstruct the Charlie Kirk Shooting

Forensic scientist Michael Haag explains how laser scanners could be used to lock down the crime scenes where Charlie Kirk was fatally shot, letting investigators revisit angles, trajectories and vantage points long after the fact.

Charlie Kirk, 31-year-old founder of the conservative nonprofit organization Turning Point USA, was shot on Wednesday while speaking outdoors at Utah Valley University. He was pronounced dead later that day. Officials say the single shot may have been fired from a nearby rooftop. On Friday morning, with a massive manhunt still underway, President Donald Trump has announced that a suspect is in custody.

Crime scenes can change quickly. Chairs, tables, cars—whatever was in the space—may be moved, or people may lose track of them. And future discoveries about the crime may be difficult to connect to the scene. One of the best ways to immediately preserve a crime scene is with three-dimensional laser scans, which use light to map every object present. Today this technique is routinely used at major crime scenes. And experts say it's likely to be important in the investigation of Kirk's death.

Among the first crime scene investigators to use this technique in the early 2000s was Michael Haag, a shooting‑incident reconstructionist and co‑author of the textbook Shooting Incident Reconstruction. After majoring in chemistry and minoring in mathematics and physics at the University of Arizona, Haag spent nearly 25 years at New Mexico's Albuquerque Police Department, where he worked as a forensic scientist on a team that handled major crime scenes ranging from homicides to officer-involved shootings. He also now owns a private company that conducts many of the same services and provides training in shooting incident reconstruction worldwide.

For more than two decades, Haag has worked on complex cases, taught investigators across the U.S. and testified in court on how 3D laser scans of crime scenes can be used. In a conversation with Scientific American, he explained how this technique would likely be used on the scene linked to Kirk's death. In plain language, he walked us through how a laser scanner captures millions of measurements to map rooftops and sightlines and how trajectory analysis checks whether impacts line up with a single shooter location.

[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]

Can you walk me through every step of what 3D laser scanning of a crime scene looks like and how you use that information afterward?

The first thing to keep in mind is that, with 3D laser scanning, the massive benefit is that you're documenting the spatial relationships of everything within that scene very accurately in three dimensions. This allows you to go back and work that scene over and over again. You can look at measurements, angles and distances—anything that has to do with physical measurement and relationships, you can redo. It's a great tool for everybody involved in a prosecution or civil action.

It's an engineering tool that we've been using in crime scenes since about 2004. These scanners were initially designed to make very accurate measurements of construction sites, factories and bridges. It's like a laser range finder but much more capable. A handheld laser range finder shoots out a “bullet” of light and, because light moves at a predictable speed, it measures the time it takes for the reflection to return and gives you a distance.

A 3D laser scanner puts that same range-finding device on a stable tripod platform that rotates 360 degrees horizontally and also moves vertically. With today's scanners, like the Leica RTC that I use, it's literally shooting out millions of these bullets of light in a very short time frame. It's not only getting the distance but also associating that distance with a very specific horizontal and vertical angle. From any one position, you build this three-dimensional world around you that is very accurate—we're talking data points with about three millimeters of accuracy within 20 meters of the scanner.

You then move the scanner from position to position, each time building a three-dimensional sphere of data points, and then you blend all these spheres together. You get a massive dataset. With a scene like this, with a courtyard, multiple buildings and rooftops, you can build a scene that you can fly people through to show a judge, a jury or investigators exactly where all of these buildings are, what the distances are and what trajectories may or may not be possible.

For example, I've done a lot of work on the Kennedy assassination and have scanned Dealey Plaza [the Dallas, Tex., site of President John F. Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963]. You can very quickly put yourself in any position you want in that scene and look at what trajectories are or are not possible. That's exactly what the 3D laser scanner brings to the Charlie Kirk shooting. The challenge is: it depends on where the bullet went after it hit Mr. Kirk. We'll see whether the bullet ... went on to hit something else downrange.

When you said earlier that you could “fly people through” the 3D reconstruction, what does that mean? Do they put on a virtual reality headset? How does someone experience this?

You could use VR headsets, but more commonly, you just put it up on a big computer screen. It's literally like a computer game where you can get up in the sky and fly down through the scene. You can put yourself above buildings looking directly down. You can put yourself behind windows in buildings looking out into the courtyard. You could put yourself in Mr. Kirk's position and look out to see what he would have seen. It really allows you to move your viewpoint anywhere you want in the scan data.

In this situation, where people have video footage of a shooter and they know the basics, what would this 3D scan add? How would it be used once they have it?

If it turns out that some of the video we've seen of a human-shaped form on top of the building is a viable shooting position, it may most commonly be used to put you in the position of that shooter so you can see what that vantage point would look like—and vice versa, from Mr. Kirk's position looking uprange.

This scene, in some ways, is not nearly as complex as other shootings we commonly work on where you've got multiple shots fired from multiple guns in multiple positions. In those scenarios, the 3D laser scan has more potential to illuminate how the shooting went down, especially when things are moving within the scene.

What other uses could the 3D construction have? 

Preserving that scene for the future is the way that comes to mind. This is going to be a shooting that people are going to think about, look at and reevaluate for years to come. Those 3D laser scan data allows people like me and others who just have an interest in the case to revisit the scene in exactly the condition it is today—where the pop-up awning was over Mr. Kirk, where chairs were, where barricades were. Those data will allow us to go back and look at the scene over and over again.

This is just a hypothetical question: A firearm was recovered near the site of the Kirk shooting. If the recovered bullet was shown not to have come from that firearm, could we look at this 3D data and the footage to see where the bullet actually came from? Is there a way to determine exactly what the trajectory was?

Probably not as accurately as you might expect from TV. Let's take the firearm and [the footage of a] potential figure on [a nearby] roof out of the picture. If we look at the gunshot wound to Mr. Kirk, and we have video that shows his orientation and general body positioning, it looks like a neck shot to me. Let's say we get a medical examiner's report that says the entry is the front left area of the neck, and the gunshot wound's path is from front to back, from left to right and slightly downward, anatomically. If we look at that path, we can start to look at where in that scene the bullet would have come from. In the example I just went through—front to back, left to right and downward—that would include somebody shooting him from his left as he's sitting in the scene, off in the distance, on top of a building over there. Again, it's not down to the degree that you might expect from TV, where crime scene investigators put a laser in and say the gun was right along this laser beam. There's usually about plus or minus five degrees of accuracy, even on a good trajectory with gunshot wounds to bodies. It's a little bit more conservative than that, but you can get a general idea of where it would have come from.

 Bones are pretty good at regenerating, but traumatic injury can require some outside assistance. 

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

With more than 200 bones in our body, evolution thankfully provided our skeletal scaffolding the remarkable ability to regenerate after a serious fracture or even break—but sometimes even nature needs a little help.

In the cases of serious trauma or tumor removal, bones may not be up to the task to repair the gaping holes left behind in the bone. Scientists have designed ways for 3D printers to aid in the healing process, but as New Scientist notes, this can often take a week or even more to create a custom bone fabrication.

This protracted timeline doesn't help those who experience a serious trauma and need immediate medical attention. So scientists made an ""in situ printing system"" that creates bone material directly.

Basically, it's a hot glue gun that heals bones.

“Our proposed technology offers a distinct approach by developing an in situ printing system that enables a real-time fabrication and application of a scaffold directly at the surgical site,” Sungkyunkwan University's Jung Seung Lee, co-author of a study in the journal Device about the breakthrough, said in a press statement. “This allows for highly accurate anatomical matching even in irregular or complex defects without the need for preoperative preparation such as imaging, modeling, and trimming processes.”

Okay, so maybe calling it a “hot glue gun” is selling it short, but the overall mechanics are remarkably similar. First, instead of operating at 100 degrees Celsius as a glue gun would, this device works at a lower departure at about 60 degrees Celsius.

Of course, hot glue itself is best reserved for arts and crafts—not human bodies—so Lee and his team created a bone-like material made up of hydroxyapatite (which fills up 50 percent of a human bone by volume) along with polycaprolactone, a thermoplastic. The mixture also contained two antibacterial compounds to limit infection.

Operationally, the device works just as you'd imagine. This bone material is extruded into the impacted area, allowing bone cells to span large gaps and begin the repairing process. 

“Because the device is compact and manually operated, the surgeon can adjust the printing direction, angle, and depth during the procedure in real time,” Lee said in a press statement. “Also, we demonstrated that this process could be completed in a matter of minutes.”

Lee and his team tested the device by repairing severe femoral bone fractures in rabbits. Thanks to the included antibacterial compounds, the rabbits showed no signs of infection or necrosis. They also displayed better bone regeneration outcomes compared with rabbits healed with bone cement, a more common method of repairing fractures.

Lee hopes that future improvements to the antimicrobial additives will open the doors toward human trials, as well as a whole new way to treat traumatic bone injury. 

“If these steps are successfully achieved, we vision this approach becoming a practical and immediate solution for bone repair directly in the operating room,” Lee says.

For several decades, a central puzzle in quantum physics has remained unsolved: Could electrons behave like a perfect, frictionless fluid with electrical properties described by a universal quantum number? This unique property of electrons has been extremely difficult to detect in any material so far because of the presence of atomic defects, impurities, and imperfections in the material.

Researchers at the Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), along with collaborators from the National Institute for Materials Science, Japan, have now finally detected this quantum fluid of electrons in graphene - a material consisting of a single sheet of pure carbon atoms. The results, published in Nature Physics, open a new window into the quantum realm and establish graphene as a unique tabletop laboratory for exploring hitherto unseen quantum phenomena.

""It is amazing that there is so much to do on just a single layer of graphene even after 20 years of discovery,"" says Arindam Ghosh, Professor at the Department of Physics, IISc, and one of the corresponding authors of the study.

The team engineered exceptionally clean samples of graphene and tracked how these materials conduct electricity and heat simultaneously. To their surprise, they discovered an inverse relationship between the two properties: as one value (electrical conductivity) increased, the other (thermal conductivity) decreased, and vice versa. This remarkable phenomenon arises from the dramatic violation of a textbook principle for metals, the Wiedemann-Franz law, which dictates that the values of electrical and thermal conductivity should be directly proportional.

In their graphene samples, the IISc team observed a strong deviation from this law by a factor of more than 200 at low temperatures, demonstrating the decoupling of charge and heat conduction mechanisms. This decoupling, however, is not a random event - it turns out that both charge and heat conduction in this case rely on a material-independent universal constant which is equal to the quantum of conductance, a fundamental value related to the movement of electrons.

This exotic behavior emerges at the ""Dirac point,"" a precise electronic tipping point - achieved by tweaking the number of electrons in the material - where graphene is neither a metal nor an insulator. In this state, electrons cease to act as individual particles and instead move together the way a liquid does, just like water but a hundred times less viscous. ""Since this water-like behaviour is found near the Dirac point, it is called a Dirac fluid - an exotic state of matter which mimics the quark-gluon plasma, a soup of highly energetic subatomic particles observed in particle accelerators at CERN,"" says Aniket Majumdar, first author and PhD student at the Department of Physics. The team additionally measured the viscosity of this Dirac fluid and found it to be minimally viscous, the closest possible to a perfect fluid.

The findings establish graphene as an ideal low-cost platform for investigating concepts from high-energy physics and astrophysics, such as black-hole thermodynamics and entanglement entropy scaling, in a laboratory setting.

From a technological perspective, the presence of Dirac fluid in graphene also holds significant potential for use in quantum sensors capable of amplifying very weak electrical signals and detecting extremely weak magnetic fields.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Toxic “forever chemicals” found in 95% of beers tested in the U.S.","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250911073204.htm","Fri, 12 Sep 2025 11:02:42 GMT","

Infamous for their environmental persistence and potential links to health conditions, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often called forever chemicals, are being discovered in unexpected places, including beer. Researchers publishing in ACS' Environmental Science & Technology tested beers brewed in different areas around the U.S. for these substances. They found that beers produced in parts of the country with known PFAS-contaminated water sources showed the highest levels of forever chemicals.

""As an occasional beer drinker myself, I wondered whether PFAS in water supplies was making its way into our pints,"" says research lead Jennifer Hoponick Redmon. ""I hope these findings inspire water treatment strategies and policies that help reduce the likelihood of PFAS in future pours.""

PFAS are human-made chemicals produced for their water-, oil- and stain-repellent properties. They have been found in surface water, groundwater and municipal water supplies across the U.S. and the world. Although breweries typically have water filtration and treatment systems, they are not designed to remove PFAS. By modifying a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) testing method for analyzing levels of PFAS in drinking water, Hoponick Redmon and colleagues tested 23 beers. The test subjects were produced by U.S. brewers in areas with documented water system contamination, plus popular domestic and international beers from larger companies with unknown water sources.

The researchers found a strong correlation between PFAS concentrations in municipal drinking water and levels in locally brewed beer -- a phenomenon that Hoponick Redmon and colleagues say has not yet been studied in U.S. retail beer. They found PFAS in 95% of the beers they tested. These include perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), two forever chemicals with recently established EPA limits in drinking water. Notably, the team found that beers brewed near the Cape Fear River Basin in North Carolina, an area with known PFAS pollution, had the highest levels and most diverse mix of forever chemicals, including PFOS and PFOA.

This work shows that PFAS contamination at one source can spread into other products, and the researchers call for greater awareness among brewers, consumers and regulators to limit overall PFAS exposure. These results also highlight the possible need for water treatment upgrades at brewing facilities as PFAS regulations in drinking water change or updates to municipal water system treatment are implemented.

On September 14, 2015, a signal arrived on Earth, carrying information about a pair of remote black holes that had spiraled together and merged. The signal had traveled about 1.3 billion years to reach us at the speed of light -- but it was not made of light. It was a different kind of signal: a quivering of space-time called gravitational waves, first predicted by Albert Einstein 100 years prior. On that day 10 years ago, the twin detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) made the first-ever direct detection of gravitational waves. The LIGO and Virgo collaborations announced it to the world in February 2016, after six months of analysis and verification.

The historic discovery meant that researchers could now sense the universe through three different means. Light waves, such as X-rays, optical, radio, and other wavelengths of light, as well as high-energy particles called cosmic rays and neutrinos had been captured before, but this was the first time researchers had witnessed a cosmic event through its gravitational warping of space-time. For this achievement, first dreamed up more than 40 years prior, three of the LIGO founders won the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics: MIT's Rainer Weiss, professor of physics, emeritus (who recently passed away at age 92); Caltech's Barry Barish; and Caltech's Kip Thorne.

LIGO, which consists of detectors in both Hanford, Washington and Livingston, Louisiana, the Virgo detector in Italy and KAGRA in Japan operate in coordination and currently are routinely observing roughly one black hole merger every three days. Together, the gravitational-wave-hunting network, known as LVK (LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA), has captured a total of more than 300 black hole mergers, most of which are already confirmed while others await further analysis. During the network's current science run, the fourth since the first run in 2015, the LVK has discovered about 230 candidate black hole mergers, more than doubling the number caught in the first three runs.

The dramatic rise in the number of LVK discoveries over the past decade is owed to several improvements to their detectors -- some of which involve cutting-edge quantum precision engineering. These gravitational-wave interferometers remain by far the most precise rulers for making measurements ever created by humans. The space-time distortions induced by gravitational waves are incredibly minuscule. To sense them, LIGO and Virgo must detect changes in space-time smaller than 1/10,000 the width of a proton. That's 700 trillion times smaller than the width of a human hair.

The Clearest Signal Yet 

The improved sensitivity of the instruments is exemplified in a recent discovery of a black hole merger referred to as GW250114 (the numbers denote the date the gravitational-wave signal arrived at Earth: January 14, 2025). The event was not that different from the first-ever detection (called GW150914) -- both involve colliding black holes about 1.3 billion light-years away with masses between 30 to 40 times that of our Sun. But thanks to 10 years of technological advances reducing instrumental noise, the GW250114 signal is dramatically clearer.

""We can hear it loud and clear, and that lets us test the fundamental laws of physics,"" says LIGO team member Katerina Chatziioannou, Caltech assistant professor of physics and William H. Hurt Scholar, and one of the leading authors of a new study on GW250114 published in the Physical Review Letters.

By analyzing the frequencies of gravitational waves emitted by the merger, the LVK team was able to provide the best observational evidence captured to date for what is known as the black hole area theorem, an idea put forth by Stephen Hawking in 1971 that says the total surface areas of black holes cannot decrease. When black holes merge, their masses combine, increasing the surface area. But they also lose energy in the form of gravitational waves during the phenomenon. Additionally, the merger can cause the combined black hole to increase its spin, which leads to it having a smaller area. The black hole area theorem states that, despite these competing factors, the total surface area must grow in size.

Later, Hawking and physicist Jacob Bekenstein concluded that a black hole's area is proportional to its entropy, or degree of disorder. The findings paved the way for later groundbreaking work in the field of quantum gravity, which attempts to unite two pillars of modern physics: general relativity and quantum physics.

In essence, the detection (made just by LIGO, since Virgo was undergoing routine maintenance and KAGRA was offline during this particular observation) allowed the team to ""hear"" two black holes growing as they merged into one, verifying Hawking's theorem. The initial black holes had a total surface area of 240,000 square kilometers (roughly the size of United Kingdom), while the final area was about 400,000 square kilometers (almost the size of Sweden) -- a clear increase. This is the second test of the black hole area theorem; an initial test was performed in 2021 using data from the first GW150914 signal, but because that data was not as clean, the results had a confidence level of 95 percent as compared to 99.999 percent for the new data. Kip Thorne recalls Hawking phoning him to ask whether LIGO might be able to test his theorem immediately after he learned of the 2015 gravitational-wave detection. Hawking died in 2018 and sadly did not live to see his theory observationally verified. ""If Hawking were alive, he would have reveled in seeing the area of the merged black holes increase,"" Thorne says.

The trickiest part of this type of analysis had to do with determining the final surface area of the merged black hole. The surface areas of pre-merger black holes can be more readily gleaned as the pair spiral together, roiling space-time and producing gravitational waves. But after the black holes merge, the signal is not as clearcut. During this so-called ringdown phase, the final black hole vibrates like a struck bell. In the new study, the researchers were able to precisely measure the details of the ringdown phase, which allowed them to calculate the mass and spin of the black hole, and subsequently determine its surface area. More precisely, they were able, for the first time, to confidently pick out two distinct gravitational-wave modes in the ringdown phase. The modes are like characteristic sounds a bell would make when struck; they have somewhat similar frequencies but die out at different rates, which makes them hard to identify. The improved data for GW250114 meant that the team could extract the modes, demonstrating that the black hole's ringdown occurred exactly as predicted by math models Another study from the LVK, submitted to Physical Review Letters today, places limits on a predicted third, higher-pitch tone in the GW250114 signal, and performs some of the most stringent tests yet of general relativity's accuracy in describing merging black holes.

""Analyzing strain data from the detectors to detect transient astrophysical signals, send out alerts to trigger follow-up observations from telescopes or publish physics results gathering information from up to hundreds of events is quite a long journey -- adds Nicolas Arnaud, CNRS researcher in France and Virgo coordinator of the fourth science run -- Out of the many skilled steps that such a complex framework requires, I see the humans behind all these data, in particular those who are on duty at any time, watching over our instruments. There are LVK scientists in all regions, pursuing a common goal: literally, the Sun never goes down above our collaborations!""

Pushing the limits

LIGO and Virgo have also unveiled neutron stars over the past decade. Like black holes, neutron stars form the explosive deaths of massive stars, but they weigh less and glow with light. Of note, in August of 2017, LIGO and Virgo witnessed an epic collision between a pair of neutron stars -- a kilonova -- that sent gold and other heavy elements flying into space and drew the gaze of dozens of telescopes around the world, which captured light ranging from high-energy gamma rays to low-energy radio waves. The ""multi-messenger"" astronomy event marked the first time that both light and gravitational waves had been captured in a single cosmic event. Today, the LVK continues to alert the astronomical community to potential neutron star collisions, who then use telescopes to search the skies for signs of another kilonova.

""The global LVK network is essential to gravitational-wave astronomy,"" says Gianluca Gemme, Virgo spokesperson and director of research at INFN (Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare). ""With three or more detectors operating in unison, we can pinpoint cosmic events with greater accuracy, extract richer astrophysical information, and enable rapid alerts for multi-messenger follow-up. Virgo is proud to contribute to this worldwide scientific endeavor.""

Other LVK scientific discoveries include the first detection of collisions between one neutron star and one black hole; asymmetrical mergers, in which one black hole is significantly more massive than its partner neutron star; the discovery of the lightest black holes known, challenging the idea that there is a ""mass gap"" between neutron stars and black holes; and the most massive black hole merger seen yet with a merged mass of 225 solar masses. For reference, the previous record-holder for the most massive merger had a combined mass of 140 solar masses.

In the coming years, the scientists of LVK hope to further fine tune their machines, expanding their reach deeper and deeper into space. They also plan to use the knowledge they have gained to build another gravitational-wave detector, LIGO India. Looking farther into the future, scientists are working on a concept for even larger detectors.The European project, called Einstein Telescope, plans to build one or two huge underground interferometers with arms of more than 10 kilometers, The US one, called Cosmic Explorer, would be similar to the current LIGO but with arms 40 kilometers long. Observatories on this scale would allow scientists to hear the earliest black hole mergers in the universe and, possibly, the echo of the gravitational shakes of the very first moments of our universe.

""This is an amazing time for gravitational wave research: thanks to instruments such as Virgo, LIGO and KAGRA, we can explore a dark universe that was previously completely inaccessible. -- said Massimo Carpinelli, professor at University of Milano Bicocca and director of the European Gravitational Observatory in Cascina -- The scientific achievements of these 10 years are triggering a real revolution in our view of the Universe. We are already preparing a new generation of detectors such as the Einstein Telescope in Europe and Cosmic Explorer in the US, as well as the LISA space interferometer, which will take us even further into space and back in time. In the coming years, we will certainly be able to tackle these extraordinary challenges thanks to increasingly broad and solid cooperation between scientists, different countries and institutions, both at European and global level.""

A new study led by Southwest Research Institute's Dr. Michael Starkey  has provided observational evidence from the SwRI-led Magnetospheric  Multiscale (MMS) Mission of pickup ions (PUIs) and associated wave  activity in the near-Earth solar wind environment. The MMS mission,  launched by NASA in 2015, placed four spacecraft in orbit to observe  Earth's magnetosphere, a magnetic field around the planet that shields  it from harmful solar and cosmic radiation.PUIs are formed when neutral particles flowing through the heliosphere  are ionized in the solar wind. These PUIs are dragged along with the  solar wind and gyrate around the local magnetic field, forming a  distinct plasma population with different characteristics from the  typical solar wind population.The PUIs were observed to have a typical velocity distribution absent of  any other significant energetic ion or electron populations. The wave  activity was identified using magnetic field data from MMS combined with  theoretical analysis of the expected wave growth modes based on models  of the observed PUIs.“The results of this study indicate that PUIs can in fact generate waves  in the solar wind near Earth and motivate the need for further  statistical studies of these processes,” Starkey said. “It may be that  PUIs play a larger role in the heating and thermalization of the solar  wind near Earth than previously thought, which would have large  implications for models of the solar wind throughout the heliosphere.”By modeling the individual ion components (solar wind and PUIs), the  authors identified which populations could be responsible for the  observed wave activity. They concluded that the observed waves were  likely generated by helium and/or hydrogen PUIs but, due to instrument  limitations, they were unable to pinpoint the precise ion species  responsible.At farther distances from the Sun, the relative density of PUIs in the  solar wind increases, which increases their contribution toward the  heating and thermalization of the solar wind through wave-particle  interactions. At the outer edges of the solar system, PUIs contribute  significantly to the total dynamic pressure in the solar wind, which has  large implications for physical processes taking place at the  termination shock and in the heliosheath.“Near Earth, the intensity of PUIs is relatively low, and so it is  typically assumed that their contribution to wave-particle interactions  in the solar wind is negligible,” Starkey added. “If this assumption is  false, current theory and modeling of the solar wind and its evolution  throughout the heliosphere would need to be updated.”

If you pull an ice core from the outer edges of the Arctic polar cap, you might spot what looks like a faint line of dirt. Those are diatoms - single-celled algae with outer walls made of glass. Their presence in ice isn't new, but because they seemed trapped and dormant, few bothered to study them.

But new research from Stanford, published Sept. 9 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, revealed Arctic diatoms aren't immobile or entombed. They're not just surviving either - they're gliding into the record books.

""This is not 1980s-movie cryobiology. The diatoms are as active as we can imagine until temperatures drop all the way down to -15 C, which is super surprising,"" said Manu Prakash, associate professor of bioengineering in the Schools of Engineering and Medicine and senior author of the paper.

That temperature (5 F) is the lowest ever recorded for movement by a eukaryotic cell - the type of complex cells in plants, animals, fungi, and more, defined by having a nucleus inside a membrane.

""You can see the diatoms actually gliding, like they are skating on the ice,"" said lead author and Stanford postdoctoral scholar Qing Zhang, who collected the samples during an Arctic research expedition. She and her colleagues demonstrated not only motility at such low temperatures, but also that their gliding - or skating - relies on a combination of mucus and molecular motors.

Navigating a bustling 'berg

The diatoms featured in this research resulted from a 45-day Arctic expedition in the Chukchi Sea aboard the research vessel Sikuliaq, which is owned by the National Science Foundation and operated by the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Researchers from the Prakash Lab and the lab of Kevin Arrigo, professor of Earth system science in the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability, collected ice cores from 12 stations throughout the summer of 2023. Using a range of on-ship microscopes that the Prakash Lab has been developing for years, the team was able to image inside ice and document the secret lives of these incredible arctic diatoms.

Back in the lab, the team extracted diatoms from the ice cores and recreated their environments in a petri dish containing a thin layer of frozen freshwater and a layer of very cold saltwater. When ice forms in the Arctic, it kicks out salt, leaving freshwater ice with small microfluidic channels in it - so the lab also made channels in their ice, using their own hair.

Even as they lowered the temperatures of a special sub-zero microscope below freezing, the diatoms slipped through the strand-sized highways. Further experiments, using gels seeded with fluorescent beads, tracked their movements like footprints in sand.

The researchers developed and used special microscopes and experimental environments to track how the diatoms move through ice. | Prakash Lab

What's so surprising is the diatoms cruised along without wiggling, scrunching, or use of any appendages. Instead, they practice the art that many diatoms display: gliding.

""There's a polymer, kind of like snail mucus, that they secrete that adheres to the surface, like a rope with an anchor,"" said Zhang. ""And then they pull on that 'rope' and that gives them the force to move forward.""

The mucilage rope mechanism depends on actin and myosin - the same biological system that drives human muscle movements. How that machinery still works in subzero conditions is now a key research question the lab is pursuing. When the team compared Arctic diatoms with temperate relatives gliding along glass, the polar species moved much faster, hinting at an evolutionary advantage.

The bigger picture

The Prakash Lab made the most of their time in the Arctic and gathered an abundance of data on multiple projects, in addition to diatoms. That includes drone footage, taken under the ice, that vividly displays the potential of this work.

""The Arctic is white on top but underneath, it's green - absolute pitch green because of the presence of algae,"" said Prakash. ""In some sense, it makes you realize this is not just a tiny little thing, this is a significant portion of the food chain and controls what's happening under ice.""

The diatoms were gathered during an expedition aboard the research vessel Sikuliaq. During this trip, the researchers visited a dozen research stations and saw several polar bears. | Lexi Arlen, Stanford University

Knowing the diatoms are active raises broader questions about adaptation to a changing polar environment. Could they be moving resources through the Arctic food web, nourishing everything from fish to polar bears? Could their mucus trails even seed new ice formation, the way pearls form around grains of sand?

Normally, Prakash wouldn't show his hand when it comes to these kinds of nascent ideas, but the stakes this time are different, he said.

""Many of my colleagues are telling me, in the next 25 to 30 years, there will be no Arctic. When ecosystems are lost, we lose knowledge about entire branches in our tree of life,"" he said, noting that severe projected budget cuts to the National Science Foundation are predicted to reduce polar research funding by 70 percent. ""I feel a sense of urgency in many of these systems, because, at the end of the day, the infrastructure and capacity to be able to operate is critical for discovery.""

Physicists have long believed that black holes explode at the end of their lives, and that such explosions happen -- at most -- only once every 100,000 years. But new research published in Physical Review Letters by physicists at the University of Massachusetts Amherst has found a more than 90% probability that one of these black-hole explosions might be seen within the decade, and that, if we are prepared, our current fleet of space and earthbound telescopes could witness the event.

Such an explosion would be strong evidence of a theorized but never observed kind of black hole, called a ""primordial black hole,"" that could have formed less than a second after the Big Bang occurred, 13.8 billion years ago. Furthermore, the explosion would give us a definitive catalog of all the subatomic particles in existence, including the ones we have observed, such as electrons, quarks and Higgs bosons, the ones that we have only hypothesized, like dark matter particles, as well as everything else that is, so far, entirely unknown to science. This catalog would finally answer one of humankind's oldest questions: from where did everything in existence come?

We know that black holes exist, and we have a good understanding of their life cycle: an old, large star runs out of fuel, implodes in a massively powerful supernova and leaves behind an area of spacetime with such intense gravity that nothing, not even light, can escape. These black holes are incredibly heavy and are essentially stable.

But, as physicist Stephen Hawking pointed out in 1970, another kind of black hole -- a primordial black hole (PBH), could be created not by the collapse of a star but from the universe's primordial conditions shortly after the Big Bang. PBHs, like the standard black holes, are so massively dense that almost nothing can escape them -- which is what makes them ""black."" However, despite their density, PBHs could be much lighter than the black holes we have so far observed. Furthermore, Hawking also showed that black holes have a temperature and could, in theory, slowly emit particles via what is now known as ""Hawking radiation"" if they got hot enough.

""The lighter a black hole is, the hotter it should be and the more particles it will emit. As PBHs evaporate, they become ever lighter, and so hotter, emitting even more radiation in a runaway process until explosion. It's that Hawking radiation that our telescopes can detect,"" says Andrea Thamm, co-author and assistant professor of physics at UMass Amherst.

Yet, while we should be able to, no one has ever directly observed a PBH.

""We know how to observe this Hawking radiation,"" says Joaquim Iguaz Juan, a postdoctoral researcher in physics at UMass Amherst. ""We can see it with our current crop of telescopes, and because the only black holes that can explode today or in the near future are these PBHs, we know that if we see Hawking radiation, we are seeing an exploding PBH.""

Though physicists since Hawking's time have thought that the chances of seeing an exploding PBH are infinitesimally slight, Iguaz Juan notes that ""our job as physicists is to question the received assumptions, to ask better questions and come up with more precise hypotheses.""

The team's new hypothesis? Get ready now to see the explosion. ""We believe that there is up to a 90% chance of witnessing an exploding PBH in the next 10 years,"" says Aidan Symons, one of the paper's co-authors and a graduate student in physics at UMass Amherst.

In its work, the team explores a ""dark-QED toy model."" This is essentially a copy of the usual electric force as we know it, but which includes a very heavy, hypothesized version of the electron, which the team calls a ""dark electron.""

The team then reconsidered long-held assumptions about the electrical charge of black holes. Standard black holes have no charge, and it was assumed that PBHs are likewise electrically neutral.

""We make a different assumption,"" says Michael Baker, co-author and an assistant professor of physics at UMass Amherst. ""We show that if a primordial black hole is formed with a small dark electric charge, then the toy model predicts that it should be temporarily stabilized before finally exploding."" Taking all known experimental data into account, they find that we could then potentially observe a PBH explosion not once every 100,000 years as previously thought, but once every 10 years.

""We're not claiming that it's absolutely going to happen this decade,"" says Baker, ""but there could be a 90% chance that it does. Since we already have the technology to observe these explosions, we should be ready.""

Iguaz Juan adds, ""this would be the first-ever direct observation of both Hawking radiation and a PBH. We would also get a definitive record of every particle that makes up everything in the universe. It would completely revolutionize physics and help us rewrite the history of the universe.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Secrets unearthed: Women and children buried with stone tools","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250911073143.htm","Fri, 12 Sep 2025 03:32:04 GMT","

Study has revealed new insights into Stone Age life and death, showing that stone tools were just as likely to be buried with women and children as with men.

The discovery, from Zvejnieki cemetery in northern Latvia, one of the largest Stone Age burial sites in Europe, challenges the idea that stone tools were strictly associated with men.

The site was used for more than 5,000 years, and contains over 330 graves, but until now, stone artefacts found in burials had not been studied, with stone tools at Zvejnieki and other Stone Age burial sites often disregarded as utilitarian and therefore uninteresting.  

As part of the Stone Dead Project, led by Dr Aimée Little at the University of York, and working with the Latvian National Museum of History and colleagues across Europe, the team took a powerful microscope to Riga to look at how the tools were made and used.

The research showed that stone tools played a far deeper role in burial rituals, as not only were the tools discovered that had been used to work animal hides, but some tools appear to have been specifically made and then broken as part of funerary rites.

They found that women were as, or even more, likely than men to be buried with stone tools, and that children and older adults were the most common age group to receive stone artifacts.

The long-held stereotype of women in this era was that they played a more domestic role - cooking animals hunted by the men, doing crafts, and caring for the family.

Dr Aimée Little, from the Centre for Artefacts and Materials Analysis, part of the University of York's Department of Archaeology, said: “The site in Latvia has seen numerous investigations of the skeletal remains and other types of grave goods, such as thousands of animal teeth pendants. 

“A missing part of the story was understanding, with greater depth, why people gave seemingly utilitarian items to the dead.

“Our findings overturn the old stereotype of “Man the Hunter” which has been a dominant theme in Stone Age studies, and has even influenced, on occasion, how some infants have even been sexed, on the basis that they were given lithic tools.” 

Dr Anđa Petrović, from the University of Belgrade, said: “This research demonstrates that we cannot make these gendered assumptions and that lithic grave goods played an important role in the mourning rituals of children and women, as well as men.” 

Tools that had never been used before, hint at their symbolic significance in burial practice, particularly as some tools appear to have been deliberately broken before being placed with the deceased, suggesting a shared ritual tradition across the eastern Baltic region where similar funerary practices have been noted.

Dr Little added: “The study highlights how much more there is to learn about the lives - and deaths - of Europe's earliest communities, and why even the seemingly simplest objects can unlock insights about our shared human past and how people responded to death.”

The research, published in the journal PLOS One and in collaboration with University of Belgrade, University of Helsinki, the University of Latvia and University of Tartu, is funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC).

Sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) have critical roles in biology and biotechnology and there has been considerable interest in the engineering of DBPs with new or altered specificities for genome editing and other applications. While there has been some success in reprogramming naturally occurring DBPs using selection methods, the computational design of new DBPs that recognize arbitrary target sites remains an outstanding challenge. We describe a computational method for the design of small DBPs that recognize short specific target sequences through interactions with bases in the major groove and use this method to generate binders for five distinct DNA targets with mid-nanomolar to high-nanomolar affinities. The individual binding modules have specificity closely matching the computational models at as many as six base-pair positions and higher-order specificity can be achieved by rigidly positioning the binders along the DNA double helix using RFdiffusion. The crystal structure of a designed DBP–target site complex is in close agreement with the design model and the designed DBPs function in both Escherichia coli and mammalian cells to repress and activate transcription of neighboring genes. Our method provides a route to small and, hence, readily deliverable sequence-specific DBPs for gene regulation and editing.

Nature uses a wide diversity of DNA-binding protein (DBP) domains for targeting specific sequences1, which are often structurally coupled to each other and to effector regions, conferring enzymatic, binding and regulatory functions2,3. Despite intensive study and substantial progress in the in silico prediction of DNA-binding specificities from complex structures4, the DNA-binding affinity and specificity of natural proteins remain difficult to predict5 and the high free-energetic cost of desolvating the highly polar DNA surface presents a challenge to the de novo design of DBPs. For these reasons, while computational de novo design has had considerable recent success in generating binders to arbitrary protein structures6, mostly at hydrophobic patches, computational approaches for DBP engineering have thus far been limited to redesigning interfaces of existing native protein–DNA complex structures7,8,9,10,11. These efforts have been constrained by the rigid geometry of the starting scaffold shape and orientation relative to DNA12, which restrict the possible target sequences that can be recognized13. A more general solution to generating compact, customizable DBPs would enable modular, geometrically precise and deliverable tools and be highly complementary to state-of-the-art techniques in gene regulation, gene editing and nucleic acid diagnostics, which primarily use Cys2His2 zinc finger (ZF) domains14,15, transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs)16,17 and CRISPR–Cas18. While these tools have proven powerful, each has limitations. ZFs can be laborious to engineer and the size of TALE and CRISPR–Cas systems complicates their delivery in therapeutic applications; CRISPR–Cas systems also require an extra guide RNA component and target sites are constrained by protospacer-adjacent motif requirements18. These systems will undoubtedly continue to be improved but their constrained backbone topologies can limit precise control of interaction specificity and close integration with diverse effector domains.

We reasoned that it would be possible to achieve DNA sequence recognition using small, compact proteins by sampling a wide variety of structures and binding modes to find those that are optimal for targeting specific sequences of interest. We previously developed a general method for designing specific protein binders to arbitrary protein targets on the basis of this concept6 but sequence-specific DNA binding requires overcoming several additional challenges. First, binding the DNA double helix, with major and minor grooves, requires sufficient shape complementarity with the DNA backbone to precisely position specific amino acid residues to interact with the DNA base edges. Second, recognition of DNA sequences requires distinguishing between the subtle changes in individual atom placements among the four bases19,20,21,22,23,24,25, which alter the landscape of potential molecular contacts. Third, in contrast to designed protein–protein contacts mostly mediated by orientation-agnostic hydrophobic patches6, the majority of accessible DNA base atoms require hydrogen-bond interactions with polar side chains for specific recognition26. Not only are polar interactions harder to model accurately but the longer polar side chains have considerable conformational flexibility, making structure modeling more difficult and increasing opportunities for off-target base interactions through alternate side-chain rotamer conformations. To address these challenges, we formulated a set of design principles (Fig. 1a) and sought to develop a design pipeline implementing them in the context of small helical DBP domains that target short DNA sequences (Fig. 1b–g).

a, Design principles for design of sequence-specific DBPs. b, HTH backbone scaffold library generated from metagenomic sequences. c, DNA target, starting with either a specific nucleotide sequence modeled as B-DNA or a DNA crystal structure. d, Generation of RIF (gray) to form base-specific hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic packing interactions. Example rotamers (pink) are generated for nucleotide bases (orange; clockwise from top left: adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine). e, Docking of scaffolds onto the RIF to identify seed interactions and placements with base-specific contacts, followed by sequence optimization of the DNA–scaffold interactions using Rosetta or LigandMPNN-based sequence design and Rosetta modeling. f, Recognition helices making multiple favorable interactions with the target are extracted from first-round designs and grafted onto the scaffold library, followed by further rounds of interface sequence design and filtering for favorable interactions. g, Inpainting of the protein loops (red) results in new connecting loops (teal) between the helical portions of the design, followed by further rounds of interface sequence design and filtering.

For design challenge 1—positioning protein scaffolds so that amino acid sidechains can contact the DNA bases—we hypothesized that interactions with the phosphate backbone, such as the backbone amide-mediated hydrogen-bond interactions with DNA phosphate oxygens (hereon called main-chain phosphate hydrogen bonds) that are frequently observed in native DBP structures, could enable precise placement of designed scaffolds such that residues designed to make specific base contacts interact in the intended geometry. We reasoned that such satisfaction of the hydrogen-bond requirements of the DNA backbone phosphates and the DNA bases would substantially constrain viable design geometries. We hypothesized that the helix–turn–helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain would be a good candidate for computational DNA binder design as it is relatively small and compact and is capable of making direct contacts with DNA through a recognition helix within the DNA major groove27. To generate a library of small (<65 aa) and structurally diverse scaffolds, we took advantage of the vast amount of metagenome sequence data and the accuracy of deep-learning-based protein structure prediction (Supplementary Fig. 1). We carried out sequence searches for HTH DNA-binding domains, generated AlphaFold2 (AF2) structure predictions28 and filtered these on the basis of prediction confidence (predicted local distance difference test, pLDDT) and template modeling score (TMscore) to known HTH domain structures29. This resulted in a library of ~26,000 HTH scaffolds, which finely sample different helix orientations and loop geometries (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Methods).

We docked the scaffolds against specific DNA target structures seeking to maximize the potential for specific side chain–base interactions (Fig. 1b–d). To do this, we extended the RIFdock approach6 to protein–DNA interactions (Methods), which finely samples many possible de novo docks for each scaffold. RIFdock begins by enumerating a large and comprehensive set of disembodied side-chain interactions, called a rotamer interaction field (RIF), that make favorable interactions with the desired target. We focused RIF generation on polar and nonpolar interactions with nucleotide base atoms in the major groove of the DNA target, with an emphasis on protein side chain–DNA base hydrogen-bonding interactions that are statistically more probable in native protein–DNA complexes30. In RIFdock, we constrained the RIF DNA base-specific interactions to the HTH recognition helix to find placements with both main-chain phosphate hydrogen bonds and base-contacting RIF sidechains, resolving the first design challenge.

To address design challenge 2—recognizing specific DNA bases—we used either Rosetta-based sequence design or an extended version of the deep-learning-based ProteinMPNN sequence design software (Fig. 1e and Methods). The ProteinMPNN graphical model generates amino acid sequences purely on the basis of protein backbone coordinates and a recent extension to incorporate ligand and DNA atoms in the interaction graph, called LigandMPNN31. While the Rosetta-based sequence design protocol was constrained by a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) for each scaffold, LigandMPNN was purely based on the structure of the designed complex. To reduce the computational cost of full sequence design on the millions of generated scaffold docks for each target site, we first repacked only the RIF side-chain residues in the context of the target to remove potential clashes between designed side chains. Docks for which good protein–DNA interactions could be achieved without side-chain clashes were then subjected to multiple iterations of full sequence design, alternating with Rosetta backbone relaxation to maximize complementarity to the target sequence. We generated 200,000–300,000 designed complexes per target. From this large set of designs, we selected those with the most favorable free energy of binding (Rosetta ΔΔG), contact molecular surface area6 and interface hydrogen bonds, with the fewest interface buried unsatisfied hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors and with bidentate side chain–base hydrogen-bonding arrangements frequent in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Methods).

To address design challenge 3—precise geometric side-chain placement—we hypothesized that specificity and affinity would be improved in designs with highly preorganized interface side chains. We reasoned that preorganization would be especially important for long polar side chains with many possible conformations. We achieved preorganization through side chain–side chain hydrogen bonding and assessed it using the Rosetta RotamerBoltzmann calculation32. By selecting only designs with native-like preorganization of key contacts (Supplementary Fig. 2), we aimed to achieve the level of precision required for specific DNA binding.

Following selection based on the above criteria and clustering by sequence identity, the monomeric structures of the hundreds to thousands of remaining designs for each target were predicted on the basis of their sequences using AF2 and designs that deviated from their original design models were discarded. The remaining predicted monomer structures were superimposed onto the design complex through alignment on the interface residues of the original design and relaxed with Rosetta in the context of the DNA. Designs with the most favorable DNA-binding interactions after superimposition, as assessed with the above metrics, were selected for experimental characterization. To obtain additional high-quality designs, the DNA-interacting segments of the filtered designs were extracted, clustered and grafted back into the original in silico scaffold library, followed by a second round of sequence design (Fig. 1f)6. We also diversified the best designs using RoseTTAFold Inpainting33, focusing on the resampling of scaffold loops, followed by sequence design (Fig. 1g). We generated at least 10,000 designs for each DNA target that passed all the structural and DNA interaction filters using a combination of these approaches.

We created three sets of designs using variations of the overall design approach. In the first set, we generated 21,488 designs using Rosetta-based sequence design, the motif grafting strategy and our custom scaffold library of AF2-predicted native DNA-binding domains. In this set, the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) targets were the DNA portions of cocrystal structures. In the second design set, we generated 12,273 designs against the same DNA sequences with the LigandMPNN sequence design strategy and the motif grafting approach for backbone resampling. In this case, rather than designing only against the dsDNA conformations found in each target's respective crystal structure, we also designed against straight B-DNA of the same sequences (6,608 for B-DNA and 5,666 for crystal-derived DNA). The LigandMPNN approach was less effective at generating designs with a high contact molecular surface, likely because of the ability of Rosetta to relax the protein backbone during sequence design, but ultimately produced designs with more favorable free energy of binding (Rosetta ΔΔG) and an increased number of hydrogen bonds to bases (Supplementary Fig. 3). Lastly, in the third set we generated 100,000 designs using the LigandMPNN-based design pipeline and the inpainting-based backbone remodeling protocol against 11 unique B-DNA targets. To test whether our method could generate binders to novel DNA sequences, design set 3 sequences were not derived from a crystal structure and contained submotifs not represented among DNA sequences bound by protein–DNA complexes in the PDB or in the JASPAR nonredundant transcription binding profile database34,35.

For each set of designs, synthetic oligonucleotides (230 bp) encoding the 50–65-aa designed proteins were ordered in a single pool and cloned into a yeast surface-expression vector. Cells containing designs that bound each DNA target were enriched by several rounds of fluorescence-activated cell sorting using fluorescently labeled target dsDNA oligos. The naive and sorted populations for each DNA target were deep-sequenced and the frequency of each design in the starting population and after each sort was determined. From this analysis, we identified 97 designs that were substantially enriched (>100×) in pools sorted with their intended dsDNA target compared to the naive library.

We tested these 97 designs as individual clones in a 96-well screening format and found detectable binding for 44 of them (Extended Data Fig. 1). The remainder may result from doublet transformants in the yeast pool or are very weak binders that were enriched under higher dsDNA oligo concentrations. Of the 44 successful designs, 30 were derived with targets modeled as ideal B-DNA and 14 were derived with DNA crystal structure models as targets. For each of these designs, we knocked out the DNA-binding interface by substituting the 2–3 residues making the most extensive interactions with the DNA bases (Supplementary Table 1). These knockout mutations completely or substantially disrupted binding for all designs that had detectable binding on yeast (Extended Data Fig. 1), indicating that the functional designs worked as intended.

We performed an all-by-all screen of DBP design hits to 13 unique dsDNA targets (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 2). Several designs exhibited a strong preference for only their designed target sequence (for example, DBPs 6, 9 and 62), others exhibited a strong preference for two or three of the sequence targets (for example, DBPs 1, 52 and 60) and a few bound to most of the targets (for example, DBPs 23, 44 and 89). To try to understand these observed binding preferences, each tested DNA sequence was threaded onto each design complex model at all possible base-pair alignments, the alternative complex models were relaxed with Rosetta and the model with the most favorable Rosetta ΔΔG was selected. We found a modest correlation between the predicted free energy of binding and the extent of off-target binding (Extended Data Fig. 2); for DBPs 44 and 89, Rosetta ΔΔG values comparable to the original targeted sequence were obtained for most of the off-target sites, consistent with the observed low specificity. Overall, we found that 14 designs bound with specificity closely consistent with the design models (DBPs 5, 6, 9, 35, 43, 69, 47, 48, 51, 56, 57, 60, 62 and 85), including binders for five unique DNA sequences (sequences A–E). Specific binders were obtained for some sequence targets, such as sequence D, at much higher rates than others, suggesting a preference for specific DNA motifs. Indeed, many of the sequence D binder design models contain very similar interface hydrogen-bond contacts (Fig. 2d). This may reflect a greater suitability of HTH scaffolds for some motifs over others, the specific DNA shape formed by the preferred target motifs or an inherent preference of the LigandMPNN model.

Additional characterized designs are shown in Extended Data Fig. 5. f, DBPs 6 and 48 (colored) differ in both structure and docking mode to native cocomplex structures with matching DNA-binding sites (gray). g, DBP 35 has a similar structure and dock to the closest match in the PDB but binds a distinct DNA target site, whereas DBPs 56 and 62 have structures similar to the closest matches but different docks and DNA target sites. DBP 48 was analyzed with sequence C because of its improved binding signal and nearly identical modeled binding sites (Extended Data Fig. 2); all other designs were analyzed with their designed target sequence.

Source data

We used a yeast display competition assay to characterize the DNA-binding site specificity of a subset of the designs (Fig. 2a–e, left, and Extended Data Fig. 3). Addition of nonbiotinylated competitor dsDNA to the biotinylated target sequence reduced binding signal by flow cytometry and scanning base substitutions through the competitor revealed positions important for binding (Fig. 2a–e, middle). DBPs 6, 35, 48, 56 and 62 exhibited specificities consistent with the designed side chain–base interactions. For example, in DBP 6, R31 and R36 in the design model form bidentate hydrogen bonds with the guanines of base-pair positions G12 and C9, respectively, while T32 forms a hydrogen bond with C10. Substitution of the bases at positions 9, 10 and 12 eliminated competition, indicating specificity for the GCxG motif as expected (Fig. 2a). DBP 62 exhibited specificity for its target site despite having relatively few base-specific hydrogen-bonding interactions; specificity in this case may have resulted from the very tightly packed interface (Fig. 2e). The observed specificities agree with those predicted from the design model using DeepPBS for DBPs 5, 6, 9 and 35 (ref. 4).

Genes encoding the designs were encoded for Escherichia coli expression and purified proteins were evaluated for binding in vitro. Most of the selected designs were in the soluble fraction, readily purified by Ni2+-NTA chromatography, and appeared monodisperse by size-exclusion chromatography (Extended Data Fig. 4). Binding to the biotinylated dsDNA oligo was assessed using biolayer interferometry (BLI) and all designs were found to bind with binding affinities ranging from 30 to 500 nM (Fig. 2a–e, right, and Extended Data Fig. 5).

Although some of the designs target DNA sequences found in crystal structures, the designed DBPs and their sequence preferences are novel, as assessed by comparison of the binding-site motifs to cocomplex structures of native DBPs in the PDB containing a protein helix in contact with bases in the DNA major groove. We found that some designs (DBPs 6, 35 and 48) preferred a similar motif as native DBP structures but had substantially unique interfaces and docking orientations, while other designs (DBPs 56 and 62) bound novel sequences found neither in the PDB (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 6a–c) nor in the JASPAR nonredundant transcription binding profile database34,35 (Supplementary Fig. 4).

Our binder design method aims to effectively sample diverse scaffold–DNA docks to find solutions optimal for binding the target DNA sequence. The method could, in principle, recover solutions similar to known native DBP–DNA complexes. To investigate this, we compared the structures of our designed DBPs to native DBP domains in DNA cocrystal structures in the PDB by TM-align29 (Fig. 2g, Extended Data Fig. 6d–h and Supplementary Table 3). We found that the overall folds of the designed scaffolds had matches in the PDB but the placement of the scaffold relative to the DNA generally differed, as expected given the de novo docking step in our approach. None of the closest matches by protein structure had more than three of seven common bases at the aligned DNA-binding site positions and the side chain–base hydrogen-bond networks differed substantially. For all designs that bound their DNA targets, we also performed BLASTp searches of the nonredundant protein sequences database36 and found that most had sequence similarity to native metagenome protein sequences ranging from 40% to 60% (Supplementary Table 1). Overall, these analyses suggest that our approach was able to use and expand upon the known native docking space, while exploring new sequence space, to identify effective DBP designs against the specified target sequences.

To evaluate the importance of backbone sampling through docking, we examined the ability of LigandMPNN-based sequence design to generate interfaces passing our in silico metrics when starting from crystal structures of native cocomplexes rather than de novo docks. Starting from cocrystal structures with high TM-align scores to the designed DBPs, we mutated the DNA sequence in silico to the target sequence and redesigned the sequence using LigandMPNN. We found that designs based on fixed native backbones failed to recover most of the base-specific hydrogen bonds present in the designs produced by our docking pipeline (Extended Data Fig. 6i). In the few cases where native redesign did recover multiple base-specific hydrogen bonds, such as DBPs 6 and 35, the de novo docked design models scored better on side-chain preorganization by the RotamerBoltzmann metric (Extended Data Fig. 6j), suggesting non-hydrogen-bond features of the interface that may be critical for specific binding and require precise docking configurations. Overall, our design method identifies designs that would not be identified through structure-based redesign and generates specific binders for unique DNA sequences that are not known to be recognized by native proteins.

We solved the cocrystal structure of DBP 48 in complex with its preferred target sequence and found very close agreement to the design model (Table 1, Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 7). Cα root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of the cocrystal structure to the design model was 0.64 Å for the binder alone and all-atom r.m.s.d. was 1.907 Å for the protein–DNA complex. Among interface residues forming key interactions with bases, R38 and S39 were in the closest agreement and formed the expected side chain–base hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3b). D43 and R49 did not form the expected hydrogen bonds observed in the design model, likely because of slight differences in orientation of the binder to DNA and deviations from ideal B-DNA in the cocrystal structure. D43 was instead involved in a water-mediated hydrogen bond to C11 (Fig. 3c) and R49 was part of a hydrogen-bond network involving the phosphate backbone. An additional water-mediated hydrogen bond was observed between S42 and A10. While water-mediated interactions are not considered by the Rosetta protocol used to build the side chains in the final design model, the LigandMPNN sequence design method implicitly considers these as the PDB training set contains many examples of water-mediated hydrogen bonds, which are known to confer additional specificity in native DBPs20,21,37. Extensive hydrogen-bond networks were also observed with the DNA phosphate backbone, with most involved protein residues supported by side chain–side chain hydrogen bonds and packing interactions. These hydrogen-bond networks with the phosphate backbone imply that much of the docking orientation is dominated by these interactions, suggesting that further enrichment for these features could improve design success rates.

Source data

To assess the contributions of each amino acid to binding for additional designs, we generated high-resolution footprints of the binding surface by sorting site saturation mutagenesis (SSM) libraries in which every residue was substituted with each of the 20 amino acids one at a time for DBPs 1, 6 and 35 (Fig. 3d,e and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6). For each of the three designs, we found that most positions at the interface and the core were largely conserved, while positions at the surface were more tolerant of substitutions. In a small number of cases, substitutions led to notable improvements in binding affinity. The depletion of most substitutions in both the binding site and the core suggests that the design models are largely correct, whereas the enriched substitutions suggest routes to improving affinity.

We selected seven designs for further assessment of specificity in vitro using universal protein-binding microarrays (uPBMs) containing all possible 7-mer DNA sequences38,39. We found that several designs exhibited very high specificity for their design targets, most notably DBPs 6, 9 and 48, for which 7-mers containing the binding-site motif were highly preferred over those lacking the motif (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 8). All-by-all analysis of on-target DBPs (Extended Data Fig. 2) showed that, while some designs exhibited off-target binding, a number were highly specific to a single target. Five of our designed DBP–target pairs were highly orthogonal (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 9i).

For DBP 35, which had moderate preference for the designed motif (Extended Data Fig. 8), we explored optimization of the specificity and affinity by combining substitutions found in mutational scanning. We found that combining three mutations into an optimized variant (DBP 35opt) (Extended Data Fig. 9a–c) (R33N, which prevents a potential off-target interaction; K18V, which adds an additional hydrophobic interaction with the methyl stem of base ADE11; P42Q, which potentially stabilizes the protein scaffold structure) dramatically increased binding strength observed by yeast display with detectable binding down to ~150 pM (Extended Data Fig. 9d). These mutations also increased specificity to seven base-pair positions as observed in a yeast competition assay (Extended Data Fig. 9e) compared to the specificity to three base-pair positions observed in the original design (Fig. 2b) and substantially reduced binding to off-target motifs (Supplementary Fig. 1f–h). Thus, just a few mutations of an initial design can lead to dramatic improvements in specificity and affinity.

We tested the ability of our designed DBPs to function in cells to regulate transcription. To assay transcriptional repression in E. coli, we constructed candidate NOT gates40, where the input is a designed DBP under control of the IPTG-inducible PTac promoter and the output is yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) expression driven by a promoter incorporating the DBP DNA-binding site (Extended Data Fig. 10a). Single DBP domains and two copies of the same DBPs tethered through a flexible linker failed to exhibit YFP repression upon IPTG induction (Extended Data Fig. 10b), suggesting a need for higher-affinity binding, longer sequence recognition and/or a bulkier binding protein for effective hindrance of transcription initiation by E. coli RNA polymerase. To increase avidity and bulk, we positioned two copies of the same DBP (or one copy each of two different DBPs) on B-form DNA containing two palindromic copies of the target site (or the two different target sites), separated by different numbers of bases. We then used RFdiffusion41 to build out new protein backbone segments that either transition into the TetR homodimer42 or interact directly in homodimeric or heterodimeric arrangements (Fig. 5a). Following sequence design with ProteinMPNN to favor folding and assembly of the extensions to the intended dimeric structure, we used AF2 to predict the structures of the homodimers and heterodimers and selected those that were close to the design models. We experimentally characterized the ability of these designs to repress transcription from synthetic promoters incorporating two dimer binding sites (four individual domain-binding sites in total) flanking the −35 promoter region. Dose-dependent repression (>2-fold) was observed for 2 of 96 TetR-incorporating homodimeric designs (Extended Data Fig. 10c–e) and 18 of 192 entirely de novo homodimeric and heterodimeric repressors incorporating different designed DBPs (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 10f,g). All-by-all characterization of six selected designs and the corresponding cognate promoters showed considerable orthogonality (Fig. 5b,c), with up to 20-fold repression for cells with the cognate target (DBP 57_A2/DBP 57_A2). Notably, two de novo dimeric designs with DBP 57 designed to bind palindromic arrangements of the cognate target site at different spacings and in different orientations were each specific for their intended target, indicating that a single domain can serve as the basis for creating an array of orthogonal repressors.

Dots represent individual data points, bars represent mean fold activation and error bars represent the s.d. of the mean relative barcode abundance (n = 3 biological replicates).

Next, we tested DBP function as activators in mammalian cells. A set of synthetic transcription factors (synTFs) were created by fusing the GCN4 dimerization domain and the VP64 activation domain to the C termini of DBPs 9, 35opt, 48, 57 and 60, which collectively recognize three unique motifs. The dimerization domain allows the DBPs to recognize a palindromic target sequence consisting of two binding motifs, increasing the binding affinity to the DNA sequence. We used the ENGRAM43 recording technology to measure the activity of specific cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5d). In ENGRAM, each CRE drives expression of a uniquely barcoded pegRNA, which, upon expression, is recorded into the DNA TAPE at the HEK3 locus by prime editor PEMax. After analyzing the barcode abundance for each individual CRE, we observed 3–5-fold activation for DBPs 9, 35opt, 57 and 60 (Fig. 5e).

Across all targets, designs that bound specifically to their intended target (Extended Data Fig. 1) tended to have more side-chain and main-chain phosphate hydrogen bonds, lower Rosetta ΔΔG and lower Cα r.m.s.d. of the AF2-predicted structure to the design model (Supplementary Fig. 7), while nonspecific binding was strongly correlated with a positive net charge. We did not observe enrichment of higher RotamerBoltzmann probabilities for side chains that make hydrogen bonds with bases, likely because of prior enrichment in the ordered design sets. However, we did observe enrichment of higher RotamerBoltzmann probabilities for side chains that make hydrogen bonds with phosphates (Supplementary Fig. 7). Further enrichment for these metrics should increase design success rates. For the DNA sequence targets where we generated successful binder hits and used the same design procedure against both ideal B-DNA and DNA derived from a cocrystal structure (design set 2), we did not observe a notable difference in success rates (eight hits with B-DNA and six hits with cocrystal-derived DNA).

A key feature of our design method is sampling from numerous diverse starting structures and docking positions to find complexes that can engage both the bases for sequence-specific recognition and the phosphate backbone to favor the designed binding mode. Like the most specific of our designs, native DBPs also have geometries enabling formation of main-chain phosphate hydrogen bonds (Supplementary Fig. 8) and highly preorganized side-chain phosphate hydrogen bonds (Supplementary Fig. 2). This is perhaps because of the inherent rigidity of these interactions that favor specific docks and restrict otherwise possible interactions of flexible side chains with off-target DNA base atoms. To explore the importance of phosphate contacts mediating specific docks for achieving specificity to a given target site, we performed LigandMPNN redesign of 14 hits from our design campaigns against 100 randomly generated target sequences. Upon Rosetta relaxation of the redesigned complexes (20 LigandMPNN designed proteins per target–scaffold pair) in the presence of DNA, we observed that only two of the 100 sequences have as favorable Rosetta ΔΔG values and as many hydrogen bonds to bases (Supplementary Fig. 9), suggesting that the details of the scaffold backbone and dock make important indirect contributions to specificity by locking in the exact binding mode and narrowing the range of possible side chain–base contacts. This makes it difficult to design DBPs to new DNA sequences through a native redesign approach and highlights the advantage of our computational sampling-based approach.

Our computational DNA binder design approach can generate DBPs that specifically bind arbitrary DNA sequences, including sequences that are not bound by known DBPs in the PDB or JASPAR databases. These designed DBPs function both in vitro and in living cells, as assessed through transcriptional repression and activation assays in both E. coli and eukaryotic cells, respectively. The method samples structurally diverse HTH scaffolds to identify complexes that can facilitate specific contacts with the target DNA bases. The best designs were highly specific for their intended targets and the crystal structure and specificity profiling assays strongly corroborate the computational design models. The modularity of the binding domains enables further increases in specificity by rigidly positioning multiple modules along the DNA double helix using RFdiffusion; as illustrated in Fig. 5b, two designs having two copies of the same binding module at different spacings each modulate transcription at a tandem target site with matching spacing but not at a target site with mismatched spacing.

The design method presented in this paper now enables the design of custom DNA-binding miniproteins to target specific DNA sequences for diverse applications in gene regulation and editing. While we focused on design of HTH domains as a proof of principle, the method should be extensible to DBP families beyond the HTH domains used here, particularly those using a helix in the major groove for recognition such Cys2His2 ZF domains or homeodomains, by generating scaffolds models with structure prediction tools; using scaffolds containing extensive β-sheets or loops, such as p53-like TFs44 could be more difficult because of their increased flexibility but should still be feasible. Beyond extending to a broader range of scaffolds, future design improvements would include consideration of sequence-dependent DNA shape, induced fit and the role of water-mediated hydrogen bonds, all of which are known to have an important role in sequence recognition25,26,45. We focused on design of direct side chain-base interactions against a fixed target DNA sequence for simplicity and because of the accuracy and computational costs of existing tools to model DNA conformational flexibility and water-mediated interactions. Moving forward, it should become possible to model these features more accurately and more computationally-efficiently using machine learning methods such as existing or future variants of RoseTTAFold-NA46, AF3 (ref. 47) and RFdiffusion-allatom48.

The ability to incorporate designed DBPs into transcriptional regulators through homodimerization and heterodimerization (Fig. 5) should allow the expansion of orthogonal TF–operator pairs for more complex gene circuits49. As outlined in Fig. 5, using RFdiffusion, it should be straightforward to fuse DNA-binding miniproteins together in a single chain in defined spatial orientations to allow specific targeting of longer target sites or link DBPs with epigenetic modifiers or other effector recruiting domains to provide functionality beyond transcriptional activation and repression. Computationally designed DBPs are also well suited for the simultaneous recognition of both DNA sequence and shape, including non-B-DNA structures that may occur in ~13% of the human genome50. For any given backbone, there will likely be limitations in the ability to target certain DNA sequences, which likely explains the challenges in generating Cys2His2 ZF and other native scaffolds to bind to some target sites; our approach provides a powerful new method for building DBPs with backbones tailored to specific sequences of interest and we anticipate that the method and the sequence-specific designs should be widely useful in synthetic biology and other areas requiring sequence-specific DNA recognition.

Scaffolds deposited to the PDB with structural similarity to selected template backbones (PDB 1L3L (ref. 51) and PDB 1PER (ref. 52)) were identified using TM-align29. Amino acid sequences of identified protein scaffolds were used as seeds to generate multiple-sequence alignments (MSAs) using an HHBlits53 search of the UniRef30 database54. Resulting MSAs were used for HMMer55 searches of the JGI metagenome protein sequence databases56 and the Uniref100 database54. HMMer search results were clustered to <70% sequence identity using MMSeqs2 (ref. 57) and MSAs were generated from each clustered sequence using HHBlits. AF2 (ref. 28) was used to predict structures for each sequence using the generated MSAs. Resulting scaffolds were filtered for high confidence AF2 pLDDT scores, TMscore to the input backbone templates and Rosetta score. Scaffolds of specific topologies were supplemented with additional AF2-predicted structures of TF sequences identified from bacterial metagenomes using DeepTF58. PSSMs were generated for each scaffold using PSI-Blast59 and custom code for use as constraints of Rosetta design. All final scaffolds are available for download.

Structures of B-DNA for each target (Supplementary Table 2) were generated by (1) using the DNA portion of PDB 1BC8 (ref. 60), PDB 1YO5 (ref. 61), PDB 1L3L (ref. 51) or PDB 2O4A (ref. 62) or (2) using the software X3DNA63, followed by a constrained Rosetta relax of the DNA structure. RIFdock was allowed to target along the entire stretch of each target sequence. The RIF docking method performs a high-resolution search of continuous rigid-body docking space. RIF docking comprises two steps. In the first step, ensembles of interacting discrete side chains (referred to as ‘rotamers') tailored to the target are generated. Polar rotamers are placed on the basis of hydrogen-bond geometry, whereas apolar rotamers are generated through a docking process and filtered by an energy threshold. Rotamers were only calculated for nucleotide base atoms in the major groove of the DNA target. All the RIF rotamers are stored in ~0.5-Å sparse binning of the six-dimensional rigid-body space of their backbones, allowing extremely rapid lookup of rotamers that align with a given scaffold position. To enrich for canonical protein–DNA hydrogen-bond interactions, rotamers of arginine, glutamine and asparagine forming bidentate hydrogen bonds with G and A bases were extracted from the PDB, clustered by r.m.s.d., aligned to the DNA target at all G and A positions and added to the RIF as hotspot residues. To facilitate the next docking step, RIF rotamers are further binned at 1.0-Å, 2.0-Å, 4.0-Å, 8.0-Å and 16.0-Å resolution. In the second step, a set of scaffolds was docked into the produced rotamer ensembles, using a hierarchical branch-and-bound search strategy. Starting with the coarsest 16.0-Å resolution, an enumerative search of scaffold positions was performed; the designable scaffold backbone positions were checked against the RIF to determine whether rotamers could be placed with favorable interacting scores. All acceptable scaffold positions (up to a configurable limit, typically 10 million) were ranked and promoted to the next search stage. Each promoted scaffold was split into 26 child positions in the six-dimensional rigid-body space, providing a finer sampling. The search was iterated at 8.0-Å, 4.0-Å, 2.0-Å, 1.0-Å and 0.5-Å resolutions. All RIF docks were required to use at least one hotspot residue to be saved as an output.

The next steps of the DBP design pipeline after RIFdock involved sequence design and/or modeling protocols with Rosetta. To facilitate this, a new version of the Rosetta score function was trained to better evaluate the energy of protein–DNA interfaces. Additional flexibility of the DNA duplex was incorporated into Rosetta's rotamer optimization and gradient-based minimization modules using modifications of DNA dihedral angles64 and the score function was optimized using the same general method as previously published65. The weights of individual terms in the score function were optimized to reproduce the geometries of DNA crystal structures. Specifically, the distributions of pairwise atomic distances, base-stacking and base-pairing geometries and bond torsions were considered. Additional optimization was performed on tasks related to protein–DNA complex structures. These tasks included energy ranking of perturbed crystal structures, rotamer recovery in repacking crystal structures and sequence recovery in redesigning the protein sequence of crystal structures. An additional weight was placed on the frequency of positively charged residues at interface positions because previous score functions tended to overestimate the strength of solvent-exposed charged interactions. Similar geometric and design tasks were included for protein structures alone. Rosetta score weights optimized included partial atomic charges of protein and DNA, hydrogen-bond strengths and solvation energies. The resulting score function showed improvement across nearly all tasks, with the greatest improvements found in the protein–DNA energy ranking and sequence design.

A stripped down version of the Rosetta score function was used to roughly design the interface of RIF dock outputs6. This step was primarily used to replace clashing residues before evaluating for design potential. Specifically, fa_elec, lk_ball[iso,bridge,bridge_unclp] and the _intra_ terms were disabled. All that remained were Lennard–Jones, implicit solvation and backbone-dependent one-body energies (fa_dun, p_aa_pp and rama_prepro). Additionally, flags were used to limit the number of rotamers built at each position (Supplementary Information). After the rapid design step, the designs were minimized twice: once with a low-repulsive score function and again with a normal-repulsive score function. Rosetta ΔΔG and contact molecular surface were then calculated on the roughly designed interface. A maximum-likelihood estimator was used to give each predicted design a likelihood that it should be selected to move forward. A subset of the docks to be evaluated were subjected to the full sequence design and their final metric values were calculated. With a goal threshold for each filter, each fully designed output can be marked as pass or fail for each metric independently. Then, by binning the fully designed outputs by their values from the rapid trajectory and plotting the fraction of designs that pass the goal threshold, the probability that each predicted design passes each filter can be calculated. From here, the probability of passing each filter may be multiplied together to arrive at the final probability of passing all filters. This final probability can then be used to rank the designs and pick the best designs to move forward to full sequence optimization. Note that the rapid design protocol here is used merely to rank the designs, not to optimize them; the original docks are the structures carried forward.

These docked conformations passing the rapid design protocol were further optimized to generate shape-complementary and chemically complementary interfaces using a Rosetta FastDesign protocol, alternating between side-chain rotamer optimization and gradient-descent-based energy minimization. Design was performed with a sequence profile constraint based on an MSA of the originating native scaffold sequence and cross-interface interactions upweighted to maximize contacts and shape complementarity. We did not allow Rosetta to repack or relax the DNA target during the design procedure. A Python script was implemented to automatically carry out rapid design evaluation, preemption and full sequence design. Computational metrics of the final design models were calculated using Rosetta, which includes ΔΔG, hydrogen bonds to base atoms and contact molecular surface, among others, for design selection. All the script and flag files to run the programs are provided in the Supplementary Information. ProteinMPNN was used to redesign noninterface residues in the final design step, before AF2 monomer validation.

LigandMPNN was used for sequence design in the context of DNA. The network was used to optimize the protein sequence for given protein–DNA complex structures during design, whereby amino acids were determined autoregressively by the identity and location of neighboring protein and DNA residues. When the full protein sequence was determined, it was threaded onto the input protein scaffold. As in the above Rosetta-based interface sequence design protocol, the designs were minimized with a low-repulsive score function and again with a normal-repulsive score function and Rosetta ΔΔG and contact molecular surface were calculated on the roughly designed interface. A maximum-likelihood estimator was used to pre-empt design of poor docks as described in the above Rosetta-based sequence design protocol. A Python script was implemented to automatically carry out MPNN sequence design, rapid design evaluation, preemption and Rosetta Relax. Computational metrics of the final design models were calculated using Rosetta, which includes ΔΔG, interface hydrogen bonds and contact molecular surface, among others. LigandMPNN temperatures of 0.2–0.3 were used earlier in the design process to increase the variability of amino acid sequences, while a temperature of 0.1 was used later to determine the more probable sequences. Key residues making base-specific hydrogen bonds with DNA atoms were fixed in later stages of the pipeline to encourage the design of supporting residues. All the script and flag files to run the programs are provided in the Supplementary Information.

Motif grafting was performed as previously reported6. Briefly, the binding energy and interface metrics for all the continuous secondary structure motifs (helix, strand and loop) were calculated for the designs generated in the broad search stage, as performed in previous work6. The motifs with good interactions (based on binding energy and other interface metrics, such as contact molecular surface) with the target were extracted and aligned using the target structure as the reference. All the motifs were then clustered on the basis of an energy-based TM-align-like clustering algorithm29 without any further superimposition. The best motif from each cluster was then selected on the basis of the per-position weighted Rosetta binding energy, using the average energy across all the aligned motifs at each position as the weight. Around 500–2,000 best motifs were selected and the scaffold library was superimposed onto these motifs using the MotifGraft mover66. Interface sequences were further optimized and computational metrics were computed for the final optimized designs as described in the Rosetta-based and LigandMPNN-based sequence design methods.

Scaffold secondary structures were determined using DSSP67. ProteinInpainting contigs were generated for each design that mask scaffold loops longer than four residues and surrounding residues while ensuring that all residues forming hydrogen bonds to the DNA backbone were conserved. In total, 10–20 unique contigs were generated for each design and sequences were constrained to a maximum of 65 aa. ProteinInpainting outputs were aligned to the DNA target using fixed interface residues of the input structure. The aligned ProteinInpainting outputs were subject to several further LigandMPNN + FastRelax rounds (DBP design steps 4 and 5) before AF2 monomer prediction and superposition steps.

AF2 structures were produced using the single sequence of each design. AF2 was run with model 1 and 12 recycles for each design. The Cα r.m.s.d. of the AF2 structures to each respective design model was calculated. AF2 structures were superpositioned onto the DNA target using the backbone coordinates of interface residues within 8 Å of the DNA target. A fixed backbone Rosetta FastRelax was performed on each superpositioned complex and all relevant metrics were calculated on the final superpositioned design model.

Designs were filtered after each sequence design step and after superimposition of AF2 models for those with the most favorable free energy of binding (Rosetta ΔΔG), contact molecular surface area6 and interface hydrogen bonds, the fewest interface buried unsatisfied hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors and those containing bidentate side chain–base hydrogen-bonding arrangements frequent in the PDB, including bidentate interactions of R–G, Q–A and N–A. Designs were additionally filtered for those with a high RotamerBoltzmann score (see below) among arginine, lysine, glutamine or asparagine residues forming hydrogen bonds with bases (max rboltz RKQE) and those with a high median RotamerBoltzmann (median rboltz) score of all residues forming hydrogen bonds with bases.

The Boltzmann probability of finding a given rotamer in a specific state was evaluated using the RotamerBoltzmannWeight filter in Rosetta32. The RotamerBoltzmann score is an approximation of preorganization of a given residue in the unbound state. All amino acid residues forming hydrogen bonds with DNA base or phosphate atoms were evaluated by this metric, which was calculated on the protein monomer in the unbound state. The metric was estimated by fixing neighboring side chains and assessing the Boltzmann probability distribution on rotamers accessible by the side chain of interest. To increase the likelihood of a given rotamer in the protein–DNA complex, designs with lower RotamerBoltzmann scores (a score of 0 implies the rotameric state is unpopulated and a score of 1 implies the state is the only populated state) were preferentially chosen, as known native protein–DNA crystal structures tend to contain preorganized amino acid residues (Supplementary Fig. 2).

To examine the ability of LigandMPNN-based sequence design to generate interfaces passing our in silico metrics when starting from crystal structures of native cocomplexes, we identified cocomplexes from the PDB with high TM-align to the designed DBPs. We mutated the DNA sequence in silico to the target sequence. In cases where the register of the DNA in the crystal structure complex did not match the design model, we systematically slid the design motif sequence, exploring all possible offsets and generating rethreaded structures for each sequence alignment. We used LigandMPNN to redesign the entire protein sequence of each native complex followed by side-chain relaxation using Rosetta FastRelax. To assess the resemblance between redesigned natives and designed DBP motifs, we examined whether the same amino acids formed hydrogen bonds with the same DNA base atoms (motif interaction recovery).

All protein sequences were padded to 65 aa by adding a (GGS)n linker at the C terminus of the designs to avoid the biased amplification of short DNA fragments during PCR reactions. The protein sequences were reverse-translated and optimized using DNAworks2.0 (ref. 68) with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae codon frequency table. Oligonucleotide pools encoding the designs were purchased from Agilent Technologies.

All libraries were amplified using Kapa HiFi polymerase (Kapa Biosystems) with a qPCR machine (Bio-Rad, CFX96). In detail, the libraries were first amplified in a 25-μl reaction and the PCR reaction was terminated when the reaction reached half-maximum yield to avoid overamplification. The PCR product was loaded onto a DNA agarose gel. The band with the expected size was cut out and DNA fragments were extracted using QIAquick kits (Qiagen). Then, the DNA product was reamplified as before to generate enough DNA for yeast transformation. The final PCR product was cleaned up with a QIAquick cleanup kit (Qiagen). For the yeast transformation step, 2–3 µg of linearized modified pETcon vector (pETcon3) and 6 µg of insert were transformed into the EBY100 yeast strain using a previously described protocol69.

DNA libraries for deep sequencing were prepared using the same PCR protocol, except the first step started from yeast plasmid prepared from 5 × 107 to 1 × 108 cells by Zymoprep (Zymo Research). Illumina adaptors and 6-bp pool-specific barcodes were added in the second qPCR step. Gel extraction was used to obtain the final DNA product for sequencing. All the different sorting pools were sequenced using Illumina NextSeq sequencing.

S. cerevisiae EBY100 strain cultures were grown in C −Trp −Ura medium supplemented with 2% (w/v) glucose. For induction of expression, yeast cells were centrifuged at 6,000g for 1 min and resuspended in SGCAA medium supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) glucose at the cell density of 1 × 107 cells per ml and induced at 30 °C for 16–24 h. Cells were washed with PBSF (PBS with 1% (w/v) BSA) and labeled with biotinylated targets using two labeling methods: with avidity and without avidity. For the with-avidity method, the cells were incubated with biotinylated target, together with anti-c-Myc fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC; Miltenyi Biotech) and streptavidin–phycoerythrin (SAPE; Thermo Fisher). The concentration of SAPE in the with-avidity method was used at one quarter of the concentration of the biotinylated targets. For the without-avidity method, the cells were first incubated with biotinylated targets, washed and secondarily labeled with SAPE and FITC.

Cell sorting of labeled yeast pools was performed using a Sony SH800S cell sorter. Libraries of designs were sorted using the with-avidity method for the first few rounds of screening to exclude weak binder candidates, followed by several without-avidity sorts with different concentrations of targets. For SSM libraries, two rounds of with-avidity sorts were applied and, in the third round of screening, the libraries were titrated with a series of decreasing concentrations of targets to enrich mutants with beneficial mutations.

For yeast display characterization of individual designs, including competition assays, DNA sequences encoding the proteins of interest were purchased as Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) E-Blocks, transformed into yeast cells and incubated in 96-well culture plates. Labeling with biotinylated dsDNA targets and SAPE/FITC was performed in a 96-well plate format. Of the 44 designs that were confirmed to bind their intended target in clonal yeast display experiments, (Extended Data Fig. 1), we categorized 14 with detectable binding to fewer than three of the 13 tested DNA targets (Extended Data Fig. 2) as specific binders and the remainder as nonspecific.

For yeast display competition assays, labeling was performed without avidity using 1 µM biotinylated dsDNA duplex oligos and an excess of 8 µM nonbiotinylated competitor dsDNA duplex oligos. As indicated in figure captions, some competition assays for higher-affinity binders were carried out with lower dsDNA oligo concentrations. Flow cytometry analysis was performed with an Attune NxT flow cytometer with autosampler. Flow cytometry data analysis was performed using custom Python code and the CytoFlow python package. For each individual sample, gating of the expression population was performed using the CytoFlow Gaussian mixture model and the ratio of SAPE channel intensity to FITC channel intensity (binding signal/expression signal) was calculated for all gated expression events of the sample.

The Pear program was used to assemble the fastq files from the deep sequencing runs. Translated, assembled reads were matched against the ordered design to determine the number of counts for each design in each pool. In each sequenced pool, binder enrichment was calculated by determining the percent of reads for each binder design in the pool and dividing this number by the same value in the naive expression sort pool. Designs were considered binders if >100-fold enrichment was observed in the last 1 µM with-avidity sort to the designed dsDNA target. For SSM libraries, apparent SC50 was estimated using the fitting procedure described in ref. 6.

DNA sequences encoding the proteins of interest were purchased as IDT E-Blocks and incorporated into plasmids using Golden Gate assembly. The plasmids were then transformed into BL21(DE3) competent E. coli. The transformation reactions were used to inoculate starter cultures in 5 ml or 25 ml of Terrific Broth (TB), supplemented with 1% (w/v) glucose and 50 mg L−1 kanamycin. After shaking overnight at 37 °C, the starter cultures were diluted 50-fold into 50 ml or 500 ml of TB with kanamycin. These cultures were incubated at 37 °C, shaking, until the optical density reached 0.6–0.8, at which point protein expression was induced by the addition of IPTG. The cultures were then further incubated overnight at 18 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 3,000g, pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5 mg ml−1 DNAse I and 1 mM PMSF, pH 8.0), the cells were lysed by sonication and the lysate was clarified by further centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000g. The supernatant was passed through Ni-NTA resin in a gravity column and then the resin was washed with 20 column volumes of high-salt wash buffer (2 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl and 20 mM imidazole, pH 8.0). Either the His-tagged protein was eluted with two column volumes of elution buffer (1 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris and 250 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) or the resin was further washed with five column volumes of SNAC buffer (100 mM CHES, 100 mM acetone oxime, 100 mM NaCl and 500 mM GnCl, pH 8.6), incubated in five column volumes of SNAC buffer + 0.2 mM NiCl2 on an orbital shaker at room temperature overnight and collected as the column flowthrough. Whether cleaved or not, the protein was concentrated to about 1 ml and loaded in 500-μl samples onto a Cytiva Superdex 75 Increase 10/300 GL gel filtration column equilibrated in buffer (1 M NaCl and 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Fractions containing monomeric protein were pooled and concentrated to about 200 μl. Protein concentrations were estimated spectroscopically by absorbance at 280 nm. For proteins with no tryptophan, tyrosine or cysteine residues, concentrations were approximated by Bradford reagent absorbance at 470 nm in comparison to BSA standards of known concentration.

BLI binding data were collected on an Octet R8 (Sartorius) and processed using the instrument's integrated software. Biotinylated dsDNA oligos were loaded onto streptavidin-coated biosensors (ForteBio) at 200 nM in PBS + 1% BSA + 0.05% Tween-20 for 6 min. Analyte proteins were diluted from concentrated stocks into the binding buffer. After baseline measurement in the binding buffer alone, the binding kinetics were monitored by dipping the biosensors in wells containing the target protein at the indicated concentration (association step) and then dipping the sensors back into baseline or buffer (dissociation). Data were analyzed and processed using ForteBio Data Analysis software v.9.0.0.14.

Purified DBP 48 was complexed with duplex DNAs, of varying duplex length and a single 5′ overhang base, to a final concentration of 176 µM DBP 48 and 233 µM duplex DNA. Complexes were screened for crystals in several broad matrix screens using a mosquito robot (SPT LabTech); then, possible hits were optimized in 24-well hanging drop trays with a 2-μl drop containing a 1:1 ratio of complex to well solution and equilibrated over 1 ml of well solution. A single diffraction-quality crystal was obtained with duplex DNA of length 10 bp with a single base overhang at either end of the duplex (5′-ACCTGACGCGA-3′, 3′-GGACTGCGCTT-5′) and a well condition containing 200 mM ammonium acetate, 100 mM sodium acetate at pH 4.6 and 28% PEG4000. The crystal was washed in well solution and then flash-cooled directly by plunging into liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at the Advanced Light Source in Berkeley on beam line 5.0.1 at a wavelength of 0.9762 Å and processed with DIALS70. Phases were determined through molecular replacement by searches with the original computational protein design and duplex DNA using Phaser71 in the PHENIX suite72. The top-scoring molecular replacement solutions were run through a round of refinement with PHENIX refine and further rounds of refinement with PHENIX refine and rebuilding with Coot73 were performed on the top-scoring structure. Data collection and refinement statistics are reported in Table 1.

uPBM experiments were carried out following the standard PBM protocol38,39. Briefly, we first performed primer extension to obtain dsDNA oligonucleotides on the microarray. Next, each microarray chamber was incubated with a 2% milk blocking solution for 1 h, followed by incubations with a PBS-based protein-binding mixture for 1 h and Alexa488-conjugated anti-His antibody (1:20 dilution; Qiagen, 35310) for 1 h. The array was gently washed as previously described38 and then scanned using a GenePix 4400A scanner (Molecular Devices) at 5-μm resolution. Data were normalized and processed with standard analysis scripts38,39.

For TetR fusions, diffusion inputs were generated by manually aligning DBP domains (DBPs 48, 57 and 69) symmetrically relative to the TetR homodimer scaffold. A total of 10,000 RFdiffusion trajectories were run per input to generate rigid linkers between the DBP domains and the TetR homodimer scaffold. ProteinMPNN sequence design was performed on dimer diffusion outputs with tied positions between the two units and most residues of the DBP fixed, only allowing the design of DBP residues nearby the newly diffused linker region. Homodimer complexes were predicted with ESMFold because of the inability of AF2 to predict the MPNN-designed TetR backbones. Predicted structures were filtered on the r.m.s.d. of the predicted DBP regions to the input DBP domains and ESMFold pLDDT to select 96 designs across the three inputs.

For homodimer and heterodimer design, diffusion inputs were generated by aligning DBP domains (DBPs 9, 35opt, 57 and 69) symmetrically or asymmetrically onto DNA. A total of 10,000 RFdiffusion trajectories were run per input to generate C2-symmetric homodimers or asymmetric heterodimers between the DBP domains. ProteinMPNN sequence design was performed on diffusion outputs with tied positions between the two units (for homodimers) and most residues of the DBP fixed. Complexes were predicted with AF2 and filtered on r.m.s.d. of the predicted DBP regions to the input DBP domains and pLDDT to select 96 homodimer designs and 96 heterodimer designs.

The pRF-TetR vector40 was used for transcriptional repression assays in E. coli. A new version of this vector (pRF-BsmB1) was constructed by first removing the LuxR gene and then replacing the TetR gene, its terminator sequence and regulated promoter with two BsmB1 cut sites such that new repressor variants and their associated promoters could be easily inserted by Golden Gate assembly74. For DBPs tethered with a flexible linker, a flexible linker was used to connect the C and N termini of two copies of the DBP (linker 1, KESGSVSSEQLAQFRSLD; linker 2, EGKSSGSGSESKST; linker 3, GGGGGGGG; linker 4, GSGSGSGSGSGSGSGS). Synthetic promoters were designed by inserting DNA-binding sites around the consensus −10 and −35 elements of the E. coli RNA polymerase promoter. Genes encoding the single-domain DBP, flexibly linked TetR fusions, homodimers and heterodimers were ordered as Twist synthetic gene fragments encoding the repressor gene (using Twist codon optimization), a transcriptional terminator and an associated synthetic promoter. Heterodimer constructs were encoded into bicistronic operons. Gene fragments were ordered containing BsmB1 cut sites on either end to allow for assembly into the modified pRF-BsmB1 vector. Upon Golden Gate assembly with the BsmB1 Type II-S restriction enzyme, plasmids were transformed into NEB 5α competent E. coli cells and streaked onto Luria–Burtani (LB) plates containing carbenicillin. All-by-all repressor constructs (Fig. 5c) were cloned by digestion with BsiWI-HF (New England Biolabs) and BbsI (New England Biolabs), followed by gel extraction of the backbone and promoter bands, ligation with T4 DNA ligase and transformation into NEB 5α competent E. coli.

Individual transformants were picked and verified by Sanger sequencing. Sequence verified colonies were inoculated into 200 µl of LB medium containing carbenicillin for overnight growth in 96-well round-bottom plates at 37 °C in a plate shaker. The following day, 2 µl of overnight cultures were transferred into a new plate with 200 µl of LB medium containing carbenicillin and appropriate concentrations of IPTG (1 mM in Fig. 5c) and grown for ~18 h in 96-well round-bottom plates at 37 °C. Flow cytometry analysis of cultures was performed with an Attune NxT flow cytometer with autosampler. Flow cytometry data analysis was performed using custom Python code and the CytoFlow python package. For each individual sample, gating was performed using the single component CytoFlow Gaussian mixture model and median BL1-A channel fluorescence was determined for all gated expression events of each sample. The median BL1-A channel fluorescence value of empty cells without a pRF vector was subtracted from the median BL1-A value of each sample. For each repressor variant in Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 9d, fold repression was calculated from at least seven biological replicates as the ratio of median BL1-A channel fluorescence of the uninduced sample (background-subtracted) to the median BL1-A channel fluorescence of the induced sample (background-subtracted).

Statistical methods and the reproducibility of experiments are indicated in the respective figures. No data were excluded from the analyses. Data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size but sample sizes were chosen to be consistent with those reported in previous publications6. The experiments were not randomized. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and analysis.

HEK293T cells purchased from the American Type Culture Collection expressing the PEmax were cultured in high-glucose DMEM (Gibco), supplemented with 10% FBS (Rocky Mountain Biologicals) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco). Cells were grown with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. A total of 1 × 105 cells were seeded on a 48-well plate 1 day before transfection. Enhancer plasmid and binder plasmid were mixed with a ratio of 2:1. Enhancer variants and background control were mixed with a ratio of 2:2:2:1. A total of 300 ng of plasmid was transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher, L3000015), following the manufacturer's protocol. Three synTF-specific recorders and 1 TCF−LEF− recorder (negative control) were mixed with ratio 2:2:2:1 and cotransfected with synTFs into the HEK293T cells expressing PEmax. Three different spacings were tested—1 bp, 3 bp and 5 bp—between the palindromic binding motifs to maximize the recorder activity. Cells were harvested and analyzed 2 days after transfection. Genomic DNA was extracted on the basis of a protocol described previously43. Briefly, cells were lysed using freshly prepared lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.05% SDS and 25 μg ml−1 protease (Thermo Fisher)) for each well. The genomic DNA mixture was incubated at 50 °C for 1 h, followed by an 80 °C enzyme inactivation step for 30 min. The DNA TAPE was amplified from the genomic DNA directly for next-generation sequencing. Recorded information was extracted using custom analysis code. Each enhancer has a unique barcode representing its activity. Transcription activation was measured as the fold change in the barcode abundance relative to the negative control barcode. All measurements were performed in triplicates. Error bars represent the s.d. of the mean relative barcode abundance.

Knockout sequences were created by mutating 1–3 key interface residues for base-specific contacts present in the wildtype (WT) design model (Supplementary Table 1). Samples of the WT design (WT + DNA, blue), and the knockout sequence (KO + DNA, orange) with target were analyzed after labeling with each respective dsDNA oligo at 1 µM with avidity (DBPs 7, 10, 11, 24, 25, 26, 28, 31, and 40 collected without avidity). The background signal of the wildtype design without dsDNA labeling (WT-DNA) is shown in green. Interface knockouts substantially disrupted dsDNA-binding in nearly all cases. b, Example (DBP43) of interface knockout of the original design model with base-specific hydrogen bonding ARG and GLN residues (pink). C, Model showing the two ALA substitutions (pink) of those residues.

a, Yeast surface display relative binding activity (Normalized PE/FITC) of each design labeled at 1 µM dsDNA with avidity, normalized by design row. Red squares indicate the intended target sequence for each design. Orange dots indicate target sequences containing Rosetta-predicted binding motifs. Sequences were considered potential binding targets if they had Rosetta ΔΔG less than or equal to the designed complex. DBPs 83, 85, 65, 6, 9, 35, 69, 47, 48, 51, 56, 57, 60, and 62 were considered to preferentially bind less than 3 of the 13 tested DNA target sequences, including their designed target sequence. b, DBP90 bound weakly to its initial design target, but strongly to an alternate target sequence (H) with slightly higher Rosetta ΔΔG but also allowed for bidentate hydrogen bonds to 3 bases. Left: DBP90 + A (on-target model), Right DBP90 + H (alternate target model). c, DBP48 bound weakly to its initially designed target sequence, but strongly to Rosetta-predicted alternative target site (D) that differed by only 1 base pair across the interface and had equivalent Rosetta ΔΔG. Left: DBP48 + I (on-target model), Right DBP48 + D (alternate target model). d, DBP57 bound strongly to its initial design target as well as an alternate target that contained an identical 6 bp stretch (ATCCAG) at the binding interface. Left: DBP57 + E (on-target model), Right DBP57 + C (alternate target model).

a-j, Relative binding activity (Median PE/FITC normalized to the no-competition sample) from flow cytometry analysis in yeast display competition assays for designs DBP1, DBP3, DBP5, DBP6, DBP9, DBP23, DBP35, DBP48, DBP56, and DBP62, respectively, with all possible DNA base mutations at each position of the competitor oligo. Heat maps show the mean of both replicates. Blue indicates competitor mutations where competition was stronger than with the wild-type competitor, while red indicates competitor mutations where competition was weaker. Competitor mutations where competition was weak (red) suggest incompatibility with binding to the competitor oligo. Asterisks indicate base pair positions contacted with hydrogen bonds or hydrophobic contacts to base atoms in the design model. Additional plots for individual replicate experiments are included in the raw data. DBP48 was analyzed with sequence C due to its improved binding signal and nearly identical modeled binding sites. All other designs were analyzed with their designed target sequence. In several cases we observed extra specificity beyond the positions directly involved in hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic contacts. For example, DBPs 6 and 9 exhibit specificity for a 6 nucleotide stretch (TGCACA) with peripheral dependence on T8 and A13. This specificity is most likely explained by effects of shape readout that are not considered by Rosetta modeling of the designs. DBP62 appears dependent on bases peripheral to the binding site (for example C11).

DBPs 5 and 35 were less specific to their target site but still preferred the target motif over sequences with a mutated binding motif (designed motif percentile 86.54% and 81.88%, respectively). DBPs 1 and 3 did not appear to have a preference to the designed target site (33.19% and 46.58%, respectively).

A sofa is one of the biggest investments you can make in home decor, and the last thing you want is to make the wrong choice. A good couch will be with you for a decade, and it should not only be comfortable and look great, it should also have the versatility to adapt to your needs in new spaces and seasons of your life.

You should consider a modular sofa. That's the kind that comes in individual pieces you can pull apart, put back together, and rearrange to suit whatever you fancy. Usually, you can change the color of the cover without buying a whole new couch. And when moving day comes, you won't need a team of three or four well-built movers to get it out the old door and into the new one.

I've been leading our coverage of the Best Couches for years, and many of us on the WIRED Reviews team have tested more than our fair share of different variations on the living-room seat. Modular couches are the way to go.

Castlery

If you move or travel frequently, a modular sofa is easy to take apart. No more playing Tetris in the U-Haul, trying to figure out how you're going to bring your old couch to your new place. And it's also easy to reconfigure. Say you're working from home and you get a new desk, and you need the chaise portion of your sofa to face a different direction. You don't need a new sofa, and you don't need to entirely rearrange your living room—you can just reconfigure your existing modular couch. Or maybe you get a new coffee table and you don't like how long your couch is in comparison. Remove a seat. It's that easy.

That's what recently happened to WIRED Reviews team director Martin Cizmar, who bought a new house and found that his new living room is functionally narrower than expected because of a large air register on the floor. Because he had the modular sofa from Koala, he simply removed one of the seats to turn it into an L-shape and put the extra section up in his attic for possible future use.

Koala

Koala

While there are a lot of standard, rectangular, boxy options, you can also play around with different fabrics and silhouettes. One example is the Castlery Auburn Performance Fabric Chaise Sectional, a modular couch with a fluffy, spill-resistant bouclé fabric and a bubbly, modern silhouette.

Modular couches can also come in handy if you have unconventional living arrangements. Do you live in a seventh-floor walk-up? A modular sofa comes in many boxes rather than as one gigantic package—you might have more steps to deal with, but you won't have to fork over extra cash for white-glove delivery, nor will you have to convince your friends to maneuver a sofa up several flights of stairs, cursing at the banister and scraping their knuckles on narrow hallways. No ruined friendships because you said “To your left” and they tilted the whole sofa in the wrong direction. No thrown-out backs or removing doors from hinges. I've gotten a few modular sofas delivered to apartments with stairs, and I was able to get them into my apartment by myself. (And, if your stairs be many, you'll only need to persuade one friend to help you out—not a bunch of them plus a truck.)

Lovesac

Modular sofas offer additional flexibility when it comes to configurations. You can make them an L-shaped sectional, a U-shaped sectional, or a traditional straight line. You can choose deep seats or shallower ones, and there are a ton of different upholstery finishes ranging from durable pet-friendly performance fabric to chenille. You could get a sleeper sofa or one designed for small spaces. Most of them come with removable, machine-washable covers, and some even have extra bells and whistles—like built-in storage or a way to charge your phone. The Lovesac Sactional is fully modular—we're in the process of giving it a dedicated review—and you can add StealthTech to it, which gives it speakers, a wireless charging pad, and a subwoofer. A home theater in your reconfigurable couch, complete with reclining seats? It's more likely than you think.

Modular couches do tend to be more expensive than standard options, but the convenience often outweighs the initial investment cost. For a modular sectional sofa, I find that it's better to go with, at the bare minimum, a standard three-seater sofa and an extra piece such as a chaise lounge. That way you can move things around, but you won't be stuck with too many additional seats, and you should still have room for an ottoman or a coffee table. Of course, if you want to go with an oversized eight-seater, you can do that too. There are some truly gargantuan modular options available, like the Cozey Ciello XL. You can even opt for an outdoor sofa, like Outer's Teak Outdoor Loveseat, which comes with a built-in cover to protect your patio furniture from the elements.

And while they do tend to be expensive, there are still some relatively affordable modular sofa options if you're on a tighter budget. The Albany Park Kova has been an honorable mention in our buying guide for a couple of years, and it costs the same—or less than—similar couches that aren't as customizable.

The long and the short of it is that a modular couch is largely similar to your standard, stuck-in-one-shape couch. You'll still get a solid warranty. You'll still get high-quality, high-density memory foam cushions, plush backrests, and comfortable back cushions. You still have the options for solid wood frames and stain-resistant fabric. But at the end of the day, if needed, you can change things up—something that's only easy to do if you have a modular sofa.

If you're in the market for a new couch, we've got plenty of recommendations in all shapes, sizes, and styles. You might also be able to visit a local showroom—or simply pester your comfy-couched friends about the brand they chose. (Let me know what it is in the comments!) And if you want the best of the bunch that'll stand the test of time, you'll consider a modular sofa.

At around 8 pm on Wednesday, the motorcade with Charlie Kirk's body left the Timpanogos Regional Hospital in Orem, Utah. Along the road, the 100 or so people who showed up for an impromptu memorial for Kirk stopped what they were doing, lined the sidewalk, and stared as it sped away from the mountains and into the dark. One pack of young “elders” from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints punctuated the air with a rendition of “Amazing Grace.”

Kirk had been at nearby Utah Valley University for the kickoff stop of his planned American Comeback Tour when a sniper allegedly stood on the roof of a building 200 or so yards away and took aim, killing him with one shot.

My presence at the makeshift gathering was as unplanned as the mourners: WIRED had sent me and photographer Sinna Nasseri to Utah to report on an unrelated story. We drove over to Orem to try to make sense of the moment.

Young people dominated the hospital crowd, which makes sense, since Kirk's major accomplishment was to promote his brand of right-wing politics to a cohort that has historically been uninterested in it. Kirk was many things: charismatic, politically canny, polemical, ruthless. His organization, Turning Point USA—with its mission to “win America's culture war”—was arguably the right's most successful new political group. A talented demagogue, he attacked trans people, LGBTQ people, Black people, Muslims, and women, and his arguments were often misleading, ahistorical, or rankly hypocritical. But because his public appearances so often took the shape of a seemingly fair debate—two citizens squaring off at microphones—they could feel honest and democratic to his fans.

Joshua Williams, 18, and Bryce Harding, 19.

“I really have to thank my Instagram algorithm for introducing me to him,” said Elder Joseph Trunnel, an 18-year-old wearing the starched white shirt and tie typical of the Latter-Day Saints. “Part of me wanted to be like him, because of how much of a genius he was.” Trunnel added that Kirk inspired him to go to trade school instead of college. “I got my barber license, and it's been working out really good,” he told me. “It's really made a difference in my life.” His friend and fellow LDS elder Bryce Harding, 19, agreed: “He spoke the truth; he never tried to cause contention.”

Ethan Mendenhall, 20, and Emma Hasson, 19, wave to cars near the hospital.

That, of course, is untrue. Kirk's career was built on contention. He went toe-to-toe with college students in public debates and also against older opponents, like California governor Gavin Newsom and the sharp liberal commentator Sam Seder. On his podcast he called for “a Nuremberg-style trial for every gender-affirming clinic doctor” and endorsed the “great replacement” conspiracy theory. His social media clips helped Kirk dominate the political sphere and positioned him as a crusader for far-right values—particularly among a rising conservative youth movement.

When I first arrived at the hospital, I bumped into a shell-shocked young boy in a green polo who couldn't have been older than 12. His mother, Whitney Williamson, 36, tightly held his hand as she told me that her son had liked watching Kirk's videos on TikTok and that he'd sheepishly asked her if they could visit the hospital and drop some flowers once he'd heard of Kirk's killing. “I can step back and say I don't have the same political beliefs as him,” Williamson said. “But no one deserves to be shot no matter what your political beliefs are. And to be killed on so many livestreams like that? It's horrific. He was someone's entire world. He's someone's baby.”

Locals watch the memorial from their lawn near Timpanogos Regional Hospital.

At the vigil, a man dressed as Abraham Lincoln called for peace and national healing, tearing up while giving a short speech that he simultaneously livesteamed on his iPhone. “When Abraham Lincoln was killed, they took his body for almost three weeks on a train ride throughout America to help people's hearts to turn to God instead of to anger,” he said. In other corners of the hospital lawn, grief quickly veered into conspiratorial musings about the so-called Deep State.

People stood huddled in groups, or alone, quietly crying. One of the speakers at the vigil captured the process of local grief metastasizing into internet anger. “This one shot,” he said, “will be heard across the world faster and farther than any one shot has ever been heard—I assure you.”

Emma Hasson, 19, who describes herself as politically “in the middle.”

Utah is a state generally known for its politeness and decorum, led by Mormon political figures like former senator and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Yet even here, strains of political radicalism have been percolating. Shortly before a 2023 visit to the state from President Joe Biden, FBI agents killed Craig Deleeuw Robertson a few miles away from where Kirk was later shot. Robertson had posted online that he'd heard of Biden's travel plans and was planning to dig out his ghillie suit and “clean the dust off the m24 sniper rifle.” He was armed when agents showed up to serve him a warrant. Then, at a June No Kings rally in Salt Lake City, the fashion designer Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, an innocent bystander, died after being accidentally shot by a band of so-called “peacekeepers.”

As WIRED has reported, right-wing figures including President Donald Trump immediately seized on Kirk's killing, in part by casting his death as irrefutable evidence that the left is intolerant of open debate. Perhaps the most worrying comments came from Stewart Rhodes, who pledged to reactivate his militia group, the Oath Keepers, and urged Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act to suppress the American left. At least two members of the Proud Boys, a far-right militant group, showed up to the hospital. One, a 35-year-old with a braided beard who goes by “Viking” even expressed shock at the unhinged state of political discourse, and violence, in America. “Charlie Kirk was the most middle-ground person out of all of them,” Viking reasoned. It didn't square to him that Kirk would be the target of an assassination. In some confounding way, Viking had appreciated Kirk's patina of fair debate. “Charlie could take a heated debate,” he alleged, “and turn it into a civil discussion.”

Thirty-seven-year-old Adam Calhoun, who, alongside his wife, was 10 feet away from Kirk when he was shot, stood on the grass dazed, clutching a MAGA hat he'd recovered from the scene that had been stained with dirt. He'd been driving around the region all afternoon with his wife, the two of them trying to process the violence they'd just encountered.

As the couple listened to the radio, Calhoun became irate at what he deemed the “left's intolerance,” specifically the irresponsible speculation from an MSNBC commentator that Kirk could have been killed by a supporter firing a gun “in celebration.” He told me that he'd never purchased a MAGA hat before, in part because he didn't like all the acrimony it spawned, but he pledged that he would keep this one forever. The killing, Calhoun concluded, “has emboldened me, for sure.” Another woman at the vigil echoed Calhoun's sentiments to a local reporter: “When it's your own home, it just kind of ignites something in you even more. It just makes me want to stand up even more and, I don't know, be even more vocal.”

Ethan Mendenhall, 20, was holding the hands of Emma Hasson, 19, who described herself as politically “in the middle” and said she had come to the vigil to express her opposition to violence. “When things like this happen it kind of sets you back,” she told me. “Even just standing here when they were saying the prayer, I felt vulnerable with my back to the cars. It just makes you feel unsafe.” Kirk's body made its final journey to his home state of Arizona on the vice president's plane this evening. As of this writing, the killer remains at large.

Apple's 2025 iPhones are here, and things are quite different for the first time in a while. The base iPhone 17 will still feel familiar, but the iPhone 17 Pro models have a completely new look, and there's a brand-new model called the iPhone Air. The “Air” branding has been somewhat diluted of late—the current-gen iPad Pro models are lighter than the iPad Air—but the iPhone Air brings meaning back to the original idea: a super-thin and ultra-lightweight device.

Preorders are live, and official sales start September 19. If you're considering an upgrade, what model should you get? I'll break down the key differences and similarities among the iPhone 17 lineup, so you can hopefully make a more informed choice on your next iPhone.

If you have an iPhone from just a few years ago, you probably don't need to upgrade to Apple's latest, unless your device has issues. Even then, there are things you can do to fix your iPhone, like getting a battery replacement, or you can try some of these troubleshooting steps. The point is, you shouldn't feel the need to upgrade just because Apple has a new model.

If you're set on buying an iPhone 17 model, we have a guide on how to sell your iPhone so that it doesn't just collect dust in a drawer. When your new device arrives, back up your old iPhone before switching to the new one, then follow our guide on factory resetting your device before selling or giving it away. We also have tips on how to set up your new iPhone and what settings to change to get the most out of it.

Let's quickly talk about the similarities across all the iPhone 17 models this year, and yes, that includes the iPhone Air, even if it doesn't have “17” in the name.

Although iPhones differ in screen size, they all feature an OLED screen (Apple refers to it as a Super Retina XDR display) and employ ProMotion technology. This is the first time the non-Pro models have ProMotion, which is essentially a 120-Hz refresh rate.

This has been a common feature on Android phones for a while, but it means your display refreshes 120 times per second rather than 60, like on the iPhone 16, so everything you do will feel smoother. (We have a broader explainer here.) These are adaptive refresh rates that can drop as low as 1 Hz when there's little activity on the screen, which is why the new iPhone 17 and iPhone Air now support the always-on display.

Apple also says there's a new Ceramic Shield 2 front glass that's 3X more scratch-resistant than before, and a new antireflective coating to reduce glare. All of these screens can also hit up to 3,000 nits of peak brightness, meaning it'll be easier to read your iPhone screen on sunny days.

The front-facing selfie camera is identical on all the iPhone 17 models. It's a new square-shaped 18-megapixel sensor, and that means you can expect more detail out of your selfies. However, the square sensor also introduces a smarter way to capture group selfies. You can keep holding your phone in portrait orientation for the best grip, and it will automatically zoom out to make sure everyone fits in the frame, while also switching to a landscape orientation for the widest view. All of these models also support Dual Capture, which lets you shoot with both the front and rear cameras at the same time. You can read more about these features here.

All of the iPhones are IP68 water- and dust-resistant and have Face ID, the Camera Control button, Action Button, USB-C, and Qi2 magnetic wireless charging (MagSafe). All devices start at 256 GB of storage. There's Apple Intelligence on these devices, the same Emergency SOS via Satellite and Crash Detection capabilities, and they utilize Apple's new N1 wireless networking chip for Bluetooth 6, Wi-Fi 7, and Thread support.

iPhone 17.

Now, here's where they diverge, which will help you better understand what model to buy.

As usual, the 6.3-inch iPhone 17 will most likely be the best iPhone for most people. The screen is slightly larger than its predecessor, there's more storage, and it finally features Apple's ProMotion 120-Hz technology. It's the only iPhone in the new lineup with the base A19 chipset, so while you should be able to run almost every app and game with ease, the next few iPhones in this list will deliver better performance, particularly with graphics-heavy apps.

While the iPhone 17 has the new Ceramic Shield 2 glass on the front to protect the screen, it doesn't use the original Ceramic Shield on the back glass; that's exclusive to the Air and Pro models. The 48-MP main camera may sound similar to the others, but it's not going to deliver the best results, though the ultrawide camera has been upgraded to 48 megapixels and should match the quality of the Pro iPhones.

The iPhone Air is the most unusual of the bunch. It's shockingly thin and lightweight, merely 5.6 mm and 165 grams. It's the only iPhone in the new series made from titanium, to ensure the thin frame remains durable. (Remember Bendgate?) The back also features the original version of Ceramic Shield, which gives it a slight boost in durability over the iPhone 17. It also has a unique 6.5-inch screen size.

With this new thin design, there are compromises to the camera. You only get a single 48-MP camera, the same as on the iPhone 17, but no ultrawide or telephoto. It lacks Cinematic mode for video and spatial video recording, both of which are available on the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro. The iPhone Air does enjoy a slight bump in performance with the A19 Pro chipset versus the A19 in the iPhone 17, though we'll have to wait to see if it's a minimal one or not.

The Air has the worst battery life according to Apple's claims compared to the rest of the new iPhones, but it still supposedly matches the iPhone 16 Plus from 2024, so we'll have to wait and see how it fares. Like the iPhone 17, the USB-C still only supports USB 2 data transfer speeds, meaning you're limited to 480 Mbps. It charges more slowly, hitting 50 percent in 30 minutes, whereas the iPhone 17 can do that in 20 minutes (with the right charging adapter). Even wirelessly, it only supports 20-watt Qi2 charging instead of 25 watts.

This is the only iPhone with Apple's new C1X modem. It's very efficient, but it means this iPhone doesn't support millimeter wave 5G, just sub-6 5G. (Read our 5G explainer to learn the differences.) That may not be a big deal since you only encounter that faster 5G in high-traffic areas, airports, and stadiums, but it's something to keep in mind.

The iPhone 17 Pro retains its 6.3-inch display but now has an aluminum unibody instead of titanium, supposedly for improved heat dissipation. Like the iPhone Air, it also employs Ceramic Shield on the back glass, in addition to Ceramic Shield 2 on the front. It also looks different! There's a two-tone design on the back highlighting the mix of metal and aluminum, not to mention the “Camera Plateau"" that spans across.

iPhone 17 Pro Max (left), iPhone 17 Pro (right).

These are the first iPhones with a vapor chamber cooling system. This is a heat dissipation technology we've seen on Android phones for years; there's a single drop of water inside the iPhone that moves through the chamber from vapor to liquid to keep the iPhone cooler for longer, and disperses heat better. That should deliver better sustained performance, and so should the A19 Pro. Unlike the A19 Pro on the Air, it has one extra graphics core here.

The telephoto camera has been upgraded to 48 megapixels, so now you have an entire triple-camera array with 48-MP sensors. It delivers 4X optical zoom and up to 8X optical-like quality. It's still the only iPhone model that can shoot 4K at up to 120 frames per second, and there are numerous exclusive video features aspiring filmmakers may find useful, like Genlock and ProRes RAW. It has better image stabilization than the other models, a better flash, and nicer microphones, and Apple still only offers the Lidar scanner on these Pro models.

The iPhone 17 Pro Max is identical to the iPhone 17 Pro except in size. It sports a 6.9-inch screen, making it the heaviest iPhone, but it also has the biggest battery, boasting up to 39 hours of video playback compared to 33 hours on the iPhone 17 Pro. It's also the only iPhone with a 2-terabyte storage option, if you need that much local space.

Like the smaller Pro, the USB-C supports USB 3, so you can take advantage of up to 10 Gbps data transfer speeds, a big boost over the iPhone Air and iPhone 17.

The iPhone 17 Pro.

I always recommend you buy your iPhone unlocked. It makes switching carriers a breeze, and you'll have no hassles if you swap to an international eSIM when traveling. The iPhones sold via Apple's storefront are unlocked, with one exception: If you buy through an AT&T installment plan, your iPhone will be network-locked. Buying the iPhone 17 unlocked increases the price by $30 to $829 instead of $799, but it's well worth it.

The best place to buy an iPhone is Apple.com. You can use the Apple Store app to place your order. Don't forget to take advantage of Apple's promotions: You get three free months of Apple News+, Apple Fitness+, Apple TV+, and Apple Music. It'll auto-bill you after the trial, so set a reminder to cancel if you don't want to continue subscribing to these services.

Apple has some financing options. If you have an Apple Card, you can pay for your iPhone over 24 months at 0 percent APR. Alternatively, you can finance through your carrier at Apple for over 24 or 36 months at 0 percent APR, or you can join the iPhone Upgrade Program. The latter lets you get the latest iPhone every year, and includes AppleCare+ with Theft and Loss. It's not really worth it unless you absolutely need the newest phone every year.

If you must buy from a carrier, here are some promotions to consider. Many of these “deals” come in the form of monthly bill credits, designed to keep you locked to a multiyear contract.

We all want a good, strong Wi-Fi signal throughout our homes, but figuring out how to achieve it without overspending can be tricky. Even once you've decided to replace the router from your internet service provider, do you get a new Wi-Fi router or invest in a mesh system? I covered this briefly in my router buying guide, but I'm going to dive a bit deeper here.

I've been testing all sorts of home networking gear for years now, so I'll break down your options, weigh up the pros and cons, and help you decide.

A router is a central hub and gateway where the internet comes into your home. It connects to devices on your home network and directs the traffic. You usually plug a modem into your router using an Ethernet cable (some routers double as modems). While you can connect other devices to a router using Ethernet cables (if it has spare ports), most gadgets link wirelessly using Wi-Fi.

Read our Best Wi-Fi Routers guide to see our top recommendations. These are usually enough for most homes. You might fancy a shiny new mesh, but if you have a home of modern construction, with a timber frame and drywall, and a modest square footage (2,500 square feet or less), a single router should be enough to keep you online.

The Wi-Fi signal will always be strongest near the router and will gradually drop off and slow down the further away you get. You should try to place your router centrally in your home and leave it out in the open to get the best performance from it. This could be tricky because you need to plug in your modem, and you need a power outlet, but an Ethernet cable is cheap, and you can always get an extension. Central placement is worth the hassle if you want solid coverage throughout your home.

It's also better to have the router up high, on top of a bookcase or mounted to the wall near the ceiling on your ground floor. The exact orientation of your router and its antennas (if they are adjustable) can be surprisingly impactful, so try different positions to find what works best with your most important devices around the home.

A mesh system consists of a main router that acts as a gateway or hub, just like a single router, with your modem plugged in via Ethernet. But mesh systems also have satellites or nodes that you can place around your home to extend Wi-Fi coverage. Mesh systems present as one single network and decide when to hand-off connections to devices as you move around the home.

Read our Best Mesh Wi-Fi Systems guide for our top recommendations. These models can ensure strong Wi-Fi throughout large, busy homes. If you have a home with thick walls or building materials that interfere with Wi-Fi, and a relatively large footprint (3,000 square feet or above), a mesh system is likely your best bet. Mesh systems can also be great for adding coverage to dead spots or extending Wi-Fi into your garden.

For best performance, mesh nodes should be connected to the main mesh router with Ethernet cables (wired backhaul), but that's not always possible, so they can also connect via Wi-Fi (wireless backhaul). The main mesh router and nodes should be placed out in the open; don't put them inside cabinets or behind TVs.

When placing your mesh nodes, think of your system as a Wi-Fi spine for your home. Rather than placing nodes in a dead spot, place them halfway between your main router and the area you want to cover. If they are too close together, you can end up with interference problems, but if they are too far apart, the connection between router and node will be slow or patchy. The manufacturer's app will likely guide you about good placement.

There's a lot to weigh before deciding whether to buy a mesh system or a single router, but it's important to note that mesh systems are not necessarily always better. If you can cover your home with a single router, that is the best option. Better coverage is the only reason to opt for a mesh. With a mesh, the system must make decisions about when to hand off connections and how to direct traffic, and this adds a layer of complexity.

Some mesh manufacturers are better than others when it comes to routing traffic and providing a stable connection. Netgear and Eero are especially good on this score. If you have smart home devices, such as a Sonos system, for example, some mesh systems don't handle them well and may drop speakers from the network or prevent you from seeing or controlling them via a phone connected to a different node. There are potential snags that you won't get with a single router.

Consider also that you always get much slower speeds from your nodes than from the main mesh router, unless they are connected via cables. Mesh routers connected wirelessly to nodes must use some of the available bandwidth for traffic between the main router and the node. This can effectively halve the bandwidth that's available for your connected devices.

After testing more than 60 mesh systems and routers in my last home, a modern two-story, 1,600-square-foot house, I found that single routers generally outperformed mesh systems, providing a faster and more stable connection, transferring files from one device to another on the network more quickly, and working efficiently without smart home connectivity issues. But many of those routers struggled to provide a fast connection in my backyard.

Mesh systems extend your coverage, and nodes can target dead spots. I used a node to extend Wi-Fi into my backyard and to plug in a TV in the back room via Ethernet for a more stable and reliable connection. But it wasn't until I moved to an old Victorian house that I felt the full benefit of a mesh system. It's slightly larger than my last home, but extremely thick stone walls can seriously dampen a Wi-Fi signal, especially on the fastest 6-GHz band.

While I haven't had the chance to test too many systems in this home yet, the couple I have tested make it crystal clear: I need a mesh for this house. A single router struggled to provide a signal for the front upstairs room and the garden, and I had to run an Ethernet cable to get the EV charger connected.

With a mesh, I can decide where I need the coverage, ensuring my big TV and office computer have a fast connection. Depending on where the internet comes into your home, it can be difficult to find a suitable spot for a single router. While there are exceptions to this, the single routers are often ugly devices, sometimes bristling with antennas, which are great for performance but aren't pretty. Mesh manufacturers have taken the lead on routers that blend into the home better.

Based on my testing, even the best Wi-Fi extenders aren't worth considering. Cheap Wi-Fi extenders perform very poorly, and the good ones are expensive enough that you'd be better off upgrading your main router or opting for a mesh, both of which will perform far better. A mesh system should give you near-seamless handoff and limit interference; a Wi-Fi extender won't do either.

Mesh systems are mostly designed to be easy to scale. You can add additional nodes as and when you need them. Eero allows you to mix and match any of its range. If you have an Asus AiMesh router (most of its range), you can add additional Asus AiMesh routers to create a mesh network, but expect to spend some time on configuration.

The problem with recommending single routers over mesh systems or vice versa is that every home is different. The size, construction, local interference, devices within the home, and other factors will impact how efficient any router is, and the only way you can be sure what will work best is to test. But if you're on the fence, I recommend opting for something that can be expanded into a mesh later if it turns out you need more coverage. You can also always buy a single mesh router or start with a two-pack and add more if required.

Age-verification laws are popping up around the world, and although websites like Pornhub originally caught the limelight, other online platforms are struggling to keep up with compliance.

It's not just porn, though saying “just” undermines how big a deal adult entertainment access really is. Bluesky shut down service in Mississippi, and Mastodon will likely follow. The video game platform Steam now requires age verification in the UK to view mature games, even with a decades-old account. Discord also requires verification in the UK with a photo, which you can stump by snapping a picture of a video game character.

Unsurprisingly, VPN usage has surged in response. A VPN, or virtual private network, masks your internet traffic and spoofs your location. You probably know about it as a way to bypass region-locked content on streaming platforms like Netflix. You can't access Bluesky if your internet traffic is coming from Mississippi, but with a VPN, your traffic could be coming from a different state or country.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) says VPNs aren't a solution. They aren't. Although VPNs provide a fix for circumventing age-verification laws, they aren't foolproof. I'm going to run down what VPNs can (and can't) do to mask your online identity, as well as the state of the laws on the books and how they interact with VPN providers.

It's hard to argue with age-verification laws on the surface. Pornhub itself has been very forward with its stance that age-verification laws are a good thing—if done correctly. Pornhub and online privacy advocates say it's the implementation of the law that's flawed, not the idea behind it.

The problem is how the verification happens. You aren't verifying your age with the government. You're routing it through an independent third party, and most of the laws on the books are designed specifically in this way. In the UK, for example, Reddit verifies with Persona, and Bluesky uses Kids Web Services (owned by Epic Games).

Persona's privacy policy states that it collects not only biometric information and personal details, like your ID, but also ties that to information gathered from third-party sources. It also retains that information and is free to share it with others.

“Age verification laws threaten individual privacy by requiring individuals to submit highly sensitive personal data, such as government-issued IDs or biometric scans, to access material online,” Rindala Alajaji, a legislative activist at EFF, tells WIRED. “This opens the door for potential breaches and misuse.”

It's data brokerage at the behest of the legislature, and organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) say the laws limit free speech protections. Service providers also argue that the laws don't protect minors. Pornhub, for example, says it saw an 80 percent drop in traffic from Louisiana in 2023 when the state passed an age verification law. It argues that these regulations only serve to push users to platforms that don't comply with regulations.

“These laws don't actually 'protect minors' or stop people from accessing adult content; they push users to unregulated, unsafe corners of the internet where privacy and safety protections are minimal, making the internet more dangerous for everyone,” Alajaji says.

Some services, such as Pornhub, have blocked access in these states in a seeming act of protest. Others, such as Mastodon, say they're forced to shut down as it can't provide verification information it doesn't have. The result is the same: a fragmented internet where the services you can access are based on your physical location, and the only solution is to sacrifice your privacy.

At a basic level, VPNs work by sending your traffic to a server within the provider's network before going out to the open internet. By routing your traffic this way, it'll appear as if you're connecting from the server's location. Unlike a proxy server, which does the same location spoofing, your connection is negotiated and encrypted with a VPN protocol. Combined with proper privacy measures on the VPN side, that should mean you and your online browsing are completely anonymous.

No system is perfect, though, and VPNs aren't an exception. When you connect to a VPN, your traffic looks as if it's coming from the VPN server, which itself poses a hurdle. If enough questionable traffic comes from a particular server, it'll be blocked. Streaming platforms like Netflix might notice that an odd amount of traffic comes from one particular server in a certain location, and it may block that server from connecting. You can easily find massive lists of known VPN servers online. Some VPNs, like Proton VPN, are good at keeping up with this game of whack-a-mole. Others, like Private Internet Access, aren't.

VPNs can hide where your internet activity is coming from, but it doesn't totally hide who is engaging in that activity. VPNs are only concerned with your internet connection. They don't touch other potentially personally identifiable information. Cookies, ad IDs, GPS, and other browser-based information can create a so-called “browser fingerprint.” This fingerprint isn't as identifiable as your IP address, but a motivated traffic sniffer could build a fairly robust profile even while you're connected to a VPN.

In the context of age verification laws, however, VPNs are effective. Prominent services like Bluesky and Pornhub have, publicly and reluctantly, withdrawn access in locations with these laws, so it's hard to imagine that they'll block access from known VPN servers. However, some organizations, such as the Age Verification Providers Association (AVPA), have pushed for more robust enforcement mechanisms beyond IP geolocation. If services are forced to comply with more restrictive tracking, the effectiveness of a VPN goes down.

“The approach outlined is that, for example, a social media platform would analyze the content or behaviour of its own users reaching it via a VPN to flag any that were likely to be underage in a jurisdiction that requires age checks,” Iain Corby, executive director at the AVPA, told me via email. “States must consider the impact of giving VPN users a pass, which is that they are effectively giving up on any attempt to apply the rule of law online.”

The EFF says it wants to see a different approach, one that's less focused on restricting access to VPNs and more focused on protecting individual privacy. “VPNs shouldn't be necessary to access legally protected content in the first place,"" Alajaji says. ""Their growing use underscores a larger issue: Age-verification laws often erode privacy and digital freedom without effectively achieving their intended goals.”

Using a VPN to spoof your location and access the internet isn't illegal in most parts of the world, and any change in legislation on that front would bring forth serious questions about online censorship. Countries like Russia and North Korea infamously have VPN bans in place. Any similar policy from Western states like the US and UK would certainly be met with fierce opposition.

Age-verification laws are targeted toward providers, not users, and they're civil liabilities, not crimes. If a company or website operating in a particular state doesn't comply with the law, that state can sue the provider—most laws in the US put liability at $10,000 per day of noncompliance.

Using a VPN isn't illegal. However, performing illegal acts while connected to a VPN is still illegal. If you're a minor using a VPN to purchase nicotine products or alcohol online, for example, that's still illegal. Circumventing age verification with a VPN isn't so that minors can access services they aren't supposed to; it's to protect the privacy of users who don't want to send sensitive information to third-party verification platforms.

There are some great VPNs out there, but there are a few I'd lean toward if you're concerned with your online privacy first and foremost. These services all have decent pricing, solid speeds, and stable apps, but privacy takes center stage.



Proton VPN (two-year)

Proton VPN (one-year)

Proton VPN is the best VPN for most people. It's fast, easy to use, and comes with a ton of server locations. I'm recommending it here because Proton has an unconventional approach to the online privacy debacle. The company is a Swiss corporation, but its primary shareholder is The Proton Foundation—a non-profit set up and led by Proton's founder Andy Yen.

That already sets Proton apart from most VPNs, and it's backed up by open source apps. For the privacy-conscious, I gravitate toward Proton due to its Secure Core servers. Proton's network comprises over 15,000 servers, but 112 of those (at the time of writing) are owned and operated entirely by Proton. Those are the Secure Core servers.

Basically, Proton owns a small internet network across Sweden, Switzerland, and Iceland, which Proton says it chose due to their robust privacy legislation. From there, you can connect to another location (i.e., a connection to the US via Sweden). You'll take a drop in speed, and other services offer these kinds of multi-hop connections, but Proton is the only provider I'm aware of that fully owns its multi-hop network.

Proton is the VPN to beat right now, full stop, which is shocking because it's not that expensive. You can get started for free, but with reduced speeds, and the paid plan clocks in at just $10 a month, even less if you subscribe for a year or more. You really get the best bang for your buck with Proton Unlimited, which is $13 per month (less for a year or more), and it includes all of Proton's apps, including the excellent Proton Mail and Proton Pass.



Like any VPN worth its salt, Mullvad says it doesn't keep logs about what you do online. Unlike other VPNs, though, you don't have to take Mullvad's word for it. You don't even need to do as much as enter a credit card or provide an email to sign up.

Instead, generate an account number on Mullvad's website and plug that number into the app to log in. When you want to add time to your account, you pay Mullvad €5 per month regardless of how much time you buy. That's €5 per month flat; Mullvad doesn't do regional pricing or long-term discounts. You can pay with a credit card if you want (or a string of various online payment providers), but you're also free to send Mullvad cash directly.

That's Mullvad's big claim to fame, but it includes a ton of other security features that most other VPN services lack. For starters, all of its apps are open source and externally audited. It also provides multi-hop connections—basically connecting to two VPN servers consecutively—and WireGuard key rotation. Key rotation is a big security feature: It ensures perfect forward secrecy, as a single compromised session won't compromise past or future sessions.

When it comes to fingerprinting, Mullvad takes the cake because of DAITA, or Defence Against AI-Guided Traffic Analysis. Although things like GPS play a role in fingerprinting, so do encrypted traffic patterns. To get around this kind of traffic analysis, DAITA uses consistent packet sizes and interjects dummy packets into the stream. It's basically background noise, making it even more difficult to figure out who you are and what websites you're visiting.

Windscribe (Free)

Windscribe (One-Year)

Windscribe is one of the few VPN providers that has a demonstrable no-logging policy. Every VPN says your history isn't logged, but precious few actually back up that claim. Windscribe founder and CEO, Yegor Sak, was personally charged in a Greek court due to activity on the Windscribe network. The case was dismissed, but even in the face of criminal prosecution, Windscribe couldn't turn over data it didn't have.

I'm recommending it here due to Windscribe's excellent browser extension. There are a lot of ways to track you outside a VPN tunnel, and Windscribe's extension is set up to tackle those exact issues. It can delete cookies when you close a tab, and it can spoof time and GPS signals to make you more difficult to track. Critically, it also rotates your browser user agent automatically, essentially making browser fingerprinting a non-issue.

Like Proton, Windscribe offers a restrictive free version with 10 GB of data per month. Unlike most VPN providers, however, you can build a plan from that piecemeal. Unlimited data will run you $3 per month, and each additional location is an extra $1. Or, you can unlock everything for $9 per month or $69 per year, which is lower than the going rate of most VPN services.

Windscribe has a lot of personality as a brand, but don't let that fool you. It's just as serious about online privacy and security as a service like Mullvad, and it comes with an extensive roster of features that even top-rated VPN services struggle to keep up with.

Although VPNs are effective at circumventing age-verification systems (at least right now), it's important to zoom out. Alajaji and Paige Collings, a senior speech and privacy activist at the EFF, put it best: “While VPNs may be able to disguise the source of your internet activity, they are not foolproof—nor should they be necessary to access legally protected speech.”

VPNs put a bandage on the age-verification problem, but they have benefits outside of this particular issue. Even without being foolproof, VPNs are a huge boon to privacy online, especially when combined with browser-based blocking mechanisms. And spoofing your location can still let you stream movies and TV shows in other countries, as well as access domestic services when traveling abroad.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","Apple's ‘Awe Dropping' Event: 5 Themes Beyond the Products","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/apples-awe-dropping-event-5-themes-beyond-the-products-179911.html","Fri, 12 Sep 2025 12:02:15 GMT","

Walking onto Apple's campus for a live event is a little like stepping into a hyper-polished alternate reality. Given that I've attended numerous events at Apple's famous “Spaceship” headquarters in Cupertino, I should know better.

The buildings gleam, the landscaping looks like it's been curated by a Hollywood set designer, and most surreal of all, waves of young Apple staffers greet you. “Have a wonderful day!” one says. “We're excited to have you join us today!” another chimes in.

The first few greetings feel charming, like you've joined a tech utopia. By the 50th, though, you half expect Yul Brynner to appear in a cowboy hat. The experience drifts into Michael Crichton's “Westworld” territory: polished, precise, and just a little unsettling.

Apple's “Awe Dropping” event itself had a similar tone. Polished. Precise. Predictable at times, yet with flashes of genuine substance. The iPhone Air, the thinnest iPhone ever, grabbed most of the headlines. But to focus only on the new devices is to miss the deeper story. Apple was sending signals about strategy, supply chains, design, AI, and health, which are just as important as the specs on a product slide.

Here's my take on the five themes that stood out beyond the announcements themselves.

For years, Apple has depended on Qualcomm's 5G modems, even after public legal battles and quiet grudging agreements. At the Awe Dropping event, the new iPhones showcased an Apple-designed modem, hinting at a future where Cupertino may sever ties with Qualcomm altogether.

Here's the nuance that often goes unnoticed by consumers: Apple knows that its in-house modem may not yet match Qualcomm's best chips in raw performance. Benchmarks in the coming weeks will reveal whether it lags in fringe reception areas or high-speed throughput.

However, Apple has always prized control over outright spec sheets. It believes that owning this crucial piece of the iPhone stack outweighs minor performance trade-offs. Integration across silicon, software, and services is Apple's core playbook.

In other words, Apple doesn't just want a modem. It wants its modem. Analysts note that this provides Apple with greater flexibility to align networking features with future product strategies, potentially including enhanced battery life, custom AI offloading, or even next-generation connectivity standards.

It's a bold move — and even if Apple stumbles in round one, the strategic trajectory is clear: independence from Qualcomm is no longer just a rumor — it's happening.

The star of the show, of course, was the iPhone Air. At an astonishing 5.6 millimeters thin and clad in polished and highly durable titanium, it instantly commanded attention. Apple has always understood the power of design to spur upgrades, and the Air shows the company hasn't lost its touch.

Some analysts called it the most significant aesthetic shift since the Pro line launched in 2019. The Air's ultra-thin design isn't just about bragging rights. It's a signal of where Apple is going: thinner, lighter, more refined, and possibly even foldable down the road. Industry voices noted that you usually have to go thin before you can go foldable. Apple may not be ready to unveil a foldable iPhone yet, but it is clearly laying the groundwork.

What makes the Air notable is that it isn't compromised. The A19 Pro chip inside offers near-MacBook levels of computing power. The camera system remains powerful. Battery life holds up. Critics can point out that titanium, while strong, is brittle. Still, for most users, the Air demonstrates that Apple can slim down without stripping out capability.

That matters.

Apple's innovation chips aren't just silicon: they're industrial design bets. The Air is a reminder that Apple's brand still rests on devices that feel different in your hand. For consumers tired of incremental updates, that differentiation could be the nudge they need to upgrade.

In today's geopolitical climate, tariffs and supply chain constraints loom over every tech launch. Many expected Apple to push prices upward, citing inflation and component costs quietly. But for the most part, it didn't. The Air came in at $999, with other models holding steady in familiar brackets.

That restraint is revealing.

Apple appears confident it can offset potential cost pressures by reworking its supply chain. The company has spent years diversifying beyond China, shifting production into India and Vietnam. By broadening its base, Apple gives itself wiggle room to absorb tariff hits without startling customers at checkout.

Most of my industry analyst peers see this as a show of confidence. Apple isn't just weathering global trade politics — it's mastering them. Holding the line on pricing tells customers, “We've got this under control.” It also suggests Apple is betting on volume this holiday season. Instead of grabbing extra dollars per device, it wants to move more devices overall.

That strategy builds loyalty.

Consumers already expect Apple products to cost more than competitors. What they don't expect — or tolerate — are unpredictable price jumps. By keeping pricing consistent, Apple sends a message of stability in an unstable world.

Artificial intelligence is this year's tech buzzword, and Apple gave it plenty of oxygen in June at WWDC. At this month's event, AI took a back seat, but it wasn't entirely absent. The most notable new feature was Center Stage, which keeps you perfectly framed on video calls.

On paper, that might sound small compared to generative models and multimodal assistants. In practice, it's classic Apple. Rather than hyping AI with abstract promises, Apple shows it solving a simple, relatable problem. You move around during a call, and the camera keeps you centered — no fiddling, no tech jargon, just a smoother experience.

This approach reflects Apple's strength: demystifying technology. Consumers don't want to read white papers on AI architectures. They want features that make life easier.

Center Stage is an easy win, and it opens the door to more visible, consumer-friendly AI integrations in the future.

It also serves a strategic role. By making AI practical and approachable, Apple positions itself differently from competitors who flood the market with technical demos. Apple's pitch is: This is AI you'll actually use. That framing could prove decisive in persuading skeptical users.

Health and wellness once felt like a side story in Apple's product line. Now it's central. The new Apple Watch Series 11 introduces features such as hypertension notifications and sleep scoring. The updated AirPods Pro add heart-rate monitoring. Put together, these devices form a tighter health ecosystem than ever before.

Analysts emphasized how significant this is. By spreading health features across watches, earbuds, and phones, Apple increases the stickiness of its ecosystem. Once you rely on Apple devices to monitor your vitals, switching to another brand becomes much more difficult.

It also broadens Apple's appeal.

Not everyone wants to wear a smartwatch, but almost everyone uses earbuds. By putting health sensing into AirPods, Apple captures a new segment of users who might otherwise be left out. Over time, these moves set the stage for a comprehensive health tracking system — one that spans multiple devices and multiple use cases.

For Apple, health isn't just about selling gadgets. It's about embedding itself in daily life, literally close to your body. That's a moat few competitors can match.

Without question, the Awe Dropping event wasn't a revolution. Analysts were quick to note that it felt evolutionary, not revolutionary. The iPhone Air is thinner and sleeker, but it's not a foldable leap that will almost certainly come in 2026.

The modem is more Apple, but still unproven. The AI features are practical, but not jaw-dropping. Health capabilities expanded, but incrementally. Prices held steady, but without dramatic surprises.

Yet, taken together, these themes paint a picture of Apple playing the long game. It's about control of the stack, from the modem to health sensors. It's about design leadership, not just processor speeds. It's about stabilizing prices in turbulent times. It's about introducing AI that feels approachable, not intimidating.

No, this event didn't score a 10 on the technology innovation Richter scale. But it didn't need to. What it did deliver was enough to excite existing Apple users, reassure the faithful, and pique the interest of potential switchers. Crucially, it set up Apple with strong momentum heading into the holiday season, which is the biggest quarter on its calendar.

In that sense, the aforementioned surreal greetings at the start of the day captured the mood perfectly. Apple knows how to make the experience feel just a little larger than life. Whether through smiling staffers or ultra-thin phones, it's all part of the same playbook: create an environment where customers feel embraced, impressed, and a modicum of awe-struck.

Nine months after the launch of its first satellite, Bellevue, Wash.-based Xplore is sharing a hyperspectral view of North Korean territory as seen from orbit.

The image, captured in visible and near-infrared wavelengths by Xplore's XCUBE-1 satellite, was unveiled today at the Seattle Space Superiority Summit at the Museum of Flight. Xplore's co-founder and chief operating officer, Lisa Rich, said the picture shows “semi-submerged farms that are likely rice paddies,” plus fish farms and salt flats. 

“This is a big reveal for us today,” Rich said.

XCUBE-1 was sent into low Earth orbit last December as part of SpaceX's Bandwagon-2 satellite rideshare mission. Xplore began sharing imagery from the satellite in June. 

XCUBE-1's images have a resolution of 5 meters (16 feet) per pixel, and are typically shown in false colors to accentuate differences in terrain. For example, shades of red are used to indicate vegetation. “We're seeing more than we expected to see,” Rich said.

Over the course of repeated flyovers, such images can track the construction of new facilities or other changes in surface features. That can provide valuable insights for intelligence agencies.

Xplore is one of six companies providing hyperspectral satellite data to the National Reconnaissance Office under the terms of five-year contracts awarded in 2023.

The contracts are part of NRO's multi-stage effort to learn more about the utility of hyperspectral imagery. The first stage focuses on analytical studies to provide estimates of system capabilities at both the individual sensor and constellation levels, as well as business and cybersecurity planning. The second stage focuses on assessing on-orbit capabilities and procuring data products.

Providing data for national security purposes is just one of the applications that Xplore is targeting for its “Space as a Service” business model. The company, which was founded in 2017, is also developing satellites and orbital platforms for commercial remote sensing.

Mark Russinovich, the Microsoft Azure CTO, posted a tweet in September 2022 that surprised the software world — declaring that, for certain new projects, it was time to avoid C or C++, the languages historically used to build Windows, Office, and other core Microsoft software.

For the sake of security and reliability, he advised using the Rust programming language — a modern open-source alternative with a quirky orange crab mascot — in situations where software can't rely on what's known as a garbage collector, the system that automatically clears unused data from memory.

It surprised Satya Nadella, too. A few hours later, an email landed in Russinovich's inbox from the Microsoft CEO, asking if he was serious. 

Yes, he replied, he was.

Russinovich recounted this story in his recent keynote address at RustConf 2025 in Seattle. The Microsoft cloud leader explained that for two decades, roughly 70% of Microsoft's security vulnerabilities have been due to memory safety issues — the very class of bugs to which C and C++ are susceptible, and which Rust was designed from the ground up to prevent. 

“No matter how much we really want to make C and C++ better,” Russinovich told the crowd of software developers, “we can't make it as good as what Rust starts with.”

Microsoft has doubled down on Rust in the years since that exchange, using the programming language across many of its products. If you're running a recent version of Windows, you can find a file in your System32 directory called win32kbase_rs.sys. The “rs” stands for Rust. 

It's part of a groundswell of support across the software industry for memory-safe languages, from the National Security Agency to the Linux operating system kernel. 

Rust, first developed at Mozilla Research in the mid-2000s, has become a core strategic component for some of the world's largest tech companies, including Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Arm. 

This year's event, Sept. 2-5, marked the 10th anniversary of Rust's first stable release, a milestone that underscores both progress and growing pains as Rust evolves from cult favorite to critical infrastructure. Sessions focused on both success stories and practical realities.

Adopting a new technology in a large organization is “wildly expensive,” cautioned Amazon engineer Russell Cohen in one session. “You're not just adopting a language, you're adopting an entire stack of technologies that teams have to be familiar with in order to be effective.”

Cohen said teams at Amazon without a Rust expert to help shepherd the project are 40% more likely to give up on Rust. He shared a cautionary tale of one Amazon team that built a working service in Rust, only to see it get rewritten from scratch in Java after a reorganization because the new team that came in couldn't justify the payoff to learn an entirely new language. 

Based on Cohen's observations of Rust adoption inside Amazon, he said it takes engineers about three months to get their bearings, with a difficult period in the middle where it gets especially hard.

“There is some deep-soul searching with the borrow checker, some dark places,” Cohen said, referring to the strict rules that Rust enforces to manage memory safely. “And this is where people either push through and learn to think in Rust, or they give up.”

For this reason, Cohen advises teams to adopt Rust only when it delivers an order-of-magnitude improvement over existing technology.  A case in point was Amazon's Fire TV team, which used Rust to cut memory usage on its devices by 10x — a big win that justified the cost.

Aaron DeVore, a software developer at Portland State University who has been attending RustConf since its early days, said part of the language's appeal is rooted in its helpfulness. After getting a computer science degree and working through the “classic bugs” in other languages, he was accustomed to the frustration of cryptic error messages.

With a language like C++, he explained, “you type one thing wrong, and you get this page full of errors” that offers little explanation of what the problem actually is. 

Rust, by contrast, is designed to guide the developer. In the Rust community, a confusing error message is considered a bug in the compiler itself. “Rust is like, oh, yeah, you probably want to change this,” DeVore said. “And here's exactly where the error came from.”

That supportive ecosystem is now getting a more formal structure. In her opening remarks, Rebecca Rumbul, the executive director and CEO of the Rust Foundation, announced two major steps reflecting the language's growing maturity. 

With this growing corporate involvement, Rust's long-term success may depend on its ability to manage the tension between its new backers and its passionate, open-source community. 

Scott McMurray, a project director on the Rust Foundation board, said the structure provides a firewall designed to give the community “its own unique voice, distinct from the companies.” 

He contrasted the needs of large corporations with those of individual enthusiasts, like one developer who's passionate about using Rust on a handheld gaming device.

 “Let me tell you, none of the big corporations care about using Rust on a Nintendo 3DS,” McMurray said — but the community structure aims to balance both worlds.

That community spirit was the focus of a keynote by Nell Shamrell-Harrington of Microsoft, the lead editor of the This Week in Rust newsletter and a Rust Foundation board member. She shared a story from 2020, when she and much of the Rust team at Mozilla were laid off, a moment that could have fractured the project. Instead, the community rallied.

“I was stunned at the outpouring of support from our community,” she recalled, describing messages from people she didn't know offering help. “I cannot think of any other instance in my professional career where I felt so seen and I felt so supported.”

Now that Rust has achieved widespread adoption, the community faces the new challenge of deciding where to go next, explained Nicholas Matsakis, a senior principal engineer at Amazon Web Services who is also co-lead of the Rust language design team.

For years, he said, the focus was on solving developers' problems and expanding Rust's adoption because the project's survival depended on it. Now, with that goal largely achieved, success itself has made the path forward less obvious and requires deeper thinking

“What is Rust's mission in the world? I mean, are we just here to make every single program be written in Rust? Like, OK, maybe,” Matsakis said, laughing during the closing keynote. 

Then he added, on a more serious note, “But hopefully not. We want to find where Rust really adds value, and double down on that.”

                                What happens here matters everywhere.

In recent years there's been a mini tech boom over in Bellevue, Wash., the city just east of Seattle that has attracted companies and talent — including a massive Amazon expansion that will bring 25,000 employees to the Eastside. 

Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell made it clear that his city still holds the edge when it comes to innovation and culture.

Speaking at the AI House on Seattle's waterfront, where he unveiled the city's new artificial intelligence policy and plan, Harrell was asked how Seattle can compete for companies considering offices in the region — including in nearby Bellevue and Redmond, home of Microsoft.

Harrell touted Seattle's diversity, arts, music, restaurants, and innovative history — while throwing a friendly jab at his rival across Lake Washington.

“They don't have an AI House in Bellevue,” Harrell said, citing the recently opened startup hub that is financially supported by the city. “We thought of it here.”

Answering a question from Bloomberg reporter Anna Edgerton, Harrell said Seattle has its “own unique history that we play to for employees.”

“We are leaders, innovators … the Seattle World's Fair was not in Bellevue, it was here in 1962, which put us on the map,” he said.

His remarks underscored the growing sense of competition between the two cities. 

A number of out-of-town tech companies have opened and grown offices in Bellevue over the past year alone, including Zoom, OpenAI, Shopify, Anduril, and Snowflake. It's also home to headquarters for T-Mobile, Valve, and Smartsheet, plus offices for Meta, ByteDance, and Pokémon.

Amazon has quickly grown its footprint in downtown Bellevue after sparring with Seattle lawmakers in recent years over corporate tax initiatives. Bellevue is the focus of much of the company's future growth in what it now calls its Puget Sound headquarters region.

Speaking to GeekWire last year, Bellevue Mayor Lynne Robinson said the city didn't have an interest in policies like Seattle's payroll tax. 

Harrell didn't mention tax policy in his remarks on Thursday. The mayor has supported a proposal to increase Seattle's business & occupation tax, which is already higher than Bellevue's rate.

Seattle voters also recently approved a new tax on big businesses such as Amazon that will fund a social housing developer.

Both cities have taken a hit to their commercial real estate markets since the pandemic. The vacancy rate in downtown Bellevue is 17.1%, up from 3.3% in 2019, according to a Q2 report from Broderick Group. 

Seattle's downtown vacancy rate topped 30% in the second quarter, according to Kidder Mathews.

The two cities will become more connected, literally, via public transit — with a new light rail line expected to open early next year. Another new line recently opened that links Bellevue to Redmond.

Harrell's comments came as he unveiled the Seattle's new AI policy and plan, part of a broader push to establish the city as a national leader in artificial intelligence.

“We are trying to be very intentional about positioning Seattle as a national leader in responsible artificial intelligence implementation,” Harrell said. “Make no mistake about that.”

Geek Life: Fun stories, memes, humor and other random items at the intersection of tech, science, business and culture.  SEE MORE

Out of Office is a new GeekWire series spotlighting members of the Seattle tech community about a passion or hobby they pursue outside of work.

Name: Mark Michael.

Day job: Co-founder and CEO of DevHub, a Seattle startup whose platform is used by big brands and/or their agencies to build websites and landing pages.

Out-of-office passion: Michael isn't a big sports guy who fills time by watching football all weekend. He's into fine arts and more. And right before the pandemic he started taking piano lessons.

After a while, his teacher insisted it was time for a recital because it was the best way to get better. So about three years ago he had his first recital in her back yard. The event featured 43-year-old Michael and a bunch of little kids.

“And when I played that concert and my two songs on piano, I'm telling you, I thought I was Elton John or Liberace,” Michael said. “It was 11 a.m. on a Saturday, I'm wearing a black tuxedo. My head was so big.”

He took singing lessons with the same teacher and recently hosted a performance for about 80 people in Seattle. 

“Horrible, horrible, horrible,” he said of his singing. “Except the audience kind of liked it, because they couldn't tell if it was real. Something was weird there.”

On Sept. 26 he's going to do it again, on the other side of the country in Kennebunkport, Maine, a vacation destination he grew to love with his wife. He calls the upcoming concert — to which he has seriously invited former President George W. Bush — a mix of Dean Martin and '80s synth sounds.

A post shared by Mark Michael (@gliderceo)

Most rewarding aspect of this pursuit: Michael admits to feeling full of anxiety and being “insanely uncomfortable” during a performance, but pushing through feels like finishing a race or something else you've been working hard on.

“It's a release of all the tension,” he said. “And once it's done, that high, whatever you want to call it, it's like, ‘Oh, wow.'”

The lessons he brings back to work: Michael said playing the piano creates a level of focus that serves him well at DevHub. 

Getting ahead of himself can be an issue in his music. When he's playing good, Michael gets overconfident and imagines that he'll soon be selling out Madison Square Garden. Work brings everything back to reality, and helps him focus on “the thing.”

His music also fills a void on the weekends after a week full of tasks, projects and momentum at work.

“What am I going to do, work by myself through the weekend? Am I going to stalk people on LinkedIn?” he laughed. “At least [music] has some element of a different kind of brain to get me over until Monday. So I can start Monday like, ‘Yeah, all right, did that thing, now it's back to this thing.'”

Mastodon, an open source, decentralized alternative to X, is rolling out a somewhat controversial feature by adding quote posts, which will launch next week. The feature, which allows a user to quote someone else's post and reshare it with their own response or commentary, has contributed to a culture of “dunking” on X, where users often deride other people by responding with snark or insulting humor.

To address this concern, Mastodon says it's implementing quote posts with safety controls.

These protections are designed to allow quote posts to be used responsibly, to “expand discussions, make new connections, and amplify underrepresented voices,” the platform states.

Mastodon gives users several ways to control how their posts can be quoted. For starters, the platform lets users decide who can quote them through a setting where you can change your defaults. Here, you can set the permissions for who can quote you by choosing between “Anyone,” “Followers only,” or “Just me.” Additionally, you can control the visibility of quote posts by setting them to be visible to the public, to followers only, or a setting called “quiet public,” which makes the quotes public but removes them from Mastodon's search, trends, and public timeline.

Users will also be able to override their default settings on a post-by-post basis, if need be, by navigating to the “Visibility and interaction settings” within the composer screen. This would be useful if you know you're about to say something controversial or anything that could attract unwanted attention from those with opposing views, for instance.

Plus, users will have control of their posts even after they're quoted, the Mastodon blog post about the new feature explains. 

When someone quotes a post, the user being quoted is notified in the app, and they can choose to remove their original post from the other person's quote post. This is accessible through the Options menu (the three dots icon). From this location, users can change the quote settings to address any future quoting of their post going forward. They can also block users to prevent them from seeing and quoting their posts in the future.

Support for quote posts will first arrive over the week ahead to the larger Mastodon servers at mastodon.online and mastodon.social. It will then become available in Mastodon's 4.5 software update.

To quote a post, you'll find the new option under Mastodon's Boost (similar to X's repost/retweet feature). Because the fediverse, or open social web, is a network of servers running different software, quote posts may not immediately appear everywhere, and some platforms may not update to use the technical specification enabling quote post support right away.

Apple is set to release its upcoming iPhone 17 series on September 19 in most countries across the world. However, the eSIM-only iPhone Air's release is being delayed in China, likely due to regulatory issues around the approval of the embedded SIM. 

Apple's website notes that all three Chinese state-owned network providers — China Mobile, China Telecom, and China Unicom — will offer eSIM support for the iPhone Air but says the timing of the release will be subject to regulatory approval. Preorders for the other new phones in the lineup start on Friday.

According to South China Morning Post, Apple told local media that it was working with regulatory authorities to bring the iPhone Air to China “as soon as possible.” The report referred to a post by China Mobile on social network Weibo that said the network has enabled eSIM services for mobile phones, though a launch date was not mentioned.

China Telecom posted on RedNote about launching its own eSIM service on September 19, when the iPhone 17 line is supposed to be released. However, the post has since been removed, SCMP noted.

Apple did not immediately return a request for comment.

Thanks to a pledge to unbundle its corporate messaging app Teams from its productivity suites, Microsoft has managed to slip unscathed through a major antitrust investigation by the European Commission that could have resulted in massive fines for the tech giant.

The Commission on Friday okayed Microsoft's concessions to address the EU's competition concerns over the company including Teams along with the rest of its Office productivity suite for free, concluding a multi-year investigation that was sparked by complaints from rival office messaging app Slack in 2020.

Microsoft has promised that for the next seven years, it will provide Microsoft 365 and Office 365 without Teams at a lower price and will let customers choose whether they want to pay more to add the collaboration app to the suites.

The Commission has also managed to get Microsoft to agree to open up its APIs to enable interoperability for key features between its suite and third-party messaging and collaboration tools, as well as let them export their data out of teams for the next five years.

In its investigation, the European authority accused Microsoft of breaching competition rules by bundling teams with its productivity suites, abusing its dominant position and granting Teams an undue advantage. In its preliminary findings, the Commission also said that advantage was improved because Teams was integrated with other Microsoft 365 apps like Excel, Outlook, SharePoint, and Word.

Microsoft attempted to allay those concerns by implementing a partial unbundling of Teams in April 2024, but the Commission felt more extensive changes were needed, following which the company offered a revised plan in May 2025.

This approval is a win-win for both the EU and Microsoft, especially because there was no legal battle. The Commission can say it's wrung a big compromise from Big Tech. Now Microsoft is voluntarily offering some versions of both its productivity suites without Teams at a 50% lower price compared to versions that bundle the app, worldwide.

And Microsoft dodged punitive measures and a big fine, as the Commission's penalties for breaching competition rules can reach up to 10% of annual global revenue — which, considering the tech giant last year recorded $245 billion in revenue, would have been truckloads of money.

“We appreciate the dialogue with the Commission that led to this agreement, and we turn now to implementing these new obligations promptly and fully,” Nanna-Louise Linde, vice president of European Government Affairs at Microsoft, said in an emailed statement.

The Commission also noted that Slack and Alfaview, another company that had complained about Teams, have withdrawn their complaints following a market test by the Commission earlier this year.

“With today's decision, we make binding for seven years or more Microsoft's commitments to put an end to its tying practices that may be preventing rivals from effectively competing with Teams,” Teresa Ribera, executive vice-president for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition at the European Commission, said in a statement. 

“Today's decision therefore opens up competition in this crucial market, and ensures that businesses can freely choose the communication and collaboration product that best suits their needs,” said Ribera.

Note: This story was updated to add a comment by Microsoft.

When Seth Winterroth left his job at GE Ventures to help launch Eclipse Ventures in 2015, robotics was on his mind. Or more specifically, the number of early-stage robotics startups that were struggling to launch due to lack of interest.

“These are teams that had just finished their postdocs at Waterloo, or CMU, or MIT, and were starting robotics companies, and the refrain that I continually heard from the startups was, ‘hey, we're having a really hard time raising institutional venture capital,'” Winterroth told TechCrunch. “At the time in Silicon Valley, most venture capital was going into the very mature application layer or the application layer of some very mature computing platforms.”

A lot has changed since then.

Now, after investing in robotics startups for 10 years, Winterroth, a partner at Eclipse, said the time to invest in robotics has never been better. The robotics startup market has matured and the hardware and software powering these bots has gotten significantly better — and cheaper.

Venture investing in the category is gaining momentum as well. Investors poured $6 billion into robotics startups in the first seven months of 2025 according to Crunchbase data. The data company predicts that this year's funding totals will eclipse 2024, making it one of the only non-AI categories to experience a boost in funding.

While one could argue that robotics is seeing a surge in investor interest because of AI — and it's not wrong to acknowledge AI's role in the advancement of robotic tech — investors who have focused on the category longer than the last few years said the industry didn't get to this point just because of advancements in AI over the past few years.

The real catalyst for the industry to start gaining momentum actually happened back in 2013, Winterroth said, when Kiva Systems, a small startup based out of Massachusetts, got acquired by Amazon.

“I like to say Kiva Systems' acquisition was the acquisition that launched 1,000 robotic startups,” Winterroth said. “Between 2011 and 2015, 2016, that really was the case. You just saw a number of different new companies get started. Some like 6 River Systems, or Clearpath Robotics, were successful, but most were not. But that talent learns and that learning compounds, and it's brought into the next set of ventures.”

This first wave helped attract engineers to the sector and helped companies figure out product-market-fit, he said.

Kira Noodleman, a partner at Bee Partners, echoed this. Noodleman told TechCrunch the last decade of trial and error helped startups figure out what the market is actually looking for when it comes to robotics and automation.

Some companies, like Rapid Robotics which Noodleman backed, shut down trying to figure out what the market wanted. Those failures have helped the next batch of startup founders, who now have a much better idea of what potential customers want from this sector.

Noodleman had a similar experience with her own investing thesis, she said, which changed as the market matured.

“Lights out manufacturing assumes there are zero humans in the loop, that is just not happening, we proved that already back in the 2010s,” Noodleman said. “Let me take a simple task, machine tending, all it is is someone's hand putting something in and out of a machine. The point here is you can imagine how many low-hanging fruit, repetitive tasks there are, like machine tending.”

Fady Saad, a general partner at early-stage robotics-focused Cybernetix Ventures, also launched his firm prior to the AI boom after he noticed he was spending a lot of time connecting early-stage robotics companies to sources of funding during his time as a co-founder at MassRobotics.

Falling hardware costs have also driven investor interest in the sector, Saad said, noting that it's cheaper to build robots today than five years ago. This allows companies to have a more viable path to scale and makes them more attractive to potential venture backers.

“The cost of building robotics has been going dramatically down,” Saad said. “Advances in sensor technology, compute, and batteries, all of that, it was the perfect timing to start full-stack robotics solutions.”

Advancements in AI aren't hurting the industry either. While AI is being touted by many as the main reason why robotics are starting to see an increase in interest — alongside an Elon Musk-driven fascination with humanoid robots — it isn't the only factor.

Saad added that while AI and large language models can be helpful for training robots, these LLMs are primarily trained on online information whereas robots interact with the real world.

There are companies building models based on that real-life data; Nvidia just released a new set of world models for robot training in August. But Saad predicted it will take a bit longer to capture and train robots, especially those that will exist alongside people, on world data.

Momentum in the industry may be starting to swell, but that doesn't mean every startup has figured out the best approach yet. Nor are some categories within robotics as mature as others.

Some of the first few markets to adopt robotics and automation, including manufacturing, warehousing, and construction, continue to be attractive for robotics startup backers.

For Winterroth, Saad, and Noodleman, healthcare and surgical-related robots remain a compelling area to invest in too. Noodleman adds eldercare to that category as well.

“In-home assistance is interesting, coming from me having looked at industrial robotics for 10 years,” Noodleman said. “Manufacturing and mining, burning labor shortages, aging populations, no humans are available at any price, even imperfect robotics are better than nothing.”

Saad added that vertically-focused robotics companies tend to have access to more real-world and physical data too than horizontal players.

One area that these VCs are not as excited about are humanoids or consumer — and especially not consumer-focused humanoids.

Saad isn't convinced that people will want to have a robot in their house anytime soon. He added that even non-humanoid consumer-focused robotics companies have struggled to get consumers excited.

“The only successful consumer robot company, iRobot, failed to come up with a second act,” Saad said. “Pool cleaning robot, lawn mower, mopping and floor-cleaning robot, none of these worked out for whatever reason.”

While the industry is still years away from commercial success of more intricate robotic models, like humanoids, VCs are pouring more capital into the sector. Despite the fact that this interest is driving up the costs of deals, the surge in interest is a net positive for the industry, Winterroth and Saad said, as the potential customer base for robotics startups continues to grow.

“There are enough examples of successful commercial organizations, successful robotics companies, that have become a valuable commercial organization,” Winterroth said. “Ten, 15 years ago, it was questionable whether or not there was going to be a large and thriving marketplace for these types of solutions. Now, there's a lot of customer awareness.”

Software might be eating the world, but it's taking some industries longer than others to realize its full potential.

From iPhones to Teslas, people have grown accustomed to software updates improving the stuff they already own. But outside consumer electronics and automobiles, over-the-air updates aren't commonplace yet.

Yet that's beginning to change, starting with an unlikely product: heat pumps. Last week, heat pump startup Quilt said that it pushed an update last week to heat pumps already installed in customers' homes. It wasn't just a bug fix either: The new software and firmware boosted the units' heating and cooling capacities overnight by more than 20%.

“From the very beginning, we wanted to design the systems to be able to be continuously improved, updated over the air. It's a pattern that's happened in EVs and gotten a lot of traction, but no one had really done that before in HVAC,” Quilt CEO Paul Lambert told TechCrunch.

“In cars, sometimes they call it software-defined vehicles. We feel like we've created software-defined HVAC,” he added.

It can be hard to prove a negative, but according to heat pump expert Drew Tozer, the update is likely the first of its kind. Typically, when a heat pump is installed — or any piece of HVAC equipment — the only time it's touched is when there's a problem.

But many on Quilt's team didn't come from a traditional HVAC background. Instead, they were drawn from Nest, Google, Apple, and Tesla, companies where frequent updates are the norm. Isaac McQuillen, the engineer who led the capacity increase project, worked most recently at Lucid Motors, where he managed heating and cooling for both passengers and batteries.

“We got some feedback from both [installation] partners and some customers that it'd be really useful if we were able to have a slightly higher maximum operating capacity,” McQuillen said. Some people had larger living rooms or open floorpans that were more demanding. So the team dug in to see if the heat pumps had a little extra to give.

Quilt had specified more and higher quality sensors than what is normally found in residential HVAC systems, including additional pressures sensors, higher accuracy temperature and current sensors, McQuillen said. That data was key to the project.

Once the team realized they had room to spare, they set about testing the new parameters on in-house units to validate both performance and reliability. Quilt's updates included both software and firmware that runs on the main processor and microcontrollers scattered throughout the indoor and outdoor units.

Originally installed, the outdoor portion of a Quilt heat pump provided up to 19,700 BTUs of cooling per hour and 20,500 BTUs of heating per hour. Now cooling and heating figures have increased to 24,000 BTUs per hour and 25,200 BTUs per hour, respectively.

The new ratings don't change how efficiently the heat pumps run, but it does allow them to better cope with extreme heat and cold. 

The power of over-the-air updating doesn't come for free. It was only possible because Quilt had used higher quality sensors, monitored the data more closely, and included networking equipment to receive the update. They added a small amount to the total bill of materials, Lambert said. But as the company sees it, the benefits far outweigh the costs. “There's the upfront capital cost of the sensors, but we think there's just so much value to be gained from that extra data that that we felt that was worth it to integrate them,” McQuillen said.

”The hard part,” Lambert added, ”is knowing how to build all the integration around it with the software and all the systems working together.”

Plus, Quilt can now sell the units to a broader range of customers without having to design and market an entirely new model. Sounds like a win-win.

I found the navigation to be scattered and disorienting. In general clicking links opens new windows. In one case it navigated away from the current ""page"" and what I believe to be the back button (looks more like undo) didn't do anything. Why am I guessing what constitutes a page and how or if I can go back? Everyone has known how these things work in browsers for decades.

But I can personally speak to at least one aspect, having worked for a company that does high end web sites and strategy for large SaaS products, and also being the target audience for such websites (director or VP Eng): the speed and ease with which I can find what I want (as a potential customer) using that top navigation menu is superior to anything I've seen done so far.I could see immediately they have 34 products under 7 categories; 5 are popular, 4 are new. If I want to try out one: Docs > Product OS > Integration > Install and configure > Install PostHog.And if I wanted to learn a bit about their engineering: Company > Handbook > Engineering > Internal Processes > Bug prioritization.Pricing: Pricing calculator > select product > set usage, select addons.Each of these interactions took only seconds. And I could switch between the product overview page I opened earlier and the pricing page I just opened, without waiting for any entire website to reload (or having to right click, open in new tab, and then scroll).As I said, there is something here beyond just aesthetics. And one of the conclusions may be that our current UI/UX philosophy has inadvertantly become user-hostile.

at the time, we were trying to figure out how to add more products in without it becoming messy, and we concluded we're trying to do a lot more than just what would work well for a 1 product company (we have very extensive content for example) - we feel quite multidimensional. thus a flatter design was proving hard to do. we wanted something that could enable us to offer a very wide variety of things (like 10+ products, handbook, job board, newsletter etc)a lot of existing websites are trying to convey what they do in <3 seconds, and all of the internet is going for that. our company doesn't fit into 3 seconds, or if it does it's annoyingly vague ""a whole bunch of devtools""...! so we thought hey we'll do something that means people _will_ explore and learn what we do better. it will mean _some_ people bounce and that's ok, because those that stick will (sometimes!) love it.as a project, it looked fun and we knew it'd stand out a lot as a way to justify it. it's much nicer and more cost effective for us to ship something 10/10 cool than go down the outbound-y sales route. we run at a 3 month cac payback period if you're into startup stats. the proviso is that only works if you go _really_ deep, so that your work actually stands out.

I'm not a super fan of this, and I kind of hated windows 3.x, so I might not be the target market. But I also hate many of the trends in modern website design, so maybe I'm just an old crank.There could be a subset of this that is accessible, compatible, and doesn't reinvent a browser in a browser. I might end up liking that better than the status quo - so I appreciate the experimental spirit!

Not sure if that is the OS thing about it or just the way that information is presented and layout.

The menu bar is one of the most effective and proved UI pattern. Unfortunately, on Linux we have an entire desktop environment that ditched the menu bar for hamburger menus, which are one of the most ineffective UI pattern.

Using an OS requires familiarity and cognitive effort. Tapping oversized buttons… less so.There's been a long trend (definitely as far back as the first iPhone release, maybe further) of every product release adding more white space, bigger elements, and overall reducing information density.If your target is consumer web, the “don't make me think” approach is probably still correct. But anyone who's ever looked at a Bloomberg terminal knows there are still times when you designing for the lowest common denominator is the wrong play.A company with a large suite of technical-ish products might be a place to experiment with alternative paradigms.

The friction occurs when people building a website for web documents think they should be building a web app, so you end up with a scaffolding that requires heavy JS just to serve what essentially is just text + maybe one or two images. The additional JS doesn't really save the user any time or pain, it just makes everything larger and harder to consume.

It's almost like, ""marketing"", itself, as a concept, is user hostile. Most sites' purpose isn't to be efficient, or informative. It's to give the impression that they are ""making a statement"" (we matter because XYZ), while looking dependable and professional enough to compel calling sales for more.Commercial transparency goes against that goal (why would I call if I have all the price details I need?). Technical transparency goes against that goal (why would I call if I can tell precisely how this compares to market leaders and competitors?).So, in many (mostly despicable) aspects, this site is terrible. Unfortunately.

Otherwise two or three such apps running at the same time becomes a game of “where's my window”.  I hate the idea of a toolbar being its own window to be managed.

However, I believe there is a better way to approach this: put each significant piece of functionality into a separate window or even executable, and use regular moveable toolbars and well-known hotkeys inside each window. One window for code editor (with working Ctrl+Tab and Window -> Tile Horizontally menu), another for configuration, yet another for terminal and output window (with a Pin on top button). When I write code I don't normally need configuration tool, but if I need it even so often it gets opened alongside the editor and is now one Alt+Tab away, not taking any screen space at all.I used an engineering tool suite written with this approach and it was much better experience than the single-window monstrosity that came as a replacement, stuffing entirety of functionality into a single app and breaking (not implementing) a lot of small conveniences like aforementioned Ctrl+Tab.

Because some applications do need multiple windows in the same application context. A common example would be image editors.It is unfortunate that almost all generic MDI implementations (Win32 and Qt basically) are incredibly barebones. I want to have multiple windows visible when i'm using Krita, for example, but Qt's MDI support (that Krita does use) is worse than what Windows 95 had.

But my response was about calling MDI an anti-pattern in general. Just because it doesn't fit all cases, it doesn't mean it is an anti-pattern.

reply

I stand by the anti-pattern comment. I think there are very, very few cases where ‘MDI' is appropriate, and I put it in quotes because the things being managed in that case are almost never ‘documents' in any meaningful sense (rather they're some kind of graph node). Functionality apps build with MDI is basically always independent of the actual app and would be better implemented in the window manager — and more often than not there's actually no additional functionality over even the lowest common denominator of window managers.

reply

In theory you can have multiple toplevel windows with separate windows for the control stuff (tool window, tool options, panels, etc like GIMP has) but in that case you really need a virtual desktop dedicated to the application itself. Personally i prefer to dedicate virtual desktops to tasks (i have a fixed number of virtual desktops and their shortcut keys have become muscle memory over the years), so e.g. anything graphical goes into the same virtual desktop, but -say- GIMP in multiwindow mode feels awkward to use alongside Blender. Krita having an MDI mode is much better IMO, even if Qt's MDI support is primitive at best.

On our datacentre servers, I also have tmux running. It is fast to connect to these hosts, attach tmux and continue from where I left off.Another use case: it is common for corporates to require devs to use windows desktops, but to then give them a headless linux host in a datacentre for development work. Here, you use putty to connect to the linux host, fullscreen it, run tmux. On your desktop you have outlook and office and putty and a browser and no dev tools. You can do all your planning and dev work on the linux host, using your favourite ten thousand hours text editor and building your own tools, and this becomes your hub. You lose awareness that you are connected to this from a locked down windows host. Corporate security reboots your windows host for patching several nights in a row, and it does not cause you any hassle because your work context is in the tmux session on another host.

> i have yet to find a window manager that lets me group so many terminals into sessions all on the same workspace.Locally-speaking, I don't really see the point of mixing tmux sessions and tmux windows. I wonder if you mean ""sessions"" -> tmux windows and ""windows"" -> tmux panes.What about i3/sway? You can have a tabbed container (functions like tmux windows) with split containers inside (functions like tmux panes). You can even float the tabbed container with all windows organized inside.

sessions let you group windows. i have a group/session for each project/purpose. one session is for all remote connections. one for my personal stuff, diary, etc. one for my hobby. one for personal dev projects, one for client work.sessions also means that i can connect to tmux from multiple terminal windows. i generally have two windows, one for dev work and one for everything else.generally i feel that having more than half a dozen windows in a session makes the session unwieldy, harder to navigate, because it becomes more difficult to find the window i am looking for.which would be the same problem if each was a gui window. try to find your way around 20 gui windows.

seriously, a window manager that can group windows and manage those groups would be awesome. workspaces help, but they are often just there, and can't be managed, reordered, named, etc..actually, i think kde may have some of that functionality.i still prefer tmux in any case because it is more scriptable, and it provides a detach function. although i recently started exploring wezterm, which can be configured to work like tmux and also has a way to detach and reattach sessions: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44762241

I'd just run a vim session. If I needed terminals, they were in my vim! Even wrote a short shell-script to automate creating or re-attaching to a project specific vim session. https://github.com/jauntywunderkind/dtachmentHaven't looked into it, but I'm love a deeper nvim + atuin (shell history) integration.

You answered your own question, because a lot of applications work across multiple platforms, and if you want to have control over the experience because you don't know what capacities the OS's window manager has you need to abstract it away.

reply

But I take your point, if you want to target the lowest common denominator of window managers it makes some sense to do your own window management. Mind you you could just ship both a browser and a window manager…I wonder to what extent the pattern of applications doing their own window management masks (and therefore perpetuates) the problem of inadequate window managers.

Same slow spreadsheet load as sibling, but that seems like a backend issue.

reply

It appears as though all spreadsheets are grouped together in the same window under tabs. Perhaps its fetching the data for all of them. I noticed they all took a long time to load and then after one loaded, the others had loaded.I imagine that could be sorted out to load per tab. Im more concerned about the idea of grouping all spreadsheets together. As opposed to a normal website which could embed a datatable in whatever page layout you want.In general it bothers me to encapsulate what are essentially just page layouts as apps.

It is that. It has done literally nothing to improve anything whatsoever, in any country. And most of the ""cookie management"" scripts that people use, barely even work. Both the law and the way it's complied with in practice are a dumb solution to a problem that the EU should have forced browser vendors to solve. Only the user's browser can choose not to send back cookies, and it would be trivial for the user to be shown a dialog when they navigate to a previously-visited site in a new session saying:  Last time you were here, the site stored information that may help them recognize you or remember your previous actions here.

reply

Yes. For ""cookie banners"" the law in fact forbids hiding ""Reject all non-essential and continue"" to be given less visual weight than ""Accept all and continue"", let alone hiding it behind ""More details"" or other additional steps.It also requires consent to be informed (i.e. you need to know what you're agreeing to) and specific (i.e. you can't give blanket consent, the actual categories of data and purposes of collection need to be spelled out) and easily revokable (which is almost never the case - most sites provide no direct access to review your options later once you've ""opted in"").One good example I can think of for a ""cookie banner"" that gets this right is the WordPress plugin from DevOwl: https://devowl.io/wordpress-real-cookie-banner/ (this is not an ad, but this is the one I've been recommending to people after having tried several of them) because it actually adds links to the footer that let you review and change your consent afterwards.EDIT: Sorry, I first misread ""disallows"" as ""allows"".

Kind of.  The intent is good and the wording disallows some of the dark patterns.  The challenge is that it stands square in the path of the adtech surveillance behemoths.  That we ended up with the cesspit of cookie banners is a result of (almost) immovable object meeting (almost) irresistable force.  There was simply no way that Google, Facebook et al were ever going to comply with the intent of the law: it's their business not to.The only way we might have got a better outcome was for the EU to quickly respond and say ""nope, cookie banners aren't compliant with the law"".  That would have been incredibly difficult to do in practice.  You can bet your Bay Area mortgage that Big Tech will have had legions of smart lawyers pouring over how to comply with the letter whilst completely ignoring the intent.

Also, data collection is fully a choice. You can always choose not to. I've built websites with logins and everything and guess what - no cookie banners necessary. Just don't collect data you don't need.

And this is a good thing, no? I certainly think so.> It's a wonder we don't have to force everyone through an interstitial consent page.If the information being tracked is truly essential to the site/app (session management and authorisation data for instance) then no consent is needed, for anything else ask before you store it, and most certainly ask before you share it with your “partners” or anyone else.

> Private-sector or third-sector organisations will often be able to consider the ‘legitimate interests' basis in Article 6(1)(f) if they find it hard to meet the standard for consent and no other specific basis applies. This recognises that you may have good reason to process someone's personal data without their consent – but you must avoid doing anything they would not expect, ensure there is no unwarranted impact on them, and that you are still fair, transparent and accountable.Session tracking, storing account information, addresses, etc all seem obvious in any e-commerce system but you still have every opportunity to notify and consent that data collection.I think you and I both think that data protection is a good thing, I'm just a little more wary of leaning on legitimate usage* as a way to skip formal consent.

Many websites are free because they survive from ads. Ads make more money if you collect data. The EU law essentially cut the revenue of all these websites. Their choice is to not collect data (meaning less revenue) or show a popup (meaning more bounce rate, which means less revenue).People who think this is a good thing are being short-sighted. That's because this law mainly affects websites that host information that visitors visit from clicking on links on the web. If a website is like Facebook or Youtube, where users must sign up first or probably already have an account, they will be able to collect data for ads with or without banners since they have their own ToS for creating an account, and they can infer a lot from how the user uses their services.I'm not saying privacy regulation is a bad thing. It made countless businesses reconsider how they handle people's data. But it's clear to me that there are two problems.First, this regulation hurts all the small websites that need to exist in order for we have to have a healthy ""web."" A lot of these are making only barely their hosting costs in ads, so there is no way they can afford the counsel to figure out how to comply with laws from another continent. If we had another way to support these websites, this wouldn't be a problem, but ads are really the lifeblood of half of the internet, and almost nobody wants to donate or pay a subscription.Second, this regulation doesn't even really protect people's private data in the end, which may give users a false sense of security because they have the GDPR on their side. I forgot the name, but there was a recent gossiping app that required the user to upload a photo in order to sign up, which should be deleted afterwards, but they never deleted it and when the app was hacked the attacker had access to photos of all users. It's the same thing with GDPR. We can tell when a website is clearly not complying with the GDPR, but there is no way to tell if they actually complied with the GDPR until the server gets hacked.Even the way they comply with GDPR isn't enough to protect users' privacy, e.g. if you have an account on Discord and you want your data deleted, they will simply turn every post your made into an ""anonymous"" post. This means if you sent a message that discloses your private information on Discord, that will never get deleted because its outside the scope of compliance. You could literally say ""Hi, my name is XYZ, I live in ABC"" and they won't delete that because you consented to provide that information, they will just change your username from ""xyz"" to ""anonymous"" or something like that.I still wonder what are the actual benefits of GDPR with these cookie banners when 99% of the users just stay on Facebook and Youtube anyway.

People who think this is a good thing are being short-sighted. That's because this law mainly affects websites that host information that visitors visit from clicking on links on the web. If a website is like Facebook or Youtube, where users must sign up first or probably already have an account, they will be able to collect data for ads with or without banners since they have their own ToS for creating an account, and they can infer a lot from how the user uses their services.I'm not saying privacy regulation is a bad thing. It made countless businesses reconsider how they handle people's data. But it's clear to me that there are two problems.First, this regulation hurts all the small websites that need to exist in order for we have to have a healthy ""web."" A lot of these are making only barely their hosting costs in ads, so there is no way they can afford the counsel to figure out how to comply with laws from another continent. If we had another way to support these websites, this wouldn't be a problem, but ads are really the lifeblood of half of the internet, and almost nobody wants to donate or pay a subscription.Second, this regulation doesn't even really protect people's private data in the end, which may give users a false sense of security because they have the GDPR on their side. I forgot the name, but there was a recent gossiping app that required the user to upload a photo in order to sign up, which should be deleted afterwards, but they never deleted it and when the app was hacked the attacker had access to photos of all users.

My business is to get money out of other people's wallets and bank accounts. I could get make much money if you just logged into your bank account and approved transactions whenever I told you to, or screamed less whenever I took the wallet out of your pocket on my own.That there's a way to earn more money does not justify it as legitimate thing to do, and if you can't figure out how to run a service in legitimate ways does not mean that illegitimate ways that attempt to violate its users in secret suddenly become okay.

1. The law isn't about browsers or websites. It equally applies to all tracking. E.g. in apps. Or in physical stores.2. The world's largest advertising company could do all you describe.

In practice these banners regularly break. They are hard to click on certain devices where the button is off screen. If they use JavaScript and there is an error elsewhere, you can't hide them. And I regularly see them over and over again on the same sites because for some reason they can't track me effectively for this purpose.In short they are a regular minor annoyance that does take time and effort.

Other people already get two choices to make here which they didn't get before, which is a win in my book. Seeing the banner, you can decide to avoid the website and if you still wanna use the website, you can chose if you allow them to track you by PII or not.

reply

Also, I am an educated consumer and understand what a cookie is. Most people do not and do whatever is necessary to make the consent screen go away. Because of that, effectively they don't get this choice.As one of the parent posts said, if it was implemented on the browser level, I would get the choice, and the cost of making the right choice would be smaller. If the defaults were to ""reject unnecessary cookies"" then most of the population would get the benefit.The way it is right now feels like a net negative. Most people don't know what the consent is about and will not spend the time to learn it. Companies still find ways to track you that agrees with the letter but not the spirit of the law. I have friction whenever visiting a new website (or an old one that forgot my choice). The only winners are people who don't value their time and are smart enough to understand cookie consent. That's a small percentage of the general population.

It's not cookie banners that are wasting productivity, it's mutual distrust and the need to protect against it. ""Cookie banners"" (or more correctly: consent forms) are legal contracts. The reason they are often so annoying to navigate is that the companies that built them want to try to trick you into agreeing to things you have no interest in agreeing to or might even have an interest in not agreeing to. Technically the law forbids this but it's still more profitable to risk the fine than to abide by the law.Or to put it another way: there's no honest reason to require a consent form to let you read an article. The consent form isn't for reading the article, it's for what the site wants to do to you (or your data - which includes all data collected about you because the GDPR defines that as being yours, too) while you're reading the article.The GDPR doesn't make you waste time on cookie banners. The GDPR grants you ownership of all personally identifiable information of you and about you - it creates legal rights and protections you previously didn't have. Cookie banners exist because companies want to infringe upon those rights. Most cookie banners are difficult to navigate because most companies don't want you to understand what you're agreeing to (and on second order because they want you to blame the law granting you rights rather than them for infringing upon those rights).

Rights don't make sense without bureaucracy because they only have meaning when you deal with them at that layer of abstraction. You can't respect and infringe ""rights"" interpersonally. You can act ethically or unethically, you can be nice or a bit of a dick, you can harm or help. But rights only become necessary as a concept when you have processes that need to interact with them and abstract entities that uphold and enforce them. Rights allow you to sue or call the police. But without rights you can't have capitalism. States enforce property rights literally at the end of a gun (and this includes ""state property"" too in case you were wondering about so-called ""communist"" states).

This is only an option if you limit tracking to using cookies. But neither tracking technologies, nor the current EU law, are limited to tracking via cookies. It also kills functionality for many web applications without also accepting all tracking. Some browser-flavors went to extreme lengths to prevent tracking through other means (eg fixed window size, highly generic header settings, ...).Maybe I am mistaken, but it seriously frustrates me how much people within the relevant field make this mistake of conflating tracking and cookies and come to this ""it would be so simple"" solution.A welcome update to the law would be to allow a header flag to opt out/in (or force the do-not-track header to have this functionality) preventing the banner from showing.

Maybe we could move towards that end in small steps. The EU should start by banning irrelevant non-sequiturs like ""We value your privacy"" and other misleading or at best distracting language. It can then abandon the notion that users are at all interested in fine-grained choice, and enforce that consent and non-consent to non-essential statekeeping are two clearly distinguished and immediately accessible buttons. No one wants to partially block tracking.It seems as though the EU is operating under the notion that this is all a matter of consumer choice, as though any informed consumer would choose to have tabs kept on them by 50 trackers if not for the inconvenience of figuring out which button stops them.

That's because of malicious compliance from all the websites/advertisers.

As an example of true malicious compliance, some companies intentionally add trace amounts of allergens to all their food, that way they can just claim that all their food contains allergens and not be at risk of being accused of improper labeling. but the intention of the law requiring accurate labeling was clearly not to get companies to add more allergens to their food. it requires a level of creativity to even think of complying like that. It requires zero creativity to think “this law requires user consent before tracking, so let's ask for consent”.

What I don't like about cookie popups isn't the popup (which isn't something the EU law dictated btw), it's that someone thought it was okay to have hundreds of advertisement vendors and data brokers on a single news article, and it's better to know so I can just close the tab and never interact with that webpage again if they're being excessive asshats.They have failed at enforcing this properly though, in particular with the recent proliferation of ""legitimate interest"" abuse (it is only legitimate interest if it an implied component to a service I am directly requesting), and the general issue of popups illegally making rejection different from acceptance, intentionally making rejection slow, or even requiring payment to continue without cookies. And yes, the occasionally completely defective prompt.I do agree that it would be neater if the browser handled this though. Would also be neater if the internet wasn't entirely sponsored by privacy violations. :/

Most of the ""cookie management"" scripts that people use aren't compliant.EU law requires ""Accept All"" and ""Reject All Non-Essential"" be both equally easy to access and given equal weight (or rather: the latter can't be given less weight and made more difficult to access, which almost all of these scripts blatantly ignore).Browser vendors can't solve this because the question isn't technical but legal.

Being jailed into a whatng cartel web engine does much more harm than cookie tracking (and some could use a long cryptographic URL parameter anyway).Basically, a web ""site"" would be a ""noscript/basic (x)html)"" portal, and a web ""app"" would require a whatng cartel web engine (geeko/webkit/blink).I do remember clearly a few years back, I was able to buy on amazon with the lynx browser... yep basic HTML forms can do wonders.

You can argue that the law might not have improved things (at least not as much as intended), but nothing about this law has made the WWW worse. If you believe that, you've fallen for the concerted efforts of the advertising industry spreading misinformation about who's idea the annoying consent popups were & (like this website) perpetuating the myth that they're a legal requirement.None of the new annoyances on the modern web that you're thinking about are mandated by EU law. It benefits the ad industry massively to scapegoat the EU for these annoyances.

It doesn't matter much what happened behind the scenes to cause that outcome. From a black-box perspective, it could be that(a) the EU mandated the cookie banners,
(b) the EU mandated to provide cookie settings in some generic form, and websites decided to use banners because it's easier, more lucrative, or even to put people against the EU, in spite of having other options that were better for the user.
(c) the EU mandated a different thing and the annoying banners don't even comply with the law.No matter what the case is, the fact is that the EU made the WWW worse with the law. Either due to an outright harmful law, or to a well-intentioned law with too many loopholes, or to a good law but lack of enforcement. Doesn't matter much for the end user. When you make laws that affect people's daily life, good intentions aren't enough.

You can reasonably argue that if the EU had not taken action to reduce advertising companies' ability to abuse customer rights, then advertising companies would not have retaliated, & therefore the web would be a less annoying experience. You cannot reasonably argue though that this is some isolated one-sided situation where ad companies are devoid of culpability.Your entire comment essentially amounts to ignoring an elephant in the room to sell a narrative that one ""side"" bears 100% of responsibility for the outcome.

Then emphasizing that all links are always different even for same routes to ""show they are randomly generated"", and saying that they do this because... idk, detecting scraping or something random but plausible-sounding.

In the teams window, The first page doesn't load the images but does the content, clicking another item in the menu does show the expected page but again with no images. At some point, clicking the menu items does not load the correct page. At some point after that the images load in, however the correct link to the correct post does not appear. I have to click about 6 times on the same menu link to see a cycling of different posts (possibly the ones I was clicking before) to see the expected post.

I've been at a company that mandated innovation by having a mandatory annual innovation day, and full productivity for the rest of the year. ""Be innovative for 8 hours, damn it!"". That never worked. Not once. Never ever. Innovation was limited to evolution, and evolution was so slow that our customers had started implementing what we provided in house instead. Stagnation, as you call it.I've also been at a company where people got... bored (didn't have enough to do). A guy single handedly re-wrote the firmware for a neat little hardware box that ended up saving the company an absolute ridiculous amount of money as they no longer needed to buy another much, much more expensive proprietary box.So in my opinion having bored engineers around could very well be a sign of great success.

Imagine a startup with an engineering team that has this much creative energy, ingenuity, and vision unencumbered by bureaucratic processes, committees, and all-day meetings.A sense of ""play"" is so important in creating fantastic software. Some of the best products are the result of engineers having full creative control and the liberty to ""play"". See, for example, Google's ""20% time policy"" in the early 2000s which birthed Gmail, or 3M's ""permitted bootlegging"" policy which birthed Post-it notes.

IMO, first impression?  This is just a straight-up better way to show docs to me.  To quote the landing page: ""Often times, I'll want to refer to different pages at the same time. So I'll CMD + click “a couple times” while browsing around and before I know it, I have 12 new tabs open – all indistinguishable from each other because they share the same favicon.""Wow.  They fixed it.  First of it's kind, at least in my career so far.  If you're got an example from DOS then yeah, I missed out, and agree that something important was lost along the way.

by Garry Tan9/12/2025

We're thrilled to announce that Ankit Gupta is joining YC as our newest General Partner.

Ankit has already worked with dozens of YC founders as a visiting partner in recent batches. He has a rare blend of deep machine learning expertise and firsthand startup experience that make him an ideal mentor for founders building at the bleeding edge of AI. Though he'll frequently commute to SF, Ankit will primarily be based out of Cambridge, Massachusetts — re-establishing a YC foothold at the site of our original office!

Ankit's YC journey began in the Winter 2018 batch, when he co-founded Reverie Labs, a biotech company applying machine learning to drug discovery. The team at Reverie developed machine learning models for small-molecule design, partnered with pharmaceutical companies, and advanced their own medicines before eventually being acquired by Ginkgo Bioworks in 2024.

Before founding Reverie, Ankit earned a B.A. and M.S. in Computer Science at Harvard and published research at ICML and other conferences on deep learning and large-scale model training. It's that blend of research and founder experience that makes Ankit uniquely equipped to help the next generation of AI startups succeed.

We are super excited to have him and are certain his expertise will continue to support YC founders at every stage. Welcome, Ankit!

Folds are powerful. One can trisect or n-sect any angle for finite n. One still needs the compass though for circle.    Straight edge

BTW nuesis can also trisect angles.Yes one would not reach the reals (that's not the ultimate goal) but the geometry would certainly would have been richer.By no means is the area of folding a mathematical dead end as new theorems still get discovered.

Fitting a -single- such surface to a set of points is nearly trivial; finding a way to best fit -multiple- such surfaces together to approximate a non-trivial shape (cloud of points) where they share edges in a way that could be joined like this paper model.... feels very NP-hard to me.  This is a subset of the problem in the 3d-scan-to-CAD industry where you have a point cloud/mesh and you need to detect flat planes, cylinders, fillets, etc of a 3d scan and best-fit primitive surfaces to those areas and then join them into a manifold while respecting a bunch of other geometric and tolerance constraints.There is a reason why there are only a few software packages that even attempt to do this, and it is almost always human-guided in some way.  It's a fascinating problem.

I actually think the title as it is now has more mass appeal; it's very general and might pique your curiosity if you're interested in either 3-D modelling or paper crafting.On the other hand if it had the ""SR-71 Blackbird"" in the title, some readers might shy away due to either not knowing what that is, or thinking ""well, I'm not really interested in planes"".Which would be kind of a shame, since I think the post has some nice points to make regardless of whether you're into the SR-71 Blackbird or planes; that's just the example chosen to paint the broader picture.

I remember a few years ago, I noticed a mole on my arm suddenly looking very irregular. I kind of panicked, thinking it was potentially skin cancer. I have decent PPO insurance, no worries, I can go call up and schedule an appointment with a dermatologist directly. I live in one of the largest metro areas in the US, tons of doctors, should be a breeze to get it checked out.I load up the find a doctor website on my insurance company's website. There's like 30 dermatologists within an hour or so drive from me, awesome. I start calling. Not taking new patients right now. Can't be seen for 6 months, 8 months, we could get you in next year. Next year, when I might have quickly growing skin cancer?Luckily when I finally talked to my wife about it, she reminded me she had poked my arm with a permanent marker. Some solvent, and my mole looks normal again. I still make sure to keep my dermatologist appointments, just so I don't have to deal with the new patient issues and the ""we're not taking anyone new these days"".I had a different issue with extreme nystagmus come upon me. Bedridden for days, I couldn't even open my eyes without having extreme vertigo. Calling ENTs to try and get help, none would be able to see me for weeks. Luckily a friend who works with ENTs managed to get a doctor to see me but if it wasn't for that I probably would have just had to suffer at home with no answers as to what was happening.I now know that unless I'm practically about to die, seeing a doctor that will do more than run extremely basic labs and very basic healthcare is weeks away in the US even if you have decent insurance.

I had Kaiser Permanente when I was in the US. Now that I'm in BC, Canada, it is very similar. I walk into any hospital in the province and every doctor and specialist in the building are part of the same system (technically they are broken up into three geographic subunits, but to the patient it basically doesn't matter). If I need some sort of treatment that hospital doesn't offer, they can immediately refer me to the correct hospital. For emergency cases the provincial ambulance service will transport you to another hospital by road or air at no cost.There are still independent specialists and doctors outside of the hospital system, but they have access to the same records systems and the billing is so seamless that I suspect that most people don't realize it is happening since it never involves the patient outside of providing your ID.

German public health insurances are concerned right now about their unusually  high deficits. Because many millions refugees are not working they only get paid a reduced amount towards the mandatory health insurance but have the same full service. Bringing the already substituted public health insurance into insubstantial deficits and now they are increasing the rates for the working class and probably they will need additional tax money too.

I have never heard of an insurance policy in the US that allows you to consume as much, and whatever type of healthcare that you want. Quite the opposite is most people's experience. You have to justify any visit to a specialist before going, you don't get to choose the specialist, many times the insurer will simply deny a payment request for care already received. On many plans, you have to spend 5 figures per year before they will even cover anything.I would love to have had healthcare in America where I was insulated fully from the costs of care. My experience was that it was rare to see a doctor where I wouldn't end p paying at least three figures despite having fantastic insurance.Meanwhile in Canada, I can recklessly visit three doctors per day for the same issue at no out of pocket cost if I want, and it will still cost my insurer (the province of BC, in my case) less than a single doctor visit 60 miles south of here.From where I sit, the US, which has an unusually high exposure to the real costs of healthcare among peer states, also has the highest cost of healthcare. That sort of goes directly against what you are saying

The only thing I've been denied for is Botox for TMJ which they say is not medically proven (seems to be the opposite, but I understand why they're wary).I've never had a medication, procedure, or doctor visit denied.

You cannot consume as much and whatever type of healthcare. You have to consume from the pre-approved list of doctors that have negotiated rates with your insurer. I also do not believe for a second that if you found a doctor willing to give -for example - daily electrolyte IVs for your post workout recovery, that the insurer would touch that claim. Same thing with cosmetic or elective surgery. Will your insurer cover a facelift? Will they cover Ozempic for vanity reasons? Will they cover the full cost of all name brand drugs after your deductible is spent? And you still have to pay $2k before any of that is in effect.Mind you, your extreme outlier reality is one that is essentially never experienced by >95% of people, and it still has constraints.

They are the one that decided customers shouldn't see most of their healthcare costs.The ideal that actually lets customers see pricing info is: a health savings account, a high-deductible insurance with no cap, and then as a cost savings measure the insurance company can incentivize yearly check-ups.Mixing in employer insurance also caused a skew, because it makes people see their employer insurance as a perk. A perk should be something you actually experience. Employers should dump money into your HSA, and subsidize a gym/healthy snacks for their campus instead (some do, of course).

There are certainly acute situations that are unpredictable -- go to the ER with a gunshot wound, and nobody can tell you what it's going to cost. That's fine.But most of the time, you're wrong. Health care moves slowly, and there's lots of time to think and plan. The costs of pretty much any procedure is pre-negotiated by the insurer and the provider, so they actually do know what it's going to cost. They just don't tell you.There's no fundamental reason you couldn't have been quoted an accurate price in the scenario you described.

I received an itemized bill with the exact cost and what would be covered listed, then it changed after the fact. It is certainly the case that for some procedures you can't get this, but for procedures where you know the cost will be hundreds you can easily obtain such a bill. Such bills always involve guesswork though. Even absent insurance this would be true, complications happen.

People already have plenty of incentive to become doctors. We just don't let them.  Medical schools collude to limit the number of medical students each year (under the guise of preventing having ""too many"" doctors). Medical schools have ridiculous selection criteria, like picking the candidates who earned an ""A"" in physics instead of a ""B"", or who came from a rich enough family that they could perform many hours of volunteer community work (mostly because the low quotas make it otherwise impossible to select candidates without literally rolling dice).You know what? I think tech workers aren't paid enough. There isn't enough incentive to become a tech worker. We should limit how many people can study CS each year with strict quotas. It should be illegal for a person to program a computer unless they have a CS degree from an accredited school (one in on the quota system) and have passed an exam. Practicing programming without a license (or practicing from a foreign country with a local license) should be illegal, punishable by time in jail. Finally, programmers should have access to computer tools (like encryption) which will be illegal for the rest of the population to possess, and be given the benefit of the doubt if/when they misuse them.Do you see how ridiculous this sounds?

I mean, people in the US pay $250k+ tuition, median income $65k/year, work $35k/year for a while, and eventually make something like that $250k/year. A house in many US markets is $300-500k.It's pretty much the same balance between each item, just more zeroes on the end of each number.

I will spare you the ethical and moral reasons, and give you a practical one.Private healthcare, being a business, cannot afford the investments of public one. Instead it operates following the Pareto principle where 20% of services and treatments cover 90%+ of patient needs.Now this works with much joy over most of your life, but there are just too many edge cases over a life time where this will screw you.E.g. A close friend of mine gave birth in a private clinic. The most luxurious one with almost a dozen people following her.All of this: pointless. Her child had complications minutes after birth, and no single private hospital in our country has a pediatric intensive care unit, or, to label it more correctly a pediatric _reanimation_ unit.The only private hospitals that do? University ones, as they operate on slightly different financial basis and incentives.This goes beyond this example I have. It doesn't matter if you're in a country with good private healthcare (e.g. Switzerland) or a crap one, public healthcare is accepted to be a money loser for the greater good and will cover more services. Always.Mind you, I'm not saying that a single public hospital will offer everything and private is bad, just stating that there's many situations where it's easier to find the service offered in public rather than private health care.

The only ones that do are all university hospitals and they only do so because they operate on a very different financial non-profit model.And I'm talking about Switzerland.PICU isn't just an example of service and treatments where even very very rich countries with quality healthcare are relatively uncovered compared to much poorer countries with public health care.It's not even the happiest one, because PICU is still ""relatively"" common, so I don't want to focus on it.Other examples of treatments that are relatively common in public health care are organ transplants, ICU for infective diseases, post trauma (stroke-like) rehabilitation are just some of the examples of treatments you're gonna find in many public hospitals in a country but extremely rarely in neighboring countries with excellent private healthcare.

I understand medicine is slightly different but my hunch is that any sufficiently smart person can do well enough as a doctor after 1-2 years of theory.This might anger a lot of people because there's a trend where we elevate medicine and doctors to a godly level.Thankfully with the internet and AI, knowledge is not gatekept as much now.I wish we allow more people to become doctors and intelligent people to become doctors. The type of people who choose to become doctors are not problem solvers, at least from my experience.Of course my argument doesn't work exactly for surgeons but I think we should not artificially reduce their numbers.

Personally, I would always rather see a physician due to how much more training/experience they have. A physician who's out of residency will have gotten at least 3 years of on the job training (after medical school). A nurse practitioner may have just gotten their BSN and then gone straight into an NP program without ever working a single day as a nurse.But yes, you're right, this person is absolutely describing NPs.

There's a very good chance, if you're seeing a NP, that the NP has a lot more experience with that sort of condition than the docs. After all, the practice is sending those sorts of issues to the NP. My dad's a radiologist, but they haven't assessed a minor break in decades, because they're very subspecialized.If it's unusual or complex, the NP is probably the first to say ""we'll need to make an appt with Dr. So and So"".

Unfortunately, right now, it is difficult for doctors to do so much as move to and start practicing in a different state. But if you want medical costs to actually come down and to ensure availability, you need to multiply the number of doctors available to treat people.

reply

It matters how much they add to the cost.Typically, ""margins"" means the profit they make over and above expenses. For insurance companies, the salaries of all the people they employ, and the rent/mortgage/upkeep on their buildings & grounds, would all be classified as expenses that would not generally be included in their margins.But in a single-payer system, none of that cost would even exist. We have to pay for all of that through our premiums, and we get nothing out of it.

I think this sentence shows that you don't really understand the difference between the two jobs. Nurses and physicians have wildly different training/education.

In the US, a majority of large employers don't buy insurance in the strict actuarial sense. They self-fund health benefits under ERISA, paying claims directly and hiring insurers only as administrators (ASOs). The plan may contract with an insurer (e.g. UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, Cigna) to process claims and run the network, but for most employees at large firms, the insurer is not actually insuring anything. Self-funded ERISA plans are regulated by the US Department of Labor, not state insurance commissioners.

I think we can assume that no matter what your political persuasion, in some sense the government is ultimately at fault, either for overregulating or for allowing for the existence of privatized healthcare. As such, it needn't be said, and we can focus the conversation on the proximal rather than ultimate cause.

2. Repeal the ACA mandates and enact interstate laws which permits low-deductible, low mandate policies along with reintroducing catastrophic insurance. The current status quo forces young people to pay for old people and those less responsible with their health. What we have now is prepaid medical care, not insureance. This also removes the insurance monopolies states and companies have created together.We have the worst of all possible systems at present.

There are two sides to this. The first is, hospitals are owned by investors, and have to increase profits. The typical playbook of trying to acquire at least a local monopoly to price-fix is in play everywhere.The other side is: to achieve high profit margins chase wealthy customers and cater to their preferences. Headhunt star staff with increased salaries. Build shiny new hospitals and prioritize private rooms (HIPAA provided a great excuse here). To woo investors turn administrator into a CEO position with commensurate pay.None of this incentivizes providing quality health care to non-wealthy people at a fair price. It incentivizes trying to get rid of lower income patients as quickly as possible to make room for high income or well insured patients who can be billed more.Same as housing, this issue is everywhere in the western world. We can try to tackle it by itself (transparent pricing would probably help a great deal), but the root issue is bigger: the rich are getting what they want on both sides of the equation. They don't want affordable healthcare.

The food system is basically a free market (with some weak safety regulations). The apparent end-state of this free market  that America has arrived at is tragic. Sure, people like me are free to select healthy, nutritious food at reasonable prices, but at a population level, 70% are overweight and 30% are obese, with all the risk and disease that comes with that.This is where free markets (in necessary goods) tend to end up.

Even this isn't so simple.  Foods in America are engineered explicitly to increase consumption, often (but not exclusively) by increasing fat, sugar, and salt.  A good example of this is bread, as most breads sold in the US would be classified as cake in other countries due to the added sugar.The only way to avoid this is to make your own food by scratch, which simply isn't viable for a large population living paycheck to paycheck.

With powerful video generation tools now in the hands of more people than ever, let's take a look at how they work.

MIT Technology Review Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what's coming next. You can read more from the series here.

It's been a big year for video generation. In the last nine months OpenAI made Sora public, Google DeepMind launched Veo 3, the video startup Runway launched Gen-4. All can produce video clips that are (almost) impossible to distinguish from actual filmed footage or CGI animation. This year also saw Netflix debut an AI visual effect in its show The Eternaut, the first time video generation has been used to make mass-market TV.

Sure, the clips you see in demo reels are cherry-picked to showcase a company's models at the top of their game. But with the technology in the hands of more users than ever before—Sora and Veo 3 are available in the ChatGPT and Gemini apps for paying subscribers—even the most casual filmmaker can now knock out something remarkable. 

The downside is that creators are competing with AI slop, and social media feeds are filling up with faked news footage. Video generation also uses up a huge amount of energy, many times more than text or image generation. 

With AI-generated videos everywhere, let's take a moment to talk about the tech that makes them work.

Let's assume you're a casual user. There are now a range of high-end tools that allow pro video makers to insert video generation models into their workflows. But most people will use this technology in an app or via a website. You know the drill: “Hey, Gemini, make me a video of a unicorn eating spaghetti. Now make its horn take off like a rocket.” What you get back will be hit or miss, and you'll typically need to ask the model to take another pass or 10 before you get more or less what you wanted. 

So what's going on under the hood? Why is it hit or miss—and why does it take so much energy? The latest wave of video generation models are what's known as latent diffusion transformers. Yes, that's quite a mouthful. Let's unpack each part in turn, starting with diffusion. 

Imagine taking an image and adding a random spattering of pixels to it. Take that pixel-spattered image and spatter it again and then again. Do that enough times and you will have turned the initial image into a random mess of pixels, like static on an old TV set. 

A diffusion model is a neural network trained to reverse that process, turning random static into images. During training, it gets shown millions of images in various stages of pixelation. It learns how those images change each time new pixels are thrown at them and, thus, how to undo those changes. 

The upshot is that when you ask a diffusion model to generate an image, it will start off with a random mess of pixels and step by step turn that mess into an image that is more or less similar to images in its training set. 

But you don't want any image—you want the image you specified, typically with a text prompt. And so the diffusion model is paired with a second model—such as a large language model (LLM) trained to match images with text descriptions—that guides each step of the cleanup process, pushing the diffusion model toward images that the large language model considers a good match to the prompt. 

An aside: This LLM isn't pulling the links between text and images out of thin air. Most text-to-image and text-to-video models today are trained on large data sets that contain billions of pairings of text and images or text and video scraped from the internet (a practice many creators are very unhappy about). This means that what you get from such models is a distillation of the world as it's represented online, distorted by prejudice (and pornography).

It's easiest to imagine diffusion models working with images. But the technique can be used with many kinds of data, including audio and video. To generate movie clips, a diffusion model must clean up sequences of images—the consecutive frames of a video—instead of just one image. 

All this takes a huge amount of compute (read: energy). That's why most diffusion models used for video generation use a technique called latent diffusion. Instead of processing raw data—the millions of pixels in each video frame—the model works in what's known as a latent space, in which the video frames (and text prompt) are compressed into a mathematical code that captures just the essential features of the data and throws out the rest. 

A similar thing happens whenever you stream a video over the internet: A video is sent from a server to your screen in a compressed format to make it get to you faster, and when it arrives, your computer or TV will convert it back into a watchable video. 

New diffusion AI models that make songs from scratch are complicating our definitions of authorship and human creativity.

And so the final step is to decompress what the latent diffusion process has come up with. Once the compressed frames of random static have been turned into the compressed frames of a video that the LLM guide considers a good match for the user's prompt, the compressed video gets converted into something you can watch.  

With latent diffusion, the diffusion process works more or less the way it would for an image. The difference is that the pixelated video frames are now mathematical encodings of those frames rather than the frames themselves. This makes latent diffusion far more efficient than a typical diffusion model. (Even so, video generation still uses more energy than image or text generation. There's just an eye-popping amount of computation involved.) 

Still with me? There's one more piece to the puzzle—and that's how to make sure the diffusion process produces a sequence of frames that are consistent, maintaining objects and lighting and so on from one frame to the next. OpenAI did this with Sora by combining its diffusion model with another kind of model called a transformer. This has now become standard in generative video. 

Transformers are great at processing long sequences of data, like words. That has made them the special sauce inside large language models such as OpenAI's GPT-5 and Google DeepMind's Gemini, which can generate long sequences of words that make sense, maintaining consistency across many dozens of sentences. 

But videos are not made of words. Instead, videos get cut into chunks that can be treated as if they were. The approach that OpenAI came up with was to dice videos up across both space and time. “It's like if you were to have a stack of all the video frames and you cut little cubes from it,” says Tim Brooks, a lead researcher on Sora.

Using transformers alongside diffusion models brings several advantages. Because they are designed to process sequences of data, transformers also help the diffusion model maintain consistency across frames as it generates them. This makes it possible to produce videos in which objects don't pop in and out of existence, for example. 

And because the videos are diced up, their size and orientation do not matter. This means that the latest wave of video generation models can be trained on a wide range of example videos, from short vertical clips shot with a phone to wide-screen cinematic films. The greater variety of training data has made video generation far better than it was just two years ago. It also means that video generation models can now be asked to produce videos in a variety of formats. 

A big advance with Veo 3 is that it generates video with audio, from lip-synched dialogue to sound effects to background noise. That's a first for video generation models. As Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis put it at this year's Google I/O: “We're emerging from the silent era of video generation.” 

The challenge was to find a way to line up video and audio data so that the diffusion process would work on both at the same time. Google DeepMind's breakthrough was a new way to compress audio and video into a single piece of data inside the diffusion model. When Veo 3 generates a video, its diffusion model produces audio and video together in a lockstep process, ensuring that the sound and images are synched.  

No—or at least not yet. Diffusion models are most often used to generate images, video, and audio. Large language models—which generate text (including computer code)—are built using transformers. But the lines are blurring. We've seen how transformers are now being combined with diffusion models to generate videos. And this summer Google DeepMind revealed that it was building an experimental large language model that used a diffusion model instead of a transformer to generate text. 

Here's where things start to get confusing: Though video generation (which uses diffusion models) consumes a lot of energy, diffusion models themselves are in fact more efficient than transformers. Thus, by using a diffusion model instead of a transformer to generate text, Google DeepMind's new LLM could be a lot more efficient than existing LLMs. Expect to see more from diffusion models in the near future! 

It's the most transparent estimate yet from one of the big AI companies, and a long-awaited peek behind the curtain for researchers.

The generative AI industry has promised to “disrupt” society, and on that front, it can be said to have succeeded. AI has certainly disrupted many parts of society, including education, social media, and politics. Most of all, it seems to have disrupted the tech industry itself, where what was once a profitable career (software development) increasingly seems to be more of a precarious one, thanks to the rise of so-called “vibe coding”—a form of AI-assisted software development that requires less experience and more automation.

This whole vibe coding thing doesn't seem to be working out for companies, however, as generating code via an LLM prompt at breakneck speed can, predictably, lead to less-than-stellar work. Now, in an ironic twist, it seems that, having dispensed with more skilled coders for the cheap effectiveness of a chatbot-aided code monkey, companies are having to hire additional contractors to fix the AI's screw-ups.

404 Media writes about the rise of an entire new class of coders, dubbed the “vibe coding cleanup specialists,” who can swoop in to fix the problems that AI-generated code creates for companies. The outlet cites one description shared with them by a specialist, who said his particular expertise was to “polish” up codebases that might be a little rough around the edges:

“I've been offering vibe coding fixer services for about two years now, starting in late 2023. Currently, I work with around 15-20 clients regularly, with additional one-off projects throughout the year,” Hamid Siddiqi, who offers to “review, fix your vibe code” on Fiverr, told me in an email. “I started fixing vibe-coded projects because I noticed a growing number of developers and small teams struggling to refine AI-generated code that was functional but lacked the polish or ‘vibe' needed to align with their vision. I saw an opportunity to bridge that gap, combining my coding expertise with an eye for aesthetic and user experience.”

Siddiqi told 404 that he commonly assists companies with “inconsistent UI/UX design in AI-generated frontends, poorly optimized code that impacts performance, misaligned branding elements, and features that function but feel clunky or unintuitive.” Yet another cleanup specialist, Swatantra Sohni, told the outlet that they think AI is being leveraged by people who don't otherwise have the digital skills to build products. The results are predictable:

“Most of these vibe coders, either they are product managers or they are sales guys, or they are small business owners, and they think that they can build something,” Sohni told me. “So for them it's more for prototyping. Vibe coding is, at the moment, kind of like infancy. It's very handy to convey the prototype they want, but I don't think they are really intended to make it like a production grade app.”

It's unclear how widely these services are being offered, but given the rising popularity of vibe-coding amongst small businesses, it seems likely that it would be a growing market. As with many other AI-led industries, humans are still necessary after all.

Hey Siri, has anyone succumbed to the corrupting influence of money and power today? Earlier this week, Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama announced that the country would institute a new minister focused on corruption. That minister: Diella, an AI-powered chatbot.

Diella, which is Albanian for “Sun,” has been up and running the Albanian government since January of this year, when it launched as a virtual assistant designed to help citizens navigate e-Albania, a digital platform for accessing government services. According to reporting from CNN affiliate A2 at the time of its launch, the chatbot is built on OpenAI's large language model and Microsoft's Azure cloud platform. And while it was initially tasked with helping people interact with government systems, it is now being charged with monitoring for potential corruption within the government.

“Diella, the first cabinet member who is not physically present, but has been virtually created by AI,” Rama said Thursday, according to The Guardian, and will aim to create “a country where public tenders are 100% free of corruption.” The task of awarding government contracts will be taken out of the hands of ministries and entrusted entirely to Diella, which Rama called “the servant of public procurement,” according to Politico.

In its new role, the chatbot will be used to review every proposal made by private companies to fulfill government contracts and assess each bid on its merits. Per Rama, the AI tool will have the ability to award contracts to “talents here from all over the world,” while mitigating “the fear of prejudice and rigidity of the administration.”

Corruption in government contracts is a major issue for Albania, which has been seeking accession into the European Union since 2009. The EU has repeatedly criticized the country for corruption and encouraged it to adopt new rules to help crack down on the problem to solidify its application to become a member state. To its credit, Albania has made progress on that front, passing major legal reforms that led to the removal of many judges and prosecutors with ties to criminal organizations.

Of course, AI is not itself objective or free of bias and is heavily informed by the source information that it is trained on. But it presumably is less likely to succumb to some human temptations, and there is some research to suggest that AI tools can be deployed to help in procurement integrity, fraud detection, and anti-money laundering efforts—though that assumes it is being deployed in a way that doesn't simply serve the interests of those who are deploying it. Power tends to corrupt, so we'll have to see how well data holds up.

Anthropic's recent $1.5 billion settlement could open the floodgates for more publishers to sue AI companies over how they use copyrighted content.

Just this week, the Britannica Group, the parent of Encyclopedia Britannica and the Merriam-Webster dictionary, sued Perplexity. Filed on Wednesday in a New York federal court, the complaint accuses the buzzy AI startup of infringing Britannica's copyright and trademark rights and claims its answer engine is cutting into the publisher's revenue.

Perplexity, founded in 2022, dubs itself as an “AI-powered Swiss Army knife for information discovery and curiosity.” The company recently made headlines in August when it made a $34.5 billion bid to buy Google's Chrome browser.

Perplexity is known for its answer engine, which pulls data from across the web and delivers quick, easy-to-read summaries to users' questions. Britannica says those summaries often lift its content verbatim without permission, diverting readers who might otherwise visit its sites, traffic the company relies on for subscriptions and ad dollars.

“Perplexity claims to be the ‘world's first answer engine,' but the answers they provide to consumers are often Britannica's answers,” Britannica Group CEO Jorge Cauz said in a press release.

This isn't Perplexity's first legal fight. Last year, Rupert Murdoch's Dow Jones, the parent company of The Wall Street Journal and New York Post, accused the startup of illegally copying its work.

However, this new lawsuit lands just weeks after Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle claims it used millions of pirated books to train its Claude chatbot, signaling that lawsuits from publishers could result in a big payout.

Since the rise of AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude, publishers have pushed to make tech firms pay for the use of their content. AI companies depend on published and often copyrighted material like websites, newspapers, journals, and books to train their large language models and answer users' questions.

OpenAI, for example, is still battling a 2023 lawsuit from The New York Times, even as it and Google have struck licensing deals with outlets such as News Corp and Reddit, respectively, to avoid more clashes. Perplexity itself announced in August that it would soon start sharing some of its revenue with publishers whose news articles are used to answer user questions.

Britannica's complaint says Perplexity scraped its sites, copied and republished articles without permission, and even attributed AI-generated hallucinated answers that could damage the brand's reputation. Britannica argues these actions violate both copyright and trademark law.

Additionally, Britannica says that it can create content thanks to the money it makes through subscriptions and advertising revenue. It accuses Perplexity's answer engine of free riding on these investments by “cannibalizing traffic” to its sites.

The company is seeking unspecified monetary damages and a court order barring further use of its content.

Perplexity did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Gizmodo.

Today's retro recreations are so good at replicating the Game Boy's look, feel, and portability. The problem is, my pockets are already occupied with my mobile supercomputer that contains my life behind a 6.3-inch pane of glass. If my phone has a powerful processor and excellent AMOLED display, why can't it also become my gaming device when I'm on the go? MCON, the controller hyped to hell and back by young engineer Josh King and brought to market by phone peripheral makers OhSnap, could be enough to make me leave my handheld at home.

I first saw the $150 MCON phone peripheral back at CES 2025; only it was a very early prototype using 3D-printed parts. Even then, I came away impressed with the collapsible phone controller. I had to duck and weave through many, many halls at IFA 2025 to find the miniscule stall for OhSnap. The company let me wrap my exhausted hands around the new, black and clear plastic MCONs that will be shipping later this year after successful Kickstarter in February.

When I glance back at most modern phone controllers sitting above my desk, whether they're the Backbone, the 8BitDo mobile controller, or a Razer Kishi, I find they all boil down to an Xbox controller split in half to make room for a phone. Some of those devices offer better controls or larger cavities for up to the size of a 13-inch iPad. While they're slim enough to fit in a backpack, the issue with the traditional phone controller design is they can't fit in a pant's pocket. MCON is about the size of a phone itself. It's compact enough that it may fit into cargo pants-sized pockets or into a pocketbook. The collapsible mobile controller also uses a MagSafe magnetic attachment point while it communicates with the phone over Bluetooth, rather than a physical USB-C connection (the company is planning to launch a 2.4Ghz dongle for PC and mobile gaming separately). With the phone and controller together, it likely won't slip into most thin jeans without tearing a hole in your pants.

You can think of MCON as a Nintendo DS or a slide-out PSP Go, though without a screen or PCB (printed circuit board) of its own. With the press of a button, the spring-loaded front plate shoots out to reveal twin thumbsticks, four face buttons, and a D-pad. Two fold-out wings fan out from the base to create a pseudo-controller feel, though you can game without them if you can retreat to your Game Boy glory days, before gaming companies cared a lick for wild concepts like “ergonomics.” The extra benefit of MCON is how it keeps the screen angled up toward your face, like the Game Boy Advance SP's or Nintendo DS' hinged display. This may prove more comfortable when sitting and gaming compared to Steam Deck-like handheld PCs or the Switch 2, where the controls are on the same plane as the screen.

The version I used was a prefab design, though it's the closest model the company had available before the device went into full production. The full-size drift-resistant TMR (tunnel magnetoresistance) joysticks didn't feel constrained despite being deep-set into the controller. While the buttons had a pleasantly shallow and clicky feel, I wouldn't have been able to hear how loud they were in such a crowded convention hall. The real surprise was the two triggers. Despite being so thin and close to the device, they dipped to a surprising depth. I didn't feel as much resistance for each trigger as I may have liked from my favorite controllers, but I would still prefer them over the clicky triggers of many thin, DS-like devices.

I didn't have the time to play anything but Warped Kart Racers, a racing game that automatically accelerates for you. There are many other titles I would want to try with MCON's design. I imagine most people who backed the MCON controller are more interested in games without solid touch controls. It may be an option for cloud gaming when you ha ve access to a strong Wi-Fi connection. What may be more exciting for me personally is how it could be used for retro emulation. The MCON's MagSafe dock can slide out and reposition vertically for playing old-school Game Boy games on emulators, like Delta on iOS.

The pop-out mechanism felt fast and smooth, though I found it was difficult to push the magnetic plate back into place. It took two hands, offering a grating feel as the rail ground against itself. OhSnap told me it was working on making that mechanism smoother as they run into full production. This is the kind of device designed for taking out while ignoring the world on your daily work commute. Such a controller would need to collapse with just one hand and slip it into your pocket when you need to hustle. Hopefully these niggling issues will be ironed out before release. OhSnap said MCON should launch some time late in October, so we'll know then if my phone might finally become the Game Boy I wanted it to be.

If you're a chronic insomniac, you might experience faster declines in memory and thinking skills than your better-sleeping fellows. In other words, your brain might age faster.

In a study published Wednesday in the journal Neurology, researchers revealed that people with chronic insomnia, described as having trouble sleeping at least three days a week for three months or more, were significantly more likely to develop mild cognitive impairment or dementia than their healthy counterparts.

“Insomnia doesn't just affect how you feel the next day—it may also impact your brain health over time,” Diego Carvalho, a Mayo Clinic neurologist and co-author of the study, said in an American Academy of Neurology statement. “We saw faster decline in thinking skills and changes in the brain that suggest chronic insomnia could be an early warning sign or even a contributor to future cognitive problems.”

To clarify, the researchers don't know if insomnia causes brain aging; they just highlight an association. In the study, the team tracked over 2,500 cognitively healthy people with an average age of 70 for an average of 5.6 years. 16% of the participants had chronic insomnia.

14% of the people with chronic insomnia developed mild cognitive impairment or dementia during the study, while only 10% of participants without insomnia developed those same symptoms. After the researchers took into account differences such as high blood pressure, use of sleep medications, age, and a diagnosis of sleep apnea, they revealed that insomniac participants had a 40% greater risk of developing mild cognitive impairment or dementia than those without insomnia. That's equivalent to 3.5 extra years of aging. Their performances in thinking tests also decreased faster.

Of the patients with insomnia, those who reported less sleep than usual in the past two weeks were more likely to get lower cognitive test scores at the beginning of the study, equivalent to being four years older. Furthermore, they had more white matter hyperintensities (potentially damaged brain tissue from small vessel disease) and amyloid plaques (a protein associated with Alzheimer's disease). The buildup of the latter was akin to that in people with a known genetic risk factor.

“Our results suggest that insomnia may affect the brain in different ways, involving not only amyloid plaques, but also small vessels supplying blood to the brain,” Carvalho said. “This reinforces the importance of treating chronic insomnia—not just to improve sleep quality but potentially to protect brain health as we age. Our results also add to a growing body of evidence that sleep isn't just about rest—it's also about brain resilience.”

Participants who claimed to get more sleep than usual in the past two weeks had greater chances of having fewer white matter hyperintensities at the start of the study.

The researchers admit that their results are limited by the fact that the insomnia diagnoses were from medical records that don't indicate the severity of the symptoms or include undiagnosed cases. Nonetheless, the point of the study seems clear enough to me—get enough sleep. And if you can't, get help.

Kioxia is working with Nvidia to build a solid-state drive that would deliver 100 million random IOPS already in 2027, the company said at a news conference earlier this month, Nikkei reports. Nvidia reportedly plans to use a couple of such SSDs — totalling a whopping 200 million IOPS — attached directly to its GPUs to boost AI performance.

""We will proceed with development in accordance with the proposals and requests from Nvidia,"" said Koichi Fukuda, chief technology officer of Kioxia's SSD division.

Kioxia's drives with 100 million random read speeds are projected to use a PCIe 7.0 interface to connect to GPUs in a peer-to-peer mode and will be exclusively designed for use in AI servers that need to access and process vast amounts of data quickly.

Today's high-end solid-state drives can deliver around 3 million 4K random IOPS, but to meet the performance needs of modern and upcoming GPUs — which are optimized for burst memory access — they need to get substantially faster and change the way they interact with NAND media.

Earlier this year, Silicon Motion's CEO Wallace Kou told Tom's Hardware that Nvidia was interested in building SSDs that offer as many as 100 million random IOPS, 33 times more than existing drives can deliver. Around the same time, Kioxia disclosed plans to build XL-Flash-based 'AI SSDs' with over 10 million 512K random read IOPS in the second half of 2026.

AI workloads rely on frequent, small, random reads to retrieve embeddings, model parameters, or database entries. In such cases, 512-byte blocks better represent actual usage patterns than 4KB blocks and provide lower latency. While drives that operate 512B blocks may not deliver the same raw bandwidth as typical SSDs with 4K blocks, it is easier to scale out sequential read/write speeds with multiple drives than to lower the latencies of conventional SSDs.

It remains to be seen whether Kioxia's AI SSD with a 10 million 512K IOPS random performance will materialize in 2026 if Kioxia plans to build drives with a 100 million IOPS random performance in 2027.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

What is interesting is how exactly Kioxia plans to build its 100 million IOPS drive. Its proposed AI SSD is based on XL-Flash, which is SLC NAND memory with high endurance, very low latency, and fairly high performance. Kioxia's XL-Flash devices feature 16 planes (up significantly from 3 to 6 planes on modern 3D NAND devices for client PCs), which points to higher sequential and random performance. As Kioxia does not publish specifications of XL-Flash, it is impossible to judge the per-device performance of this memory type.

Meanwhile, considering that an Innogrit Tacoma-based 400GB XL-Flash SSD with 32 NAND dies (with seven allocated for overprovisioning) and a PCIe 5.0 x4 interface delivers 3.5 million random read IOPS and 0.5 million random write IOPS, we can estimate that each die contributes up to 109,375 random read IOPS and 15,625 random write IOPS—though this calculation comes with some caveats.

Assuming perfect linear scaling across loads of NAND devices, a 100 million 512B IOPS SSD would require 915 of such dies (presuming the same levels of over provisioning). Now that Kioxia knows how to pack 32 NAND ICs into a single package, it can certainly build a drive based on 915 XL-Flash ICs (in 28 packages). Such a drive would require a special controller with at least a PCIe 5.0 x16 host interface (though PCIe 7.0 x4 would be more preferable). The problem is, there is no perfect linear scaling. Real-world performance of NAND devices in SSDs is limited by channel bandwidth, multi‑plane constraints, command pipelining/overheads, queue depth, firmware, and loads of other factors. Hence, the best case scenario for a 100 million 512B IOPS SSD featuring XL-Flash devices is a multi-controller module with dozens of controllers and a switch. Such a solution may well make sense in all-flash arrays, but Kioxia is explicitly talking about an SSD.

Since using traditional 3D NAND memory for a 100 million IOPS SSD with 512B blocks is not exactly feasible, whereas using a brand-new type of media on a commercial data center-grade product is highly unlikely, Kioxia might instead look to emerging technologies that use NAND memory in an unconventional way.

One of such technologies is probably high bandwidth flash (HBF) that packs up to 16 NAND devices and a logic die (a controller?) into a single stack and interconnects them using TSVs and microbumps. While HBF layers still use proven NAND memory cells, they are organized in multiple arrays to achieve a very high level of parallelism and therefore performance. We do not know whether Kioxia plans to use HBF for the project or stick to something similar. However, it is safe to assume that the knowledge it will gain from its experimentation with HBF to build ultra-high-performance SSDs is something the company intends to leverage.

Want more? We've got an exclusive roadmap to the future of high-bandwidth memory — only for subscribers of Tom's Hardware Premium.

SK hynix has completed development of its HBM4 memory and prepared it for high-volume manufacturing of memory stacks, the company said on Friday. HBM4 stacks from SK hynix go beyond specifications set by JEDEC by 25% in terms of performance, though it remains to be seen whether producers of next-generation AI accelerators — such as AMD, Broadcom, or Nvidia — will use that potential on their 2026 products.

SK hynix's HBM4 memory stacks feature a 2,048-bit I/O, doubling the width of the HBM interface for the first time since 2015, and a 10 GT/s data transfer rate, which is 25% higher compared to the official JEDEC standard (more on this later). The company's HBM4 memory stacks use specially designed DRAM dies built using proven 1b-nm (5th Generation 10nm-class) process technology that combines decent performance efficiency with node maturity (i.e., low defect density and variability).

For its HBM4 modules, SK hynix continues to use its proven Advanced Mass Reflow Molded Underfill (MR-MUF) method. In this process, multiple memory chips are placed on a base substrate and bonded together in a single reflow step. Right after that, spaces between the stacked DRAM layers, base die, and substrate are filled with a mold material to secure and protect the structure. Advanced MR-MUF enables the company to keep the height of its 12-Hi HBM stacks within specification and improve heat dissipation of power-hungry memory modules.

 




""Completion of HBM4 development will be a new milestone for the industry,"" Joohwan Cho, Head of HBM Development at SK hynix, who has led the development, said. ""By supplying the product that meets customer needs in performance, power efficiency and reliability in timely manner, the company will fulfill time to market and maintain competitive position.""

Unfortunately, SK hynix does not disclose either how many DRAM layers its HBM4 devices use, or their capacity, though we are likely talking about 12-Hi 36 GB devices that will be used for Nvidia's Rubin data center GPUs, but we are speculating. The company also does not disclose whether its initial HBM4 stacks use 12FFC+ (12nm-class) or N5 (5nm-class) base logic dies produced by TSMC.

Arguably, the most interesting part of SK hynix's announcement is the fact that it decided to go beyond JEDEC's specification and certify its HBM4 stacks for a 10 GT/s data transfer rate, up from the 8 GT/s set by the standard. The company is not alone in going beyond JEDEC spec with HBM4: Micron is currently sampling HBM4 devices with a 9.2 GT/s data transfer rate, whereas Rambus has an HBM4 memory controller capable of 10 GT/s speed. While extra performance may be used by actual chip developers at some point, most developers apparently want to have some reserve for added piece of mind, according to an insight shared by Rambus a few years ago.

SK hynix says that it is ready to mass produce its HBM4 stacks, though it does not disclose when it plans to kick off volume production of HBM4.

""We are unveiling the establishment of the world's first mass production system of HBM4,"" said Justin Kim, President & Head of AI Infra at SK hynix. ""HBM4, a symbolic turning point beyond the AI infrastructure limitations, will be a core product for overcoming technological challenges. We will grow into a full-stack AI memory provider by supplying memory products with the best quality and diverse performance required for the AI era in a timely manner.""

Performance complaints have dominated Borderland 4's PC launch, but with a hefty day-one patch and DLSS in play, the story is more complicated than it might appear.

Borderlands 4 has arrived on PC to a chorus of criticism over performance and stuttering. Just one day after launch, Steam user reviews show as ‘Mixed' as early reports from players described low frame rates and frequent crashes, even on high-end hardware.

“Terrible optimization. Another Unreal Engine 5 casualty. Not worth buying in its current state unless you have a NASA PC,” wrote Steam user 'Rej'. Meanwhile, on X, a player claimed that their RTX 5090 couldn't maintain 60 FPS, even with settings turned down, and other anecdotal reports have echoed complaints of stutter, texture pop-in, and unresponsive controls.

Borderlands 4 cant reach 60 FPS on a freaking RTX 5090 with *THAT* graphics !!! The more I see these type of PC ports, the PC Gaming content creator in me dies bit by bit ! pic.twitter.com/LQT7FeFY2RSeptember 12, 2025

Independent benchmarks back up those anecdotes. DSOGaming's test on a Ryzen 9 7950X3D paired with an RTX 5090 saw frame rates dip to 40-43 FPS at 4K/Badass settings indoors. Enabling DLSS 4 in Quality mode brought the average closer to 60 FPS, but outdoor traversal still produced noticeable stutter.

Criticism has been especially sharp during shootouts, particle-heavy areas, and certain indoor sequences where performance has tanked without warning. Despite this, the game reached a peak of just under 208,000 concurrent players on launch day.

Borderlands 4 officially launched at 12 PM ET for PC players on September 11, with Gearbox deploying a 2.7 GB day-one patch at the same time. But because many players had preloaded the game and jumped in the instant it unlocked on Steam, the update didn't apply automatically. Those players effectively ran the unpatched build, leading to a wave of negative reviews.

In a pre-patch breakdown by PC Gamer, Nick Evanson tested both minimum-spec and top-tier builds. His RTX 5090 and Ryzen 9 9800X3D rig saw around 43 FPS in 4K with “badass” settings and no upscaling. “As you can see, the overall performance isn't great. Hitting 40 fps on average in an indoor environment… is really disappointing,” he wrote, later adding that, “Not long after Borderlands 4 launched on Steam, a 2.7 GB patch appeared…. I can say it stopped most of the crash-to-desktop failures I experienced with my first few runs.""

Even so, Evanson noted that outdoor sequences remained harder to stabilize than indoor ones. Large open areas with lots of AI and particle effects saw higher CPU utilization and sporadic hitching, reinforcing concerns that Unreal Engine 5's heavy reliance on CPU-driven systems like Lumen and Nanite is part of the bottleneck.

While the majority of the game's early reviews were negative, recent reviews paint the game in a more positive light. “The game runs smooth [sic] at 80fps… my rig is RTX 4070 Ti Super and a 13th Gen i9 CPU,” wrote Steam user 'sudobored'.

Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford has been upfront about the challenges that some players might face. In a pre-launch post, he warned that systems below spec — especially those with older GPUs or without SSDs — might see serious issues. The day-one patch “does a lot,” Pitchford said, adding that the expectations of those using a below min-spec machine “should be that the game is unplayable.”

In terms of the specs required, the game's minimum specs, which can “run Borderlands 4 with solid performance on older pc hardware,” and maximum specs, which will “provide the intended experience,” are:

For those still struggling, Gearbox has posted basic troubleshooting guidance, including driver updates and shader cache resets. The company has also posted an Nvidia optimization guide on Steam, the response to which has been pretty emphatic. Steam user ‘PeePeePantsCity' sums up the mood nicely: “No one on PC wants to play at ~60 fps. They didn't buy 3080s or 4080s to play games at 60 fps 1440p.”

Let's talk about night shift tips and tricks. 

The best way to be efficient on night shift is to be prepared. One way you can do that is to make sure that you have food regularly available the whole night. I like to bring many small snacks because I like to have something to nibble on when I'm doing notes or every hour when I'm seeing patients.

When you have a little bit of a sugar rush, it helps you stay alert when you're up at 2:00 AM. It gives you that boost that you need to continue. 

Another hack that I have found that helps the most for me and my energy levels when I am going into the hospital at night is to work out about 2 hours before my shift starts. This is because after a workout, your body's amped up a little bit. You're going to be having natural endorphins and you are going to feel ready to conquer the day. 

If you do that right before your shift, you're going to shower, prepare, and have a large amount of energy ready to go for your night shift. That's a great way to wake up your body right before.

About 1 in 10 veterans with early-stage cancer developed new persistent opioid use after curative‐intent surgery, though less than 1% were diagnosed with opioid use disorder.

“Although a cancer diagnosis, treatment, and associated pain syndromes will require specific pain management strategies,” the authors wrote, “efforts should be taken to mitigate long‐term opioid use and its potential adverse effects in this population. They added that “both system‐level changes that involve preoperative evaluation planning as well as increased knowledge, awareness, and education among providers and patients about the risk of long‐term opioid use can guide strategies for effective and safe pain management.”

The study, led by Marilyn M. Schapira, MD, MPH, Center for Healthcare Evaluation, Research, and Promotion, Corporal Michael J. Crescenz Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Philadelphia, was published online in Cancer.

Opioid prescriptions outside the Veterans Affairs system were not captured. The study was based on filled opioid prescriptions, and actual patient consumption was unknown. Outpatient methadone prescriptions were not included. The study also excluded patients with breast cancer, limiting generalizability.

The study was funded by grant from the Department of Veterans Affairs. One author reported consulting for Moderna and TriNetX. Another author reported consulting for Genetic Chemistry, Thyme Care, Biofourmis, Onc.Al, Credit Suisse, Main Street Health, ConcertAI, Medscape, and G1 Therapeutics. The other authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

A meta-analysis showed no significant differences between JAK inhibitor use and TNF antagonist use in terms of the risk for serious infections or malignant neoplasms in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). However, JAK inhibitor use was associated with a slightly higher risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) than TNF antagonist use.

“[The study] findings support JAK inhibitor use with appropriate patient selection, monitoring, and strategies to optimize disease control,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Virginia Solitano, MD, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Università Vita-Salute San Raffaele in Milan, Italy. It was published online on September 10, 2025, in JAMA Network Open.

The absence of randomization and limited patient data may affect causal inference. Despite subgroup analyses and meta-regression, heterogeneity was not fully accounted for. The median follow-up duration of less than 2 years limited the ability to assess long-term safety, particularly for malignant neoplasms.

The study was supported by the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation. One author was supported by awards from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases and the National Institute on Aging. Another author was supported by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Some authors disclosed receiving personal fees, consulting fees, speaker fees, royalties, advisory board fees, and/or research support/grants from various sources, including AbbVie, Janssen, and Pfizer.

Middle-aged or older adults with a prefrail or frail status had a significantly higher risk for incident dementia than those with a robust status. The risk for dementia rose sharply in participants whose status transitioned from robust to frail over 2 years.

“[The study] findings highlight the importance of monitoring frailty trajectories and suggest that even modest declines in health reserve signal increased vulnerability to cognitive decline,” the authors of the study wrote.

“Assessing frailty progression in middle-aged and older adults serves a dual purpose: It acts as a ‘red flag' for intensified cognitive screening and identifies a key modifiable target for preventative interventions,” they added.

This study was led by Xin Ye, PhD, of the Institute for Global Public Policy at the Fudan University in Shanghai, China. It was published online on September 6, 2025, in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

Dementia was ascertained using different methods across the three cohorts, which may have affected the comparisons. This study could not exclude participants with conditions such as traumatic brain injury or delirium. The included participants were of advanced age, thus the findings may not be generalizable to all age groups or to regions with different healthcare systems.

This study received support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the “Chenguang Program” of the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission and Shanghai Education Development Foundation. The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

Gamification in digital health interventions could be a game changer for smoking cessation, increasing quit rates through enhanced engagement and motivation.

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis found that apps integrating gamification features achieved significantly higher smoking abstinence rates than nongamified interventions.

While cognitive-behavioural therapy and other standard methods often show limited long-term success, mobile health apps with game mechanics provide scalable and personalised tools to support behaviour change.

However, many existing apps lack the interactive features required to sustain interest.

By integrating rewards, competition, and storytelling, gamification can boost motivation, track progress, and foster social support among users.

Malaysian researchers have noted that these strategies are grounded in behavioural frameworks such as self-determination theory and goal setting, which enhance intrinsic motivation and self-confidence.

The analysis, based on 15 randomised controlled trials, showed that gamification-based interventions improved quit outcomes, especially within the first 6 months.

These effects were more pronounced in the short term, particularly within the first 6 months, suggesting that long-term engagement remains a critical challenge.

This decline in effectiveness over time may be attributed to the novelty effect, which diminishes user participation as engagement wanes.

To ensure lasting behavioural change, future interventions must go beyond initial engagement strategies and focus on sustaining motivation and adherence over time.

mHealth platforms, including smartphones, tablets, and wearables, make smoking cessation support more accessible to users. The apps delivered through these platforms showed the strongest benefits for users seeking to quit smoking.

The authors stressed that future interventions must extend beyond short-term engagements. Gamification features that keep users involved and provide adaptive feedback are crucial in this regard.

They concluded that by identifying and optimising the most effective gamification elements, future research can refine intervention designs to maximise the long-term impact.

As digital health innovations continue to evolve, integrating evidence-based gamification strategies presents a unique opportunity to revolutionise smoking cessation efforts, making them more engaging, scalable, and effective.

Moving forward, the power of gamification can be harnessed not only as a tool for short-term success but also as a catalyst for sustained smoking cessation and broader tobacco control efforts.

Sarcopenia affected 59% of children with Crohn's disease (CD) at the diagnosis and increased their risk for clinical relapses within the first year.

""Sarcopenia is well known to affect the quality of life of individuals and their families. Addressing sarcopenia should, therefore, be a therapeutic goal, as its persistence during child­hood may have long-term consequences on growth and devel­opment,"" the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Giulia D'Arcangelo, MD, PhD, Pediatric Gastroenterology and Liver Unit, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy. It was published online on September 05, 2025, in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.

This study was retrospective in nature, and paediatric-specific guidelines for defining sarcopenia were lacking. Its single-centre design may have limited generalisability, and the high prevalence of sarcopenia may have reflected a selection bias.

This study did not receive any specific funding. Two authors reported receiving consultation fees or honorarium in the last 3 years from Nestle and various pharmaceutical companies.

 September 12, 2025  

The popularity of antiobesity drugs known as GLP-1 agonists has exploded in Australia, as in many other countries, in recent years.

One of those drugs, Ozempic (semaglutide), was initially approved and put on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) for the treatment of diabetes in 2018. Last year, the Therapeutic Goods Administration approved Wegovy (semaglutide) and Mounjaro (tirzepatide) for chronic weight management, allowing general practitioners (GPs) to prescribe these medications to patients with obesity or overweight, as well as to patients with weight-related comorbidities.

Administered via injection, GLP-1 agonists promote weight loss by acting on the brain to reduce appetite and increase feelings of satiety while simultaneously slowing down gastric emptying. Experts say that the boom in these medications corresponds with a much greater understanding of obesity.

“Our understanding of obesity has changed enormously over the last 20 years,” Priya Sumithran, MBBS, PhD, head of the Obesity and Metabolic Medicine Group in the Department of Surgery at Monash University in Melbourne, told Medscape Medical News. “We have a greater understanding of how complex its causes are, and that it is not caused by lifestyle habits alone. We also understand more about how excess weight can affect health.”

Earlier this year, a Lancet Commission was set up to establish objective criteria for obesity diagnosis to aid clinical decision-making and improve the prioritization of therapeutic interventions and public health strategies. The Commission recognized that BMI-based measures of obesity can alternately underestimate and overestimate adiposity. It defined clinical obesity “as a condition of illness that, akin to the notion of chronic disease in other medical specialties, directly results from the effect of excess adiposity on the function of organs and tissues.”

In 2022, 66% of adults in Australia were overweight or obese, highlighting the need for more efforts to tackle the epidemic.

But while antiobesity drugs are improving thousands of lives across the country, their high prices mean that many are unable to afford the monthly dose, further deepening health inequities. Available only by private prescription, Mounjaro costs $395 per monthly dose, and Wegovy costs $460 per monthly dose.

Terri-Lynne South, MBBS, a GP and chair of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) specific interest group on obesity, told Medscape Medical News that she supported the drugs' availability on the PBS “because the people who need them the most are the ones who can least afford them. Obesity has greater prevalence in lower socioeconomic status suburbs,” she said.

“We have medicines on the PBS for blood pressure, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, but we don't have a single medication for obesity management, which is a chronic disease. We need to help the people who have the most severe forms of obesity, who need it the most.”

Although these medications can treat obesity, they are not a “silver bullet,” said South. “Losing weight doesn't equal health,” she said. “These medications can help patients to get moving, lose weight, and reduce food noise, but they need to be added onto the bedrock of lifestyle interventions: improving diet and exercise,” she said.

“For my patients, I find those who are getting the best health outcomes have wraparound care and advice on muscle maintenance, physical activity, and how to use the medication as a tool to improve diet.”

South added that she is concerned about patients who are not the target population for these drugs but who, she said, are manipulating online prescription services to access them.

Mark Mellor, MBBS, a specialist GP and founder of Perth Weight Clinic, told Medscape Medical News that he advocates for funded access to treatment for obesity for “those who want and need it.”

The RACGP's expert obesity group has submitted a framework to the government outlining which patients they believe should be eligible for funded access: patients with clinical obesity with three obesity-related impairments or at least one severe obesity impairment.

“There's inequity in access to treatment for people with obesity compared with other diseases because of historic stigma that largely sees it as a choice,” said Mellor. “These are people who need treatment now. They're living with a chronic, systemic illness.”

“But I do believe the government wants to be able to fund it. It recognizes that it's an epidemic and the driving force behind so many other chronic diseases we see. The challenge now is how to fund it. It's very expensive.”

But like South, Mellor cautioned that GLP-1 agonists were only a tool. “These medications should not be prescribed by someone who doesn't understand obesity and wraparound care. Treatment should always be holistic, patient-centered, and delivered with a clinician with access to multidisciplinary care.”

But not all experts agree with the use of antiobesity drugs. While such medications help those who have found it difficult or impossible to lose weight because of their biology, they also cause harm, Emma Beckett, PhD, adjunct senior lecturer in nutrition, dietetics, and food innovation at the University of New South Wales Sydney, told Medscape Medical News.

“They harm all of us because it's making diet culture and fat phobia worse,” she said. “They also harm people who use them to suppress appetite but aren't given the support to improve their diets at the same time, which leads to malnourishment. And they harm the people who can't use them because of costs, side effects, or other health reasons. They will now be judged for not losing weight in the GLP-1 medication era, when everyone else thinks it must be so easy.”

These drugs should be subsidized by the government to improve access “if weight truly is the medical problem that it is framed as under the medical model of overweight and obesity,” Beckett said.

Yet she didn't agree that these drugs necessarily would improve Australians' health. “As more people go on these medications, we will see that weight loss alone doesn't improve health in the way we have been conditioned to think it will,” said Beckett.

Sumithran has coauthored manuscripts with a medical writer provided by Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly and Company and received payment from these companies (to the writer's institution) for speaking and advisory activities. South has received honoraria for educational lectures, advisory boards, and travel to conferences or research from Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Company, Nestlé, iNOVA, and Boehringer. Mellor reported receiving honoraria for speaking and advisory board services from Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Company, and Nestlé Health Sciences. He has a financial interest in Perth Weight Clinic. Beckett reported having no relevant financial relationships.

Fernando  Fuentes, MD

 September 12, 2025  

In 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) revised the hemoglobin cutoff values to improve the detection and classification of anemia in children. For infants aged less than 2 years, the threshold for mild anemia was lowered from 11 g/dL to < 10.5 g/dL.

The change in the hemoglobin cutoff, first studied in Peru and now confirmed in Argentina, led to a significant drop in the prevalence of anemia among young children in both countries.

With rates falling below 40%, childhood anemia may lose its classification as a severe public health problem in Latin American countries. However, continued vigilance and targeted interventions are essential to address this ongoing health burden in the country.

Speaking with Medscape's Spanish edition, Ana María Varea, biochemist and human nutrition specialist at the Instituto de Desarrollo e Investigaciones Pediátricas (IDIP), La Plata, Argentina, said, “The WHO's proposal to lower the cutoff for defining anemia in infants under 2 years led us to ask how this new definition would affect our population, to quantify the change, and to analyze its implications for clinical diagnosis and prevention strategies.”

The research Varea participated in, published in Archivos Argentinos de Pediatría, analyzed 1843 infants aged less than 2 years (median age, 6.74 months; 47.7% girls) who attended the IDIP during 2017-2024.

The results showed that the prevalence of childhood anemia dropped from 46.9% to 25.8% over this period. Approximately 74.4% of infants were aged 6-12 months, the group most affected by mild anemia, which increased from 76.3% of cases in 2011 to 82.2% in 2024. Importantly, no cases of severe anemia (hemoglobin level < 7 g/dL) were recorded. Despite this decline, anemia remains a significant public health issue, affecting 1 in 4 young children in this region.

Varea noted that lowering the cutoff was expected to reduce childhood anemia prevalence in this population. However, she cautioned that even with values below 40%, the condition would still be classified as a moderate public health problem rather than severe, according to the WHO criteria.

“There is a risk that changing the classification will minimize the need for interventions. That 1 in 4 healthy infants under 2 years old, with access to healthcare, still has anemia is a situation requiring immediate action,” she cautioned.

Similar findings have been reported in Peru. Gustavo Gonzales, MD, dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences at Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Lima, Peru, and president of the National Academy of Medicine of Peru, was not part of the team that conducted the study in Argentina. However, he described the study as a valuable and timely contribution.

He highlighted the importance of understanding how the epidemiology of childhood anemia may change depending on the definition used.

In collaboration with another author, Gonzales previously published data from a similar study in Revista Médica Herediana in 2024, focusing on Lima. Their analysis of data from 2012 to 2017 showed that the prevalence of anemia in the metropolitan population declined from 45.4% to 25.5% under the updated WHO thresholds. He noted, “This change should not be interpreted as a health victory but as an opportunity to redefine and improve diagnostic criteria without losing sight of the central goal: protecting neurological, physical, and cognitive development in infants.”

Gonzales also noted that, despite government investments in iron supplementation and food fortification, statistics from Peru and other Latin American countries show only modest progress in controlling childhood anemia in recent decades.

He emphasized that Peru must maintain a critical, evidence-based approach, informed by broader epidemiological evidence, to determine how to respond to the new international thresholds.

“This shift in how we diagnose anemia shows that relying on iron supplementation is no longer the most effective approach. Resources should not be cut but redirected toward improving diagnosis and, most importantly, understanding the underlying causes,” Gonzales added.

Approximately 24.3% of the global population has anemia, with the heaviest burden among pregnant women and infants aged less than 5; iron deficiency accounts for 60% of cases.

Varea urged to strengthen the implementation of proven measures such as early infant iron supplementation, antenatal supplementation, diet diversification, and food fortification, as well as to raise awareness by engaging healthcare professionals and families to improve coverage and adherence. 

Varea warned that falling prevalence could reduce vigilance. She stated that this could result in inadequate iron intake among children. She urged a multifactorial response that addresses socioeconomic conditions, maternal health, dietary quality, infections, and other micronutrients rather than focusing exclusively on iron.

Gonzales is concerned that children who do not need iron supplements are receiving them, putting them at risk for iron overload and related complications. He noted that the WHO's revised thresholds may help reduce this risk.

In his article, he questioned whether, with childhood anemia no longer considered a serious public health problem, routine iron should be administered to infants as young as 4 months or to infants aged 6-59 months without anemia, as required by regulations in some countries.

Gonzales cited data showing that supplementation programs have had only a modest impact despite longstanding government support and highlighted scientific concerns about the potential harm from excess dietary iron.

Gonzales and colleagues noted that “the lack or modest response to iron intervention indicates that iron deficiency is not the primary cause of anemia. The World Health Organization recommends a comprehensive assessment for anemia management. In many low- and middle-income countries, inflammatory anemia is a major contributor.”

Both experts agreed that anemia in infants under 2 years of age remains a serious public health concern and must remain a priority in health policy.

“The decrease in prevalence, with the new cutoff point proposed by the World Health Organization, does not mean that anemia has ceased to be a significant problem,” Varea concluded.

Varea and Gonzales declared having no conflicts of interest.

In a cohort study of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), exposure to certain antibiotics, high-dose steroids, or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) at the start of immunotherapy was associated with poorer overall survival.

The findings suggest that for patients beginning immunotherapy, co-medications “should be monitored carefully,” the authors wrote. More specifically, they suggested that antibiotic choice could be “oriented toward” macrolides or penicillin, while PPIs should be avoided except when necessary for indications such as gastric ulcer.

This study, led by Adrien Rousseau, MD, Thoracic Group and International Center for Thoracic Cancers, Paris-Saclay University, Villejuif, France, was published online in JAMA Network Open.

This study lacked data on hospital medication use and brain metastases. Additionally, the indications for various exposures were unknown, while residual confounding could be present despite adjustment.

The authors did not disclose any funding information. Several authors reported receiving personal fees or having other ties with various sources. Full disclosures are noted in the original article.

Children of parents with diseases of despair (DoD) — including substance use disorder, alcohol-related disease, or suicidal behavior — face nearly double the risk for suicidal events, with exposure to two affected parents or maternal DoD conveying higher risks.

“Improved access to care for parents with DoD and systematic screening and referral of their offspring could help to reduce the adolescent suicide rate,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by David A. Brent, MD, Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in Pittsburgh. It was published online on September 12 in JAMA Network Open.

This study was limited by its focus on individuals with private insurance, which may not be representative of the general US population. The researchers noted that deaths of despair were initially more common among poorer, less educated individuals, suggesting potentially higher rates among those with Medicaid or no insurance. Additionally, the database only captured individuals who received treatment, not all affected persons. This study lacked race and ethnicity data, limiting the ability to examine health disparities, and could not establish whether parents and children were biologically related.

This study received support from the National Institute of Mental Health (grant No. PSO MH115838). Brent disclosed receiving personal fees from UpToDate as editor and eRT for an electronic version of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale, as well as grants from the Pittsburgh Foundation for pilot funds outside the submitted work. Additional disclosures are noted in the original article.

A noted expert on health policy issues, Julie is the author of the critically praised reference book ""Health Care Politics and Policy A to Z,"" now in its third edition.

Oct. 1 is the start of the next fiscal year, and unless Congress reaches agreement on continued spending, big parts of the government could shut down that day. Democrats, whose votes will be needed in the Senate, would like Republicans to extend the Biden-era extra tax credits for Affordable Care Act insurance plans as part of a compromise, but so far Republicans don't seem willing.

Meanwhile, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. released his much-anticipated ""Make America Healthy Again"" blueprint to improve children's health, but the report contained few specifics on how his goals would be reached.

New global data show a dramatic surge in childhood and adolescent diabetes, especially type 2, yet improved care is helping reduce mortality worldwide. 

Study: Analysis of the global burden of diabetes and attributable risk factor in children and adolescents across 204 countries and regions from 1990 to 2021. Image credit: mother_ana/Shutterstock.com

A recent study in Frontiers in Endocrinology examined trends in diabetes among children and adolescents in 204 countries and regions. The incidence of diabetes has sharply increased in children and adolescents, but diabetes-related mortality has declined over time.

Diabetes is a severe chronic condition typically resulting from insulin deficiency. As of 2019, it affected 460 million people worldwide and was the eighth leading cause of death and disability. Forecasts indicate that the number of individuals with diabetes may increase to an alarming 783 million by 2045. This shows the substantial burden that diabetes can impose on the healthcare system.

Diabetes is predominantly classified as type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Recent evidence points to a rising incidence of diabetes among younger individuals. Despite the progress made in prevention strategies, they have not been able to prevent the trend of early onset of diabetes and the rising incidence. To aid in better disease management in the younger population, it is crucial to understand the global epidemiological trends of diabetes in children and adolescents (age less than 20 years).

This study extracted data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database for 204 countries and regions from 1990 to 2021 to examine trends in diabetes among children and adolescents. It also considers diabetes-related mortality and examines the associated risk factors. The GBD 2021 provides extensive mortality, incidence, and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) data.

The Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) is a composite metric of a country's developmental status and is significantly associated with health outcomes. Using its values between 0 (least developed) and 1 (most developed), the countries were categorized into low SDI, low-middle SDI, middle SDI, high-middle SDI, and high SDI regions. The patients were also divided into subgroups by age, namely, 15-19 years, 10 – 14 years, 5 – 9 years, 2 – 4 years, and under 1 year.

Sixty-six specific attributable risk factors were identified, including lead exposure, high consumption of red meat, particulate pollution, extreme temperatures, active and passive smoking, high sodium intake, and others. However, data were available only on three risk factors: elevated fasting blood glucose and high and low temperatures.

Globally, diabetes incidence among children and adolescents has increased by approximately 94% from 25.77 per 100,000 in 1990 to 49.99 per 100,000 in 2021. The incidence of T2D has surpassed that of T1D, and T2D now contributes more to the rising disease burden; despite this, T1D still accounts for a higher mortality rate. Before 2020, the incidence rates were higher in females than in males. Across all five SDI categories, rates increased, with the lowest burden in low SDI regions and the highest in high-middle SDI regions.

Concerning geographical regions, the highest incidence rates were seen in Oceania. The most notable increases were in East Asian Regions, North Africa, and the Middle East. India and China report the highest numbers of diabetes cases at the national level. Pakistan also showed a significant increase in cases between 1990 and 2021.

The diabetes-related death rate among children and adolescents declined from 0.39 per 100,000 in 1990 to 0.31 per 100,000 in 2021. T1D-related deaths were significantly higher than T2D, and the death rates were comparable between males and females. However, whilst T1D mortality declined, the T2D mortality rate rose slightly from 0.06 to 0.08 per 100,000.

High SDI regions recorded the lowest death rates at the SDI level, while low SDI regions carried the highest. Oceania had the highest regional death rate overall, whereas East Asia saw a significant decline. India reported the highest number of deaths, while China showed a marked decrease during the study period.

The overall DALY rate among children and adolescents declined during the study period, from 39.45 per 100,000 in 1990 to 37.83 per 100,000 in 2021. The DALY rate for T2D increased, while that for T1D decreased. Despite this, T1D DALY rates remain higher overall than those of T2D.

The reduction significantly influenced the overall decline in the diabetes DALY rate for females. For males, the DALY rate remained stable. An increase in the diabetes DALY rate was noted only in the high SDI region. In contrast, the low SDI region showed the most pronounced decline in DALY rates. Oceania showed the highest DALY rate, while India not only exhibited the highest total diabetes DALYs but also an increasing trend. Conversely, China's total diabetes DALYs decreased between 1990 and 2021.

The highest diabetes incidence was noted in the 15–19-year-old age group, both across the five SDI regions and globally. In some subgroup analyses, however, the 10-14-year-old age group also showed particularly high incidence rates. For patients under 1 year of age, the mortality and DALY rates for T1D were significantly higher than those of other age groups.

Among the risk factors, the main determinant of diabetes-related mortality and DALYs in children and adolescents is elevated fasting blood glucose. The study also projected, using ARIMA models, that the global incidence of diabetes in children and adolescents will continue to rise over the next 15 years, while mortality is expected to keep declining.

The results show that diabetes-related mortality in children and adolescents has declined over time. However, the marked increase in incidence is alarming and seriously threatens global child and adolescent health.

A key limitation of the current study is data quality, as several countries may have a significantly high number of undiagnosed diabetes cases and may also lack data on risk factors. Furthermore, epidemiological methods could not be used to study the data because the data provided by GBD are aggregate.

New national data reveal that food insecurity worsens long COVID outcomes, but access to nutrition support programs like SNAP could break the cycle.



Study: Long COVID and Food Insecurity in US Adults, 2022-2023. Image Credit: Dmitry Demidovich / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the JAMA Network Open, researchers utilized a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey-based study of United States (US) adults to investigate the associations between food insecurity and the risk of reporting current Long COVID or recovering from it.

Study findings revealed that in participants who had ever had Long COVID, food insecurity was associated with 73% higher odds of having current Long COVID (aOR 1.73) and 30% lower odds of recovery (aOR 0.70; sensitivity analysis aOR 0.76). Encouragingly, participation in food assistance programs like SNAP appeared to attenuate this association, suggesting that addressing food insecurity could be a powerful tool in reducing the burden of Long COVID.

Commonly called ""Long COVID"", post-COVID-19 condition is a recently discovered but globally prevalent condition characterized by COVID-19 symptoms (fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, shortness of breath) that persist or develop three or more months following recovery from the original infection. More than 10% of people who had symptomatic COVID-19 are estimated to experience Long COVID (over 65 million globally), making the identification of modifiable risk factors a ray of hope to millions.

While intensive medical research has focused on the biological mechanisms of the disease, less is known about how social and economic factors (such as poverty and food insecurity) influence the risk and progression of Long COVID. Food insecurity – the lack of reliable access to sufficient, affordable, and nutritious food – is a known risk factor for a host of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease, as it can lead to poor nutrition, chronic stress, and difficulty managing health conditions.

While associations between food insecurity and Long COVID have never formally been investigated, Long COVID is itself a chronic condition, leading researchers to hypothesize that the same food-insecurity pressures driving diabetes and heart disease could make individuals more vulnerable to Long COVID's long-term effects.

The present study aims to address this knowledge gap and inform future public health policy by analyzing data from a large, nationally representative dataset: the 2022–2023 US National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The analysis included 21,631 adults who had previously been infected with COVID-19 and who reported whether they currently had Long COVID or had recovered from it.

The study leveraged the validated 10-item National Center for Health Statistics food insecurity scale to categorize participants into two main cohorts: 1. Food secure, and 2. Food insecure. The primary outcomes of interest were the qualitative measure of whether an individual had ""current Long COVID"" (symptoms lasting three months or more and still present) or had ""recovered from Long COVID"" (a history of Long COVID but no current symptoms).

The study analysis included logistic regression models to calculate the odds of Long COVID as a function of food security status. Regression models were adjusted for confounding sociodemographic variables (age, sex, race/ethnicity, employment status) and preexisting medical conditions (particularly chronic diseases).

Finally, to investigate whether food security initiatives, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), or being unemployed, modified the association, researchers collated and analyzed the results of logistic regressions in the context of these factors.

The present study revealed that food insecurity and Long COVID are statistically linked, with participants in the food-insecure cohort demonstrating a 73% higher likelihood of current Long COVID (aOR 1.73; 95% CI 1.39–2.15) and a 30% lower chance of Long COVID recovery (aOR 0.70; 95% CI 0.54–0.92).

These outcomes suggest that food insecurity simultaneously exacerbates both the risk of ongoing symptoms and reduces the likelihood of recovery. Encouragingly, the study found that social safety nets substantially improved outcomes for food-insecure participants by mitigating the risk of Long COVID and enhancing recovery.

Specifically, while the association between food insecurity and Long COVID was substantial for individuals who were not receiving SNAP benefits (aOR 2.04) and for those who were employed (aOR 2.32), these links were attenuated and not statistically significant in participants receiving SNAP benefits (aOR 1.23) or in unemployed individuals (aOR 1.28).

The interaction between SNAP participation and the outcome was statistically significant (P for interaction = .04), and the interaction with employment status was also significant (P = .04).

A notable dose–response pattern was observed: individuals with more COVID-19 vaccine doses had progressively lower odds of current Long COVID, supporting the model's validity.

The association between food insecurity and Long COVID was present across income strata, and the authors noted that about 40% of food-insecure adults living below the federal poverty level were not enrolled in SNAP, underscoring enrollment barriers.

The present study validates the previously hypothesized link between social (food) insecurity (a modifiable risk factor) and Long COVID outcomes (risks of persistence and recovery). Its findings suggest that the inability to access nutritious food consistently appears to make people more vulnerable to developing persistent symptoms and less likely to recover from them.

Furthermore, as food insecurity worsens Long COVID, the latter's debilitating nature could impair a person's ability to work, exacerbating both conditions and triggering a sinister positive feedback loop.

The study ultimately highlights food assistance programs, such as SNAP, as powerful tools to break this cycle. By mitigating the effects of food insecurity, these programs may serve as a crucial public health intervention against this chronic disease.

However, because this was a cross-sectional survey based on self-reported data, causality cannot be inferred, and the likelihood of relapse over time cannot be determined.

Protecting Indigenous territories in areas of the Amazon rainforest with high levels of forest cover may help reduce the number of cases of several diseases (including malaria and respiratory conditions) in the surrounding areas. The results, from an analysis published in Communications Earth & Environment, highlight the importance of legal protection for Indigenous territories in the Amazon, and the complex role they play in human health.

There are an estimated 2.7 million Indigenous people living in the Amazon, predominantly in Indigenous territories (ITs), which constitute approximately 2.4 million of the roughly 7 million square kilometres the Amazon covers. A growing body of evidence has shown that ITs are linked to decreased deforestation and biodiversity loss, but we do not currently understand the relationship between ITs and human health.

Julia Barreto and colleagues investigated how the number of cases of zoonotic and fire-related diseases between 2000 and 2019 was affected by the presence of ITs, using data from administrative regions in the nine countries the Amazon spans. For each region, their analysis combined the number of cases of 21 diseases, the forest fire rate, the forest cover and fragmentation percentages, and the percentage coverage of ITs. The authors found that the condition of a region's forest was a key factor in how the presence of an IT affected the rates of disease. In regions with more than 45% forest cover containing an IT, there was a reduction in the number of cases of both fire-related diseases (such as pneumonia) and zoonotic diseases (such as malaria). However, for regions with low forest cover or highly fragmented forests, the effect was lessened, or even reversed.

The authors argue that their work shows that ITs may help protect human health in both the IT itself and the surrounding area, but only if high levels of forest cover are maintained. They link this potential protective effect to increased pollution absorption by trees, reduced human-animal contact, and increased biodiversity within ITs. The authors also note that the effect was more pronounced when ITs were legally protected, emphasising the importance both of maintaining Amazonian forests and of protecting Amazonian ITs' legal status.

A new research paper was published in Volume 17, Issue 8 of Aging-US on August 8, 2025, titled ""AI-driven toolset for IPF and aging research associates lung fibrosis with accelerated aging.""

In this study, researchers Fedor Galkin, Shan Chen, Alex Aliper, Alex Zhavoronkov, and Feng Ren from Insilico Medicine used artificial intelligence (AI) to investigate the similarities between idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a severe lung disease, and the aging process. Their findings show that IPF is not simply accelerated aging, but a distinct biological condition shaped by age-related dysfunction. This insight may lead to a new approach in how scientists and clinicians treat this complex disease.

IPF mainly affects individuals over the age of 60. It causes scarring of lung tissue, making it harder to breathe and often leading to respiratory failure. Current treatments can slow the disease but rarely stop or reverse its progression. The researchers used AI to identify shared biological features between aging and fibrosis, finding new potential targets for therapy.

The team developed a ""proteomic aging clock"" based on protein data from more than 55,000 participants in the UK Biobank. This AI-driven tool accurately measured biological age and found that patients with severe COVID-19, who are at increased risk for lung fibrosis, also showed signs of accelerated aging. This suggests that fibrosis leaves a detectable biological trace, supporting the use of aging clocks in studying age-related diseases.

""For aging clock training, we used the UK Biobank collection of 55319 proteomic Olink NPX profiles annotated with age and gender.""

They also developed a custom AI model, ipf-P3GPT, to compare gene activity in aging lungs versus those with IPF. Although some genes were active in both, many showed opposite behavior. In fact, more than half of the shared genes had inverse effects. This means IPF does not just speed up aging but also disrupts the body's normal aging pathways.

The study identified unique molecular signatures that distinguish IPF from normal aging. While both involve inflammation and tissue remodeling, IPF drives more damaging changes to lung structure and repair systems. This difference could guide the development of drugs that specifically target fibrosis without affecting normal aging.

By combining AI with large-scale biological data, the study also introduces a powerful toolset for examining other age-related conditions such as liver and kidney fibrosis. These models may support personalized treatments and expand understanding of the relationships between aging and disease, opening new directions for therapy development.

Women's Soccer

By Charlotte Harpur, Melanie Anzidei and Tamerra Griffin

Twenty-one days ago, Alyssa Thompson scored a critical match-winner against the reigning National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) champions, the Orlando Pride, breaking an eight-match winless drought for Angel City FC. She powered the ball past Brazilian forward Marta with her left arm wrapped in a thick cast, making the feat all the more impressive.

It would prove to be the last on-field action of this current chapter with her hometown club, but the story was far from over.

Thompson's arm is still bound in a cast, but now she is wearing the colors of Chelsea Women's team after signing with the eight-time Women's Super League (WSL) title-holders last week.

Though Thompson is still waiting for final eligibility approval on her cast WSL Football rules state that player safety is the primary consideration, with any protective equipment deemed dangerous not permitted to wear. Non-soft casts are judged for their safety by the match official, who has the final call. However, Chelsea head coach Sonia Bompastor said in a press conference last week that she is hopeful Thompson will be able to play on Sunday against Aston Villa.

It's been a whirlwind past few weeks for the 20-year-old, which says a lot considering her high-profile roots.

The moment Thompson became Angel City's No. 1 pick in the NWSL draft in January 2023 was a wholesome picture.

Then 18 years old, she was sandwiched on a big couch between her two younger sisters, Gisele and Zoe, surrounded by their parents and dozens of friends and family. There was no real sense of mystery over her draft status, and yet Thompson took deep breaths as she awaited the sound of her name.

As soon as NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman read it, she broke into a wide grin and brought her hands to her face. Thompson had foregone Stanford for this, and now her fate was all but sealed with Angel City as the team entered its second season in Los Angeles.

It didn't take long for her sacrifices to pay off. In Thompson's first 11 minutes of regular-season soccer, she scored her team's only goal in a 2-1 loss to Gotham FC in March 2023.

But Thompson's departure from Angel City two years and eight months later was less pristine.

There were lengthy discussions in a clandestine suite inside BMO Stadium, where Angel City plays, that continued across the continent and ocean to England, Thompson's Instagram Story post of a text message screenshot with the reminder not to “let someone rob your happiness,” and tears that fell during a farewell to teammates before the deal was done.

The tense process was one Angel City and the NWSL would have wanted to prevent from happening altogether. It is another U.S. player now unavailable for promotion after a season without strikers Sophia Wilson and Mallory Swanson (both of whom are on maternity leave) and having only recently seen the return of Trinity Rodman.

“We are diligent and fair in our negotiations to ensure that we protect the rights of the league and our clubs and to maintain strong working relationships around the world,” an NWSL spokesperson told The Athletic.

Still, Thompson blazed her path from Los Angeles to London over the past few weeks as determined as she is when she has the ball at her feet.

Turning back is rarely an option for her.

Even as Chelsea navigated injuries to key players like centerback Kadeisha Buchanan, striker Sam Kerr, and centerback Naomi Girma, for whom the club had paid a then-record $1 million in transfer fees to bring over from the San Diego Wave in January, they still enjoyed an unbeaten season and a domestic treble last year.

Not only are those players back this season, but Chelsea continued padding its roster with the likes of Australian fullback Ellie Carpenter from OL Lyonnes and Swiss goalkeeper Livia Peng from Werder Bremen.

Still, compared to Arsenal's £1 million signing of 21-year-old Olivia Smith in July, Chelsea was quiet during the transfer window until the late push for Thompson. They were reluctant to splurge on another record signing, according to sources briefed on the negotiation, and who, like all in this piece, requested to remain anonymous to protect relationships.

But adding Thompson, for just over $1 million, boosts an already winning squad. On the field, she is one of the top wingers in the world, a position Chelsea has been looking to add depth to. Off it, she provides plenty of marketing upside.

Last Friday, Bompastor said during a press conference that the team decided early in the summer transfer window to bring a new winger into the squad. Thompson's versatility as a right-footed winger, who is comfortable playing down the left flank, appealed to Chelsea, but her profile is not a replacement for Lauren James or Mayra Ramirez, who are dealing with injuries. However, winger Guro Reiten's contract expires at the end of this season.

Chelsea had been monitoring Thompson for some time, but it seemed unlikely she would move given she had just signed a three-year contract extension with Angel City in January. Initially, a January transfer for Thompson after the NWSL season concluded seemed more likely, especially since Angel City occupied ninth place in the table, just outside of playoff contention.

Thompson's success in the NWSL and with the USWNT also comes with more attention from sponsors. Alyssa and Gisele were the first high schoolers to sign a name, image and likeness (NIL) deal with Nike and recently became the face of NYX Professional Makeup's “Make Them Look” campaign.

The sisters have been somewhat of a package deal since Gisele signed with Angel City in December 2023, and they excelled at their Los Angeles club. Their rapid success led to Angel City extending both players' contracts in January. And in May, they connected for the first sister-to-sister goal in NWSL history. The sisters, born just 13 months apart, are extremely close and lived together in Los Angeles.

Angel City pushed to keep the younger Thompson stateside, too, offering the 19-year-old a contract extension through 2029, which they announced the same day Alyssa was presented at Chelsea. Alyssa's move gives the sisters an opportunity to step into their own spotlights.

When Thompson's camp realized Chelsea were serious about making a deal and willing to spend seven figures for the forward, talks sped up, according to sources. Thompson leaned on her family for support and even tapped her U.S. national team head coach Emma Hayes for guidance on Chelsea before making a final decision.

“Emma always talks about her experiences at Chelsea in the national team, and just, like, how much she loved it,” Thompson said in an interview with the club. “But when I talked to Emma about coming here, she really wanted to make sure this was the right decision for me. She really supports her players. She was asking me the right questions to really make me understand if I truly wanted to be here or not.”

Thompson added that engaging with Hayes' questions “helped me know in my heart that I actually did want to come here, even though there would be difficult things that I might face.”

Chelsea's winning record also made for a stark reality check between Angel City and Chelsea as the 2027 World Cup looms. Angel City have played in one NWSL playoff game so far, a 1-0 quarterfinal loss against Seattle Reign in 2023, in which Thompson subbed on during the second half. Since Thompson was not named in the USWNT's 2024 Concacaf W Gold Cup roster or the 2024 Summer Olympics, she has very little experience playing knockout stage football for club or country.

The Guardian first reported Chelsea's interest in Thompson on Thursday, Aug. 28. By Monday, three days before the transfer deadline, Thompson's team was at BMO pushing to get the deal through, as Angel City played Bay FC at home. Time was already thinning, and the fact that the talks took place over Labor Day weekend further slowed negotiations, according to sources.

Thompson was absent from the line-up on an excused absence.

The league told The Athletic its “player affairs team works around the clock to ensure we meet US and international deadlines.”

On Tuesday, Thompson shared a message on Instagram, a screenshot of a text advising the recipient not to “let someone rob your happiness.” However, she would soon be on her way to London, where she arrived Thursday morning around 10 a.m. Thompson's agent almost missed his flight from the United States because the permission to fly was given so late; however, he made it.



Angel City did what it could to keep Alyssa, going as far as offering the highest salary the club could manage, according to a source, but it wasn't enough to sway her final decision.

Before she finally left for London on Wednesday night, still waiting to finalize a deal, Thompson left each of her teammates a handwritten note saying goodbye.

The deal went down to the wire. FaceTime calls stretched across time zones as those involved were up until midnight and 1 a.m. local times. On Thursday, with the deadline nearing, the team filmed promotional material at Cobham, Chelsea's training facility, before the deal was finalized, according to sources. Both Angel City and Chelsea declined to comment on the nature of the talks.

Disputes over contractual language weren't resolved until 8 or 9 p.m., mere hours ahead of the 11 p.m. deadline. In the room were Chelsea's head of women's football, Paul Green, and head of player recruitment TJ O'Leary, Thompson's father, uncle and youth coach, as well as her agents from A&V Sports and their commercial team.

As is customary at Chelsea on deadline day, Domino's pizza was ordered, as negotiations continued late into the night.

Thompson and her agent finally signed the transfer papers and confirmed the five-year deal just 30 minutes before the transfer window closed.

 

 

A post shared by Takumi Jeannin (@takumi.jeannin)



The Athletic reported an initial deal valued Thompson's transfer at just under $1.3 million, with other sources later saying the figure is closer to $1.45 million. If all of the contract's add-ons are met, depending on Thompson's and Chelsea's performances over the next five seasons, it will likely raise that total. Angel City announced the move as an NWSL record for an outgoing transfer, surpassing Girma's $1 million.

The heavy investment by Chelsea with their five-year, fully-guaranteed contract is a statement of commitment that the club envisions Thompson as part of their long-term plan.

However, the move is not necessarily a goodbye to Los Angeles, more of a see-you-later.

After all, LA is Thompson's home; it is where her family is, though they plan to make staggered visits to London. With Chelsea, Thompson chose to wear the No. 12 jersey, a quiet nod to the No. 21 she wore with Angel City.

As if scripted by the writers in her hometown of Hollywood, Thompson's Chelsea move means she is returning to the city where she first stepped into the spotlight as a 17-year-old making her national team debut.

On October 7, 2022, the U.S. visited England for a friendly against the recently-crowned European champions England at Wembley Stadium. Ninety thousand fans packed the house for a high-octane meeting between two of the best in the world — and in the 83rd minute, as the U.S. trailed the Lionesses 2-1, Thompson came in as a substitute for Megan Rapinoe. She was and remains the first teenager in USWNT history to make such a high-profile debut.

Even then, her contemplative nature was evident — but equally apparent were the things about which she was certain.

“Since I started playing soccer, this is all I wanted to do,” Thompson, speaking to U.S. Soccer after the game, said. “I'm kind of speechless. Like, it's kind of hitting me now that I just played.”

The rookie made her USWNT debut over the summer.

The United States Women's National Team has been going through what ESPN termed “the most drastic overhaul in the 40-year history” of the program, with Emma Hayes searching for her ideal group. The fullback position remains “anyone's guess,” as the manager has given an opportunity for several players to stake a claim. Lilly Reale is one of the newer additions to the pool, having picked up two starts at the most recent camp. The 22-year-old Gotham FC defender is building a strong rookie season after a sterling collegiate career.

Born in Boston, Massachusetts, Reale competed with South Shore Select and was teammates with Ally Sentnor. At the scholastic level, she played for Hingham High School and amassed 36 goals in her first two seasons before moving to defender while also competing for the basketball team. Her various honors included All-League, All-State, All-Region, and All-American, boosted by regular experience with the national team program.

After initially committing to Boston College, Reale matriculated to the University of California, Los Angeles and opened her collegiate career by starting in 19 matches, being named All-Pac-12 First-Team and Freshman Best XI and All-Freshman First Team by Top Drawer Soccer and College Soccer News, respectively. Her sophomore campaign saw her pick up another 24 appearances and garner first-team All-American, Pac-12 Defender of the Year, and Most Outstanding Defensive Player at the College Cup as the Bruins won the national title. She continued to dominate as a junior by repeating as Pac-12 Defender of the Year and a first-team All-American, despite being upset by UC Irvine in the first round of the NCAA tournament. After training over the summer with Gotham FC and Angel City FC, her time in Westwood ended with another stellar season, compiling a total record of 71-9-7 and receiving Big Ten Defender of the Year, first-team All-Big Ten, and first-team All-American.

Beyond her performance at multiple positions, Reale's leadership helped the program achieve high levels of success. “Lilly only has one volume, which is loud,” said UCLA head coach Margueritte Aozasa. “She's kind of like a coach on the field. She's directing, she's encouraging, she's organizing things, and that's why I think our team really looks to her to be a leader for us... Lilly was just a player that, right away, you notice her potential.”

In January, Reale signed with Gotham on a three-year deal, receiving her debut in the season opener and starting the following week against Orlando Pride. She has made 21 total appearances across all competitions, scored her first goal in a 3-1 victory against the North Carolina Courage, and started as her side claimed the 2025 CONCACAF Champions Cup with a 1-0 win over Tigres. The league named her to the Best XI for the month of April, while the defender has met her stated objective of “adjusting to the speed of play” and “putting forth the most consistent performances.”

“I think it's definitely an adjustment as it always will be, going into the pros,” Reale told the Sports & SHEnanigans podcast. “Playing against and with a lot of my role models growing up – just players I've looked to for so long for little tips and tricks to add to my game – to now play against them in training every day is so much fun… [It's] awesome to pick their brain and understand who they are, not only as a player but also as a person. [That] has been probably the most exciting part for me… The back line that I'm fortunate to work with right now has been awesome.”

At the international level, Reale began appearing with the United States program for the Under-15 team in 2017 and was a member of the side that won the 2022 CONCACAF U-20 Championship before dumping out of the group stage at the ensuing U-20 World Cup. After being included in January's Futures Camp, she played with the Under-23 squad in June's two friendlies against Germany and scored in the opening fixture. Her first senior call-up came during the most recent camp, with her debut cap coming in the first 4-0 win over Ireland; during the 90-minute appearance, her tackle and assist set up Alyssa Thompson for the fourth goal. Hayes utilized her again for the full match in the 3-0 victory against rivals Canada, with Goal describing her as “looking as if she's been playing alongside [Naomi] Girma forever” and “great on the ball.”

Standing at five feet, nine inches tall, Reale is a defender who can deploy at left fullback and centre-back, racking up tackles and clearances every match and looking to beat opponents off the dribble by displaying “great attacking qualities” and accurate crosses. She is praised for being “fearless, physical, capable of contributing on both ends of the field, and [able] to elevate play,” seeking out the ball and “committing high to snuff out attacks early.” Her communication and assertion of control over proceedings have been noted despite her newness to the professional level.

“My tenacity [is my greatest on-field attribute],” said Reale. “Being a defender, you have to be really competitive and gritty. So, in moments where I have to track back or lay a tackle, I feel like I find that competitiveness and channel that. I like to say that I'm a pretty tenacious player… It's something that I definitely pride myself on and try to bring into my game every game that I play. Keeping that up and holding myself to that standard is a big thing.”

Reale finally made her way to the professional level after dominating the college scene and quickly became a key player for her club and entered the national team picture. She has the talent and potential to contribute to the USWNT, as Hayes appears to be intrigued by the rookie. There is a chance for her to seize her spot in the depth chart, with the all-important CONCACAF Championship taking place in November of 2026.

GUADALAJARA, Mexico – World Cup 2026 co-hosts Mexico, Canada and the United States are less than a year away from organizing what is expected to be a transformational tournament. Stateside industry talk has focused on the impact that a World Cup on home soil could have in further developing the sport in the world‘s most commercialized country.

Advertisement

But south of the border in Mexico, where fútbol is already the most popular sport and the domestic league is the most-viewed in the U.S., leading football officials view the World Cup as a runway that could lead to groundbreaking cross-border growth for Liga MX. Foreign investment has already become a factor and is poised to increase in stature, while commercial opportunities could turn Mexico's first division into one of the world's most profitable leagues and leave MLS, a valued partner, behind.

For starters, the door for foreign domestic leagues to play league matches in the U.S. may be swung wide open. Barcelona is hoping to play an official La Liga fixture against Villarreal in Miami this December. Serie A hopes to stage a December match between AC Milan and Como in Perth, Australia. Both remain on hold after a UEFA decision on Thursday to postpone a final ruling on the viability instead of making one as planned. Regardless, it's a concept that is tied to the ongoing globalization of the sport. In Europe, moving matches to the U.S. is not only highly controversial, it borders on blasphemy. That hurdle doesn't exist for North America's foremost league and footballing nation.

Mexico's men's national team plays regularly in the U.S., with crowds that dwarf those of the actual home team. Liga MX is already the domestic league king in its neighboring country. Now, Mexican football wants to take the next step. The novel Leagues Cup, a tournament that pits Mexico's 18 first-division clubs against 18 of the top MLS teams, is merely an appetizer to what could be a gluttonous proposal for Liga MX's top brands.

“We don't understand why a game from a European league is being prioritized when we're the neighbors, and you could call us MLS' partners, through various tournaments including Leagues Cup,” Club América president Santiago Baños told reporters recently. “Why prioritize the Spanish league and not us? If the game between Barcelona and Villarreal is allowed to be played, we will do anything possible to play an official Liga MX match in the United States.”

The most influential voices in Mexican football are not tip-toeing around this. If Liga MX is able to strengthen an already massive footprint in the U.S., that could be viewed as a threat to the development of MLS.

“The opportunity is so big that there are many ways to actually go for it,” Grupo Orlegi chairman Alejandro Irarragorri told The Athletic. “So we can go together (with MLS) or we can go in separate ways.”

Grupo Orlegi owns Club Santos Laguna and Atlas FC, in addition to second-division Spanish side Sporting Gijón. Atlas is up for sale as Orlegi seeks to distance itself from the Mexican tradition of multi-club ownership. Irarragorri, for his part, has long pushed for Liga MX to work closer with its American neighbors. The mutual interests that both leagues have sought to capitalize on outweigh the drawbacks of the partnership.

“I've been discussing this integration, at some point it was called a merger,” Irarragorri said. “I don't think a merger is necessary, but I've discussed it with many owners and particularly with some of my closest MLS owners. I remember saying that in the short term, (Leagues Cup) was maybe better for MLS. In the medium term, maybe it was better for Liga MX. But I truly believe that in the long term this is better for both leagues.”

MLS wants to appeal to the millions of Mexican-American fans in the U.S. and expose its clubs to more competitive matches against Liga MX teams. Club officials in Mexico, along with the Mexican Football Federation, view tournaments against MLS teams as commercially viable brand-building exercises. Leagues Cup, though, has not gained much traction since its launch in 2023.

The tournament is only played in U.S. stadiums, running from late July to late August, when Liga MX sides are at the start of their Apertura tournament. Leagues Cup in its current state doesn't benefit Liga MX – it clearly favors MLS teams.

Liga MX can continue to play friendlies in the U.S. in front of its loyal fanbase. But if the stakes are higher, Mexican football can potentially increase its market share on the other side of the border. Official matches in sold-out U.S. stadiums would put three points on the line in a league where narrow title races are common.

“Globalization used to be innovative. Now it's happening,” said Atlas FC president Aníbal Fájer. “Having this closeness to the States and having all of these fans there, it's something that we have to do.”

Fájer listed Major League Baseball, the NBA, NFL and Formula 1 as Liga MX's primary competitors, though; not MLS.

“They're all coming to play official matches in Mexico. They're building that market and it's growing. That's our competition,” Fájer said.

Added Irarragorri: “The fact of the matter is that we, as Liga MX, have a great market in the U.S. We have followers, we have our fans, we have people who are committed to our league, to our teams, to our history, to our heritage, to our sport. That won't change with Concacaf tournaments, with a Club World Cup or with the (2026) World Cup. That's a great powerhouse for the development of soccer in the U.S.”

Meanwhile, Liga MX president Mikel Arriola told The Athletic in August that a decision to play official Liga MX fixtures in the U.S. “would be made together with MLS.”

There's a championship spirit that runs through the $24 million Academia AGA in Guadalajara. The Atlas training facility, a six-acre venue, features a school, a small Catholic church, men's and women's dorms and the latest in sports science technology. Atlas is still buzzing from the team's back-to-back Liga MX championships in 2021 and 2022.

Those triumphs ended a 70-year title drought that had threatened the club's existence. After over a century of football, Atlas became a dying brand in Liga MX before Grupo Orlegi acquired it in 2019.

Sipping coffee in the open-air complex, Fájer, 35, raises his voice in order to cut through the noise of a heated U-21 match between Atlas and Club América on one of the facility's six pitches. “This is the heart of the club,” he said. “It's our safe place. It's our bunker.”

Later on this day, Fájer would speak in front of a group of the club's most important sponsors at Guadalajara's five-star Grand Fiesta Americana Country Club. “As you know, we've announced the sale of the club,” he said, as he sought to calm concerns. “But we remain focused on the day-to-day. That won't change.”

Fájer is in his 13th year at Orlegi. He has risen through the ranks, having served as its head of business intelligence and working within the organization's mergers and acquisitions division. In short, he knows what a takeover entails. He was heavily involved in the purchase and culture transformation of Atlas. But now, while he remains busy running Atlas, Irarragori is entertaining offers for the club.

“We're really responsibly looking for the best group to take Atlas to where it belongs,” he said. Grupo Orlegi's decision to sell Atlas has reached the highest office in the city.

“When I spoke with (Irarragorri) and was informed of Grupo Orlegi's decision to sell Atlas, I understood the situation,” Governor Pablo Lemus told The Athletic. “However, I raised only one condition: that the team does not leave Guadalajara, because it is truly very important for the people of our city. The only condition I told them was that the team must stay in Guadalajara.”

“Anyone who acquires the team,” Lemus continued, “will not find a fan base as loyal as Atlas's. They will not find the advantages that our city offers, nor a sports center like the one Atlas built, which is world-class.”

The imminent sale of a club with a loyal fanbase and a contemporary training facility could signal a new era for Mexican club football. There's growing interest from foreign investors during a time when private investment has become a trend in world football.

La Liga finalized a deal in 2021 with CVC Capital Partners for a reported $3.2 billion, for example. Clearlake Capital is the majority owner of Premier League side Chelsea, while private equity group Arctos Partners acquired a minority common equity stake in current European champion PSG in 2023.

Those are just a few examples of how global football has become more lucrative than ever. This year was supposed to mark the beginning of a league-wide investment deal between Liga MX, NFL owners and asset management leader Apollo. The deal was scrapped last December after Liga MX owners failed to vote on it, leading to the resignation of the league's former commissioner president, Juan Carlos Rodríguez.

At the time, it was a blow to Liga MX and a reminder that traditional boardroom diplomacy is not always the norm in Mexico. The Apollo deal was expected to not only significantly increase commercial spend in Liga MX, but also spearhead the centralization of the league's media rights. Chivas and Club América, for example, have benefited tremendously from having their own rights packages.

The alternative deal would include all 18 clubs, boosting Liga MX's value and its stronghold in the U.S.

“I think one great generator of information and indicators was the process that we had with Apollo,” Arriola said. “Apollo is now on hold, it didn't fall apart. We have the offer. We have the evaluation. And we have the interest. So what we have to do before that, is to generate a corporate governance reform in the league in order to see the conditions to centralize the TV rights and then decide if we want a 19th partner.”

With Apollo's original offer in limbo, and with the dotted line still blank, competing investment firms have begun to circle. This coincides with the growing interest of foreign ownership in Liga MX.

Atlético San Luis is co-owned by La Liga side Atlético Madrid. Necaxa is partially owned by NX Football USA, led by American businessman Sam Porter and celebrity investor Eva Longoria; Wrexham AFC co-owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney are involved, as well. U.S. based MountainStar Sports Group co-owns FC Juárez.

“I think that the future is becoming a reality today, because Necaxa was sold at two-times (revenue),” Arriola said. “Querétaro five times, to an owner in the U.S. And then we have in parallel an operation with Atlas.”

History was made earlier this year when Querétaro was acquired by Innovatio Capital, becoming the first Liga MX club with majority U.S. ownership. Innovatio Capital founder Marc Spiegel, who is based in Atlanta, first considered acquiring English Championship side Charlton Athletic and a handful of other European clubs.

“That experience really started to crystallize what our investment thesis is, because for us, buying a club that really had no chance to break even from a cash flow perspective wasn't interesting,” Spiegel told The Athletic. “But I'd be lying if I said that we were really focused on Mexico.”

A careful analysis of the North American market convinced Spiegel and his team of investors that Liga MX, and Mexico, were the right fit, after getting past what he described as the initial “allure of being in one of the big five European leagues.”

“(Querétaro) is booming and blossoming into a hub for international business,” Spiegel said. “(Liga MX) teams are profitable. There's a growing interest level. There are opportunities to even make this a borderless transaction between (Mexico and the U.S.). We felt like there wasn't anything that came close to this from a growth and upside perspective.”

“There's so much untapped right now, be it from commercial to media to fan engagement to collaboration with MLS to games in the United States,” he continued. “There's just not one. And looking at the fragmented nature of the media rights deal, it's the biggest league in the world that hasn't centralized. And you've seen the growth that happens with that.”

Spiegel said that Irarragorri was the first Liga MX owner to call him and congratulate him for acquiring Querétaro. The club nearly ceased to exist following a horrendous incident of stadium violence at Estadio La Corregidora in 2022.

The Mexican Football Federation's (FMF) Disciplinary Commission fined Querétaro and issued a one-year stadium ban at La Corregidora. The previous ownership group was banned from Mexican football for five years and the club was placed for sale. Spiegel and Innovatio Capital bought it in July for more than $120 million.

Elsewhere, Grupo Pachuca is reportedly considering selling Club León. The organization also owns CF Pachuca, but its multi-ownership structure led to the expulsion of León from the Club World Cup. That could potentially lead to another foreign-owned Liga MX club, something Spiegel described as “inevitable.”

“The process going on with Atlas, I'd say it's highly likely that it sells to an American or to an American group,” he said. “I think if we're sitting here having a conversation three years from now, I think you'll see two or three more (American-owned clubs). There are just so many parallels.”

“When you talk to people outside of Mexico about Liga MX,” Spiegel added, “You talk to people in Europe, they're like, ‘This is a sleeping giant.' People don't know what this could be. It could be huge. And I think understanding there is quality from a sporting perspective, but also being so tied naturally to the United States from a commercial standpoint.”

Spiegel sees a future where Liga MX and MLS move past their current state, which he called “dating” to a relationship that could change the sport forever. Leagues Cup, he said, is just the tip of the iceberg.

“Do the two leagues merge one day?” Spiegel asked. “I think that could be a game-changer globally in the football space. I think if that happens, you probably have the second biggest league in the world behind England. A lot of things have to happen, but I think that it makes a lot of sense.”

As both MLS and Liga MX consider their own growth strategies, the 2026 World Cup will provide the ideal sales and marketing pitch for both leagues. MLS has made significant strides over the past decade, and the most recent transfer window was a clear indicator of progress. Per MLS, clubs spent nearly $336 million in player acquisitions, a league record.

Despite that milestone, MLS continues to be held back by its distinct financial rules and restrictions. In Mexico, however, the gloves are coming off. With foreign capital now actively flowing through the league and a new media rights deal on the horizon, Liga MX is primed for its own foundational transformation.

Club World Cup windfall and Adidas deal boost Egyptian champions' finances

World Cup Millions Boost Al Ahly's Finances Amid On Field Woes

Egyptian giants Al Ahly confirmed football surplus of EGP 45 million for the 2024 /25 financial year following strong revenues from international participation & commercial deals.

The club's board approved total budget of EGP 8.488 billion (176m dollar) for the year reflecting Al Ahly's growing economic strength.

Much of the surplus came from the team's appearance at the FIFA club World cup which generated close to USD 11m before tax deductions.

Al Ahly also confirmed the renewal of its long term kit partnership with Adidas running from 2026 to 2030. While financial details remain undisclosed, local media reported the deal to be worth USD 11m.

Despite the positive financial news, Al Ahly face challenges on the pitch. With just 1 win in 4 Egyptian Premier League match, the club parted ways with Spanish coach Jose Rivero.a","{'href': 'https://ca.sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'ca.sports.yahoo.com'}","soccer"

EPL

Liam Delap is yet to announce himself properly at Stamford Bridge and, for now, that is how things will stay.

That is not a criticism of Delap. The 22-year-old cannot be accused of dragging his heels: he made his Chelsea debut at the Club World Cup less than two weeks after joining from Ipswich Town, going on to play in six games at the tournament, score once and assist once, and collect his winner's medal.

Advertisement

But that was on the other side of the Atlantic, out of sight of the Stamford Bridge faithful. He has not yet made his new club his own.

He had little chance to do so in a cameo as a substitute against Crystal Palace on the opening weekend, and his next home appearance, against Fulham, lasted less than 15 minutes before he limped off with a hamstring injury. The Athletic reported on Tuesday that the England international does not need surgery, but Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca told reporters on Friday that the centre-forward is expected to be out for 10-12 weeks, so has “a long way to go” in his rehabilitation.



The timing is cruel.

Delap has waited for his opportunity with a top club: he watched his former Manchester City academy team-mate Cole Palmer competing for European qualification while he was shouldering the goalscoring burden in an Ipswich team bound for relegation. After standing out with 12 Premier League goals last term, his first season in the top flight, he was courted by numerous Premier League teams and took on the mantle of starting centre-forward at one of the country's biggest clubs.

At Chelsea, Delap was hoping to spend the coming weeks learning the ropes of Champions League football. Instead, the most valuable lesson his new club can teach him is patience.

“He will be desperate, no doubt, to push that process and get back as soon as possible,” says former Watford, Reading, and Norwich City physiotherapist Luke Anthony. “But with a hamstring, if you get that wrong and (the player) re-injures, then you're looking at missing another two or three months.”



There are particular risks around Delap's potential for re-injury. As Anthony explains, young players who have not previously experienced a certain type of injury — such as a hamstring tear — might be lulled into a false sense of security that draws them back to action too soon. Delap has no recorded history of hamstring or soft-tissue problems, making this new territory.

“Once you're about three-quarters of the way through the process, you should feel good and feel like you're back to normal,” says Anthony. “But (young players) maybe don't have that experience to say: ‘Actually, I understand that I've got to get this last bit of work done, I've got to really cross the T's, dot the I's, before I get back into it'.

“That's where the staff around the process, medical staff, mostly the coaching staff, performance staff, and the manager, are key to making sure you manage that process dispassionately.

“Injuries are very emotional things. There's a lot at stake for different people. But if you just go on what the player tells you, then that's only a small part of the picture, and you could well get that wrong.”

Players increasingly understand that it is in their interest to prevent re-injury, Anthony says, with an increased focus on injury history in recruitment processes.

Delap will know the importance of patience — but that does not mean it will be easy to accept. “He has signed for a huge Premier League club, he's going to have a bunch of objectives,” says sports psychologist Dan Abrahams. “He wants to hit the ground running, get in the team, stay in the team, win games.

“Suddenly, because of his injury, all these dreams and goals have been hampered.

“This is where a multidisciplinary team is so important. This is where the sports psychologist gets involved with the medical team, because the team can help Delay see and understand the medical evidence, so that they can weave an effective story.

“What you're trying to do is help him think rationally about his situation. His brain and body want to send him impatient thoughts: ‘I have to get back and prove myself'. It's trying to help him use his self-talk to weave a story of intelligence, integrity, patience — one that is evidence-driven. ‘I am young, I've got a long career ahead, what I don't want to do is damage this further'.”

Former Liverpool physiotherapist Andy Renshaw says winning a player's trust in the rehabilitation process is key.

“You can do that by explaining it and giving them a little bit of education: 'There's our table of these injuries in the past, that's how long they've been',"" he says. ""Have you got anyone else — any of your friends or any other players that you know — who have been through this injury that you'd want to speak to? Just give them the benefit of experience from other people they might trust.”

To that end, the Chelsea forward could speak to his father, Rory, whose 19-year professional career took in spells at seven clubs. Delap Snr has plenty of experience with injuries striking at inopportune moments.

An ankle problem ruled him out of Southampton's appearance at the 2003 FA Cup final. On his home debut for Stoke City on loan in October 2006 — against parent club Sunderland — he broke his leg in two places, ruling him out for the rest of the season. His son is not facing anything like that length of layoff, but the two can empathise over the disappointment of an injury derailing their chance to hit the ground running.

After returning to Stoke in the 2007-08 season, Rory Delap went on to play for the club until 2013, helping them reach and stay in the Premier League.

The Chelsea forward has had his own setbacks to draw upon. He dealt with ankle ligament problems at Manchester City in the 2021-22 season and a knee injury while on loan at Hull in 2023-24. He then remained fit throughout his Premier League campaign with Ipswich.

“I've managed to focus and work hard and, importantly, not rush things,” he told The National in 2022 after suffering that ankle ligament issue at City. “I am still so young and had to make sure the injuries healed properly so there are no issues later in my career. Patience has obviously been key.""

“Talent development pathways are becoming quite sophisticated,” adds Abrahams. “They know that roadblocks and speed bumps — challenging times put in the way of young players — are important. No doubt he's had tough moments where he's had to weave a narrative when it's been challenging to do so.”

Delap's situation is far from ideal, but he has the chance to use this setback to create a potent narrative of resilience.

Posted on 12th September 2025

One of the leading candidates to be New York City's next mayor has started a petition against FIFA's plans to use surge or dynamic pricing at next year's World Cup.

Zohran Mamdani, currently leading the race to become the next mayor of New York City, has launched a “Game Over Greed” campaign that is calling on the global game's governing body to drop its plans to use dynamic pricing for next summer's World Cup.

Surge pricing models can lead to significant price increases depending on demand – and the FSA has previously spoken out against its use in football, with FSA chair Tom Greatrex speaking to MPs in Parliament in February 2025.

Senior FIFA sources have said, according to reports from The Athletic this week, that prices start at $60 for the cheapest group-stage seats and range up to $6,730 for the most expensive non-corporate tickets for the final.

Now Mamdani is calling for an end to its implementation at the World Cup along with a cap on ticket resales and 15% of match tickets set aside for local residents at a discounted rate.

“People across this, across this country, across the world are fed up with a model of ticket pricing that views fans as a commodity that can be priced higher and higher and higher.” https://t.co/uN0knBFsWJ

— Zohran Kwame Mamdani (@ZohranKMamdani) September 10, 2025



Mamdani's petition says: “The FIFA World Cup is coming to New York City next year. It's an incredible opportunity for economic growth and community spirit in our city — but only if working-class New Yorkers can actually attend the matches.

“This year, for the first time, FIFA is using dynamic pricing for ticket sales. They can raise prices, in real time, depending on how much profit they think they can make off us. Those tickets can then be resold on an official FIFA platform with NO price cap — yet another method of gatekeeping the game. And to make matters worse, unlike for the past three World Cups, there are no seats set aside for local residents.

“The biggest sporting event in the world is happening in our backyard and the vast majority of New Yorkers won't be able to see it.”

Last autumn the FSA submitted evidence to Parliamentary investigations into the use of surge pricing in the sporting and cultural sectors.

FSA Tom Greatrex said: “Dynamic pricing models are just the latest way in which some are determined to exploit the loyalty of football supporters, without any recognition of the downsides on atmosphere, occasion and attendance, that are an integral part of what makes elite football so marketable.

“It is only a couple of years since clubs and owners said football without fans is nothing – this approach risks pricing out the fans whose loyalty, passion and commitment is part of the ‘product' sold around the world.”

The World Cup is a generational opportunity for many fans and every effort should be made to keep it as accessible as possible so we welcome Mamdani's political intervention.

In the meantime our Free Lions Fans' Embassy team will continue their preparations for the tournament as they ready themselves to help supporters over the largest – and possibly most expensive – World Cup to date.

Thomas Concannon from our Free Lions Fans' Embassy team said: “Dynamic pricing is yet another major challenge for supporters who wish to attend the World Cup.

“Official participating nation allocations often don't satisfy demand, meaning many supporters find themselves leaning on the official FIFA sales, and dynamic pricing models could easily scupper any realistic chance people have of being able to afford to attend this tournament.

“The costs will already be through the roof, with this being such a widespread tournament in terms of travel, the biggest in history. Hotel prices in host cities are already way above and beyond standard pricing.

“Dynamic pricing might be standard practice at sporting events in the US, but it is certainly not a standard practice on the world stage, and this is supposed to be a tournament for the world.

“We fear the unique atmosphere that football produces worldwide will not make an appearance at this tournament at many games due to the supporters who would normally be there to create it being priced out by this latest money grab.”

From reducing ticket prices to increasing FA Cup final allocations – if we stand together, we can win together. Strength comes in numbers.

DALLAS — More than 1.5 million people in 210 different countries signed up in the first 24 hours of the Visa Presale Draw, according to FIFA. 

FIFA officials said most of the applications came from the United States, Mexico and Canada, which makes sense given they will jointly host the 2026 World Cup next summer. The highest sign-ups after that included Argentina, Colombia, Brazil, England, Spain, Portugal and Germany.

“The large number of entries submitted is a testament to the huge amount of excitement sparked across the globe by the FIFA World Cup 26 and the extent to which it's set to become a watershed in football history,” said FIFA World Cup 26 Chief Operating Officer, Heimo Schirgi.

The Visa Presale Draw will continue to be open until Sept. 19, so that 1.5 million figure should continue to grow. FIFA says it will randomly select applicants and notify them starting Sept. 29, giving them a date and time slot to purchase tickets (subject to availability), with time slots starting from Oct. 1.

It's not clear how many applicants from the Presale Draw will be selected. Each successful applicant will be able to purchase up to four tickets per match for up to 10 matches, capping each applicant at 40 for the tournament.

FIFA is hosting two more ticket draws in late October and mid-December. Tickets will go on sale again closer to the tournament in 2026 “on a first-come, first-served basis,” according to FIFA. FIFA also said it will start an official resale platform.

With demand being seemingly this high, getting your hands on tickets might seem fleeting. While tickets for all 104 matches will be put on sale, receiving a timeslot does not guarantee tickets will be available.

Here's a breakdown at how many will be available for the entire tournament: 

Tickets available for the entire World Cup: ~7.01 million

Ticket prices for next year's World Cup will range initially from $60 for group-stage matches to $6,730 for the final, but could change as soccer's top event adopts dynamic pricing for the first time.

The prices are up from a range of $25 to $475 for the 1994 tournament in the United States and for the U.S. dollar equivalent $69 to $1,607 when ticket details were announced for the 2022 tournament in Qatar.

Ryan Smart

FIFA have officially imposed two 3-0 forfeits in World Cup qualifying after a failed appeal.

Qualifying for the 2026 tournament, which takes place in the United States, Canada and Mexico, is at different stages across the six continents.

Various controversies have taken place, particularly in the African and Asian sections.

Advert

In Asia, Pakistan were briefly suspended by FIFA for governmental interference, while Congo were banned for a similar reason in African qualifying.

The latter's first round group also included Eritrea, who pulled out before qualifying even began due to reported government concerns that players would attempt to flee in exile during away matches.

In Group H, meanwhile, Equatorial Guinea were among the favourites to progress from a group that also featured Liberia, Tunisia, Namibia, Malawi and Sao Tome and Principe.

They recorded crucial 1-0 wins over both Namibia and Liberia in November 2023, which would have seen them qualify for the second round as group runners-up.

But six months on, FIFA awarded a pair of 3-0 forfeit wins to their opponents, citing an ineligible player that had appeared in both matches.

That player was former Middlesbrough and Birmingham forward Emilio Nsue, who scored the winning goal in both games.

Advert

He was given a six-month ban from international football by FIFA.

What was unusual about the case is that Nsue, rather than having made his international debut in those two fixtures, is actually Equatorial Guinea's all-time top scorer, with 22 goals.

The row stemmed from the fact that the Mallorca-born forward had played for Spain's various junior sides at youth level.

His final match for Spain's U21 side was in 2011, with FIFA concluding in 2013 that he had not been formerly cleared to play for Equatorial Guinea after he was deemed ineligible to play in two 2014 World Cup qualifiers.

Advert

The African nation's governing body, Feguifut, lodged a second eligibility request for Nsue earlier this year, which FIFA accepted in March.

Feguifut successfully proved that any person born to a mother or father from the country is automatically an Equatoguinean, with Nsue cleared to play.

Subsequently, an appeal was lodged to win back the six points that Equatorial Guinea had been forced to forfeit earlier in the qualifying campaign.

Advert

However, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) have now formally rejected the appeal, due to the governing body not including the Namibian FA and Liberian FA in its appeal.

As a result, the two 3-0 forfeits imposed by FIFA remain in the record books.

Had Equatorial Guinea been successful, Namibia would have dropped out of the second round of qualifying.

CAS' verdict, which was delivered on July 28 but was only made public on Thursday, as per BBC Sport, reads: ""Since the appeal is directed solely at FIFA and does not name the NFA and LFA as co-respondents, the panel concludes that the appeal must be dismissed.""

FIFA had argued that their punishment was 'lenient' on the African nation as they could have excluded them from World Cup qualifying due to the seriousness of the breaches.

Don't you cry, El Salvador fans. Thanks to Guns N'Roses, the men's national team will now have its fun and (very crucial) games at the country's main stadium. 

El Salvador will now play its two World Cup qualifying matches in October at Estadio Cuscatlán after the band agreed to move its forthcoming concert to another venue. 

Concert organizers confirmed that the band's October 4 concert will now be at Estadio Nacional Jorge ""El Mágico"" González to accommodate the games.

The Cuscatlán, El Salvador's largest stadium, is set to host La Selecta's qualifiers against Panama on October 10 and Guatemala on October 14. Officials had cautioned that holding a major concert days before those games would damage the pitch.

El Salvador is vying to reach its first World Cup since 1982 and is in the middle of a qualifying campaign through CONCACAF. The winner of its regional group will directly qualify for the expanded 48-team tournament.

Yamil Bukele, president of El Salvador's Instituto Nacional de los Deportes (INDES), thanked the band and promoters for their cooperation.

""We appreciate the willingness of Guns N' Roses and the organizing team to make this change so that fans of both soccer and music can enjoy world-class events,"" Bukele said in a statement.

More than 1.5 million ticket applications from fans in 210 countries have been received by FIFA within 24 hours of the presale draw for the 2026 World Cup being launched, according to REUTERS. The demand for the tournament “came primarily” from the U.S., Mexico and Canada, followed by Argentina, Colombia, Brazil, England, Spain, Portugal and Germany. Tickets will start at $60, yet dynamic pricing will be in operation during the first phase of ticket sales with fans “paying different prices according to market demand.” Additional ticket sales phases are scheduled to begin in October (REUTERS, 9/11). The CP's Neil Davidson noted the presale, which runs until Sept. 19, is a lottery open to Visa cardholders -- Visa is a FIFA partner -- and the first of several ticket windows ahead of the tournament. The initial bumper numbers come “despite some technical glitches” on the first day of the draw Wednesday, with some applicants facing lengthy waits after getting error messages or being kicked back to where they started from. The pre-sale draw will “involve approximately one million tickets” (CP, 9/11).

FREE ACCESS: REUTERS noted box and suite holders at Mexico City's Azteca stadium, also known as Estadio Banorte, will have “free access to 2026 World Cup matches” after they reached an agreement with FIFA. Under the terms of the long-standing contractual rights, box seat holders -- whose 99-year clause was originally established to help fund the stadium's construction in 1966 -- will be “granted free access to all five matches, including the tournament opener.” The stadium, which will have 90,000 seats after renovations, includes 12,500 individual box spaces. Box and suite holders will “need to register via a dedicated website,” with further details to be announced (REUTERS, 9/11).","{'href': 'https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com', 'title': 'Sports Business Journal'}","soccer"

The Brazil international has yet to unlock his full potential at the Emirates Stadium, and could soon find himself on the fringes of the line up

Just over two years ago, Arsenal welcomed Nottingham Forest to the Emirates Stadium for their first Premier League game of the 2023-24 campaign. After a cagey first 25 minutes, Gabriel Martinelli conjured up the moment of magic his team were crying out for. There didn't look to be much on when the Brazilian picked the ball up on the left flank with two defenders closely tracking him, but he dribbled towards the byline before deceiving them both with an outrageous pirouette backheel pass to Eddie Nketiah, who subsequently shimmied inside and fired low into the net to give the Gunners the lead - with the aid of a slight deflection.

It was an instant assist-of-the-season contender that set Arsenal on their way to a 2-1 victory, a sublime piece of skill that very few players would even dare attempt, but Martinelli has always had that in his locker. The problem is, he hasn't pulled it out consistently enough.

Arsenal are preparing to host Forest again on Saturday, six years on from Martinelli's stunning introduction to English audiences, and he has yet to unlock his full potential. The enigmatic 24-year-old still has the capacity to be a match-winner, but more often than not, he frustrates with his decision-making and execution.

Time is now running out for him to change that. The summer arrivals of Eberechi Eze and Noni Madueke in north London have significantly increased competition in attack, while Leandro Trossard has agreed terms on a new contract, and Martinelli's position will come under serious threat if he continues to fall short with his end product. The former Ituano wonderkid has played a key role in Mikel Arteta's revolution to this point, but Arsenal need a lot more from him if they are to take the next step and get their hands on some major silverware.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Smith, a former world No. 1 and seven-time major champion, went from being one of the game's biggest stars to the face of Adidas when the brand launched the Stan Smith shoe in 1973. With his portrait and signature stamped on the white leather, the sneakers became Adidas' all-time best seller and a pop culture staple across hip hop, celebrity fashion, and today's tenniscore trend.But Stan Smith is more than just a shoe. The film highlights his work as a civil rights and AIDS activist, as well as his lasting impact on the sport as president of the International Tennis Hall of Fame since 2011.To mark the streaming release, Smith, 78, hosted a family-friendly book and sneaker signing at P.C. Richard & Son on the Upper West Side, followed by a special screening at the Seaport Racquet Club—an immersive pop-up created with Racquet Magazine—during the US Open. The event featured a panel with Smith, director Danny Lee, and author Mark Mathabane, whom Smith famously helped escape apartheid South Africa with a tennis scholarship in 1978.

F1 Drivers Vote For The Best Bromance | The 2025 F1 Yearbook

Getting to know... Franco Colapinto 

Lewis Hamilton has given his take on Cadillac's driver line-up for 2026, with his former team mate Valtteri Bottas set to partner Sergio Perez.

Lewis Hamilton believes that Cadillac have “chosen the right guys” after selecting Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez as their drivers for 2026, with the seven-time World Champion admitting that he still misses working with former team mate Bottas.

Just prior to the second half of the campaign getting underway, it was confirmed that Cadillac will run the veteran pair as their line-up for the team's maiden season next year, meaning that both drivers are making a comeback to the grid after spending 2025 on the sidelines.

The news was met with positive reactions from several drivers – including Perez's former Red Bull team mate Max Verstappen – and Hamilton has also welcomed the return of Bottas, who he raced alongside at Mercedes between 2017 and 2021.

When asked what sort of a driver Cadillac are getting, Hamilton responded: “I don't need to say anything about his talent because he's shown that throughout his career.

“But [they're] getting one of the most honest, probably the funniest, Finns I would imagine, and just the most genuine person to work with. I miss working with him.

“I think they've chosen the right guys. Obviously, we'll see with Sergio as well, he's got great experience. That knowledge that they both bring from two great teams will help them progress faster.”

Bottas and Perez indeed bring with them a wealth of experience, sharing a total of 527 Grand Prix starts and 16 Grand Prix wins between them.

Pushed on whether he feels it is a good decision to have two experienced names back in the sport, Hamilton reflected: “I think so. I think we have a good mix on the grid.

“I think it's amazing to have an extra team, and I think for a team to be able to develop, you have to have drivers who have experience, especially when it's a brand new team.

“You've got two different flavours coming from Red Bull and Mercedes with different knowledge and experience that they'll both be able to put into the pot and help the team move forward faster.”

F1 Drivers Vote For The Best Bromance | The 2025 F1 Yearbook

Getting to know... Franco Colapinto 

IndyCar driver Colton Herta is planning a move to Europe and Formula 2 in 2026, but will it result in a future Cadillac Formula 1 seat?

Cadillac Formula 1 Team CEO Dan Towriss has admitted that the squad's new test driver, Colton Herta, will be taking a “huge risk” with his planned switch from IndyCar to Formula 2 next year, but feels the American has the ingredients to succeed.

Herta, whose Cadillac testing role was announced earlier this month, is an established racer in the United States-based IndyCar Series, having made 116 starts and scored nine victories, 19 podium finishes and 16 pole positions so far.

While Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez will drive for Cadillac in their debut 2026 season and beyond, Herta is aiming to make a case for a future seat – and score valuable points towards a Super Licence – by swapping America for Europe and tackling the F2 feeder series directly below F1.

At the Italian Grand Prix, where Cadillac's chiefs made another visit to the paddock, Towriss explained the reasons behind Herta's upcoming move and noted how racing on the same tracks as F1 – as well as using tyres supplied by Pirelli – are key factors.

“For Colton, this has always been a dream of his, to drive in F1, but to do that, this is the path he had to take,” Towriss told Sky Sports F1. “He has to take a huge risk, a huge amount of risk – no seat is guaranteed. This is F1, so he wants to learn tracks and tyres and show that respect to European open-wheel racing.

“The entitlement model from the US hasn't worked out that well in the past, so we really want to build that body of work, the knowledge that's necessary, to see if he has what it takes to drive in Formula 1.”

Herta has already tested F1 machinery with McLaren and been in a simulator with several teams – Towriss keen to point out that, while results in IndyCar have been mixed, the 25-year-old “excelled” at every opportunity.

“He really is a special talent,” added Towriss. “I think a lot of people look at some of the results in IndyCar and say, ‘Well, he hasn't won a championship, he's not with [multiple champion] Alex Palou'.

“I think as a team owner I would take some responsibility for that; there have been times where there have been troubles on pit lane or strategy didn't work out, but Colton's an immense talent and he really can find speed where others can't.

“I think any time he's had a chance to do a test, whether it was with McLaren, or time that he's been in the sim with Alpine, Red Bull and Sauber, from that standpoint he really has excelled and shown really high potential and promise for an F1 seat.

“Now this is the chance to do it. He's had to choose this path of taking a big risk to not have that guarantee of the seat. He's leaving behind what at this point is very comfortable for him, to choose something that's uncomfortable for him – but no risk, no reward, as they say.”

When he heads to F2, it will not be the first time that Herta has raced in Europe – the California native previously competing on the continent from 2015-16 and spending time as Lando Norris' team mate in the MSA Formula Championship.

F1 Drivers Vote For The Best Bromance | The 2025 F1 Yearbook

Getting to know... Franco Colapinto 

From his Formula 1 debut in Toro Rosso, all the way to announcing his retirement from racing in 2025, here's how F1's very own Honey Badger defined his paddock style throughout his racing career

Daniel Ricciardo has always been one of Formula 1's most magnetic personalities. His career wasn't just about race wins, shoey podiums, and daring overtakes. It was about the joy he carried with him everywhere, the humour he shared in interviews, and the way he made everyone around him feel like part of the show.

That infectious personality extended to his wardrobe. Ricciardo never set out to be a fashion icon, but over time he built a personal style that felt unmistakably his own. It wasn't about trends or approval; it was about wearing what made him happy.

When he first arrived on the grid in 2011 with HRT, his look was what you would expect from a rookie – team kit, hoodies, caps, and sneakers. But even then, his personality occasionally peeked through in brightly coloured trainers or playful hats.

Much like his early driving, there was a spark that hinted at bigger things to come. Fans were quick to notice his charm and cheek, and the nickname “Honey Badger” started circulating, perfectly capturing the blend of fearless aggression and cheeky humour that defined him.

As his career progressed, so did his confidence both on and off the track. By 2014, as a three-time race winner with Red Bull, Ricciardo's style had started to evolve into something more playful. Oversized tees, patterned button-ups, tinted aviators, and his ever-present black Vans shoes became staples. He wasn't dressing to impress anyone but himself, and that authenticity made him stand out in a paddock that could otherwise feel uniform.

1 / 5

His personality extended beyond the racetrack. Fans loved his radio callouts – from funny quips to his spontaneous humour during races – which became just as famous as his overtakes. There were moments like the chaotic 2016 Monaco Grand Prix where his laughter over the radio made headlines, and, of course, the shoeys. Each podium celebration was a joyous statement that sometimes ended in champagne all over the team, and usually over himself too.

He also had a knack for leaning into the culture of wherever the F1 circus landed. Speaking to GQ Australia, Ricciardo said that travel shaped his style more than anything. “The more I travel, the more I recognise I am drawn to the styles of each place. I guess you could say I dress to the setting and go with the flow.”

Nowhere was this more obvious than in Austin, where he embraced his “honorary Texan” status with cowboy boots, Stetson hats, and even arriving at the paddock on horseback in 2022. Other weekends brought different twists, from Western belt buckles to Mexico-inspired sombreros, but, for Daniel, it was always about having fun.

This light-hearted spirit eventually found its way into fashion more deliberately with the birth of his lifestyle label. Ricciardo's first foray came via his RIC3 merchandise, which included 'Enchanté' – a small line of hoodies and tees that felt closer to his own wardrobe than traditional F1 fanwear.

Fans responded immediately – the pieces were wearable, authentic, and reflected Ricciardo's own approach to clothes and style. By January 2023, the line had grown into a separate lifestyle brand, Enchanté, boasting an array of oversized tees, playful graphics, and bold colours.

“It started as a bit of a laugh,” he told GQ Australia, recalling a friend in Monaco who would say “enchanté” instead of cheers. What began as a joke became the perfect encapsulation of Ricciardo's aesthetic.

Enchanté wasn't just for fans. Fellow drivers were often seen sporting the pieces around the paddock or at casual team events. Ricciardo wore the brand himself because it felt right, not for promotion.

“When I'm not in a cowboy get-up or a homespun Bode shirt, I'll be in a hoodie or T-shirt of my own making,” he said to GQ, showing how the brand was as much a reflection of his personal style as it was fanwear.

In his later F1 seasons at McLaren, as Red Bull's reserve driver, and finally during his stint with Racing Bulls, Ricciardo doubled down on comfort and individuality. Oversized tees, slouchy cardigans and easy layering became his signature, with plenty of Enchanté pieces mixed in. Still, he showed he could switch gears when the moment called for it.

At the 2023 Met Gala, his first time at the biggest night in fashion, Ricciardo traded in his hoodies and Vans for a custom suit in black grosgrain ribbon tweed, complete with a sharp waistcoat and jacket. He even slipped a hip flask into his look, which was a typically cheeky touch from the Honey Badger.

Vogue even covered his getting-ready process for the event, a high compliment that highlighted how effortlessly he could step into black-tie while still keeping his bubbly personality front and centre.

By the end of 2024, Ricciardo had stepped away from the grid, and his wardrobe made the transition seamlessly into his post-racing life. Instagram posts throughout 2025 show him at ease: walking along the beach, enjoying coffee runs ay home, and hanging out with those close to him.

Oversized hoodies, relaxed shorts, and his favourite tees (often Enchanté) still dominate the Aussie's wardrobe, and his clothing choices still reflect the same philosophy he's held for years: wear what makes you happy.

When he officially announced his retirement in September 2025, alongside his new role as Ford Racing ambassador, Ricciardo had already settled into a life with fewer schedules and more freedom. “The greatest thing about my days now is not having a schedule,” he reflected with GQ. After years of precise, high-pressure routines, he was enjoying the little things.

And yet, his signature playfulness remains. Speaking to GQ about his long-standing love of baggy tees, he said: “I have been wearing baggy tees for a long time. Maybe I will move from an XL to a M in some scenarios, for a cleaner look. I will be 36 this year, so I might experiment with 36-year-old clothing!”

Ultimately, Ricciardo's story is less about trends or accolades and more about authenticity. He dresses for himself, with a grin that could light up any paddock, a sense of humour, and the same joyous energy that has made him one of Formula 1's most beloved figures from day one. And yes, that cheesy grin is still very much part of the package wherever he goes.

Mark Hughes and Giorgio Piola analyse why conditions were ideal at the 2025 Italian Grand Prix for Max Verstappen to drive “a race of perfection”.

Although Max Verstappen's victory at Monza on Sunday was his third of the season (not including the Spa Sprint event), it was the first time that the RB21 showed a genuine race day pace advantage over McLaren.

We've already seen other tracks at which the Red Bull's good aerodynamic efficiency when running low wing levels, notably Jeddah and Silverstone, has made it competitive. Monza, being a more extreme low-downforce track, was even better-suited to those car traits.

F1 Drivers Vote For The Best Bromance | The 2025 F1 Yearbook

Getting to know... Franco Colapinto 

The first ever F1 ACADEMY rookie test is set to take place on September 17-18.

F1 ACADEMY has today announced that, following substantial global interest, 18 female drivers – all eligible to compete in 2026 – have been carefully selected to take part in the series' first ever rookie test on September 17-18 at Circuito de Navarra.

Taking place alongside official testing, the rookie test has been designed to ensure that the best talent, from an ever-increasing global talent pool of female drivers, is selected to compete in F1 ACADEMY.

With all 18 drivers competing on the same track under identical conditions and equipment, the test offers a fair stage for the rookies to show they deserve a full-time seat or a Wild Card entry for the 2026 season.

On the first day, participants will be immersed within an F1 ACADEMY team during an official test day, where they will observe briefing and engineering sessions.

They will also participate in research-led physical and cognitive assessments delivered by the series' Official Driver Performance & Research Partner, More than Equal, to support their individual development and progression.

The assessments, delivered by More Than Equal, will provide drivers with detailed insights into their performance, including strength, cognition, and endurance, and identify individual areas for growth while contributing to a wider evidence base on female driver performance.

The 2025 F1 ACADEMY grid will also take part in the assessments, with the findings set to inform long-term strategies to better support female drivers at every stage of their careers.

The two-day schedule will conclude with the participating drivers, aged 15-21, getting behind the wheel of F1 ACADEMY machinery with a total of six hours of testing available throughout the day.

Susie Wolff, Managing Director, F1 ACADEMY said: “This is a landmark moment, not just for F1 ACADEMY as a series, but for our sport. Over the past three years, the global female talent pool has grown stronger and more competitive, and our priority is to ensure that we have the best possible drivers competing in F1 ACADEMY.

“With this test, we are providing 18 of the most promising talents with an equitable platform for them to demonstrate that they deserve a seat on an F1 ACADEMY grid.”

Katie Denver, Performance & Talent Development Manager, F1 ACADEMY continued: “This test is more than just a statement of intent; it reflects our deep-rooted commitment to identifying and nurturing the next generation of female talent and strengthening the future talent pipeline.

“Change demands meaningful action, and our mission is to create a clearer, more accessible pipeline that breaks down barriers, and creates a pathway for the most talented to succeed.”

Tom Stanton, CEO, More than Equal, added: “Supporting F1 ACADEMY in delivering important physical and cognitive assessments at this rookie test reflects our shared mission to ensure that the most talented female drivers are given the tools, data, and opportunities they need to succeed.

“By combining research-led insights with real track experience, we are not only helping individual drivers unlock their potential but also building the knowledge base required to strengthen the entire pipeline of female talent in motorsport. This initiative is a landmark moment in creating a level playing field for the next generation.”

F1 Drivers Vote For The Best Bromance | The 2025 F1 Yearbook

Getting to know... Franco Colapinto 

It is not a victory or even a podium finish that Fernando Alonso would choose as his greatest Formula 1 race...

Fernando Alonso has shared the untold story behind what he believes to be his best drive in Formula 1 up to this point, picking out an “anonymous” performance at the Malaysian Grand Prix a decade-and-a-half ago.

Alonso is the most experienced driver on the F1 grid, having made his debut back in 2001 and racked up 417 starts so far – scoring more than 2,300 points, 106 podium finishes, 32 wins, 22 pole positions and two world titles as of the 2025 Italian Grand Prix.

However, rather than any of those successes topping his list of greatest races across that period, the 44-year-old Spaniard would go back to the early-2010s and a particularly challenging Sunday afternoon with Ferrari.

Speaking in an interview with Maaden, a partner of his current team Aston Martin, Alonso instead made reference to the 2010 Malaysian Grand Prix, where race-long gearbox and clutch issues blighted his efforts to recover from 19th on the grid (following a shock Q1 exit amid changeable weather conditions).

“There are many races that people were not maybe aware of,” said Alonso, reasoning why he did not choose one of his legendary wins, such as the 2012 European Grand Prix in Valencia, which saw him charge from 11th to the top step of the podium.

“It was Malaysia, Sepang [in 2010], where I had a problem on the gearshift. The gearbox was broken, semi-broken, the clutch had a problem – the gears went up okay, but not down.

“Around halfway through the race I tried to downshift into Turn 1 and from seventh [gear] I went to only fifth instead of second, so I did Turn 1 in fifth, I lost time, and I realised in the following corner that there was a problem.

“Out of desperation, I tried to blip the throttle on a downshift, because if not I would retire the car in that lap. I blipped the throttle and the downshift went in, so on the next braking point I blipped the throttle four times and four downshifts [happened].

“I communicated to the team, ‘What I'm doing is right or wrong? I will break the gearbox within one lap?' They said, ‘Keep doing what you're doing, the gearbox is safe by doing that'.

“I did like 30 laps like that, so the upshift was okay, then braking I had to brake and, while having the pressure on the brake pedal, I had to blip the throttle a couple of times to do the downshifts that I wanted – obviously synchronising the throttle and the paddle shift.”

An engine failure a couple of laps from the chequered flag left Alonso 13th in the overall classification, without a point to his name, but even today he takes great pride from the performance he was able to deliver while managing so many issues.

“The engineers said [after the race], ‘I don't know [how] you came [up] with that solution that fast, because that could be a solution, but you did it like in 13 or 14 seconds, the second corner after you had a problem',” added Alonso. “I said, ‘I hate losing, I hate retiring the car, I will try everything before accepting that we have to DNF'.

“[It was] completely anonymous, no one will remember that race, but the level of energy that I had to put [into] that race, the level of concentration, focus, and [to] instinctively come out with a solution [to] a problem that was never tested or experienced… I think it was quite a race to remember.”

F1 Drivers Vote For The Best Bromance | The 2025 F1 Yearbook

Getting to know... Franco Colapinto 

Carlos Onoro, manager of Williams Racing's Carlos Sainz, reveals what life is like working alongside his own cousin.

Modern Formula 1 teams are huge companies with hundreds of employees all working hard to try to be the best in the sport. But within these vast organisations there are the teams within a team – the small cadre of people centred around helping each driver perform at their maximum.

In a new series of features, Formula 1.com is delving into those bubbles to gain a greater understanding of the lives of those who work closely with the stars of F1. This week Carlos Onoro, manager of Williams Racing's Carlos Sainz, provides an insight into working with his cousin, his responsibilities, and dealing with the famous ‘silly season'.

Carlos Onoro has known Carlos Sainz his entire life. As his older cousin – Onoro's mother and Carlos Sainz Senior are siblings – Onoro and Sainz have holidayed together, shared Christmas and New Years countless times, and, since 2017, have been travelling the world side-by-side.

Onoro is one of the figures often spotted close to Sainz, in the background of photos or on the world TV feed, through his role as his cousin's manager.

“Other than driving the car, I'm more or less involved in nearly every aspect of the driver's life!” Onoro says.

“My role covers personal stuff like taxes, finances, lawyers – everything that Carlos needs away from the track – and on track, there's the relationship with the team, contracts, sponsorships and just traveling around with him. In this hectic world we live in, I think it´s positive for him to have someone that he knows and he has confidence in.”

Onoro was born into a motorsport family, with his father being a two-time Spanish rally champion and of course Uncle Carlos a motorsport legend (Sainz Senior is a two-time World Rally champion), which meant “even when Carlos [Junior] wasn't yet born, when I was a little kid, we always gathered together to have lunch on Sundays and we'd stop lunch to watch the F1 race start, watching with my uncles and my father.”

He studied business administration and embarked on a career in finance, but remained passionate about motorsport, first attending the Singapore Grand Prix in 2015.

“I fell in love with it,” he beams. “As you can imagine, for someone like me that has always been following the sport closely and watching the races on TV, to be able to get into the paddock with the access that going with a driver gives you and so on, it was insane.”

Sainz was then a rookie with Toro Rosso but at the end of his sophomore season Onoro got a call from his uncle.

“From that day in Singapore we never discussed about working together until December 2016, where I had a first meeting with Senior,” Onoro recalls. “He basically asked me if this was something I would consider. I went home, had a chat with the pillow, and one day later I was sitting down with him and Carlos, and we discussed a little bit how it would work and so on, and went for it.”

It meant a personal relationship suddenly had a business element added onto it.

“You have to be very careful when you're working with family and friends,” Onoro says. “It can be a very thin line. The first thing that we all agreed on was that that line had to be super thick! There was no way that we were going to mix up family business with business stuff. This was a primary objective, and I think we've done a good job at keeping it that way.

“I always say that when we are working, I treat Carlos the same way I used to treat my partners at my previous jobs: same respect, same sort of relationship. Then when we are relaxed back at home in the summer or whenever, I'm his older cousin and we don't talk about business. We can go and play golf or padel or be relaxed and go for dinner and not speak business.”

Onoro and Sainz speak most days and there is a transparency to the relationship.

“Every available moment is good to work together. When we are at the track or travelling, even on an airplane where you have 10 hours, we try to book our seats together precisely to be able to open the laptop and go through the calendar or review things that are pending,” Onoro says.

“We have the confidence to raise our hands when we see something that is not working properly or it's not going as we would like it to go. We are confident to say: we need to change this, we need to look into this. It's a very open relationship and we speak clearly about whatever it is that we need to discuss.

“By now I know what things he likes and what things he doesn't like, and it's also easy for me to translate that to the team. When we are discussing schedules, for example, between FP3 and Quali, no meet-and-greets or distractions are allowed, because it's time that he needs to concentrate or be with his engineers and so on.

“Throughout the years I've learned all the dos and don'ts, and that makes it easier for everyone in the end.”

One of the major elements associated with a manager is their role in Formula 1's 'silly season', when rumours abound about which driver might be moving to which team – and in 2024, it was Sainz who was one of the biggest players in the market.

“It's no secret that it got us a bit by surprise, the same way that it got by surprise 99 per cent of the paddock,” Onoro says of learning that his cousin had lost his Ferrari seat to Lewis Hamilton.

Fortunately the experience of both Onoro and Sainz helped, given prior moves to Renault, McLaren, and then Ferrari.

“It's obviously a difficult moment, because you feel the responsibility of having to put your best efforts into that – trying to find a good contract for Carlos – whilst at the same time you need to keep dealing with the day-to-day things,” Onoro explains.

“So it's extra work, it's long hours and it's a lot of talking on the phone and not sleeping much. It really gets exhausting, but you need to be focused and you need to have a clear head and a clear strategy.

“Senior plays his role in contract negotiations as well; on the day-to-day basis he is not that involved, but when it comes to F1 contracts, I think we do a good job together as a team, and we are always discussing: what's the strategy? Who do we call next? How do we do this? Do we approach this team now or do we wait?

“It's like a game of chess. You are preparing for a move, but you don't really want to make it very obvious. So you need to be careful what pieces you're moving on the chessboard. The moment you start talking to too many people around, then it starts leaking and [the media] get hold of it and then the rumours start going around and the silly season gets going.

“But it's also interesting, and the silly season is always good fun. You hear rumours from here and there. Then you try to understand how much of which one's true, which one's fake, which one is 50-50.”

Onoro and Senior always have Sainz's best interests at heart but the ultimate decision, such as in 2024 when Sauber, Alpine and Williams were prominent suitors for Sainz's services, will always rest with the driver.

“The way I see it, our job is to put on top of the table all the available options for Carlos and then for him to decide,” Onoro says. “Carlos is also part of that process because we keep him updated and discuss strategy together along the way, and obviously we negotiate the best deal possible, but it's for him to take the decision.

“If he wants my opinion as a manager, obviously I'll give him my opinion, but I don't like influencing him too much beyond where my responsibility goes, which is to put the contract on the table. It's his future, it's his career, and he's the one that makes every final call.

“Once the decision is made by the driver, you communicate it to the team, get the paperwork and sign it. The rest is just obviously communicating it in the best way possible to the other contenders or the other teams and then to the public.

“We always try to keep it as professional as possible, trying to not burn any bridges because in this sport you never know what the future holds. We always try to be fair, honest and straightforward with every team. I think we've managed to do that so far.”

Sainz has had plenty of highs throughout his career – Onoro agrees that his swift return and recovery from appendicitis to win in Australia last year was “mind-blowing” – but it is the lesser heralded outcomes at other difficult moments that Onoro says are more rewarding.

“The proudest moments for me are those that people don't see, which normally tend to be when he's struggling a little bit with the car or he's had a couple of bad races,” Onoro says. “I´ve seen him come out of situations where others would have crumbled.

“I think that his mental strength is impressive, and the proudest I felt is when he is capable of digesting those difficult moments and coming back stronger. I have a front seat to see all of that unfolding. This sport is cutthroat and you can easily fall apart if you're not ready for it. And he's very strong mentally.”

Onoro is clearly dedicated to furthering his cousin's career prospects but also has his own life to live, shifting business commitments around spending time with his wife and young child. Nonetheless it is not a career that permits lengthy breaks.

“It's a very demanding job and you always need to be on the phone,” Onoro says. “You always need to be ready. Checking social media as well to learn if there's any news or rumours coming out. You always need to be connected.

“Honestly, I think I'm hooked up to my job 365 days and I'm pretty sure my wife would agree on that! I don't think there's a period of time throughout the year that I fully, fully, fully disconnect for a week.”

As if by comic timing our conversation is briefly interrupted.

“That's the phone ringing! There's obviously moments where you can relax a little bit more, but still you have an eye on your phone, you have an eye on your emails. It's intense. But at the same time, if you love it like I do, it's a pleasure to dedicate your working time to something that you're passionate about and that you enjoy.”

‘Alien: Earth' also joins the charts for its premiere week. 


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


Wednesday stayed at the top of the streaming charts in the second week after season two's premiere, but it wasn't as dominant as it was for its opening frame. FX's Alien: Earth also joined the rankings with its debut on Hulu.


	After logging the second-largest weekly total of 2025, Wednesday fell by about 43 percent for the week of Aug. 11-17 — though it still drew a strong 2.14 billion minutes of watch time in the United States, according to Nielsen. The CTV/CW drama Sullivan's Crossing moved back up the charts a week after its third season debuted on Netflix, logging 1.59 billion minutes for second place overall. KPop Demon Hunters continued its huge summer with 1.02 billion viewing minutes.

Alien: Earth premiered to 464 million minutes of watch time on Hulu for its first two episodes. That was good for seventh place among originals, just behind another debut: Prime Video's spy thriller Butterfly (491 million minutes), starring Daniel Dae Kim. 


	The previous week's second- and third-ranked original series, King of the Hill and The Hunting Wives, swapped spots. The Hunting Wives scored 761 million minutes of watch time for Netflix, while King of the Hill had 714 million minutes for Hulu.


	Nielsen's streaming ratings cover viewing on TV sets only and don't include minutes watched on computers or mobile devices. The ratings only measure U.S. audiences, not those in other countries. The top streaming titles for Aug. 11-17, 2025 are below.

Paramount Sports Entertainment will house Skydance Sports, develop scripted and unscripted programming, as well as interactive games and experiences.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


Paramount wants to carve out a bigger piece of the sports media business, and is creating a new division within the company to help it do so: Paramount Sports Entertainment.


	Jesse Sisgold, the former president and COO of Skydance Media and chairman of Skydance Sports, will lead the new division. 




	The media company, led by CEO David Ellison, says that Paramount Sports Entertainment will produce scripted and unscripted programming for its own platforms as well as third-party media companies and streaming services, while also developing sports-focused interactive games and experiences.

	The division will work with athletes, creators, leagues and brands in the pursuit of that programming and entertainment. The new division will also house Skydance Sports, the joint venture (along with the NFL) that produced films and programming like Prime Video's Air and Netflix's America's Team: The Gambler and His Cowboys.


	Paramount Sports Entertainment is meant to complement CBS Sports, which led by David Berson and is focused on the company's live sports programming and studio shows. That said, the two divisions are expected to collaborate on various projects.


	“We are incredibly excited to expand Paramount's best-in-class sports portfolio with the launch of our new Sports Entertainment division with Jesse at the helm,” Ellison said in a statement. “Blending cutting-edge technology, innovative entertainment, and the power of our media platforms, our goal is to deliver the very best in storytelling while reimagining how fans engage with the sports they love. This division embodies our fan-first philosophy and our dedication to delivering a full spectrum of sports entertainment that engages and inspires fans at every level.”

	











	Sports has solidified itself as a critical building block of modern media. While live sports and shoulder programming are still at the heart of that (just look at the NFL's $111 billion dollar rights deals, or the NBA's $77 billion haul), sports-adjacent programming has emerged as a powerful genre in its own right.


	That includes docuseries that take fans behind the scenes of their favorite teams, leagues or athletes, but also scripted programming with sports at the center. Many athletes have also launched their own production companies, seeking to do more in the entertainment space while leveraging their Rolodexes and knowledge. And of course leagues are fully embracing that content, too, well aware of its ability to drive fandom and engagement.


	And sport-adjacent games remain an undertapped resource. While franchises like Madden and NBA2K still hold cultural resonance, there is clearly room to explore more in that space. Paramount is betting that it can leverage Skydance Games to help it more fully take advantage of that opportunity.

James Hamilton, who created the FBI's Close Protection School before becoming a private security adviser, explains the evolving challenges of threat assessment and mitigation.


							By 

	Gary Baum


Senior Writer


	The Sept. 10 assassination of Charlie Kirk, the influential conservative activist and prominent media personality, at an open-air college event in Utah has reverberated across America. Among those likely reflecting deepest on the killing are other outspoken celebrities whose business is public performance — along with the security experts whose job it is to protect them.


The Hollywood Reporter spoke to James Hamilton, a seasoned adviser to the country's most at-risk individuals, about the evolving challenges of threat assessment and mitigation. The former FBI agent created the bureau's Close Protection School and served on its director's own protective detail before an extended tenure in private practice, first as a key figure at the entertainment industry-favored Gavin de Becker & Associates and, more recently, his own eponymous firm.

	Hamilton, who notes that protection clients often review their existing arrangements following publicized violence, explains that the environment in Utah — a large outdoor venue surrounded by elevated positions — is among the most difficult and costly to secure. “It's eerily familiar to what happened in Butler, Pennsylvania” in July 2024, when Donald Trump was nearly murdered at a rally during the campaign for his second presidential term. “There you had the Secret Service, and they weren't able to stop it.” He observes that Kirk's team intentionally had him positioned under a tent: “It takes away some visual ability.” Still, “technology today allows a mediocre shooter to be highly accurate at long distances.”

	











	Among the complications is determining the allotment of personnel as well as any coordination between private security details and law enforcement agencies. “It's terribly tricky,” he says.


	Assassination attempts are becoming a constant, from the health-care CEO Brian Thompson and Minnesota state lawmakers to the Israeli embassy staffers in Washington, D.C. “People think that this is some watershed moment, but a sniper shot is not new,” Hamilton says, adding, “nothing has changed in my business since Julius Caesar.”


	There are two key contemporary throughlines. One is that the perpetrators typically know in advance where their targets will be. “Charlie Kirk was killed at a public appearance, not on a CVS run on a Sunday morning,” he says. The other is that the weapon is a firearm. “Seventy-one percent of attacks on protected individuals, according to research, are with a gun. There are more guns than people in America.”


	Hamilton remarks that the 1960s saw its own wave of assassinations. Yet this era's social media feedback loop increases the contagion. “There wasn't the same way to express support as there is now — look at the fan fair Luigi [Mangione] got” after being identified as Thompson's killer. “The public sentiment is scary. Right now, we're just in this moment where there will be copycats. People are using violence to speak.”

A manspreading ‘Succession' actor left a Toronto Film Festival audience flustered as his pleated skirt showed far more than his strong calves during a 'Glenrothan' world premiere. 


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


Brian Cox, a proud Scotsman, left little to the imagination Thursday night as he wore a kilt to the world premiere of Glenrothan, his Scotch whisky drama and directorial debut, at the Toronto Film Festival.


	“Is it that bad?” an immodest Cox asked after a filmgoer in the Roy Thomson Hall audience during the post-screening Q&A put up his hand to warn the manspreading Succession actor he was showing on stage far more than sturdy calves as his traditional black tartan pleated skirt unceremoniously lifted.




	“Or that good?” a grinning Cox then asked the audience by now in raucous laughter. “You have to wear the kilt the proper way. The kilt is designed to make you cool and free. And it's a fucking wonderful freedom,” Cox then insisted after finally putting his knees together.

	Cox turned his attention to Glenrothan, his Scottish family drama set in the rural highlands and centering on two estranged brothers who reunite in the land of their birth. Donal, played by Alan Cumming, has returned home from America to see his older and ailing brother Sandy (Cox), only to reopen old wounds and finally reconcile with their shared past to save the family whiskey distillery.


	While arguing he wanted with Glenrothan to tell the story he wanted to tell, unlike other filmmakers in Hollywood who just “cover their ass…or not,” a ruffled Cox then added with another below-the-belt jibe about his kilt fashion.

	











	“What an unfortunate phrase. I'm really sorry about this. I never thought I'd be in this position,” Cox told the TIFF audience apologetically. Still later, when calls of “Your legs! Your legs!” were heard again from the first few rows of the TIFF venue, Cox called out to Glenrothan producer Neil Zeiger in the audience for apparently urging him to dress to kilt for the world premiere. 


	“Whose idea was it to wear these fucking kilts?” Cox cried out with faux outrage. “Certainly not my idea. It was the producer's idea. They always try to fuck you up, at the end of the day. They can be so vengeful sometimes,” he added. 


	“You're probably wearing underpants,” Cox then questioned Zeiger, who was himself wearing a tartan kilt and who nodded in the affirmative. “The kilt is about being free and easy,” Cox then advised, before adding sheepishly: “It's hard not to wear underpants.”  


	The Toronto Film Festival continues through to Sunday.

The author posted several messages addressing a disparaging tweet he wrote about Kirk after his murder.  


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


Stephen King has issued a rare apology for a politically oriented tweet in the wake of Charlie Kirk‘s death.


	King originally posted on X about Kirk in the wake of his assassination: “He advocated stoning gays to death. Just sayin.'” The tweet was in reaction to post by Fox News host Jesse Watters writing, “Charlie Kirk was not a controversial or polarizing figure. Charlie was a PATRIOT.”




	On Friday morning, King reversed course, writing: “I apologize for saying Charlie Kirk advocated stoning gays. What he actually demonstrated was how some people cherry-pick Biblical passages.” And then, in reply to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz calling the author “a horrible, evil, twisted liar,” King wrote, “The horrible, evil, twisted liar apologizes. This is what I get for reading something on Twitter w/o fact-checking. Won't happen again.” King later wrote yet again: “I was wrong, and I apologize. I have deleted the post.”

	The messages come as the long-awaited adaptation of King's 1979 dystopian novel The Long Walk hits theaters. The film is earning rave reviews, generating a 93 percent positive critic average on Rotten Tomatoes.  


	King is the latest media figure with left-wing political views to come under fire for their response to Kirk's assassination following the 31-year-old conservative activist and Turning Point USA co-founder being gunned down during an event at Utah Valley University. 


	Previously, MSNBC political analyst Matthew Dowd was fired for his comments about Kirk where he seemingly blamed the activist for his own murder, saying “hateful words” lead “hateful actions.”

	











	On Friday, the three top executives of NBC and MSNBC's parent companies collectively urged employees to embrace different perspectives, writing in a memo: “You may have seen that MSNBC recently ended its association with a contributor who made an unacceptable and insensitive comment about this horrific event. That coverage was at odds with fostering civil dialogue and being willing to listen to the points of view of those who have differing opinions. We should be able to disagree, robustly and passionately, but, ultimately, with respect. We need to do better.”

The starring pair returns alongside an original cast that helped bring both sex and culture wars back to television this summer when the Rebecca Cutter-created series became a hit for the streamer.


							By 

	Jackie Strause


Managing Editor, East Coast


Netflix is heading back to Texas for another round of The Hunting Wives.


	The sexed-up summer sensation from Lionsgate has been renewed for a second season at the streamer. The original cast led by Brittany Snow and Malin Akerman will reprise their roles.




	“I'm so excited to write these amazing characters again, and I can't wait to take the audience on another sexy, twisted, batshit crazy ride through Maple Brook,” said creator/writer/showrunner Rebecca Cutter.


	Created by Cutter and based on the bestselling novel by May Cobb, The Hunting Wives became a streaming success for Netflix after acquiring the twisty murder drama that was originally produced for Starz, where Cutter had her three-season series Hightown. Producers Lionsgate Television and 3 Arts Entertainment pivoted the series to Netflix in the lead up to Starz's split from Lionsgate in May (which became official this summer). Netflix released The Hunting Wives weeks later, on July 21, and it became the most-viewed streaming series in the U.S. after spending five weeks in the Top 10.

	While the first season was a Netflix U.S. offering, season two will release exclusively as a Netflix branded series in nearly all countries the streamer is available. The returning cast includes Jaime Ray Newman, Dermot Mulroney, Evan Jonigkeit and George Ferrier.


	The success of the buzzy drama also surged sales for Cobb's 2021 besteller. Publisher Berkley has gone back to press twice on the trade paperback since premiere week, and saw a 5,000 percent increase across all formats in year-over-year weekly sales following the show's release, according to Christine Ball, evp & publisher.

	











	When speaking to The Hollywood Reporter about the show's future, while awaiting the renewal, Cutter had detailed how Cobb supported the major changes she made from the book, which set up the series to continue on after a cliffhanger finale that questioned the central relationship between Snow and Akerman's characters — new girl in town Sophie and queen bee Margo, respectively. “Even when it was at Starz, it was never, in my mind, a limited series,” said Cutter of her plan for more Hunting Wives. “From what I gather, doing more than three [seasons] is hard, so three is a great number. But I could do it forever. It's so fun. The girls are so fun. We love it.”


	Cutter also weighed in on The Hunting Wives effect, which included bringing both sex and culture wars back to television by centering the erotic main plot around a conservative clique in East Texas and having a Democrat (Sophie) roll into town. “I've heard some people say that the show is part of this new mandate to make red-state content, and that wasn't what it was. I mean, it was for horny middle-aged women,” she said.


	The second season will be a continuation of the storyline and characters from season one, based on an original script from Cutter. Here's the official logline: “At the start of season two, Sophie and Margo are on the outs. But soon enough, old secrets and new foes force them back together. As they play their dangerous games the question arises. Are they the hunters or the hunted?”


	Snow and Akerman played into the viral viewer reactions (and that cliffhanger ending) when announcing the news on social media Friday. (Watch, below.)

	Erwin Stoff is an executive producer for 3 Arts Entertainment, along with Cobb and Cutter. Cutter's crime drama Hightown is also now streaming on Netflix. She is currently in development on another project for Netflix with Jerry Bruckheimer Television and is repped by CAA, Artists Collective and Jackoway Austen Tyerman Wertheimer Mandelbaum Morris Bernstein Trattner Auerbach Hynick Jaime LeVine Sample & Klein.

The pop artist's long debut LP is purposeful, tender and bold – a declaration of intent that should resonate far beyond her fanbase.


													By
												

	Sophie Williams



	Throughout her solo career, Jade Thirlwall has positioned herself as an awe-struck romantic, her songs capacious enough for both high camp and heartfelt examinations of selfhood and love. On long-awaited debut LP That's Showbiz Baby!, the singer and Little Mix member tackles a flurry of personal contradictions: yearning and rupture, ambition and anxiety, broken promises and intimacy. She knows how to conjure a whole universe of emotion and lose herself in it.


	The album's 14 tracks traverse deep psychological wounds borne from Thirlwall (known mononymously as JADE)'s early days as a returning teenage X Factor contestant, through to the rewards and rigors of her time spent in one of the best-selling U.K. girl groups of all time, in service of pure pop melodrama. The resulting music is precise and introspective, channeling the unexpected, iridescent revelations that come with rebuilding yourself from scratch. 


	Leaping from electroclash and synth-pop to luxurious disco and ambient electronic, That's Showbiz Baby! channels sensuality, anger and freedom, as JADE takes sonic cues from her diva elders Diana Ross, Madonna and Janet Jackson, as well as newer visionaries like Chappell Roan and Billie Eilish. In her pursuit of pop stardom, the singer builds out a distinct, dazzlingly ornate record while honoring those who informed her musical education.  Next month, JADE will embark on her headline U.K. and Ireland tour, having enjoyed a star-cementing turn at Glastonbury Festival in June and also having appeared at Mighty Hoopla and Radio 1's Big Weekend. To celebrate the release of That's Showbiz Baby!, Billboard U.K. dives deep into each and every track on the record. See our ranking of its 14 songs below.






	By pulling from a revolving palette of tones, the thump of the production guides “Headache” forward, offering a backdrop for JADE's musings on her needs and wants in a relationship. Taken over a whole track, however, the track lacks continued dynamism; its twists and turns are overegged as to be almost cloying.


	Over a tightly coiled bass riff, JADE's snappy talk-sing on “IT Girl” feels like an intriguing left-turn for an artist famed for their belting and typically uninhibited vocal rasp. As such, her delivery here veers on becoming monotone – but the beats, squeals, sequencers, and crunches in the production save it from becoming a total dud, while the lyrics righteously eschew broad strokes empowerment in favour of slabs of bravado.


	“Unconditional” initially gains its power from how little is happening: Its zigzagging kick drum gathers momentum the more familiar it becomes, interspersed with a storming guitar riff. When the latter kicks in, the track punches a hole through the haze to let all the feelings come gushing out. Try not to feel your heart skip a beat when JADE enters her upper register during the final chorus.


	The lyrics to “Natural At Disaster” are ready to be prodded and unpacked. Who is she singing about when she calls out a person who is “all snakes no ladders”? Social media will rush to connect the dots between this track's pointed, concise lyrics and JADE's fractured relationship with former bandmate Jesy Nelson, who she is no longer in touch with. Zoom out, though, and digest the ghostly production – all contemplative percussion and vocal yearning.


	On the cutting and vulnerable “FUFN (F–k You for Now”), JADE continually reaches for moments of emotional intensity. At times, the track veers on a hammed-up pastiche of early Lady Gaga, but its stomping, high-octane production provides fertile ground for its author to sift through the hard work of industry burnout and the mental toll it leaves in its wake.


	Every pained admission of desire, security, or dwindling self assurance throughout “Self Saboteur” is compounded by a ripple of keys or a swirling falsetto, allowing the song to swell into something luxurious but still light on its feet. JADE takes us through the bustling streets of her mind, slipping past rainfall and wildfire; it's a trip that's as intoxicating as it is confounding. Her voice is so careful here that it suggests a dam straining to hold back a flood.


	“Glitch” is a song of relief, where articulating what you need can help reclaim a confidence you once believed to be lost forever. “Get out of my head/ Get out of my f–king skin,” JADE coos, as much directed to an ex as to her own demons. Over euphoric icy, arpeggiated synths, her pleas twirl and glide in a state of determination. Her voice, too, sounds different: It's almost inhuman, humming in a rhythmic and robotic pattern.


	JADE doesn't play coy about what she wants from a partner on “Lip Service,” a no-frills standout. The focus is on celebrating sexual versatility with metaphor: primarily juice, and lips that are underworked. She takes her task extremely seriously, playing around with layered harmonies and a pitch-shifted vocal flourish. Pop is a long-explored touchstone for excess and emancipation, an idea that JADE appears to have firmly signed up to.


	The core signifiers of a Robyn classic – tingle-inducing electronic shimmers, gently pulsating synths, a whispery vocal – are all embedded within “Plastic Box,” which, thematically, also follows the Swedish icon's trademark mix of despair and steely determination. Written with Lauren Aquilina, also a keen student of pop's past and present, the track shows a brilliant new shade of melancholy for JADE.


	On “Silent Disco” JADE sings her way through personal challenges with a delicate, bruised strength. She taps into the isolating pursuit of inner peace as the song begins to sound a yearning for release, falling deeper into the connection she shares with the person she holds closest. Towards the end, she flaunts the full extent of her range with whistle notes, highlighting an underappreciated ability to convey different colors with her voice.


	Arguably, “Midnight Cowboy” is a spiritual successor to Jessie Ware's What's Your Pleasure? era, oozing a vintage glow that rubs up against sexy, contemporary-sounding soundscapes. Featuring a blink-and-you'll-miss-it shoutout to former British Vogue editor Edward Enniful, plus an intro from actor Ncuti Gatwa, JADE clambers up and down scales with ease. The intensity of her late-night plea to a lover, sung over a lone, rumbling beat, burns incandescent.


	At times, JADE's skill as a singer is really beside the point – more affecting is that she can hold back and showcase intimacy, while still being capable of blasting down a door with her powerhouse voice. Led by a gleaming Supremes interpolation, “Before You Break My Heart” sees JADE making the most of her Main Pop Girl dreams, as her commitment to both sides of the vocal equation makes this a soulful masterclass.


	The track that made JADE a true Popheads darling (move over for a minute, Carly Rae), “Fantasy” offers ripples of disco-house nostalgia, fuelled by a winsome sincerity and some infectious “ah-ahs”. She reaches heady new heights on this inspired merge of Studio 54 aesthetics and slinky bass that practically demands that you park up by a speaker and give in to its delirious highs.


	With a structure akin to the non-traditional style switch-ups found in Girls Aloud's “Biology” or Lorde's “Green Light” – the type of pop song Max Martin might describe as “incorrect” – this hit is a delicious sensory overload, multiple ideas skilfully woven into one stunning tapestry. Throughout, JADE revisits and exalts past versions of herself; there's a central tension between the limitations she feels have been imposed on her by the major label machine, celebrity and misogyny, and the expansiveness of the love she feels towards her art form. Here, JADE establishes herself as an intelligent, concise songwriter, and a singer of power and clarity.

	Western Australian indie artist John Butler bows at No. 3 with his solo release PRISM (via Jarrah/MGM), the third in a four-part “seasons” project — some six years in the making.

PRISM follows an album of meditations (Running River) and a fully instrumental LP (Still Searching), and was crafted entirely solo, with support from producer James Ireland (POND, San Cisco). “I was channeling Kevin Parker to see if I could do it all myself,” he tells Rolling Stone AU/NZ. “That was fun. I learned a lot about honing my production skills. I was making all the beats and all the synths and all the guitars and kind of create this symphony of sound.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	As band leader of the John Butler Trio, the roots rocker has nine top 50 albums, including ARIA Chart leaders with Sunrise Over Sea (2004), Grand National (2007), April Uprising (2010) and Home (2018).


	Just missing out on a podium finish is G Flip, whose Dream Ride (AWAL) drives in at No. 4. Dream Ride is the multi-instrumentalist's third studio album, and the followup to their 2023 chart leader Drummer. Dream Ride is the week's best-seller on wax, to lead the ARIA Vinyl Chart.

	











	The surprise release of Justin Bieber's Swag II (Def Jam/Universal) refuels Swag, which bounces 20-6 on the new survey, published Friday, Sept. 12. Following its release in July, Swag debuted and peaked at No. 2.


	Talking Heads singer David Byrne lands a new career high as a solo act, as Who Is The Sky? (Matador/Remote Control) debuts at No. 18. That eclipses the No. 47 for My Life In The Bush Of Ghosts, his collaborative effort with Brian Eno, released back in 1981. Talking Heads had five top 20 albums in Australia, topping out No. 2 with Little Creatures in 1985 and True Stories in 1986.


	Meanwhile, U.S. indie rock band Big Thief bag a top 20 appearance with Double Infinity (4AD/Remote Control), new at No. 19.


	At the top of the leaderboard, KPop Demon Hunters (via Republic/Universal) lifts 2-1 for an eighth non-consecutive week at No. 1. The LP leapfrogs Sabrina Carpenter's Man's Best Friend, down 1-2.


	After pulling their music from Spotify, and inviting fans to download their catalog on Bandcamp at whatever price they choose, King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard‘s strategy appears to have paid off with two entries into the top 50. Phantom Island (Virgin/Universal), released in June, returns at No. 39, and Flight b741, from 2024, reenters at No. 48.


KPop Demon Hunters proves impossible to slay, as the soundtrack to the animated Netflix hit accounts for seven singles in the top 20, led by “Golden,” which now leads the ARIA Singles Chart for a seventh consecutive week.

	“Baby I'm sorry, one of my biggest fears is losing you to the internet/ One of my biggest fears is waking up in our bed without you right by my neck/ Saying don't you break a sweat, pillow talking ain't my game,” a beaten-down Thugger melodically raps. 




	Thug also shows love to Drake, whom he allegedly dissed in a jail call, for visiting him when he was behind bars. “Drizzy, you my brother/ You know I ain't going against you/ I got manners/ Everything you did for the rap community can't ban you/ Never diss you/ Came to visit me at Cobb County like my kin do/ F— the jail call, you know the other calls we had,” he raps.


	Next, he moves to Lil Baby, as it appears that WHAM isn't picking up his phone calls at the moment. There's been a clear divide in the friendship of the once powerful triumvirate of Thug, Baby and Gunna since the RICO case. 


	“WHAM pick up the phone, yeah talk to me it's Spider/ Taught you everything you know about this s—t we for lifers,” Thug implores. 


	He also attempts to clear the air with 21 Savage, letting the Slaughter Gang honcho know they're on good terms. “Savage you a real n—a/ Don't let them tell you different,” Thug proclaims.


	After plenty of chatter, Thug is attempting to finally control his narrative and the reclamation of the Atlanta rapper is on. He'll have plenty more to say, as the long-awaited UY SCUTI album is slated to arrive on Sept. 19.

The record is Sheeran's first in his new series of LPs.

	Thomas Smith



Ed Sheeran's career is at a crossroads. Earlier this month, he concluded his Mathematics world tour, which ran for 169 shows and spanned the releases of two albums: 2021's = (Equals) and 2023's – (Subtract). The Mathematics era in total has spanned his entire recording career, kicking off with 2011 debut + (Plus); 2014's x (Multiply); 2017's gargantuan ÷ (Divide) and totals as one of the 21st century's most successful recording and touring musicians. His reputation and legacy as a modern great is richly deserved.


	But in recent years, life got in the way. In 2022, his close friend Jamal Edwards – founder of influential online channel SBTV – died of an accidental overdose. His wife Cherry suffered a health scare during the pregnancy of their second child, a topic broached on the contemplative Subtract. Two legal cases around accusations of plagiarism – Sheeran denied all claims and won in court – sapped the joy out of songwriting for him.


	Perhaps it comes as little surprise, then, that Sheeran has gone for a total reset with Play. It's the start of a new era for the English pop star, and the first of his five planned symbol records — with Pause, Fast Forward, Rewind, and Stop set to follow in the coming years. His planned posthumous album Eject (seriously) is hopefully a long way off. The news that Sheeran was planning a “big pop” comeback after passion project Autumn Variations (2023) will be welcome news for his fans. When Sheeran is on form, there are few songwriters like him — and fewer still who are content to use his skills in such effective, crowd-pleasing ways. Experimental, avant-garde departures are not in the Sheeran songbook… and why should they be?Play, his eighth LP in total, is a buoyant record that traverses moods and continents. Lead single “Azizam” features Persian influence, and several songs (“Sapphire”) were inspired by his shows and travels through India. This is Ed back at his vibrant best, and the start of a bright, brilliant new era; here's how the 13 tracks on Play shake out.


	In an album that pushes Ed's creativity forward, the songs with his tried-and-tested sound are somewhat less impactful. True to its title, “Slowly” doesn't really get going until the final minute, which then ends in quite sudden circumstances. It makes for one of Play's rare forgettable moments.


	“In Other Words” is one of the calmest songs on Play, but that doesn't make it completely unremarkable. The track begins as a piano ballad that grows steadily across its four-minute run time as a string section softly swells in the background. It offers a much-needed breather at the LP's halfway point following a head-spinning start.


	Backed by Our Dementia Choir, a Nottingham-based charity group of singers featuring people living with the disease, “The Vow” packs serious emotional heft. There's a nod to blue-eyed soul in the record's lush production that commits to the bit, just as much as Ed does to the song's subject: “We're stronger from joy and from pain/ Our love is the thing that remains,” he croons.


	Hitmaker Amy Allen makes an appearance on “For Always” as a credited songwriter and backing singer. The pair trade lines on the reverent ballad, with Allen's subtle vocals providing a gorgeous counterweight to Sheeran's, as he promises to be his child's constant throughout their life no matter the circumstance: “From your first breath/ To my last day,” he assures, “Whether I'm by your side/ Or a thousand miles away.”


	Sheeran's finest songwriting is often when he's addressing his subject directly. “Camera” is for a lover, one that is so dazzling he has “to count to 10 and take a breath” amidst the butterflies flapping away in his stomach. He sings each line with such conviction so that, for a brief moment, it feels like he's singing solely for you in this magical, romantic moment. Aw, shucks.


	There's a hint of Bon Iver in the way that Sheeran stacks his vocals on Play's closing track, utilizing its quality and dexterity as an instrument in its own right. “Heaven” is a reflection on the journey he's been on to get back on top and traversing life's challenges, and makes for a fitting finale as he completes the first chapter of his next adventure: “let's pause and just take in this view” he sighs.


	Before cloud-based storage, mobile phones were time capsules of certain moments in your life – the good, the bad and the cringe. “Old Phone” was inspired by the rediscovery of a previous device from Sheeran's past, full of lost photos and messages to lovers and friends (estranged or otherwise). No wonder this acoustic guitar-led number is full of longing and nostalgia for the past, but this time revisited with wisdom and perspective.


	Sheeran has described heading to India to meet with superstar Arjit Singh in his hometown as “a pilgrimage of music,” as the pair exchanged ideas, music and friendship. “Sapphire” features Singh performing in Hindi and Punjabi with Sheeran in English, although a remix of this track – not included on Play – offers a more pronounced role for Singh and is perhaps stronger for it. Either way, the universal language of music remains potent and disregards man-made borders and divisions.


	Ed described India as a place he could “never get bored of,” and the influence from his travels in such a vibrant nation is felt keenly on “Symmetry.” The track is jam-packed with percussive instruments, such as the dhol and the ghatam — as well as stringed instruments the bouzouki, and the bansuri, a bamboo flute. The result is punchy, and Sheeran totally pulls it off.


	You can see why “Azizam” was selected to lead the Play era: that chorus. It's the type of earworm melody that's scattered throughout Sheeran's career (see: “Shape of You,” “Bad Habits,” et al) and has the record's biggest hit potential. The central refrain and song title “Azizam” translates as “my dear” in Persian, and sees him work with Swedish-Iranian producer Ilya Salmanzadeh on his latest travels beyond Western sounds.


	Sheeran's work with dance producer Fred again.. has proved one of the most fruitful creative relationships in his songwriting catalog. The pair worked extensively together on 2019's No. 6 Collaborations Project, and on two of Sheeran's biggest hits in recent years, “Bad Habits” and “Shivers.” This team-up doesn't fit the smash hit formula, but is all the better for it: The song slithers closer towards Fred's electronic background and puts Sheeran outside of his comfort zone. These beats are best experienced in dark rooms and with strobe lights.


	Ed does the doting love song better than anyone, but his break-up missives – rare as they are – often prove just as compelling. “A Little More” has the pomp of Amy Winehouse's Back to Black, era and the swagger of Lily Allen at her rudest. “I wish you would look in the mirror, 'cause if you did,” he warns, “you'd see the problem is you, cause you're a pr–k.” Tell us how you really feel, Ed…


	Ed's got a bone to pick. The LP's opening track features a slick beat switch that elevates the song from a mid-tempo ballad to bouncing pop-rap banger. Raw intimacy is felt throughout, though. In the calmer moments, themes from Subtract spill over: Sheeran remembers “shaking my wife's surgeon's hands” during her health scare, and losing his “brother” Jamal Edwards in such sudden circumstances. The song grows with confidence in the latter half, as he confronts his battles in his breathless rap style: the court cases he “beat”; the pressures of fame from an early age; an ally he once trusted turning foe. “Opening” is the grit in Play's oyster, and a spectacular curtain-raiser.

The Vince Guaraldi soundtrack's surge is mostly powered by sales of a new Target-exclusive ""ghost white pumpkin-shaped vinyl"" variant.

	Keith Caulfield



Vince Guaraldi's soundtrack to It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown returns to Billboard's Kid Albums chart for the Halloween season, as it re-enters at No. 4 on the list dated Sept. 13.


	The surge back onto the list (its first appearance since November 2024) is powered mostly by sales of a new Target-exclusive edition of the album, a “ghost white pumpkin-shaped vinyl” variant.


	The Kid Albums chart ranks the week's most popular kid albums in the United States, according to Luminate. The latest chart reflects the tracking week ending Sept. 4.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown is the companion album to the 1966 Emmy Award-nominated animated TV special of the same name. The special first aired on broadcast TV on CBS, before migrating to ABC, and eventually to the paid streaming service Apple TV+. The latter has previously aired the program for free for non-subscribers for a limited time during the spooky season; Apple has yet to announce information about a free streaming window for Pumpkin in 2025.




	The Pumpkin soundtrack has spent at least one week at No. 1 on the Kid Albums chart every year from 2021 through 2024, for a total of six nonconsecutive weeks on top.


Pumpkin is one of four soundtracks to Peanuts TV specials and films to hit No. 1 on the Kid Albums chart through the years, standing alongside A Charlie Brown Christmas, A Boy Named Charlie Brown and A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving.


	The Pumpkin soundtrack also populates further Billboard rankings this week: Jazz Albums (rising 18-6), Traditional Jazz Albums (14-5), Soundtracks (No. 5 re-entry), Vinyl Albums (No. 13 re-entry) and Top Album Sales (No. 28 re-entry).

The música Mexicana star will perform three back-to-back shows in the groundbreaking venue.

	Griselda Flores


Senior Editor, Latin


	Mexican star Carín León is set to make history as the first Latin artist to perform at Sphere in Las Vegas. 


	The Sonora-born, música Mexicana hitmaker announced on Thursday (Sept. 11) a run of shows in the groundbreaking venue that will take place Sept. 11-13, 2026. Produced by AEG Presents, the three back-to-back dates will be part of Las Vegas' annual Mexican Independence Day weekend festivities.


	According to a press release, fans will experience visual displays and staging “never before seen” in Spanish-language music, where León will utilize Sphere's “next-generation” technology, including the world's highest-resolution LED display that wraps up, over and around the audience, “creating a fully immersive visual environment.”

	











	Sphere officially opened in September 2023 and has since hosted residencies by U2, Backstreet Boys and the Eagles, to name a few. Becoming the first Latin artist to perform there is another milestone and history-making feat for León who, in March 2025, became the first Mexican artist to perform on the main stage at the RodeoHouston, while setting a historic attendance record for a Hispanic artist by drawing over 70,000 people. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	“I need to change the game,” León told Billboard about his global vision back in June. “I'm hungry to make history, to be the one and only. I'm so ambitious with what I want to do with the music. It's always the music. She's the boss.”


	Most recently, León, known for his signature norteño sound, fused with R&B, country and pop, released his latest cross-genre collaboration, “Lost In Translation,” with Kacey Musgraves. 

	











	Presale for León's Sphere dates will begin Sept. 23 at noon PT. Tickets go on sale to the general public Sept. 26 at noon PT at CarinLeon.com.


Carín León is set to speak at the 2025 Billboard Latin Music Week, slated to run Oct. 20-24 at the Fillmore Miami Beach. The week will feature panels, live performances, workshops, and networking events, wrapping up with a special celebration concert on Oct. 24. The event aligns with the 2025 Billboard Latin Music Awards, airing live from Miami on Thursday, Oct. 23 on Telemundo and Peacock. Tickets for Latin Music Week 2025 are now available at BillboardLatinMusicWeek.com.

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


Netflix has renewed breakout hit series The Hunting Wives starring Malin Åkerman and Brittany Snow for a second season. As expected, the racy Texas drama, from Lionsgate Television and 3 Arts Entertainment, will become a Netflix-branded series that will stream exclusively on the platform in all but four countries Netflix is available, Deadline has learned. Like Season 1, the second season will consist of 8 episodes, sources said, with the main cast set to return. 


	Created by Rebecca Cutter, The Hunting Wives' first season was based on the bestselling novel by May Cobb. Season 2 will be an original concept-based continuation of the story, using the Season 1 finale as a jumping-off point. At the start of Season 2, Sophie (Snow) and Margo (Åkerman) are on the outs. But soon enough, old secrets and new foes force them back together. As they play their dangerous games the question arises. Are they the hunters or the hunted?

	











	Snow and Åkerman channel the Sophie-Margo dynamic from Season 1 in a video announcing the renewal, which you can watch below. It ends with Åkerman, in Margo's wig, saying, “Pack your boots and load your guns. We're going back to Maple Brook for Season 2, baby.” (The line, which reflects the show's fun vibe, lands a little different in the wake of this week's tragic event.)


The Hunting Wives — originally developed and produced for Lionsgate TV's then-sibling Starz before the studio acquired back the rights in the two companies' May split — started off as a Netflix U.S.-only acquisition in a one-year domestic licensing deal, with its first season launching on Netflix July 21 without the streamer's “N” branding at the start of each episode.


	At the time, The Hunting Wives already had launched on Stan in Australia, Crave in Canada, OSN in the Middle East and HOT in Israel, and the show had been sold in at least 10 more territories. As Deadline reported last week, amid The Hunting Wives‘ outsized success on Netflix in the U.S., Lionsgate TV put further international rollout on hold as the studio entered renewal conversations with the global streamer. 

	











	A Netflix pickup requires global rights, leading to Lionsgate reworking their existing international distribution deals. In the end, The Hunting Wives Season 2 will be available in all Netflix markets except four, Canada, Australia and two European territories, sources said. Conversations are underway for Season 1, which also is expected to become available on Netflix exclusively in most countries.


The Hunting Wives‘ renewal follows an impressive ratings performance for Season 1. 


	After launching with little fanfare and no formal promotional campaign on a Monday, the steamy drama became a staple on Netflix's U.S. Top 10 for six weeks running, including a stint at No.1, and also spent its first five weeks in the global English Top 10, amassing over 20M views, despite only being available in the U.S.


	Lionsgate TV had options on the cast, which have been exercised, with all Season 1 series regulars whose characters' fate allows them coming back, including Snow, Akerman, Jaime Ray Newman, Dermot Mulroney, Evan Jonigkeit and George Ferrier.


	“I'm so excited to write these amazing characters again, and I can't wait to take the audience on another sexy, twisted, batshit crazy ride through Maple Brook,” Cutter said.


	She executive produces the series alongside Erwin Stoff for 3 Arts Entertainment and Cobb.


	The success of The Hunting Wives on Netflix also buoyed sales of Cobb's book, originally published in 2021. In one week following the show's release, the publisher went back to press twice on the trade paperback and saw a +5,000% increase across all formats in the same one-week period year over year.


	Cutter, who also was the creator, showrunner and executive producer of Starz's Hightown, is repped by CAA, Artists Collective, and Jackoway Austen Tyerman.

					By Peter White 

Executive Editor, Television


EXCLUSIVE: It turns out the cast shakeup at Saturday Night Live isn't over. Ego Nwodim has decided to leave the NBC show after seven seasons.


	Deadline understands that Nwodim made the decision after it was thought that the cast for Season 51 was set and ready to go ahead of its October 4 return.


	“The hardest part of a great party is knowing when to say goodnight,” she said. “But after seven unforgettable seasons, I have decided to leave SNL. I am immensely grateful to Lorne [Michaels] for the opportunity, to my castmates, the writers, and the crew for their brilliance, support, and friendship. Week after week on that stage taught me more than I could have ever imagined, and I will carry those memories, and that laughter, with me always.”

	











RELATED: Shaking Tables & Stepping Up: How Ego Nwodim Broke Through On ‘SNL' – Q&A


			Watch on Deadline		







	Nwodim likely will be in demand following her exit; in recent years, she increasingly has been starring in series such as Peacock's Poker Face and Mr. Throwback and in the Netflix film Little Brother, alongside John Cena, Eric André and Michelle Monaghan. “Dream come true. I want my other dreams to come true,” she told Deadline in 2023. “I want to be in films, and I want to do more TV as well.“


	Nwodim was one of the most senior female cast members on Saturday Night Live, and her departure comes after the news that Heidi Gardner, Emil Wakim, Michael Longfellow and Devon Walker also are not returning for Season 51.


	Nwodim, a pre-med student who was part of UCB, joined the show in 2018, ahead of Season 44 — the sole new face joining that year. She was promoted to repertory player ahead of Season 46.


	It's somewhat of a surprise given that Nwodim has broken out in recent seasons with a memorable performance as Miss Eggy earlier this year, which saw the audience yell expletives live on television after a call and response segment.

	She also went viral with Lisa from Temecula, a lawyer whose predilection for overcooked meat has implications for the stability of her dining environment. Watch a clip of Nwodim as that character here:


	Nwodim, who has also played Dionne Warwick and Edith Puthie on the show, was non-committal when asked earlier this year whether she would return for Season 51.


	“We like to keep things mysterious around here,” she told Deadline. “That's part of the allure of SNL — we don't know what's going to happen week to week, let alone in the fall, so who knows.”


RELATED: Scarlett Johansson Says Colin Jost Will Return To ‘SNL' As ‘Weekend Update' Host In Season 51


	On the other hand, the timing of her departure makes sense, coming on the back of the 50th anniversary of SNL, a major milestone, which she admitted was a “surreal experience”, given the number of SNL legends and A-list guest stars that appeared. Nwodim, who was part of the Domingo vow renewal sketch, said it was a “special honor” to be part of that club.


	“At one point, there was an event honoring Lorne between the concert on February 14 and the special, and Heidi [Gardner] said to me, ‘I thought there were 500 people in this cast, and I'm realizing there's only a hundred-and-something of us ever to be in the cast.' What a special honor to get to be part of that club or family. The 50th felt really nostalgic and beautiful,” Nwodim said at a recent FYC event.

	Season 51 of SNL now will consist of 17 people after Michaels added Tommy Brennan, Jeremy Culhane, Kam Patterson and Veronika Slowikowska to the cast as well as Please Don't Destroy's Ben Marshall.


	They join Michael Che, Mikey Day, Andrew Dismukes, Chloe Fineman, Marcello Hernandez, James Austin Johnson, Colin Jost, Sarah Sherman, Kenan Thompson, and Bowen Yang as well as featured players Ashley Padilla and Jane Wickline.

Never understood why SNL needs such a big cast. especially since most of the ‘extra' cast never seem to appear on a regular basis. If the show needs an extra for a skit, just hire a day player.

WHAT?! Between this and Heidi Gardner, they're losing some stars.

Exactly. Heidi and Ego were the 2 stars of last season in my opinion. I feel they lost 2 of the best cast members they've had in recent seasons. These 2 exits really hit hard so now it's up to Sarah Sherman & Chloe Fineman to keep the train on the tracks . I haven't been this sad about an upcoming season since Kristen Wiig & Kate McKinnon left

I always love SNL and am not a naysayer by any means, but this exit on top of Heidi and Michael L have me a bit worried. We shall see. I hope it's a great season!

Michael wasn't on screen enough to matter, but losing Ego and Heidi hurts.

🥲🥲🥲 wow Ego was always a high point for me!
But I am looking forward in seeing her in other Series and Films. She's pretty fantastic!!

I can't help but think her exit had something to do with Heidi Gardner's ridiculously forced exit–and the reasoning behind it. They are very very close friends.

What caused Heidi to leave?

I think it showed her that SNL is just another employer

Nooooo!

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


	The top executives of Comcast sent a letter to all employees about the shooting death of Charlie Kirk, calling for the “respectful exchange of ideas” amid concerns of an uptick in political violence.


	The executives, CEO Brian Roberts and president Mike Cavanaugh and incoming Versant CEO Mark Lazarus, also referenced comments made on MSNBC by political analyst Matthew Dowd in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. Dowd had cited Kirk's rhetoric, saying “hateful thoughts lead to hateful words which ultimately lead to hateful actions,” but noted that much was not yet known about the shooting at Utah Valley College. MSNBC's president later apology and Dowd was fired from the network.

	











	“You may have seen that MSNBC recently ended its association with a contributor who made an unacceptable and insensitive comment about this horrific event,” the Comcast executives wrote. “That coverage was at odds with fostering civil dialogue and being willing to listen to the points of view of those who have differing opinions. We should be able to disagree, robustly and passionately, but, ultimately, with respect. We need to do better.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	They added, “Charlie Kirk believed that ‘when people stop talking, really bad stuff starts.' Regardless of whether you agreed with his political views, his words and actions underscore the urgency to maintain a respectful exchange of ideas – a principle we must champion. We believe in the power of communication to bring us together. Today, that belief feels more vital than ever. Something essential has fractured in our public discourse, and as a company that values the power of information, we have a responsibility to help mend it.”

	











	“As employees, we ask you to embody our values in your work and communities. We should engage with respect, listen, and treat people with kindness.”


	After Dowd's remarks, MSNBC immediately came under intense criticism on social media. The network is preparing to be split from Comcast, under a new corporate entity called Versant. MSNBC also will rebrand as MSNOW.


	On Fox & Friends on Friday, Trump noted the firing of Dowd. He said, “We are trying about radical left networks and cable channels, horrible channels, like MS, I always call it, DNC, because it is somehow affiliated with the Democrat National Committee. So it is a little statement you make. But MSNBC, NBC, ABC, CBS — they're all terrible. Absolutely terrible and unfair. But even they have been giving it, like, ‘This can't be allowed to happen.'”


	Trump has blamed Kirk's assassination on the rhetoric of the “radical left,” and in a video message posted to Truth Social on Wednesday, cited other instances of violence against those on the right. But he did not mention violence against figures on the left, including the shooting deaths of a prominent Minnesota Democratic lawmaker, Melissa Hortman, and her husband.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


UPDATED: The suspect in the shooting death of Charlie Kirk is in custody, the governor of Utah told reporters.


	The suspect was identified as Tyler Robinson, 22.


	“We got him,” Gov. Spencer Cox said.


	The governor said that the suspect is believed to have acted alone.


	Cox said that a family member of Robinson reached out to a family friend, who contacted the Washington County Sheriff's Office with “information that Robinson had confessed to them or implied that he had committed the incident.” 


	He said that investigators identified Robinson arriving in a gray Dodge Challenger at about 8:29 a.m. MT on Sept. 10. He said that when Robinson was encountered by investigators early on Friday morning, he was “observed in consistent clothing” with the surveillance images gathered from campus cameras.

	A family member had stated to investigators that Robinson “had become more political” in recent years, and referenced a recent incident in which he came to dinner. “In a conversation with another family member, Robinson mentioned that Charlie Kirk was coming to UVU. They talked about why they didn't like him and the viewpoints that he had. The family members also said that Kirk was full of hate and spreading hate.” 


	Investigators also identified the roommate of Robinson, Cox said, who showed them messages on Discord. Included in the messages was one from Robinson's phone contact name, “stating a need to retrieve a rifle from a drop point, leaving the rifle in a bush.” The messages also related to “visually watching the area where” a rifle was left, and “referring to having left the rifle wrapped in a towel.”

	











	The messages also referred to the “engraving bullets and a mention of a scope and the rifle being unique.” The messages also mentioned that he had changed outfits, Cox said.


	Authorities said on Thursday that they believed they had recovered the weapon used in the shooting, a high-powered bolt action rifle. It was found in a nearby wooded area, authorities said.


	Cox said that the rifle had a scope mounted on top of it. Inscriptions found on a fired casing read: “Notices bulges OwO what's this?” The inscription on an unfired casings read “Hey fascist! Catch!,” followed by an up arrow symbol, a right arrow symbol and three down arrow symbols. On another casing, the inscription read, “Oh bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao ciao ciao.” On another, it read, “If you read this, you are gay LMAO.”


	The Associated Press reported that Robinson's father recognized his son from the images released by law enforcement, and then encouraged his son to turn himself in. A youth pastor helped Robinson surrender to police, the AP reported. FBI Director Kash Patel said that the suspect was taken into custody at 10 p.m. MT on Thursday. 


	Earlier, President Donald Trump, in an in-studio appearance on Fox & Friends, told the hosts, “I think with a high degree of certainty, we have him in custody, in custody. Everyone did a great job. We worked with the local police, the governor.”


	The FBI and Utah authorities have not yet released any information. On Thursday night, additional video was released of the suspect, dropping from a rooftop after the shooting, as authorities asked the public for tips and assistance in identifying him. They also offered $100,000 for information that led to the arrest of the suspect.

	Trump said that he had been told about the suspect about five minutes before his Fox & Friends appearance.


	The president indicated that the suspect was brought “to a U.S. Marshal, who was fantastic. And the father convinced the son, ‘This is it.' I am always subject to be corrected, but I'm just giving you based on what I am hearing.” Trump said that “essentially somebody that was very close to him turned him in.”


	In the initial aftermath of the shooting, there were initial reports from Utah Valley University that a suspect was in custody, but that was not the case. Later, FBI Director Kash Patel said that a “subject” had been caught, but he later announced that person had been released. Another person also had been interviewed and released.


	Kirk, one of the most prominent political activists and organizers on the right, had been addressing thousands of college students at an outdoor event. Kirk had been asked a question about transgender individuals involved in mass shootings, a single shot was heard, striking him in the neck. About two hours later, Trump announced his death on Truth Social. The president said on Thursday that he would award Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom.


	At a press conference on Thursday, Cox warned that there was “tremendous amounts of misinformation” about the assassination, particularly on social media.


	“What we're seeing is, our adversaries want violence,” Cox said. “We have bots from Russia, China, all over the world, that are trying to instill disinformation and encourage violence. I would encourage you to ignore those, to turn off those streams, and to spend a little more time with our families.”

Yes!  Thank you Mr. President, and to the federal, state and local law enforcement for the quick apprehension. Well done.

His parents brought him in….

“We got him”

He turned himself in, you didn't get him.

“We got him” is a universal statement meaning ‘after the manhunt, we have him in custody. You're trying to imply the police saying they “found” him.
He did not turned himself in, his father informed the police after loser confessed.

Why is he announcing this on a morning show? Not a conspiracy theorist but this whole thing is getting weird

It does feel like a storyline being acted out, honestly.

Donnie's always trying to make it about him. Even according to him, it was the father who acted to bring the son to justice. Not Donnie. Get it through your heads, mags. Also, Jesus forgives Charlie and the shooter. Prove me wrong.

Bro picked a bad time to parkour.

He could parkour all he wants, it's his great dad who turned him in

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","​​The Ellisons are reportedly coming for Warner Bros. Discovery next","https://www.avclub.com/paramount-bid-merger-warner-bros-discovery","Fri, 12 Sep 2025 13:58:00 GMT","

Paramount is putting together a “majority cash bid” to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, according to The Wall Street Journal. The bid is backed by David Ellison, the founder of Skydance Media who recently became CEO of Paramount, and his dad Larry Ellison, the Donald Trump advisor and tech entrepreneur who recently became the richest man in the world. Though the Ellisons haven't formally made a bid, WSJ suggests they're trying to get in the door before WBD splits into two companies, making a play for the movie studio, cable networks, and traditional television assets. 

This is not the first time a merger between the two historic studios has been suggested. Heads of both studios met to discuss the possibility in December 2023, but the talks fizzled by February 2024. While Paramount moved on with Skydance, the debt-riddled WBD ultimately decided to split into two companies. Per WSJ, by making a huge offer for the whole company Paramount angles to preempt competitors like Amazon and Apple from buying up WBD's used parts after the split. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Warner Bros. Discovery stock jumped 36 percent following the news of Paramount's interest.

A deal of this magnitude that consolidates two of the last remaining major Hollywood studios would almost certainly face regulatory scrutiny… at least, it would in previous years. In our current era, greasing the right palms seems to get anything done. Paramount has seemingly followed this playbook by succumbing to the Trump admin's whims, particularly in regards to CBS News. And in the wake of Paramount signaling its allyship to conservatives, Larry Ellison coincidentally rose to the top of the list of global billionaires. Owning and operating a Trump-friendly entertainment conglomerate is a powerful position in politics, media, and business right now. Imagine how much more powerful that position would become with two powerful legacy studios under one banner.

The following will contain “Big Brother” live feed spoilers as of Friday, September 12.

By a vote of three to two, Will Williams became the second juror from the “Big Brother” house into the Jury house. This marks yet another ally of ‘The Judges' alliance sent out the eviction doors. A new Head of Household competition will determine which contestant secures power and safety heading into the coming week. 

Host, Julie Chen reveals the upcoming week of “Big Brother” features a two-hour episode on Wednesday, Sept. 17, highlighted by the return of the fan-favorite Zingbot. The drama escalates again the following night with a double eviction episode scheduled for Thursday, Sept. 18. Fans don't have to wait until Wednesday's episode to up to date on what the houseguests are up to thanks to the “Big Brother” live feeds.

Will provides insight to Chen as to who he wants to see win “Big Brother” season 27. “I hope Ava wins. She is a great person” adding “Vinny (Vince) is probably going to win. He can convince anybody of anything.”

Nicknamed ‘Captain Will' explained that he woke up on eviction day and realized the houseguests viewed him as too likable to keep in the game, fearing he would be a dangerous finalist to face at the end. He described his fellow competitors as “crazy kids,” but added that he felt the show cast him as a mentor. He said he leaves the game feeling like “a better man.”

Will emphasized that he does not feel betrayed, noting that both Morgan and Vince openly told him about their decision to vote him out. He expressed no hard feelings toward them or anyone else. Will joins first juror Rachel Reilly in deciding who will win “Big Brother” come finale night on September 28.

The return of the “Big Brother” live feeds is always one of the most anticipated moments after an episode airs, but last week's White Locust twist left fans waiting much longer than expected. Typically, the feeds come back within a reasonable window after the broadcast ends, giving the audience a chance to learn who won Head of Household and to watch the fallout unfold in real time. Instead, CBS kept the cameras down for an extended stretch, frustrating loyal feed-watchers who rely on that behind-the-scenes access to stay connected to the game.

The White Locust twist added layers of production that seemingly contributed to the delay. While it made for dramatic television, the extended blackout made fans feel disconnected and out of the loop. Social media lit up with complaints as subscribers pointed out that the feeds are part of what makes “Big Brother” unique compared to other reality competitions. Without them, it becomes harder to track shifting alliances, subtle conversations, and the strategy that never makes the final cut of the episodes. The downtime also sparked speculation online, with fans questioning whether production was hiding too much under the guise of a “twist.” Last week, the feeds resumed to reveal “Big Brother” legend Rachel Reilly had been eliminated.

Heading into this week, there's already an air of skepticism among viewers. Will the same extended delay happen again, or will CBS allow the feeds to resume more quickly so fans can see who claimed the Head of Household room and power? For many, the feeds aren't just a bonus—they're the heartbeat of the show. If production repeats last week's long blackout, it risks alienating the die-hard audience who invest hours following the game outside of the network edit. For now, fans are left in limbo, hoping the downtime won't become the new normal.

(Updated 11pm PST) Live feeds resumed an hour and a half after the episode aired on the west coast. Vince is the new HoH!

Ava and Kelley speculate as to who Vince will nominate.

Vince speaks with Morgan about his targets for the week. Ava, Keanu and Kelley are in his line of sight. 

Official nominations will be made tomorrow in the “Big Brother” house.

The following article is an excerpt from the new edition of “In Review by David Ehrlich,” a biweekly newsletter in which our Chief Film Critic and Head Reviews Editor rounds up the site's latest reviews and muses about current events in the movie world. Subscribe here to receive the newsletter in your inbox every other Friday.

Ahoy, mateys! And welcome to another thrilling installment of “In Review.” Over the last two weeks I have journeyed far and wide across this land to bring you the hottest takes on the fall's most exciting new movies, even if the best of them — by some distance — was the one I saw at the exotic AMC 34th Street (more like One Escalator After Another am I right?). 

 








Related Stories Can ‘One Battle After Another' Beat ‘Sinners' and ‘Hamnet' at the Oscars? — Screen Talk Michael Shannon on Finally Getting His Big Courtroom Drama with ‘Nuremberg,' His Next R.E.M. Tour, and Playing Bill Parcells 

Here are five things I learned on my travels:

When “The Brutalist” stormed the festival circuit around this time last year, it seemed like something of a unicorn — as well as an almost impossible sell. Twelve months, 10 Oscar nominations, and one rapturous quasi-musical later, it feels like a new kind of recipe for success. How do you follow an epic historical drama about a traumatized European who sails to America and builds their own church? You make another one, of course.

 










The parallels between Mona Fastvold and Brady Corbet's future projects may not rhyme quite as clearly as those between “The Brutalist” and “The Testament of Ann Lee,” but the most exciting thing about this one-two punch isn't their thematic overlap so much as it is their shared sense of scale and self-possession. At a time when Hollywood is both deathly allergic to risk and physically incapable of making anything that costs less than $100 million, the fact that Fastvold and Corbet have now both directed gorgeous, sweeping, and creatively unbound movies for a fraction of that cost in Hungary feels like a new way forward. Sure, that model requires the kind of zeal and asceticism more associated with a religious movement than a film set, but “The Testament of Ann Lee” is nothing if not an ideal example of how it's done. 

Most good movies take a hot minute to get made, but this fall saw the premieres of several films — surely more than I've made room to mention here — that were marinating for decades. I mean, Guillermo del Toro was probably pitching his “Frankenstein” to the other kids in the middle of class during first grade, where his teacher forced him to write “I will not be sympathetic toward monsters” on the blackboard 100 times as punishment. 

 










But timing is everything, and it often only appears as if all of the pieces are falling into place. On the one hand, Park Chan-wook was duly rewarded for waiting 20 years to direct “No Other Choice,” as his Donald Westlake adaptation — about a man so desperate for another job in his field that he murders the other candidates — is perfectly suited for the worldwide pivot to AI. Ditto Laura Poitras, who'd been trying to make a Seymour Hersh documentary since at least 2005, but didn't manage to wear him down until world events — specifically the genocide in Gaza — had provided her the material she needed to paint her subject's career as an investigative journalist into a broader and more damning portrait of American malfeasance.

On the other hand, del Toro has not been done any favors by dreaming of “Frankenstein” for so long; his love for the material is sacred and unimpeachable, but it comes through more palpably in how he talks about Mary Shelley's novel than it does in any part of the movie he's made from it. Soapy, broad, and so chintzy-looking despite its budget that it was difficult for me to appreciate the tragic beauty of Frankenstein's monster (I weep for how tactile this film might have been had del Toro made it before teaming up with cinematographer Dan Laustsen for “Crimson Peak” and committing himself to a series of increasingly garish digital veneers), this most passionate of passion projects would be so easy to mistake for any of the other gothic CGIsores from the last 25 years that it might as well be stitched together from the leftover parts of “Van Helsing.” I think there was a time when del Toro would have recognized as much, but the money and technology at this disposal has caused him to lose sight of the human element that drew him to this story in the first place.  

 










Earlier this summer, I wrote about the fate of Nadav Lapid's “Yes,” and how its post-Cannes disappearance appeared to suggest that festivals and distributors were afraid of films that dared to confront the most transparent moral atrocity of our times: the genocide in Gaza (Kino Lorber has since acquired U.S. rights for “Yes,” and will release it here in early 2026). Did Telluride, Venice, or TIFF do anything to improve the situation? Well, yes and no. 

Telluride, a wonderful festival whose need to appease its patrons has seen it become subtly but worryingly less adventurous in its programming, neglected to screen many of the recent films that feature the genocide as their primary subject (“Cover-Up” touches on Gaza with great purpose, but only in passing). Amid a lineup that was absolutely bursting with documentaries about everything from the American Revolution to the making of “Megalopolis,” and everyone from E. Jean Carroll to Elie Wiesel, I was disappointed not to see “Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk,” and only took an uncertain measure of consolation in the fact that Telluride chose to screen Netalie Braun's “Shooting,” a self-reflexive Israeli film about how the country's unchecked militarism has poisoned its cinema (I wasn't able to see it myself, but the movie's Letterboxd reviews make it sound appropriately damning). 

 










TIFF, which stepped on rake after rake in the process of premiering “The Road Between Us: The Ultimate Rescue,” an “inspiring” documentary by TIFF donor Barry Avrich about an Israeli man who saved his family from the violence of October 7, at least provided a venue for the North American premieres of Venice standout “The Voice of Hind Rajab,” as well as Locarno highlight “With Hasan in Gaza” and the rousing historical drama “Palestine 36.” The festival also, if not on its own accord, played host to a loud and defiant protest in front of the Lightbox last Sunday night, which did more to make TIFF seem relevant and in conversation with the world than most of the movies I saw there. 

And yet, of all these films, only “Put Your Soul” and “Palestine 36” have distribution, but Kino Lorber and Watermelon Pictures — the latter of which almost exclusively releases movies from or about Palestine — can't be expected to be American cinema's sole lifeline to the country. (“The Road Between Us” is being released on more than 1,000 screens in October.) Fingers crossed that “The Voice of Hind Rajab,” “With Hasan in Gaza,” and “Cover-Up” will all find proper homes soon, even if only under the auspices of awards season. 

I don't want to make any sweeping pronouncements based on anecdotal evidence, a tiny sample size, and my own personal biases (just kidding, I'm a film critic, that's pretty much my favorite thing to do), but at a time when being numb to the world is at once both a survival mechanism and a moral abdication, the festivals made it seem as if there's a newfound premium on movies that make you feel anything strongly — even if only through brute force. 

 










As an introverted cynic whose love of movies can probably be explained on some level by the fact that sitting in the dark allows me to be present but not perceived, I naturally struggled with Chloé Zhao's insistence on leading every “Hamnet” premiere audience in the same mindfulness routine that she conducted for the cast and crew on set every morning. Taking deep breaths, looking the person next to you in the eye, putting your hand on your heart, that sort of thing. I'm not proud to say that it had the opposite of the intended effect on me, making me more guarded and self-conscious rather less (though as someone who's been prescribed stimulants to make myself less hyper for the last 20 years, I'm used to that sort of counter-intuitiveness). 

Less than an hour later, I was sobbing so hard that the woman next to me started to look worried. Maybe it was the mountain air, or that I missed my kids, or that “Hamnet” resonated with me as the story of a writer who goes on a work trip that leaves him unable to stop or bear witness to a tragedy back at home (Tweeting about movies in Telluride is basically the same thing as scripting “Macbeth” in 17th century London and don't you dare suggest otherwise), but I forgot myself for the rest of the film. 

I forgot that I was in public, and that leaving yourself completely open to the pain of others can be a paralyzing experience these days. I even forgot that Gracie Abrams was sitting right behind me. “Hamnet” will never be accused of having a light touch (my review accused the tear-jerker of “farming viewers for moisture”), but I found myself unexpectedly grateful for Zhao's refusal to hold back, and  for how the almost pornographic sentimentality of her film invited its audience to participate in the same kind of emotional transference that Will Shakespeare and his poor wife Agnes experience towards the end of the story. 

 










It's no coincidence that “Hamnet” stayed with me — sank deeper into my bones, even — over the course of the days that followed, while the stiff upper lip of “H Is for Hawk,” the probing ambiguity of “After the Hunt,” and the inert wistfulness of “La Grazia” made it that much harder to engage with those films on any level. There's a reason why the last five minutes of “Jay Kelly” is one of the only memorable parts of that movie, just as there's a reason why “Rental Family” loses points for not better weaponizing its treacle, and why the most interesting thing about “The Smashing Machine” is how gingerly it navigates between pain and stability. It's never been more important to feel alive to the world, especially for those of us who are more inclined to be closed off, and it's the movies which dispossess people of their numbness that are poised to leave the biggest mark this fall.

On a related — if somewhat perpendicular — note, it was also telling to see that several of the season's early standouts are movies that engage with our current moment head-on. That's most obviously true of Paul Thomas Anderson's “One Battle After Another,” which towered over the festivals despite skipping all three of them, and, along with “Eddington,” offered the most overt rebuke to/apology for the prevailing wisdom that many of today's greatest filmmakers are more comfortable engaging with the past (more on that next week). But it was also thrilling to see Yorgos Lanthimos confront red pill conspiracy brain and corporate technocracy with “Bugonia,” whose relevance to the present day was made all the more pronounced by the fact that it's a remake; “Bugonia” might like the sweep and inventiveness of Lanthimos' best work, but sometimes a brilliant Chappell Roan needle-drop is all it takes to bridge the gap between any number of different worlds. 

 










No such luck in Park Chan-wook's “No Other Choice” (which favors classic Korean pop ballads over the modern American kind), but none of the maestro's work has stung quite as hard as this one does in the pyrrhic victory of its final moments, when the film's “Looney Tunes” violence mournfully surrenders to a situation all too real. And while “Wake Up Dead Man” might lack the fun and humor of the previous “Knives Out” movies (I found the mystery in this one labored, its major supporting roles underwritten, and Benoit Blanc's presence frustratingly ornamental), Rian Johnson's ensemble Netflix movie comes back to life whenever it refocuses its attention on the political underpinnings of its story — on charismatic demagogues, the self-serving cowardice that fuels their power, and the absurdity of the politics that bind them together. The least of Johnson's trilogy does the most to position it as a coherent treatise against the indecency of Trumpian narcissism, and as a bittersweet testament to the fantasy of solving it.

Michael Shannon can be a prankster, particularly during interviews conducted over the phone. I know this, because I've seen him do it. 

Before an in-person interview for Jeff Nichols' “Midnight Special,” I witnessed him end what seemed like a cordial phone interview, only to do a bit as he hung up in which he said a few disparaging things about the outlet's home city that they “weren't supposed to hear,” just to see what happened. Then there was the time he told an interviewer (again, over the phone) that General Zod in “Man of Steel” would have flippers instead of hands. (That one wound up getting a lot of attention.)

The last time I asked the actor about this, he explained, “I didn't have to sell it with my face, just my voice.” This time around? We're doing a phone interview.




			Popular on IndieWire		






This interview was supposed to happen in-person at the Toronto International Film Festival, where the film premiered to rousing applause, but schedules didn't work out and it later became what industry insiders call “a phoner.” Still, Shannon promised, no pranks this time, because the movie at hand is too important. From the title alone, no, “Nuremberg” doesn't really lend itself to horsing around.
 










But! One of the interesting things about James Vanderbilt's film, which features Shannon as Supreme Court justice Robert Jackson after he's tapped to prosecute the living hierarchy of the Nazi party after World War II (including a disturbingly charming performance from Russell Crowe as Herman Göring, the highest-ranking living Nazi), is the humor. 

As Shannon stresses, he's human. He has to figure out how to navigate setting this trial up, involving multiple countries, and then not losing. This involves working with psychiatrist Douglas Kelly (Rami Malek), who has been analyzing the captured Nazis, and navigating where the boundaries are between doctor-patient privilege and, well, just not caring, because they are some of the worst people who have ever lived.

Also, yes, there's plenty of R.E.M discussion, as Shannon and Jason Narducy — who have been touring and performing full R.E.M. albums, including a couple of performances with the actual band — get ready to announce their “Lifes Rich Pageant” tour. And we get into Shannon's next role, as (surprisingly) former New York Giants head coach Bill Parcells.

The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.

IndieWire: I've always been wary to interview you on the phone. You pull pranks on phone interviews.
 










Michael Shannon: Pull pranks, like what?

When I interviewed you for “Midnight Special,” I walked into your room and you were doing an interview with, I think, the Toronto Star. As you were hanging up the phone, you started badmouthing Toronto as a joke to see what would happen if they heard you.

I do have a pretty twisted sense of humor.

And then another time you told a reporter General Zod would have flippers for hands.

[Laughs] Oh, right.

You said it's easier to sell these things on the phone.

Alright, well, I'm dead serious right now.

“Nuremberg” is a pretty serious movie, but your interpretation of Justice Robert Jackson has a lot more levity than I thought there'd be, which was welcome. 

They're all people. They're all real people. And I think that's one of the points of the movie is that these are actual real human beings. One of the great things you can do with historical drama is turn people onto that fact. Because when you're reading about it in some giant textbook or something, it feels undigestible, or you just get tired of it. But, lo and behold, these are actual people and every single character in this movie, despite their circumstances, has a personality. And, dare I say, a sense of humor.

 










Well, you just mentioned textbooks, and I know how diligently you prepare for stuff. How many textbooks did you have to read for this?

Well, at first I read “The Nazi and the Psychiatrist,” which the film is based on. But that honestly doesn't have so much about the trials in it. I had never heard of Robert Jackson before, but if you go on the internet there's a website devoted to him. He has his own website. And I looked at that and then I found a book to read about him. I didn't read 20,000 books or anything.

I don't know how much you think about this, I'm guessing you don't, but when you get into heavy scenes with Rami Malek, then later Russell Crowe, it's great to watch three Oscar winners and/or nominees just going at it. 

Well, I think the story and the script and the project merited that level of commitment and professionalism. I mean, it demands the top echelon. It makes me a little squeamish to include myself in that category…

You are an Oscar nominee. That is a fact.

I'm just saying, there's a gravity to it. For some people watching this movie, they're really not going to know much about what happened. And there's a whole younger generation that really knows diddly squat about what happened. So, this might be their only exposure to it, you never know. Despite our accomplishments, we all felt an extreme amount of duty and obligation to push ourselves. Because if you've been doing this a long time, people have been known to rest on their laurels from time to time. But this is definitely not a situation to do that. 

 










I was in awe of the amount of work that Russell put into this. And Rami. I mean, they both worked their tails off. There's something very thrilling about… I haven't really had my courtroom drama yet.

Right, like “A Few Good Men.” Obviously you and Russell have a different story dynamic than [Tom] Cruise and [Jack] Nicholson. In this, both characters are supposed to be very good at cross-examination.

What's interesting is that that actual testimony went on for much longer than it does in the movie. Russell gave me a book, the transcripts, just of Jackson questioning Göring, and it's a very long book. And even in its distillation, there are parts of it that are tricky to follow, but I like that. I like that it's just not, “You did something wrong.” “No, I didn't.” “Yes, you did.” It's more intricate than that. Göring is a frighteningly intelligent individual with very selective blindness.

There are a couple moments in this I was thinking, “Well, everyone knows that.” But like you said, there are a whole host of young people who really know nothing about this specifically or the atrocities of World War II. 

And it is something that should not be forgotten definitively for all of our sakes. Jamie's managed to make a film that is informative, perhaps even educational, but you don't really notice it so much while you're watching it because it's also just a good, old-fashioned movie.

 










Yeah, they used to make movies like this all the time. There is a tendency to label anything not IP or a superhero movie a throwback, but that also doesn't mean it's not true.

Well, I mean, Jamie's been around a while and he's been writing a long time.

He wrote “Zodiac.”

Yeah! So, he's from that tradition. He understands it. But I know exactly what you're saying. Just because something isn't “The Avengers” or something doesn't mean it's a throwback.

Speaking of throwbacks and Tom Cruise, “Vanilla Sky” was on cable the other day. You're in a shot with Cruise and Kurt Russell. It's weird, because it feels like you went back in time just to insert yourself in that scene, because now it's three famous actors.

[Laughs] I used to do a lot of work that, day player stuff. My career has been very much like the tortoise, slow and steady wins the race. It was not a meteoric rise, but I just kept showing up and they kept giving me a little more to do. And now, here I am.

People love that you're in “Groundhog Day,” but I like bringing up that you're in “Chain Reaction.”

Yeah, that's a rather obscure one. I think, honestly, for everybody involved in the project, not just me. That's neither here nor there.

I am so excited you and Jason Narducy will be performing “Lifes Rich Pageant.” That's my favorite R.E.M. album. When you announced this on “The Tonight Show,” I was getting annoyed he wanted you to skip to “Monster,” because this is the one I've been waiting for.
 










We can't skip. I mean, because the rule is it has to be the 40th anniversary. That's the rule. We're doing the 40th anniversary of dot, dot, dot. We skipped “Reckoning” for reasons.

Why?

I don't know. But we played the heck out of “Reckoning” on the “Murmur” tour. And we also played a lot of “Reckoning” on the “Fables” tour. Even though “Reckoning” didn't have a firm tour, I think we played “Reckoning” more often than any other album.

And you did “Pretty Persuasion” with R.E.M., right?

Yes! That happened, yes.

That's as good as playing your own “Reckoning” tour.

Yeah, yeah, we did it. We did those songs a lot. And so now it's on to “Lifes Rich Pageant.” We're doing 22 shows in February and March next year. They're just about to announce the tour. I think they're announcing it in September.

I cannot wait to hear your version of “Flowers of Guatemala.”

Thank you. I'm really looking forward to it. I love this record. Everybody really loves this record so much.

Obviously the other ones you've done have rockers on them, but that whole album is almost non-stop rock music. Well, the one I just mentioned is a little slower.

Yeah, yeah, all hands on deck! And they made that in Bloomington, Indiana, which is the last stop on our tour. I think the fellow who produced it, he was working with John Mellencamp.

 










“Fables” they made in London with a very different producer, Joe Boyd. I mean, beautiful producer, made beautiful music, and I love that record just as much as “Lifes Rich Pageant.” They have very different tones to the records. You can feel it on “Lifes Rich Pageant,” it's a very full-bodied sound. Much more, I don't know, much more earthy.

And next you're playing Bill Parcells, alongside David Corenswet in “Mr. Irrelevant.” I'm in. I do realize it's a sad story.

I was surprised! I was kind of hesitant to do it just because it felt like a stretch to me. But I love working with Jonathan Levine very much.

He is the nicest guy.

Yeah, he's a good person and he's a lot of fun to be on set with and work with. So, he talked me into it. And I got to say I'm really glad I did it. I learned a lot about something that, honestly, I may not have put too much attention on otherwise. But that's the great thing about what I do. Your perspective is just always expanding every time you do a job.

Honestly, I can't really define what you're “doing” easily anymore because you're kind of doing it all right now. 

Well, I am riding on the shoulders of giants, as Michael Stipe would say. We have their music to play. And it is nowhere near the thrill of seeing the actual band, but we do our best.

 










“Nuremberg” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival. Sony Pictures Classics will release the film in theaters on Friday, November 7.

“Friendship” has turned out to be a surprise mini-breakout for A24. That the Tim Robinson-led film has its critical champions and devoted following is to be expected, but it's surprising that the dark, anxiety-inducing, so-called cringe comedy was able to make an extended theatrical run, before becoming the top-rated film on HBO MAX as it made its streaming debut this past weekend.

When “Friendship” writer/director Andrew DeYoung was a guest on this week's episode of the Filmmaker Toolkit Podcast, he admitted he wasn't prepared for the volume of laughs the film received during its initial festival screenings.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






“When I saw it at TIFF, I didn't realize I made this kind of movie,” said DeYoung of the crowd's laughter. “Seeing it with a crowd, I was like, ‘I can't believe this, did I make ‘Borat 3' accidentally?'”

Related Stories The Movies Are Meeting the Moment, but Distributors Are Still Scared of Palestine (and Three Other Lessons We Learned from the Fall Fests) Can ‘One Battle After Another' Beat ‘Sinners' and ‘Hamnet' at the Oscars? — Screen Talk 

While DeYoung has learned credit is due to Robinson's rabid fanbase and the raucous SXSW and Toronto's Midnight Madness audiences, he's also come to realize the film's humor hits harder than he expected — that's in part because he wasn't trying to make a traditional comedy.

 










“I'm not a huge fan of most comedy movies because I think it lacks something real underneath,” said DeYoung. “I respect a lot of [comedies], I watch, I laugh, and I don't think about them ever again.”

DeYoung gravitates more toward more “uncomfortable” comedies, like Scorsese's “King of Comedy,” or the work of Swedish director Ruben Östlund (“Triangle of Sadness,” “Force Majeure”) — films that come with laughs that, accordingly to DeYoung, “hit harder because of the emotion underneath,” because they touch on the nerve of something deeper and “real.”

In the case of “Friendship,” DeYoung pokes beneath the surface at issues that political scientist Robert D. Putnam wrote about in his landmark 2000 book, “Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community.”

“I went deep into [Putnam's] work,” said DeYoung. “He was pointing at the complete lack of community in [modern] American life that I think we all feel.”

That communal void is felt by Craig Waterman (Robinson) following the termination of his brief friendship with Austin (Paul Rudd), the cool new neighbor who, in the first act, magically injects Craig's life with a male friend group, outdoor adventures, jam sessions, and evening hangs. After Austin abruptly ends their friendship, Craig is desperate to get back what he lost and to refill that void, triggering increasingly unhinged behavior that culminates in him losing his job, family, and freedom.

 










It's not the stuff of a standard American comedy, but neither is DeYoung's model of what a comedy should be. While on the podcast, the “Friendship” writer/director discussed the eye-opening moment when he was a teenager and saw Chris Smith's “American Movie,” a documentary about a Wisconsin filmmaker trying to complete his low-budget horror film amid a series of setbacks and personal problems.

“I know it's a doc, but to me [‘American Movie'] is what comedy should be, because it's desperate people trying their damnedest to make something of themselves, ” said DeYoung. “And the camera ideally should be in service of those real emotions. I feel this in TV — because I work in TV a lot — when things are so bright, I just all of a sudden am like, ‘All these characters are in a Target.' It takes away from the emotion.”

DeYoung added, “It's also [that] we're inundated with images now, especially things that look technically correct, but are so goddamn boring. So, I'm excited to push it even further and play with the image and make it feel ‘real,' or dark as possible.”

DeYoung and cinematographer Andy Rydzewski plunge Craig into increasing literal darkness, so much so, as the film progresses that it stylistically adopts aspects of the horror genre.

 










“As soon as [Craig and Austin's] breakup happens, [the film] starts to enter that [darkness] because it's that anxiety of losing somebody, that you want to be with, that I think feels like a horror movie to most of us, especially if they met a certain amount of your needs that you don't know how to meet yourself,” said DeYoung. “That's why ideally we laugh and get rid of the tension, but it's those two feelings at the same time [that] is really rewarding to me. It's fertile ground for narrative to have both places — both, I'm getting laughs, but I'm also in this tense, ‘I'm not sure [what] is going to happen' [feeling].”

It's here DeYoung points to Paul Thomas Anderson, a director he's studied intensely, and whose 2012 Philip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix-led “The Master” had a profound influence on him, in part because of Anderson's ability to craft scenes that hold simultaneous and contradictory emotions.

Said DeYoung of Anderson, “There's something rewarding about him not shoving you, the viewer, into kind of expectation, or a certain feeling. He's so good about providing a few feelings that you get to choose from, and to me, I find that he respects the audience so much.”

DeYoung also argues PTA's films are far funnier than people give them credit — something “Friendship” fans have helped him accept about his own film.

We spent nearly a full year waiting and waiting for Skydance‘s deal to merge with Paramount to finally close, and before even one single movie has been released by the newly formed company, there's already serious talk that another legacy studio could be in full-on upheaval again.

The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Paramount Skydance was preparing a majority cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery — an offer backed by David Ellison and his uber-wealthy father Larry Ellison — that would look to buy all of WBD, including its movie studio, its library, and its cable networks.

 










WBD stocks skyrocketed after the report, but the immediate feeling is that this deal would be hard to actually fathom — or even come to fruition. Warner Bros. and Paramount are two of the last legacy major studios from Hollywood's Golden Age, and combining them under one corporate roof may seem near-impossible to comprehend (and also a little gross).

Look, we've been down this road before, and M&A activity is just par for the course. Disney bought Fox's film studio, Amazon bought MGM, Warner Bros. has changed hands from AT&T to Discovery, and this won't be the last mega merger or transaction to shake up the business. 

 










And there's also no guarantee this happens. Companies kick the tires on deals all the time, other buyers emerge, things fall through. Just look at how long and drawn out the Paramount-Skydance deal was in the first place.

A sale of Warner Bros. Discovery has also long been on the table, but selling it to another legacy studio that literally just beefed up and hasn't set its agenda yet wasn't on anyone's bingo card. And it's left us with a few questions. 

First of them being, wait, what? Below are the others.

Would this not be a monopoly? Wouldn't a company of the combined size of Paramount/Skydance + Warner Bros. Discovery set off alarm bells? There's no doubt that a deal of this magnitude would be subject to Justice Department scrutiny, and it's hard to know how this administration would behave toward such a move, given that the Paramount/Skydance deal didn't even go through until CBS News settled President Trump's lawsuit against it and the new owners agreed to appoint an ombudsman to look over CBS News. 

How would Trump react to his administration now getting to decide the fate of CNN? (Remember when people like WBD CEO David Zaslav thought a Trump administration would be more, not less conducive, to M&A?)

One of the big hurdles Paramount and Skydance likely wouldn't have to worry about is the FCC. It would be a big no-no for a media conglomerate to own not one, but two broadcast channels. But consider recent history: NBCUniversal has had no trouble operating both MSNBC and NBC and Fox operating Fox News and its Fox broadcast channel.

 










David Ellison has already made clear his priorities around streaming, both in drastically improving the underlying tech of Paramount+ and also combining Paramount+ with its free, ad-supported Pluto TV. Doing that would attract more users and greatly reduce costs of having to operate two separate streamers.

If you're adding HBO Max into the mix and treating each service's subscribers as apples to apples, the 77 million subs on P+ combined with the 125 million across HBO Max, Discovery+, and HBO's linear channel would better help it rival Netflix's 300 million+ subscribers and a newly beefed-up Disney+ that now includes Hulu and ESPN. 

But if Ellison is all about consolidating, do they really need two (or three or four) streamers? Disney is already sunsetting the standalone Hulu app and integrating it into Disney+ as a tile, so envisioning a Paramount+ in which there's an HBO tile and Discovery tile alongside ones for Showtime and Pluto could be the way this is headed. 

HBO as a brand itself is too valuable to discard, something WBD realized when they literally put “HBO” back under the name “HBO Max” after a monumentally dumb decision to remove it. But what use would Paramount and Skydance have for it?

This one is trickier and sadder to think about. Maybe it helps the library of TCM to be able to have WB classics alongside Paramount ones more easily, but TCM is an anomaly in this day and age when cable networks already have dwindling value. It's a channel with no commercials that only plays old movies. When IndieWire led the charge in raising a stink about TCM going away under David Zaslav's watch, Zaslav himself rallied to keep it because he is an old-fashioned movie wonk.

 










Would David Ellison have the same level of nostalgia for the channel? Paramount has held firm with its cable channels, but who knows if this would continue to be one of them. 

Perhaps the most curious detail about the Wall Street Journal's report is that Paramount Skydance would be looking to buy all of WBD and not just one half of the business. The cable networks empire of CNN, TBS, TNT, Food Network, HGTV, Discovery, and more are not worth what they once were, and Zaslav this summer announced plans to split the company in two, effectively going back to a structure before Discovery combined its cable channels with the Warner Bros. movie studio.

By splitting them up, it makes the more valuable part — the studio and library — more attractive to other buyers. You could see Apple or Amazon or another tech giant get involved and not have to burden themselves with the cable channels that are hanging on by a thread. Private equity could also get involved and further split the company into parts.

Paramount may have a need for the cable networks to be a behemoth alongside Comedy Central and MTV, and it would likely want to combine WBD's many sports rights with its own. But though it would cost a pretty penny — at least $41 million plus $35 billion in debt — Ellison can afford it and can potentially get ahead of other bids as part of a bidding war by diving into the pool early. 

 










When we reported on the Paramount/Skydance deal initially, we argued that getting a guy like Ellison in charge was arguably a better-case scenario than having private equity buy Paramount or even Sony absorbing all of it. It meant fewer redundancies in terms of studio lots, talent, and the types of movies and shows that might get made.

With an arrangement like this, all bets would be off. Paramount under Skydance is currently planning $2 billion in cost cuts, which has been reported to result in 3,000 jobs lost. 

A combo with WBD would likely mean a whole wave of executives that would be out. Warner Bros. Pictures and Paramount Pictures could easily fall under one umbrella, as would CNN and CBS News and all of cable. Would they need two lots to operate from? How many more jobs would be on the chopping block? 

But at least Superman could finally do a crossover with the Transformers.

There are only so many ways to hide a body, and there are only so many ways a movie like “Adulthood” turns out. Alex Winter's amusing but slight film is a wacky romp about intergenerational trauma and cycles of abuse, though that's pretty obvious from any given promotional image. As crazy as the movie purports to be, there's never an unexpected moment. Thankfully, this turns out to be less of a problem than it should be. 

“Adulthood” follows Noah and Megan Robles, two siblings whose mother has been left unable to speak after a stroke. While looking through the basement of their childhood home, they notice a leak in the water heater and a terrible smell. Their investigation leads them to the rotting corpse of their old neighbor Patty Metzger (a great name for a character whose moniker will hang over the rest of the film), who disappeared years ago. Instead of calling it into the police, they decide, in order to protect their family's reputation and finances, to dump the body in a quarry. Of course, the pair's attempts to bury the past only cascade into further collateral damage and ethical compromise.

Over the past 20 years of Black List darlings and Edgar Wright rip-offs, the American film industry has established a new archetype of cinema filled with quippy antiheroes, gory allegories for domestic strife, and character actors rattling off reference humor. The last few years this have seen this subcategory exchange its trendiness for a position as a legitimate niche market with the lower-tier of silly genre programmers. In 2025, a movie like “Adulthood” — i.e., a Whedon-esque morality play where one of the characters wears an Alamo Drafthouse shirt — is no longer cool or remotely notable. It is the standard deviation of every movie to play the Midnight section of a festival. But I like the Midnight section, and I found the movie to be a totally amiable way to spend 97 minutes.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Much of this hinges on a single load-bearing creative decision, one that becomes delightfully obvious only a few scenes in. Unlike similar stories, wherein characters often recoil at the notion of replicating the faults of their parents, the Robles are maniacally insistent that they must, at any cost to their well-being or the lives of others, follow in their parents' footsteps. It is their duty to protect their mother's legacy. They barrel recklessly past several oppurtunities to free themselves from the consequences of their own actions out of a stubborn devotion to their own toxicity. This approach is way more fun than the alternative, and gives far more room to explore questions of familial responsibility and the difference between care and self-preservation.

Such thematic complications present themselves, though in a confounding order, with unreliable consistency. Nearly half the film focuses on the extortion effort of the mother's nurse (Billie Lourd). Her motivations, as someone who resents being dehumanized by those who pay her to do what she believes is a child's duty of care, are a worthy inclusion, but her scenes feel like a slack waste of time in a story that demands a certain level of propulsion. Anthony Carrigan's Bodie, the unpredictable cousin brought in by Noah to intimidate her, is similarly leveraged disproportionately. He lays bare the hypocrisy of the siblings' insistence that they are acting out of some familial obligation and not outright selfishness. But this would perhaps be better highlighted by the character played by Winter himself. As Patty's vagrant son, he delivers a heartbreaking and immediately commanding performance. Unfortunately, he has a total of about 180 seconds of screentime, the perfect foil to the sibling's relationship is bizarrely abandoned.

 










The other performances are uneven, though I'm not sure how much of that is the script and how much is Winter's direction. On one side is Gad, who fares shockingly well. Noah is a debt-addled, nerdy middle-aged who feels totally emasculated by his inability to get a project off the ground. As someone who has never been swayed by Gad's particular brand of obnoxiously chipper humor, Noah's depressive snark finds him in a much more comfortable register. He takes an insufferable caricature and turns it into a convincingly normal guy, even amidst all the hijinx and bloodshed. Scoledeno, however, is ill-served by a script that gives her plenty of detail but no depth. In addition to covering up a murder or six, Megan obsessively monitors her diabetic son's glucose levels and finds herself stuck at the bad end of a multi-level marketing scheme. Scoledeno is visibly distressed, but Megan's motivations are frustratingly indecipherible until she finally explains herself in voice-over.

All of this is perhaps explained by the core flaw in “Adulthood”'s construction: every arc is defined by if and when someone chooses to lash out in violence, but said violence is always irrational and inertly dramatized. Carrigan is, as always, a game performer. But Bodie, with his room full of swords and adult braces, is the kind of wacky force that requires a clarity of vision and Winter isn't up to the task. The ending is not a twist, but it does backfill psychological information about the nature of the sibling dynamic that would have worked infinitely better if Galvn had found a way to seed these tensions sooner, or Winter a way to dredge them up via performance or mise-en-scene. Despite the premise, the movie is without a clear genre. It is not scary, it is not exciting, I do not even know if I would call it a comedy.

 










Yet I thoroughly enjoyed my time watching “Adulthood.” Whatever you call this type of movie, I find it endearing. I think its snarky faux-nihilism is cute and brings enough energy to the proceedings to paper over its dramatic lurches. I like the eagerness with which every idiosyncratic bit of set design and every minor twist is presented. I like sensing that someone on-screen is about to commit manslaughter and then swear, the way you can tell a rom-com heroine is about to trip by the way she carries a stack of papers. 

I like movies like “Adulthood.” There are plenty of better films just like it. But there are plenty of worse ones, too. Plus, this one doesn't have a single annoying needle drop. That has to count for something!

“Adulthood” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution

Fans of Algernon Cadwallader during their original run claim lifelong bragging rights for having seen them play a late-2000s basement show with sweaty floors and a fisheye-toting Flickr photographer—and they probably have the blown-out YouTube video to prove it. Across the Northeast, the Philadelphia emo band paid its dues at every VFW hall, youth community center, and dilapidated DIY house that opened its doors. In the seven years before they called it quits, Algernon were a refreshingly haphazard and wildly fun live act. The longer the crowd bellowed like a football team to open “Serial Killer Status,” the higher scrawny teens flung themselves to “Katie's Conscious”; the faster the drive home through pitch-black suburbs, the stronger the urge to burn a CD for your friends so you could scream “If fucking up feels right/Then fuck it up” together.

But statistically, the more impressive feat is having seen the band at a music venue with an active permit—bigger capacity, rarer opportunity. By the time Joyce Manor tapped Algernon Cadwallader for a fall 2012 tour, the promise of seeing them play inside a proper establishment felt monumental: Algernon on a raised stage? Through a professional sound system? Walking up to the storied Cambridge club T.T. the Bear's, I remember doubting the run of show on the whiteboard; in what world were Joyce Manor, West Coast pop-punkers getting message-board backlash for their lo-fi pivot, headlining over Algernon, East Coast darlings already being cited as an influence on their peers? Watching with a clear view, mic stands no longer in danger of being knocked over by a sudden convulsion of the crowd, I thought Algernon Cadwallader were poised to blow up. Now that they had a stage, how were they going to use it?

Your guess was as good as theirs. Four days later, Algernon Cadwallader broke up. Members dispersed to Hop Along and Dogs on Acid, and a new wave of emo bands tried to recapture the twinkly guitars and frantic poetics of the soon-to-be-pegged “revival” forefathers. But 14 years after their last album, Algernon Cadwallader finally return to answer the question. Trying Not to Have a Thought is the first LP with their original lineup—vocalist-bassist Peter Helmis, guitarists Joe Reinhart and Colin Mahony, and drummer Nick Tazza—since their 2008 debut-turned-emo classic Some Kind of Cadwallader, and their first release since 2011's Parrot Flies. It's a comeback album that reintroduces four friends who still crave technical prowess and percussive playfulness. More than that, it makes the case for why emo was never just about adolescent angst, but the purity of feeling alive in the present.

Though admired by a range of emo and indie rockers, Algernon Cadwallader originally considered themselves an off-kilter punk band, and they fully embrace that identity on Trying Not to Have a Thought. It's their densest and loudest album, even if each member sounds more controlled on the whole. From the gnarled rock propelling “Shameless Faces (even the guy who made the thing was a piece of shit)” to the artful, ketamine-fueled post-punk of “noitanitsarcorP,” all four members sound energized, focused, and inspired by each other's ideas. “There is no ‘I' in Algernon,” Helmis yells with relief on the title track. It's a testament to the band members' tight bond and how their live shows allow the public to share in it.

In the band's first run, Algernon Cadwallader were sometimes criticized for being too in thrall to their influences: Cap'n Jazz, Joan of Arc, Owls. But even that intended bullet bounces like a rubber band in the emo scene, where the Kinsellas are venerated like saints and simultaneously recognized for how they've continued to evolve as musicians over the years. Algernon would like to attempt the same, and the development of Helmis' vocal tactics on “What's Mine” alone warrants the reunion album: He mumble-speaks like Phil Elverum, switches to pining long notes, and lets melodic hiccups accent his transition from scream-yodel to full-on yell. Meanwhile, Tazza continues the tradition of Analphabetapolothology's childlike percussive loafing by casting a prism of pastel textures over “Koyaanisqatsi” with triangle, shakers, and diaphanous drum patterns.

Reinhart, who also mixed the album, trains the spotlight on the precise jabs of a buttoned-up fencing match with Mahony, his co-guitarist. The two dance around one another in equal volume, light on their feet, with intricate finger-tapping and rhythmic interplay that cherry-picks from Midwest emo, bluegrass, jazz, and fingerstyle guitar. In “You've Always Been Here,” atop Tazza's steady beat and Helmis' bassline, Reinhart and Mahony ramp up until their two guitars sound like four, then six. The intentional frenzy of Algernon Cadwallader's past work is refined into contemplative passages (“What's Mine”) and sugary Pop Rocks explosions (“World of Difference”) that raise your heart rate without mandating participation in the mosh pit. Tempting as it is to credit that melodic punk push as being solely Reinhart's handiwork—he's the band's not-so-secret weapon, a producer for Beach Bunny and Modern Baseball—a closer ear takes notice of the crucial choices Mahony makes in each of his complementary guitar parts.

By waiting to return to the drawing board, Algernon Cadwallader built Trying Not to Have a Thought on their own time and in their own way. The mood is grateful and reflective, but it doesn't dull their unruly style. The title track, the album's centerpiece, introduces an effortless, freewheeling hook that drips with bittersweet nostalgia as Helmis belts mouthfuls like, “I'm trying not to get caught in the backwash of an artificial world constructed by bloodsucking motherfuckers in an anti-social coliseum.” He's having fun, but he's not putting on blinders for the sake of a good time. “Hawk” opens the album by grieving a high school friend: Helmis remembers roughhousing and playing with pocket knives together, never imagining they'd run out of time. “A few of your favorite clothes from your high school wardrobe/Are the closest thing to having you back,” he sings. His bandmates know exactly how to brighten pockets of the song to match Helmis' elegy: “When we had the chance/We did it right.”

In the late 2000s, scene commentators viewed Algernon Cadwallader as nonsensical lyricists who chose imagery over storytelling. Trying Not to Have a Thought goes a long way toward countering that perception. Helmis may sing with a goofy cadence, but he's serious when critiquing wealth disparity, TV brainrot, and American colonialism. In “Million Dollars,” he satirizes the so-called logic of anti-homeless architecture in Portland. On “Attn MOVE,” he turns his attention to Philadelphia's infamous 1985 MOVE bombing, when police dropped explosives on a local Black activist group, killing 11. “Some black clouds never go away,” he reflects. “Just hover in place and change their shape right in front of your face.” The band has expressed regret over its past disengagement from political issues; now, they've found new commitment to push for change and collective understanding. That they do so with the evocative rush of joy, longing, anger, awe—for Algernon Cadwallader, that's called playing the hits.

I'll never get used to Waymos, those driverless taxis rapidly taking over tech hubs like San Francisco and Austin. They're impossible to miss on the road, each conspicuously outfitted with spinning sensors where a sunroof would be, like the world's most expensive dunce cap. It's not exactly that I feel safer among my fellow men; the company says that their fleet is “better than humans at avoiding crashes that result in injuries.” Still, I break into a cold sweat every time I pull up to a red light, turn to the lane next to me, and find that no one is driving the car.

A similar unease pervades the new record from La Dispute. Their first full-length album since 2019's Panorama, No One Was Driving the Car takes its title from a report about a Tesla crash that killed both its passengers in 2021. The vehicle burst into flames as soon as it hit a tree; it took more than 30,000 gallons of water to extinguish its battery. For lyricist and vocalist Jordan Dreyer, exploding autonomous cars are one of many (headless) horsemen of the apocalypse. Across 14 songs split into five “acts” (the first four of which the band released as individual EPs), No One Was Driving the Car surveys societal decay—overdoses on the street, parasitic pyramid schemes, post-industrial blight—and wonders if anyone is at the wheel.

Since the band's inception in Grand Rapids, Mich., over two decades ago, Dreyer's tortured howls have come to personify anguished disinhibition, a death rattle for the unbearably lonely. In the last few years, La Dispute's 2008 song “Such Small Hands” has found a second life as a viral hit on TikTok. Dreyer's lovelorn caterwaul— “I think I saw you in my sleep, darling!” —is the ideal soundtrack for a nervous breakdown. There are still romantic failures on this record, but they've matured into the thorny existential questions that weigh on a long-term commitment: “Are you still having fun? Are you feeling fulfilled?” Dreyer asks on “Self-Portrait Backwards.” But No One Was Driving the Car is also explicitly political, as the band aims its ire at the greed, corruption, and other faceless evils that shape our world.

In La Dispute's hometown, “innovation” has always come with a caveat: once-reliable blue collar jobs vanishing on a corporate executive's whim, an epidemic born from painkillers marketed as “non-addictive,” multilevel marketing companies like Grand Rapids' very own Amway invoking Calvinist doctrine in the name of scamming vulnerable people. The album's centerpiece, the nearly nine-minute “Environmental Catastrophe Film,” traces Grand Rapids' faded past as a furniture manufacturing hub through the lens of a sturdy wooden chair that has outlived the industrial boom from whence it came. “Time goes and we change/Not what we made/But what can be,” Dreyer sings. Time is fluid here, warped by familial spats and dead friends and the persistent beauty of Lake Michigan despite it all.

In fittingly luddite fashion, No One Was Driving the Car is largely built from analog instruments, losing the electronic interludes from Panorama and their latest Here, Hear EP. The band—Dreyer, along with drummer Brad Vander Lugt, guitarists Chad Morgan-Sterenberg and Corey Stroffolino, and bassist Adam Vass—produced the record entirely themselves in New South Wales, Australia, surrounded by a national forest; field recordings of their tropical environs snake their way into the album's final mix. More than its thematic shifts, the album's composition is a distinct, ambitious, and captivating step up for La Dispute: The discordant riffs on “I Shaved My Head” set the tone for the record, with a bluesy bassline that suggests nothing good's ahead. The gentle strumming on “Self-Portait Backwards” and “Saturation Diver” underscores the desperation in Dreyer's lyrics, fingerpicked melodies a foil to the blunt instrument of his voice. There's hints of early Sabbath, Slint, Orchid—a lineage of alienation that La Dispute carries on in the face of modern horrors.

The band, most of whom were raised in the Christian Reform Church (the subject of fellow Grand Rapidian Paul Schrader's First Reformed, which Dreyer cites as a major inspiration for this record), reveals its moral code through religious allegories. There's the woman “narcanned back to life” on Easter Sunday in “Autofiction Detail.” Another, glimpsed through a window, appears as an “archangel” standing over her victim on “Man With Hands And Ankles Bound.” “Landlord Calls the Sheriff In” follows a woman sucked into a pyramid scheme, only to be hit with the extremely Protestant “try a little harder now” when her sales aren't quite meeting the mark. Still, these barons get their due: “No yachts will drift oﬀ when the rapture comes,” Dreyer barks, not the first nor last reference to prophetic resurrection on the record. No One Was Driving the Car is an inspired departure from interpersonal drama in favor of incisive critique, a confident step forward into an uncertain world.

In 2019, Waymo's parent company, Google, made a big announcement: They were planning on investing millions of dollars in “the world's first factory 100 percent dedicated to the mass production of autonomous vehicles” in Michigan, a former auto industry powerhouse. They promised it would create hundreds of jobs, welcome news after General Motors announced the closure of its Detroit factory earlier that year. But those jobs never materialized: The plant quietly ceased operations in early 2025, employing just 60 people at its peak. La Dispute are a band for precisely moments like these, when you've followed empty promises to their inevitable conclusions; when the worst sinners get off scot-free; when the rapture comes and you're still stuck in traffic, surrounded by ghosts behind the wheel.

Mankind, before science, ran on myth. We've always tried to explain the seemingly inexplicable, stretching imagination to fill the gaps: the sun is pulled to and fro by flaming chariots, eclipses are tragic lovers meeting briefly in the sky. This impulse toward legendary expansion is very much present in HAGEN, the second collaboration between Venezuelan guitarist Héctor Tosta, who releases music as I. la Católica, and celebrated Guatemalan experimental cellist Mabe Fratti. Together, they make up the duo Titanic.

This power couple of Mexico City's contemporary avant-garde combine classical training with a punk approach, garnering a reputation for challenging, mind-melting music. (The same could be said of Fratti's acclaimed work as a solo artist.) Titanic, led by Tosta, plays with sound and silence on their second album in the way one might a rubber band: stretching it almost to its breaking point before propelling it forward at full strength. The new songs feel heavy with esoteric weight, in their titles as well as in the way they unfold. Maybe bloom is a better word: Take “Escarbo dimensiones” (“Digging Dimensions”), which grows from just a sparse drumbeat and a few chords supporting Fratti's voice. Into this silence, the song gradually flashes new sounds—a loud drum, a soaring riff. Halfway through, its parts collide, locking into a fast-paced duet between electric guitar and plucked cello. It feels like the supernova that births a world.

Fratti's cello is a key presence throughout. On “Pájaro de fuego” (“Firebird”) it entwines itself with sparkling synth keys, courtesy of Oneothrix Point Never's Daniel Lopatin and Nate Salon, that rise to the pitch of an angelic chorus; perhaps the namesake bird is preparing to be reborn. Lead single “Gotera” (“Leak”) has a raucous chaos at its center, fuzzy and pattering in a way that feels less like a slow drip and more like a torrential downpour. Moments like these are grounded by Fratti's tremulous voice, a shimmer that intones in time with her strings.

The levity in her vocals is a welcome guide through a musical environment that can get quite dense, though never to an extent that makes one want to pull away. “La Gallina degollada” (“The Headless Chicken”), a grimy bass-driven track seemingly referencing Uruguayan writer Horacio Quiroga's classic short horror story about a sister murdered by her siblings, makes use of her voice as a spritely instrument, venturing bravely into the storm and coming back with a wink. She can get cheeky, too. Opening track “Lágrima del sol” (“The Sun's Tear”) starts off HAGEN with a simple request: “Don't ask me for the last cigarette when the world ends.”

Still, the world Titanic has made here isn't all Genesis and Apocalypsis. The throughline, like in any good myth, is cyclical. The music on HAGEN isn't impenetrable, though it is gargantuan. Its scale calls to mind Fratti's recent appearance on “I Can Go,” the closing track of Blood Orange's new Essex Honey. Again, she's a psychopomp guiding us back toward silence as Dev Hynes concludes a journey through grief. She sings in Spanish about the fear we feel when our real path opens before us. Even a route as winding as the one she and Tosta trace on HAGEN can be maneuvered: The height from the top of the mountain where the path leads is nothing short of divine.

	Fifty years ago to the day, Pink Floyd released Wish You Were Here. To celebrate the anniversary of the landmark album, Sony has announced plans for a new box set entitled Wish You Were Here 50 that will be available as three vinyl records, two compact discs, or a Deluxe Box Set. It will also be released digitally.


	The package will contain a new Dolby Atmos Mix of the album, nine studio rarities, and 16 songs recorded at the Los Angeles Sports Arena on April 26, 1975. There is also a hardcover book packed with unseen photographs, a comic book tour programme, and a Knebworth concert poster. For a preview, check out “The Machine Song (Demo #2, Revisited).” It's an early version of “Welcome To The Machine.”


	Other rarities on the set include a new stereo mix of all nine segments of “Shine On Your Crazy Diamond” fused together, an alternate version of “Have a Cigar,” a rendition of “Wish You Were Here” featuring jazz violin great Stéphane Grappelli,” and another take on “Wish You Were Here” with David Gilmour on pedal steel guitar.

	











	The L.A. Sports Arena show was recorded by famed bootlegger Mike “The Mic” Millard. Throughout the Seventies, he used a phony wheelchair to sneak a Nakamichi 550 tape recorder into concerts around Los Angeles. When the lights dimmed, he'd connect the recorder to microphones attached to his hat. Using this method, he captured pristine recordings of shows by Genesis, Rush, Led Zeppelin, Eric Clapton, Yes, and many other giants of the era.

	











	Many of those bands recorded their own concerts using more sophisticated equipment than anything Millard could sneak into arenas, but Pink Floyd made no such efforts.


	“The problem was we just hit a period where everyone was paranoid about bootleggers and we didn't tape shows,” Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason told Rolling Stone in 2018. “It's great we did the Pink Floyd at Pompeii thing, but I'm sorry we never filmed and recorded a Dark Side, Animals, or Wish You Were Here show, really … [From the Animals period], there's certainly nothing really good, just sort of monitor mixes and so on. We really should have done the whole thing, filmed and recorded it properly.”

	Earlier this month, David Gilmour elaborated on the issue in an interview with Rolling Stone. “There are many, many mixing desk tapes which would, in the Seventies, have been done to cassette,” he said. “And later on in the Eighties and Nineties were done to DAT, but they are just straight off the mixing desk. But we did record most shows just sound-wise, and God knows where all those tapes are. I guess they are now in the hands of Sony [since they recently purchased the Pink Floyd catalog]. So, you have to persuade them to have a look.”


	It seems like they did just that and concluded that Millard created a better tape than any mixing desk cassette in the vault. The audio has been restored and remastered by Steven Wilson. (May the record state that back in 2021, we encouraged Pink Floyd to release this exact L.A. Forum recording by Millard. Sadly, Millard didn't live to see the day when his tape was included on an official Floyd release. He died in 1994.)

“The review you had on Shark Sandwich, which was merely a two word review, just said ‘Shit Sandwich.'”


“Where'd they print that? That's not real. They can't print that!”


	No, it's not as bad as Shark Sandwich. Let's accentuate the positive here. When you're a die-hard fan of a band, you tend to look at the lesser albums with a sort of bigger-picture viewpoint, and come to love the valleys as well as the peaks. Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer had all been kicking around for a while, writing sketch comedy and performing in National Lampoon stage shows and bursting through Laverne and Shirley's apartment door, before they created a fictional metal group still living the sex, drugs, and rock & roll dream. They were known by many names: the Originals, the New Originals, the Thamesmen. You know them as Spinal Tap. Along with director Rob Reiner, who joined in by playing documentarian — or, if you will, “rockumentarian” — Marty DiBergi, the quartet created This Is Spinal Tap, a fake vérité portrait of a fake band that became a real band, and gave birth to both a genre and a genuine classic.

	











	Reiner would direct dozens of other movies, from The Princess Bride to Misery to A Few Good Men. Guest became a filmmaker in his own right, popularizing the mockumentary format they had pioneered. McKean has graced any number of projects over the years; his turn on Better Call Saul is canon-worthy. Harry Shearer is still doing his radio show, Le Show, and continues to do voice work for an animated series whose name escapes us. The three musicians toured as Tap occasionally over the years, and collaborated on a number of similarly deadpan projects. None of their other work, arguably, has had the seismic impact or inspires the same insane quotability as This Is Spinal Tap. (OK, well, maybe The Simpsons.) It's their Live at Budokan, their Pet Sounds, their Dark Side of the Moon.

Spinal Tap II: The End Continues is the sequel that many of us have waited for, if not exactly the sequel we wanted. It's amusing rather than hilarious, gently ribbing rather than gutbusting. A colleague compared this late-act follow-up to a modest dessert rather than a meal; we'd say it's closer to an after-dinner mint served with the check. What made the original work so beautifully, besides the sheer genius of all four major participants and a supporting cast that completely got the joke, was the way they understood the excess and ridiculousness of what rock had become by the mid-1980s. They had enough knowledge and, more important, affection for it to mock it. Here, there's nothing really left except the affection. The laughs do not go to 11. They stop somewhere around the Roman numeral II.

	And yet! Much like the legacy acts that reunite, sometimes for the paycheck and sometimes simply for old times' sake, the gents are happy to trot out the hits one more time. Occasionally, a fleet-fingered solo emerges that reminds you why you fell in love with them originally. Hearing that the boys are reuniting for one final show due to a longstanding contractual issue, Marty DiBergi decides to pick up where he left off 41 years ago. A lot has happened since then. The Tap members have not spoken to one another, much less played together, in 15 years. Everyone's moved on. Nigel now runs a cheese shop. Derek has opened up the New Museum of Glue, a museum devoted to, um, glue. David has kept himself busy by playing in a mariachi band in Morro Bay, California, composing “please hold” music for companies, and writing a memoir. The latter, he tells DiBergi, was motivated by his reading of “Bruce's book, I Am Springsteen, Going on Sprevensteen.” (That's one of the funnier lines.)

	So, though the bad blood remains, they decide to honor the wishes of Hope Faith (Kerry Godliman), daughter of their late manager Ian Faith, and avoid a lawsuit. They convene in a house in New Orleans — not called the Rising Sun, for the record — and begin rehearsing. A number of famous drummers turn down the chance to play with Tap, what with the high mortality rate and all. Thankfully, a young woman named Didi (Valerie Franco), who's a monster on the skins, takes the gig. DiBergi catches up with “the hostess with the mostess” Bobbi Fleckman (Fran Drescher) and their A&R guy Artie Fufkin (Paul Schaffer). Paul McCartney drops by to play “Cups and Cakes” with them. So does Elton John, who takes over the vocal duties on “Stonehenge.” Everyone loves it, except for the show's producer Simon Howler (The Thick of It‘s Chris Addison). He thinks Sir Elton is adding a bit too much piano.

	Rock is supposedly no country for old men, but no one seems to have told these guys. There are a lot of jokes about Tap not exactly being in their prime, and you wonder if the fictional bitching about creaky joints and aching bones doesn't reflect the cast's own feelings about being up there in years. When the concert finally does happen, fences are mended, old wounds are healed, and … let's just say that the band's unlucky streak regarding live performances has not gone away. Before things go awry, however, you see the sold-out crowd basking in the glow of these living legends. Older fans get their nostalgia fix. Younger fans who missed them the first time around finally get a chance to hear “Big Bottom” in all of its low-end glory. The same applies to the audiences offscreen as well.

	“Time is weird,” Mitch Rowland says, speaking for a lot of dads. A few years ago, he was just a shy Midwest guitar dude working at an L.A. pizzeria, washing dishes. Then he met Harry Styles, and suddenly became the wingman to one of the world's biggest pop stars. These days, he lives out in the English countryside, where he made his superb new indie-folk gem Whistling Pie. He even demoed the songs with his father-in-law at the family farm — in a chicken shed.


	But Rowland is right at home moving between musical worlds. Whistling Pie is a homemade album of acoustic ballads, inspired by his hero, the late British folk guitarist Bert Jansch. As on his 2023 debut, Come June, you can hear traces of Nick Drake and Elliott Smith in Rowland's gentle vocals and delicate guitar. The songs are meditations on time and memory. As he says, with his soft-spoken laugh, “The big difference between the two albums is having kids, and not having time.”


	The album is a family affair: Rowland made Whistling Pie with his drummer and collaborator Sarah Jones, the rock goddess from Harry's band. The couple met in rehearsals when they hooked up with Harry for his 2017 solo debut, after the end of One Direction. They fell in love, got married, and moved to the tiny English village where she grew up, with their two little sons.

	











	The music is full of that rustic atmosphere. “It's a luxury for me to be a songwriter out in that part of the green world, rather than kind of grinding away in L.A.,” Rowland says. “It's a pure choice — this is where we've decided to parent, so it makes sense artistically.” As the old song goes, you know it's not the same as it was.

	











	They live out in the British countryside, in the West Midlands. “It's way out in the Cotswolds region,” he says. “One of the greenest areas — it's not cool, which to me is what makes it cool. There's a lot of tradesmen, but songwriters… There's not loads of them. Just woods. And pubs.”

	Rowland wrote these tunes surrounded by that pastoral beauty. “I made these demos with Sarah's dad, because we're right down the lane from her parents,” he says. “He and I would go into the studio he built in the chicken shed — the same shed where Sarah learned to play drums when she was a little girl. He's such a music lover. He's 75, but he was like, ‘All right, a bottle of wine, let's go.'” In fact, as he learned, the area has a proud music heritage. “Mott the Hoople is the most notable,” Rowland says. “I suppose I have to mention Ellie Goulding is from there. But let's stick with Mott the Hoople.”


	When he met Styles, Mitch was a small-town guy from Ohio, an indie rocker who knew nothing about the pop world. Harry was already a megastar, but with zero interest in following any kind of conventional career formula. In quintessential Midwest fashion, Mitch didn't even quit his day job at the pizzeria until two weeks into the sessions. But they've been together ever since, collaborating on all Harry's albums, including the blockbuster Harry's House, which won a Grammy for Album of the Year at the 2023 awards. Fans delight in these two as an odd couple, yet they share a unique musical chemistry. “There's a magic to Mitch, past him being so good,” Styles once told Rolling Stone. “I feel like he represents a kind of magic to me.”


	As with Come June, he made Whistling Pie working closely with producer Rob Schnapf, who's made classics in the Nineties with Beck and Elliott Smith. The band is an intimate collaboration: Schnapf on guitar, Jones on drums, and engineer Matt Schuessler on upright bass. They recorded at Rockfield Studios, on a Welsh farm. “I wanted to make the album in the countryside,” Rowland says. “I wanted to capture everything on the spot, instead of taking these songs to L.A. But with Rob and Matt, I was nervous to get these city guys out to Wales. At their studio, it's like, ‘Where are we ordering from tonight? What's the best pizza in L.A.?' All that shit that you start caring about. And out here it was like, ‘Someone's going to cook, and then we're going back to work.' We just kept working until we were saying ‘good morning' to the horses at 7 a.m.”

	One of the most powerful songs is “Be Your Man,” an intimately emotional tune with a long arc in his life. “I wrote it in a parking lot, when I was 20,” Rowland says. “I was going to this treatment facility for an eating disorder, so I'd stop in the lot and smoke as many cigarettes as possible before I'd go in. And one morning I wrote ‘Be Your Man' behind the steering wheel.” The song came back to him years later, despite its traumatic origin. “No one asks for it — it just happens,” he adds. “But I guess it's something do with that song. Certain moments make certain songs, and that was one of them. I was at this stop sign in life, and I can easily look back at that time and think, ‘Oh, well, I'm not that different from that person with all the stuff that was going on.' It's weird how songs can say more than I'm able to.”


	His original guitar inspiration back then was Ben Harper, who's now one of his friends and collaborators. “The first time I saw Ben, I didn't know who he was, but I went because my friend had an extra ticket. Then I went out and bought every CD of his. That only happens a few times in life. And that song was me emulating him. I can't remember finger-picking before I started listening to Ben Harper.”


	“Really Ready” sums up the album's domestic spirit. Its origin story is a classic parable of modern parenthood: Mitch found an old demo on his phone, while frantically trying to free up space for photos. “I'm trying to take a picture of my kids,” he recalls. “So I gotta get rid of a hundred things first, so my camera will turn on.” He came across a riff he'd captured on video years earlier. “I wrote it when I was new in London, at Harry's flat — Harry didn't live there, but I just kept the water running. This song was one of hundreds of unfinished ideas, but for some reason I always remembered it. Every time I'd go to delete and make more room, I'd come across it and think, ‘That's kinda cool.'”


	That thought also evokes the way technology interferes with our emotional lives. “Oh, man — I hate my new phone,” he says. “Why do I need a new phone that does the same shit as the old phone? What's the next app I need to delete so I can take pictures of my kids? This summer I went to see Neil Young at Hyde Park, but I had to delete pictures to download an app. I'm on the guest list — I need an app? How many songs am I gonna lose having to get this app?”

	











	They're a modern rock & roll family on the road. For Rowland's great 2024 solo tour, their toddler son came along, as he'd done on the Harry's House tour, watching his folks onstage. (Their younger son was still a few months away from being born.)


	“Harry made it possible for us to tour as a family,” he says. “We had all those moments like, ‘What the fuck are we doing taking a five-month-old on a bus? Are we stupid?' But for so many people, it's a way of life. I take advice from Ben Harper, who's raised his kids on the road. Our son is so socialized — always jumping into the mix, immediately talking to other kids — and I think that has to be down to taking him on the road, or else he'd be a bit more on the shy side. Right? I was so shy when I was his age. Thank goodness for Modelo.”


	This is the family that plays together — the little boys have one-string toy guitars shaped like tigers, so they can join in. A few years ago, Rowland and Jones took their then-toddler to the Green Man festival, the famous folk gathering in the Welsh countryside. But having grown up at Harry shows, their child kept screaming. “He thought that's just what you do at a concert,” Mitch says. “We had to say, ‘This is folk music, son. This is not Wembley.'”


	As you might expect, both kids are pop fans. “He's really into Chappell Roan at the moment, which made me as a parent realize, ‘Shit, am I more of a Chappell Roan fan than a Sabrina Carpenter fan?' I think I'm leaning more to Chappell. I texted Harry, ‘They're great.' He was like, ‘Yeah, yeah — I think you're right there.'”


	It's been three and a half years since Harry's House — enough time for Mitch and Sarah to come up with two albums and two kids — and Rowland praises Chappell for not banging out a quickie follow-up to her big album. “People don't know how to go away, do they?” he asks. “Do people just live in a panic state of, like, ‘I need to do more'? Not even in terms of popular, but just in general — ‘I need to do more.' People romanticize being over-prolific. Why can't they just savor it? It can really work for people not doing anything.”


	He pauses. “All this just to say, ‘Take your time, Chappell Roan. Do it for my kids. Stretch it out.'”


	But that's part of the mystique of his organic collaboration with Styles. Musical inspiration has its own natural timing. “When we were finishing Fine Line, we were working in the same studio as Liam Gallagher,” Rowland recalls. “He was like, ‘I gotta fucking hand it to Harry. He's not fucking about. He made one record, now he's getting right back in making another.' And then after that he made another straightaway.”

Fine Line was a massive success, yet Harry's House was a phenomenon even by previous standards, while “As It Was” spent 15 weeks sat Number One in the U.S. But there was no rush to jump right back in to bang out another. “No, it was kind of the opposite,” Rowland says, citing Styles' famously obsessive full-immersion studio process. “Making those albums, it felt like he was going inward — or maybe we were all going inward, and we couldn't imagine doing anything else. With him, it's not like a flash in the pan, ‘let's book two weeks and bang it out.' It's like, ‘Let's live in it. We're a stew.'”


	That's the same process that Rowland brings to his own music, whether he's playing in a chicken shed or Wembley. “The thing that makes me want to make music is Bert Jansch,” Rowland says. “The first time I saw him, it was just him sitting in a chair, with his acoustic guitar. And to me, that's still the ideal. That's the mountain for me to climb. I want to be good enough to need a chair onstage one day.”

	The rise of Make America Healthy Again arrived with big promises for kids: an end to chronic disease, a focus on nutrition and healthier school meals. For school food professionals and public health advocates, it seemed like an unexpected win that could benefit the millions of children who rely on federal school meals, often the most nutritious — and sometimes the only reliable — food they receive all day. That push to improve children's health from a Republican administration was all the more surprising, considering the political attacks Michelle Obama endured when she campaigned to improve school nutrition.


	But those hopes are colliding with reality. Despite MAHA's rhetoric, the Trump administration has cut programs supporting children's health and school nutrition. In March, the U.S. Department of Agriculture abruptly canceled the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement and Local Food for Schools programs, which together provided more than $1 billion to help schools and food banks buy produce, meat and dairy from local farms and ranches.

	











	For food service directors like Kim Sieck in Iowa's Gri​​nnell-Newburg school district, the fallout was immediate. Without farm-to-school funds, she can no longer add better tasting, locally sourced, nutrient dense microgreen sprouts to the fruit and vegetable bar, a hit with the kids and a win for anyone who has tried to get a child to eat vegetables. Gone also is the farm-fresh corn she served with a chicken pot pie bowl and the apples from a local orchard, which she used as an educational opportunity: “We explained this apple is different from what you get at the store. It came straight from the tree. It may have a few bumps, and it's not bright red because it doesn't have all that wax on it to preserve it.”

	Marlene Schwartz, director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy, was baffled by the cuts. “The basic idea of supporting farmers, especially smaller farmers, and having them work closely with local school systems isn't a Democrat or Republican idea. It's just a good idea,” she said.

	As the school year begins, nutrition experts warn that the administration's policies contradict the stated MAHA agenda. Ending the farm-to-school food programs undermines local economies and limits access to local produce, dairy, and meat. President Donald Trump's signature “Big Beautiful” legislation also includes deep cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and Medicaid benefits, depriving children access to medical care and food stamp benefits. When those reductions take effect in 2027, they will also limit access to healthy food at school: Eligibility for discounted meals is tied to SNAP participation. 


	The contradictions extend to the MAHA Commission, chaired by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and established to tackle childhood diseases like diabetes and obesity. In May the commission released its first report asserting that chronic disease among children is at an all-time high, the result of kids consuming mostly ultraprocessed foods. The report, which initially won praise from both sides of the aisle for its critique of the U.S. food system, was undermined when media reports revealed that it included false and misleading research. In August Politico published a leaked second commission report that it called “friendly to the food and ag industries” and characterized as failing to propose strategies to reduce pesticide use or consumption of ultraprocessed foods. According to the White House, the official report offers a policy map to improve children's health and is set to be released this week. 


	Trump's embrace of Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic who promotes fringe ideas like urging fast food chains to use beef tallow as a healthier option to cook french fries, forged a connection between the MAGA movement and the wellness world. MAHA mom activists are a big constituent of that alliance; they want artificial petroleum-based dyes out of their food, pesticide-free produce, as well as the freedom to choose whether to vaccinate their children. Nutrition experts say ridding food of artificial dyes and pesticides is a worthy but ambitious goal that requires an expensive overhaul of the U.S. food system, which is driven more by business interests than public health.

	Improving school nutrition is a far more attainable and important target, advocates say. But they worry Kennedy's open hostility toward school meal programs — coupled with cuts to SNAP and local farm to school programs — will impact the nutritional quality of school meals. 


	In May during an event at Texas A&M with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, Kennedy said, “School lunch programs have deteriorated where about 70 percent of the food that our children eat is ultraprocessed food, which is killing them. It is poison. We need to stop poisoning our kids and making sure that Americans are once again the healthiest kids on the planet.”


	School food experts say Kennedy's critique fails to acknowledge the complex logistics of food procurement and the care that goes into school lunches, as well as their nutritional value. The quality of school meals varies widely by district and state, but unlike grocery stores or restaurants, they are required to meet federal nutritional guidelines, explained Schwartz of the Rudd Center for Food Policy. Even without access to local farm products, schools are still required to provide fresh fruits and vegetables. 


	“Research shows school meals are the healthiest meals that children are eating because they're required to offer fruits and vegetables, milk, whole grains, and because they're required to meet limits on sodium, calories and fat and added sugars,” said Diane Pratt-Heavner, a spokesperson for the nonprofit school nutrition professional organization the School Nutrition Association. “Now is not the time to be cutting back these programs. It's time to invest in them.” 


	School food advocates worry more budget cuts may halt progress made since the 2010 passage of Michelle Obama's Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act, which added more fruit, vegetables and whole grains in school cafeterias, while setting limits on sodium, sugar, and fat.


	“That act significantly improved the quality of school meals,” said Marion Nestle, professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. “The pushback on what [Michelle Obama] tried to do with school meals was ferocious, and it came from Republicans. And so that's the great irony, is that they say they're doing exactly what she did, except she was focused on something important, and they're focusing on color additives. … That's the problem with the MAHA movement: It sounds good, but it's embedded in an administration that's doing exactly the opposite.”  

	











	Kennedy touts success in convincing ice cream manufacturers to remove color additives and the Coca-Cola Company's introduction of a new version of Coke that uses cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup — moves that Nestle has called “nutritionally hilarious,” since soda  and ice cream still pose the same chronic health risks despite the ingredient tweaks. 


	And when it comes to school meals, major suppliers like Tyson and General Mills have already made strides in reducing artificial colors and flavors in their K-12 products, according to the School Nutrition Association's Pratt-Heavner. School districts rely on those multinational food companies out of budgetary necessity, she added. 


	“People say, ‘Oh, you're serving chicken nuggets.' They think we just open a box, throw it on a tray and throw it in the oven,” said food service director Sieck. “Well, ours may be a processed chicken product, but it's still a healthier version. It has less sodium and fat, and whole grain breading, and we're also making sure students are being offered a variety of fruits and vegetables too. You don't get that at McDonald's.” 


	The deeper problem is funding. Meghan Maroney, who leads federal child nutrition program initiatives at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said that changing school food systems is painstaking work. “It's not just about the food industry reformulating, but distributors that work with schools need to have products schools can purchase,” she said.


	The gold standard for preparing nutritious school meals is cooking from scratch. According to the 2023 USDA Farm to School Census study, less  than a quarter of school meals involve what school nutrition professionals call “scratch cooking.” (In some states, like California, the percentage of scratch meals is higher.) “Folks working in schools would love to do more scratch cooking. They are clamoring for that, but that requires more funding,” Maroney said.

	“I will say, there's been a lot of talk among the MAHA folks about removing harmful dyes and additives. Those are the kinds of buzzwords coming out of the movement. We think that's an important part of making school meals healthy, but that's just one piece of a larger puzzle,” said Lori Nelson, chief school food operations officer at the Chef Ann Foundation, which helps schools incorporate more scratch cooking into their food programs. “When you're able to purchase food that's whole and not processed, you know what's in it. You don't have to screen for any of these laundry lists of ingredients you can't pronounce. That seems like the easiest answer.”

	











	But Nelson admits that kind of radical change won't happen overnight. In the meantime, she said, “School food professionals are going to continue to do what they've always done. They're going to pivot, they're going to adapt, they're going to keep the meals going out to the kids.”

Jimmy Kimmel used his monologue on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Thursday night to respond to the death of Charlie Kirk and to discuss why Donald Trump‘s reaction has been so problematic.


	Kimmel described Kirk's shooting death earlier this week as “a senseless murder.” “His death has amplified our anger, our differences,” Kimmel said. “And I've seen a lot of extraordinarily vile responses to this from both sides of the political spectrum. Some people are cheering this, which is something I won't ever understand. We had another school shooting yesterday in Colorado, the hundredth one of the year.”


	He continued, “With all of these terrible things happening, you would think that our president would at least make an attempt to bring us together. But he didn't.” 


	Kimmel shared a series of X posts from past presidents, including Barack Obama and George W. Bush. “President Obama did,” Kimmel said. “President Biden did. Presidents Bush and Clinton did. President Trump did not. Instead, he blamed Democrats for their rhetoric. The man who told a crowd of supporters that maybe the Second Amendment people should do something about Hillary Clinton. The man who said he wouldn't mind if someone shot through the fake news media. The man who unleashed a mob on the Capitol, and said Liz Cheney should face nine barrels shooting at her for supporting his opponent, blames the radical left for their rhetoric.”

	











	Kirk was shot dead Wednesday while speaking to students at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. The right-wing political influencer and activist, who co-founded Turning Point USA to foster a culture of conservatism on school campuses around the nation, was 31. News of Kirk's death generated shock throughout the U.S. political ecosystem. 

	











	Following his death, Kimmel posted on Instagram, encouraging people to respond thoughtfully. “Instead of the angry finger-pointing, can we just for one day agree that it is horrible and monstrous to shoot another human?” Kimmel wrote. “On behalf of my family, we send love to the Kirks and to all the children, parents, and innocents who fall victim to senseless gun violence.”

	Stephen Colbert also addressed the incident on The Late Show earlier this week, noting, “I am old enough to personally remember the political violence of the 1960s, and I hope it is obvious to everyone in America that political violence does not solve any of our political differences. Political violence only leads to more political violence. And I pray with all my heart that this is the aberrant action of a madman and not a sign of things to come.” 


	On Thursday night, Colbert added a “message of unity” to his monologue. “However you feel about his politics, he was a young father of two small children and an American who has the constitutional right to express his opinion in safety,” Colbert said. “It should go without saying that violence is never the answer to political disagreement.”

	The conversation around the assassination of right-wing activist and Donald Trump ally Charlie Kirk on Wednesday during a campus event at Utah Valley University has been fiery, to say the least. Graphic footage of 31-year-old Kirk, a husband and father of two young children, being fatally shot in the neck has gone mega-viral, inflaming passions on all sides. With no suspect in custody, the public has imagined a full spectrum of deranged political motives for the killing. Prominent members of the MAGA movement are using Kirk's death to call for a “civil war” with leftists they accuse of inciting violence. And the Republican establishment — along with a fair number of Democrats — are mourning him as a martyr for the American values of debate and civic engagement, even while critics argue that he was often divisive and extreme.


	Some of those critics have already faced severe consequences. Matthew Dowd, a political analyst for MSNBC, found himself out of a job today after on-air comments about Kirk in the immediate wake of the shooting, long before confirmation of Kirk's death. Dowd had observed in a Wednesday appearance on the liberal-leaning cable news channel that Kirk was “constantly sort of pushing this sort of hate speech aimed at certain groups.” He added, “I always go back to: Hateful thoughts lead to hateful words which lead to hateful actions. And I think that's the environment we're in.” The network cut ties with Dowd, who apologized on his Bluesky account, while MSNBC president Rebecca Kutler issued a separate statement: “During our breaking news coverage of the shooting of Charlie Kirk, Matthew Dowd made comments that were inappropriate, insensitive, and unacceptable,” she said. “We apologize for his statements, as has he. There is no place for violence in America, political or otherwise.” (Dowd also had a university speaking engagement canceled.)

	The irony of this termination and a slew of similar firings over the past 24 hours is that Kirk and Turning Point USA, the conservative youth group he co-founded, branded themselves as the ultimate defenders of free speech. In a June debate at the Oxford Union, during a tour of the U.K. in which he condemned the country for its “totalitarian” censorship of its citizens, he argued, “You should be allowed to say outrageous things.” Last year, Kirk posted on X: “Hate speech does not exist legally in America. There's ugly speech. There's gross speech. There's evil speech. And ALL of it is protected by the First Amendment. Keep America free.”

	Yet his supporters, regardless of their stated ideals of free expression and complaints about “cancel culture,” have been swift to exact retribution against those who have intimated that Kirk was a dangerous ideologue or effectively brought a violent end upon himself. Far-right social media figures, including Laura Loomer, Enrique Tarrio, the pseudonymous “Catturd,” and Chaya Raichik (author of the anti-LGBTQ account “LibsOfTikTok”), have sought to identify and expose individuals either speaking negatively of Kirk's effect on political discourse or seemingly celebrating his murder. An anonymously run website called Charlie's Murderers has served as a hub for personal information, including employment details, about people allegedly endorsing the assassination. A college administrator named on the site has lost her job, while others have received death threats. Many have been targeted for pointing out that Kirk in 2023 said, “It's worth to [sic] have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights.”


	Charlie Rock, a public relations coordinator for the NFL‘s Carolina Panthers, apparently alluded to this comment of Kirk's in a post on his personal Instagram account on Wednesday. “Why are yall sad? Your man said it was worth it,” he wrote, including a reference to the song “Protect Ya Neck,” by the Wu-Tang Clan. A source disclosed today to The New York Times that the Panthers subsequently fired Rock. “The views expressed by our employees are their own and do not represent those of the Carolina Panthers,” the organization shared in a post on X. “We do not condone violence of any kind.

	Much of Kirk's inflammatory rhetoric has come in for reevaluation as America debates his legacy. He had called for a complete halt to immigration into the U.S., amplified the racist “Great Replacement” conspiracy theory, said that abortion bans should not make exceptions for rape even for girls as young as 10 years old, expressed his fear that Black airline pilots are unqualified, attacked Marin Luther King Jr. (while calling the Civil Rights Act of 1964 a “huge mistake“), declared that “Islam is not compatible with Western civilization,” stood against LGBTQ+ rights, amplified the fake 2024 narrative about Haitian immigrants in Ohio stealing and eating local pets, spread medical misinformation during the Covid-19 pandemic (at one point falsely touting hydroxychloroquine as a “100 percent effective” cure for the disease), and advocated for a form of Christian nationalism that would end the separation between church and state.

	











	Kirk was known for peddling these views at college campuses, which he viewed as illiberal and repressive environments that stifled dissent and controversial ideas. Now, educators and scholastic administrators across the country are being fired or suspended for speaking their minds on him. Laura Sosh-Lightsy, assistant dean of students at Middle Tennessee State University, was terminated for posting on Facebook that she had “ZERO sympathy” for Kirk, and that he “spoke his fate into existence,” after Sen. Marsha Blackburn drew attention to these online remarks and demanded her firing. (Shosh-Lightsy had been at the school for more than 20 years.) The University of Mississippi, meanwhile, fired an unidentified employee who allegedly reshared an Instagram post disparaging Kirk as a white supremacist and concluded, “I have no prayers to offer Kirk or respectable statements against violence.”

	An elementary school teacher in Florida was suspended from her position for posting an article about Kirk's death on her Facebook page and writing, “This may not be the obituary [w]e were all hoping to wake up to, but this is a close second for me.” (The state's education commissioner, Anastasios Kamoutsas, warned teachers today in a memo that they were monitoring such statements. “We will hold teachers who choose to make disgusting comments about the horrific assassination of Charlie Kirk accountable,” he wrote.) Two teachers in Massachusetts were likewise placed on leave for unspecified posts regarding Kirk's death. A Virginia teacher has been suspended for taking to Facebook to say of the assassination, “I hope he suffered through all of it.” And the Oklahoma State Department of Education has said it is investigating a middle school educator who posted “disgraceful rhetoric” in the wake of the deadly shooting.


	Calls for these punitive actions hardly appear in line with Kirk's purported philosophy of open discussion and absolutist protections for incendiary or offensive speech. Suddenly, however, a MAGA coalition that has long insisted on their right to demonize and threaten marginalized communities, joke and fantasize about violent attacks on their enemies, and push conspiracy theories to justify an authoritarian agenda is outraged that other Americans would dare to voice their contempt for a slain hero of reactionary conservatism. As ever, the hypocrisy is no less galling for being entirely predictable.

A senior navy officer has spoken out on the bizarre incident where he saw multiple UFOs. 

Before you start fearing that alien overlords are coming to get you, it is important to note what a UFO is...

It stands for unidentified flying object, so it can essentially be anything that you can't identify - well, so long as it flies. But with that said, certain encounters can prove eerie.

US Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins had one of those encounters and has spoken out about what he saw on February 15, 2023.

Advert

Wiggins was even able to convince a doubting radar officer that what he was seeing was real and strange.

Recounting the incident, Wiggins spoke to the New York Post and said he saw the first UFO emerge seamlessly out of the ocean.

Wiggins clarified he was speaking to the outlet on his own behalf, not as a representative of the navy.

Advert

He said: “From my observations, it did in fact come from the water.

“It was first seen on radar and once I saw it on radar, I wanted to confirm visually what I was seeing on radar if it was clouds and atmospherics and something else.”

Wiggins noted that he then changed his position, moving to the core bridge wing of the ship he was on, the USS Jackson, and tried to decide on what he was looking at.

However, he said he was convinced it was not made with standard human technology based on an odd maneuver it made.

Advert

The 21-year navy veteran admitted he had seen nothing like it.

He added: “It [was] rising into the air high enough to where I'm like, alright, that's definitely: A. too fast and B. not something I've seen before.”

He said he saw three other objects moving in coordination away from the ship and reported the unknown objects to a tactical officer before attempting to view the UFO on a Sapphire radar.

Earlier this year a video recording of the Sapphire radar tracking the UFOs went viral on social media after first being published by George Knapp and Jeremy Corbell on the WEAPONIZED podcast.

Advert

Wiggins explained that he faced some apprehension after he tried to convince other navy men that he had seen something strange.

On the radar the UFOs appeared as oval shaped black spots, moving up and down with ease before meeting with three other shapes.

Wiggins said one of his shipmates thought it was a plane but he had a ‘checkmate moment'.

Advert

He explained: “In utilizing the Sapphire system, you're able to see silhouettes and heat signatures of different objects. So, in relation to the tic-tacs – once it went away at near instantaneous speed, we had some skeptics in ICC-1.

“About 30, 45 seconds pass, and I see an incoming or a passing by commercial aircraft. And so I tell the CSM, slew into that aircraft around the same location, and lo and behold, you see the air signature coming off the back. You see the wings perfectly. You see the tailwing. The side wings. You see the shape of the nose of the aircraft. You see it perfectly.

“It was kind of like ‘Checkmate,' and he sat back down. Even if I were to second-guess myself [before], I no longer could.”

Footage of a Hellfire missile from an MQ-9 Reaper drone hitting a mysterious orb near Yemen has once again triggered chatter about UFOs. One scientist thinks it was not an alien object, but a Samad drone launched by Yemen.

A Congressional hearing on September 9 saw a video showing an Unidentified Anomalous Object (UAP) being hit by the Hellfire missile shot from an MQ-9 Reaper drone. Despite being struck, the object continues to move, as seen in the video. This footage was shared by Rep. Eric Burlison, who got it from an anonymous whistleblower. But was it really a UFO? Or could it be a man-made weapon? Harvard scientist Avi Loeb, who is known for his views on extraterrestrial life, thinks that this UAP was a drone fired by Yemen towards Israel. The video is dated October 30, 2024 and was shot off the coast of Yemen, Loeb says. The MQ-9 Reaper remotely piloted aircraft is armed with a variety of weapons, including AGM-114 Hellfire missiles. He cited news reports to state that on October 29, the Yemeni Houthis announced that they had attacked Southern Israel with multiple drones. Loeb says that this reasonably hints at the possibility that this UAP was a drone. Also Read: 'No way, not going to happen': Acting NASA chief Duffy says China will not beat US to the Moon

The reason why he does not think this object is of extraterrestrial origin is that its size is consistent with the Samad drones the Houthis use. Also, he points to its speed and movement. Loeb wrote in his blog that at about 20 seconds in the video, the Hellfire missile hits the object, but only manages to scrape off a few pieces as the warhead failed to detonate. He says that given the size and dimension of the Hellfire missile, which has a mass of about 45 kilograms, the UAP appears to be ""a few meters in size."" He says this is about the same scale as the Samad drones, which weigh ""about 200 kilograms, about 4.4 times larger than the mass of the Hellfire missile."" Also Read: WHAT! Earth has been sharing its orbit with a cosmic body for 60 years. We have only now seen it

However, the missile moves much faster than the drone. He says that looking at the video, the Hellfire missile ""is moving about 6 times faster than the target in the video's projection. The known speed of the Samad drones goes up to about 70 meters per second, which is about a sixth of the speed of a Hellfire missile."" Loeb says going by this data, the size and speed of the UAP hints at the likelihood that it wasn't a UFO, but a Samad drone launched by the Houthis.

A video shown Tuesday in a House hearing appears to capture a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone firing a Hellfire missile at an unidentified aerial object off Yemen in 2024.

Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., presented the 50-second clip during a session of the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, which is reviewing unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP).

Below is the video I revealed in our @GOPoversight UAP hearing today, made available to the public for the first time.

The footage, recorded on October 30, 2024, and provided by a whistleblower, shows a Reaper tracking an object described as an “orb.” A second drone, which is not seen in the video, fires a missile that strikes the object, causing it to break apart.

“It looks like the debris was taken with it,” Burlison said. “I'm not going to speculate what it is, but the question is why are we being blocked from this information consistently?”

The Pentagon has not confirmed the video. “We do not have anything to provide on this,” a U.S. defense official told The War Zone.

The House hearing, titled “Restoring Public Trust Through UAP Transparency and Whistleblower Protection,” was the third UAP-focused congressional hearing in three years.

In 2024, the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office reported that most recorded UAP cases involved balloons, birds, or drones, and stated it found “no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity or technology.”

The siblings will be locked in together in some of the most haunted places in the UK

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

Daisy May And Charlie Cooper's NightWatch, a new factual entertainment series looking at paranormal activity, is to air on BBC Two and iPlayer.

The six-part series will see the siblings, who are best known for BBC mockumentary sitcom This Country, reunite as they are locked in together in some of the reputedly most haunted places in the country.

The pair said: “We've both had a brush with the paranormal, and really do love the concept of life after death, so we thought this could be the perfect way to prove to the world that we're not delusional.

“It will be a miracle if we both come out alive and well.”

The show will see them visit locations such as historic castles and Victorian prisons, with each episode beginning with a tour around the place they will be staying where the pair learn about its ghost stories, before they are left alone and a countdown clock to dawn begins.

The series will start at the closed down HMP Gloucester, close to the Coopers' hometown, where they will spend the night shut in a small cell, before they move on to locations such as an old pub frequented by highwaymen in Cannock Chase, bat infested ruins in Herefordshire, and a cinema in York.

During their time locked in together, the pair will reflect on family life, sibling rivalry and their career.

Catherine Catton, BBC head of factual entertainment and events, said: “We are really looking forward to spending the night with Daisy May and Charlie Cooper in some of the UK's spookiest places.”

Lisa Clark, executive producer, added: “Working with Daisy May and Charlie in some of the spookiest buildings in the UK was terrifying – but also a lot of fun.”

Each episode will last 30 minutes, with a release date yet to be announced.

SpectreVision, the production company behind such films as Mandy, Color Out of Space, and A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night, is teaming with Oni Press to investigate the in-between in High Strangeness.

The prestige formatted, double-sized, five-part experiment in comic book launches on October 8 with High Strangeness: Book One – 1967, and we have an exclusive, extended preview below.

SpectreVision co-founder and real-life experiencer Daniel Noah joins acclaimed writer Chris Condon (Ultimate Wolverine) for an unexpected encounter with the Men in Black illustrated by Dave Chisholm (Plague House).

Influenced by real, documented cases of paranormal phenomena, High Strangeness reveals the liminal spaces where reality and hallucination and science and mythology give way to cosmic wonder and existential terror.

Chicago, 1967. Magazine writer Harry Kean is dispatched to rural Indiana to investigate the sudden disappearance of Becky Plume, a local teenager who stepped into the national spotlight with staggering photographic evidence of a recent UFO sighting.

Frustrated to leave his developing stories in Chicago—and the wife he's hoping to win back—Harry sets off to expose a hoax but instead finds himself in a labyrinth of high strangeness involving a missing girl, her boyfriend, a UFO, and some mysterious black-clad visitors circling at the perimeter of a mystery more vast than Harry could possibly imagine.

Told across five interconnected issues that will interlock to reveal a dimension-spanning finale, each chapter includes an essay by Euphomet podcast host Jim Perry on the historical facts and documentary evidence underpinning the phenomena detailed in the respective issue.

High Strangeness: Book One – 1967 features covers by Jock (Wytches), Chisholm, Becca Carey (Radiant Black), and Malachi Ward (Black Hammer).

High Strangeness: Book Two – 1975 will follow on November 5.

NASA in shock—discovery of an extraterrestrial mineral never before seen on Earth that could explain the origin of life

NASA has witnessed many shocking discoveries, and this extraterrestrial mineral is another one. The Ryugu asteroid is a unique opportunity for science to go to the remote past of our Solar System. In 2020, the popular mission Hayabusa2 delivered tiny grains of rock from this carbonaceous asteroid to Earth. Thanks to these grains, scientists discovered an extraterrestrial mineral never found on our planet: So, let's learn more about this discovery.

The two grains analyzed come from different parts of Ryugu: one comes from its surface and the other from the inside. So, both together work as archives preserving chemical reactions of the first stages of the Solar System.

These fragments are valuable because, on Earth, the oldest geochemical registers were removed due to an intense geological activity. However, carbonaceous asteroids like Ryugu haven't suffered these extreme conditions. That's why its materials are almost intact and pollution-free.

Each particle from Ryugu is extremely valuable. In total, Hayabusa2 brought only 5.4 grams of material. Out of this small amount, the team led by geoscientific Paul Northrup from the Stony Brook University only received 9.3 milligrams. Northtup explained the importance of taking so much care of the:

“The beauty of these combined techniques is that we can measure the chemistry of both the exterior and the interior of a sample without damaging it. This is important to preserve such rare and unique samples, especially when hundreds of researchers are competing for access to so little material.”

This is why the team used two advanced image techniques with X-Ray, which allowed them to study the mineral composition without destroying the samples.

The analysis revealed a great diversity of elements and compounds: selenium, manganese, iron, sulfur, phosphorus, silicon, and calcium. Among all of them, phosphorus was particularly interesting…

According to the statement from the Brookhaven National Laboratory, this element appeared in two different ways:

In the first study, Northrup's team couldn't immediately confirm what mineral was, but the analysis after Ryugu's material in 2024 allowed scientists to identify it as hydrated ammonium magnesium phosphorus (HAMP). This is a crystal that doesn't exist on Earth and its structure seems like struvite's, a terrestrial mineral with biological processes and is even found in some kidney stones.

This finding confirmed the existence of a truly extraterrestrial mineral with no direct counterpart in the geology of Earth.

Astrobiologist Matthew Pasek highlighted the relevance of this discovery in Nature Astronomy in 2024: “The finding of HAMP grains in the Ryugu samples continues to highlight the potential role of extraterrestrial matter in originating life on Earth.”

Basically, this means that minerals like the HAMMP could have influence on chemical reactions which led to the origin of biology itself.

As you can see, the samples from the Ryugu asteroid is a historic advance: a never seen on Earth extraterrestrial mineral! This discovery might make you want to think about our place in the universe since every tiny grain from Ryugu proves that answers about our origins are also in space.

We never get tired of the many discoveries NASA and other space agencies make. It is so fascinating to think that we are witnessing these types of events that happen around our planet, isn't it? So, we will see what's next in the exciting world of the universe and its origins.

The stars discuss the series' most underrated episode, the scene they'd like to erase, and more.

Samantha is a writer based in Los Angeles. Television is her one true love, and she tweets about it. A lot.

 Death has never stopped a Winchester, but walking around the halls of a Supernatural fan convention, you'd swear they never died to begin with.


 It's been nearly five years since the beloved CW series aired its final episode — and Sept. 13 marks the 20th anniversary of the series premiere — but as fans line up for photos with series stars Jensen Ackles, Misha Collins, and Jared Padalecki at a Creation convention in Austin last month, the level of excitement would make you swear the show was still on. Fans in line wring their hands, while others nervously bounce on their toes, waiting for their 30 seconds of interaction with the stars of their favorite show.


 When Supernatural premiered in 2005, it introduced viewers to Sam (Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Ackles), two brothers who were raised in the business of monster hunting after a demon killed their mother when they were young. As adults, they couldn't seem to escape that life — no matter how hard Sam tried. 


 Across 15 seasons, fans watched as the brothers — with some some help from Collins' winged Castiel — battled just about everything you (and the writers) could imagine: Bloody Mary, vampires, demons, angels, witches, talking teddy bears, God himself, you name it. Propelled by a dedicated fandom, the series seemed to be immortal, until Ackles and Padalecki decided it was time to say goodbye. 


Christin Rose

 ""We had that moment where he and I both realized that we didn't want it to end,"" Padalecki told Entertainment Weekly back in 2020. ""It finally got to a point, ironically, where it was like, 'I never want to leave this. I could do this until the day I die, and then if I get the choice when I'm dead, I'll re-up!' But you never want to be the last person at a party. We just knew.""


 As Ackles added at the time, ""[Jared] and I were always married to the fact that we never wanted to go out with a diet version of what we had. We wanted to have enough gas left in the tank to get us racing across the finish line. We didn't want to limp across.""


 And so they didn't. In November of 2020, after a months-long production halt due to the COVID-19 quarantine, the show aired its final episode, which devastated fans when Dean died fighting vampires, and Sam had to live out the rest of his life without his big brother. (Thankfully, they reunited in heaven for the final shot of the series.)But nothing stays dead on Supernatural — and that includes the show itself. Sitting on stage at that same convention in August, Padalecki starts to answer a question when he casually throws in an ""if, and hopefully when, we do come back..."" a phrase that has the crowd cheering. It's not the first time the actors have talked about their hopes of once again lacing up Sam and Dean's boots one day, and it likely won't be the last.


 Regardless of its future, Supernatural's legacy is undeniable. As it celebrates its 20th anniversary, EW reunited Ackles, Padalecki, and Collins to answer 20 questions about some of the show's best (and worst) moments.


 QUESTION 1: What was the very first scene each of you filmed on Supernatural?


 JARED PADALECKI: I remember. [To Ackles] It was with you. Do you remember? 


 JENSEN ACKLES: Library. 


 PADALECKI: Correct. 


 ACKLES: Yes! 


 PADALECKI: I think a lot of people might watch that episode and be like, ""What are they doing with the little, like, you know, hard drive disk, and it magnifies it?"" Because it was the old school library hard drive thing. 


 ACKLES: Yeah. Didn't we go over to the Dewey Decimal System at some point? And started like looking through that.


 PADALECKI: We probably did.


 ACKLES: I know we used that.


 MISHA COLLINS: My first scene was the very first scene that Castiel shows up for-- 


 ACKLES: Oh, the barn scene. 


 COLLINS: Yes. Where you shot me. Or stabbed me? 


 ACKLES: I don't know. Attempted to kill you. 


 COLLINS: My debut performance on Supernatural was so substandard that we did a reshoot the next day, because they got the dailies back of my creepy performance and they were like-- 


 ACKLES: Is this true? 


 COLLINS: Yeah, this is true. 


 ACKLES: I don't remember doing that again. 


 PADALECKI: They probably just did his coverage. [Laughs] Like, Jensen's fine.


 ACKLES: Yeah, all of his stuff was great. 


 PADALECKI: Just bring in the other guy. 


 ACKLES: Just bring in that new guy. 


 PADALECKI: With the weird voice.


 QUESTION 2: What was the most underrated episode? 


 ACKLES: Probably the one where Misha was introduced. No, overrated. That was overrated.


 COLLINS: The episode ""Baby,"" where the entire episode has a frame of the car in it, or is from the car's vantage point. I thought that episode was absolutely awesome. 


 PADALECKI: To Misha's point, I think a lot of the ones that we did that wouldn't work on literally any other television show that's ever aired, you know, where we play ourselves, where it's all from the vantage point of a vehicle, it wouldn't work. 


 COLLINS: And in fairness, a lot of those episodes didn't work on Supernatural either. [Laughs]


 QUESTION 3: What's the series' best needle drop? 


 PADALECKI: Needle drop? That's like a mic drop? 


 ACKLES: No. Music cue. 


 PADALECKI: Oh, okay, thank you. I know mine. 


 ACKLES: I bet I know yours. Styx, ""Renegade."" 


 PADALECKI: No. That's a very damn close second. I'll give you a hint. My favorite needle drop is a scene I am not in. 


 ACKLES: Oh, David Bowie. 


The CW

 PADALECKI: Yep. When I heard Bowie come on, [Singing] ""Ground control to Major Tom,"" I was like, ""What?"" A) How did they find the money to pay for this? 


 ACKLES: That was the question. 


 PADALECKI: And then I remember the crew complaining for the week after because there was no food, because they had spent all the money-- 


 ACKLES: Oh, that's what it was. Yeah, well, you know, sometimes filming is tough. 


 COLLINS: Castiel had to cradle a baby and put the baby to sleep, and it was scripted that he was supposed to sing ""Highway to Hell,"" but on the day that I got there to film, they were like, ""It turns out that's too expensive for you to sing 'Highway to Hell,' so you're gonna sing the theme song to The Greatest American Hero."" [Laughs] 


 ACKLES: I'm gonna go back to the basics with ""Back in Black."" I think it set the tone for the whole show.


 QUESTION 4: What's a script you remember reading for the first time? 


 PADALECKI: So ""French Mistake"" was an episode where we all play ourselves. And it was one of the few times, maybe the only time, where the writers called us ahead of time and said, ""Hey, we have this idea for an episode, but we wanted to run it by you first.""


 COLLINS: They asked us because they had to get us to sign off on it. 


 PADALECKI: Because it was our likenesses. 


 COLLINS: They had to get our permission. We didn't realize it, but we had a tremendous amount of power. 


 ACKLES: We had leverage that we did not use. 


 QUESTION 5: Is ""Bugs"" actually the worst episode of Supernatural? 


 ACKLES: Yes, I think it was, because of what we went through and what it ended up being. Basically, the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. 


 COLLINS: Did you actually have bugs? 


 PADALECKI: Like 70,000 bees. 


 ACKLES: We were literally being stung by bees. And then they get to post [production], and the bees didn't show up on camera so they had to VIXFX the bees.


 PADALECKI: We go meet the bee specialist and it's a dude with, like, mesh and a big pair of surgical tweezers holding a bee saying, ""So we're going to sting you, but it can't give all of its venom. But we'll find out if you're allergic."" And then, when we were shooting the episode, and they're like, ""Listen, there's no queen bee here, so they're not gonna bite you. They're not gonna sting you unless you really piss them off."" Well, how do you piss them off? ""If you swat them."" Wait, the whole scene is about us trying to get rid of bees. They're like, ""Don't get rid of the bees, just guide them away. Gently guide them away. It was the most absurd thing. I sat on one bee. I don't think I killed it, thank God. 


 ACKLES: Well, if it stung you, it died. 


 PADALECKI: Oh. Then it died. [Laughs] It died valorously.... I feel like [the worst episode] was one of the Leviathan episodes that got a little too heavy into the Dick Roman of it all. We leaned so hard into all the dick jokes. 


 ACKLES: It was a lot. 


 COLLINS: But what is the right number of dick jokes? 


 PADALECKI: That's a good question. 


Christin Rose

 QUESTION 6: Name three essentials in any motel room set. 


 ACKLES: Partitions. The kind of see-through partitions was something that [production designer] Jerry Wanek had in every [motel room]. it was like a quintessential Supernatural thing. 


 COLLINS: The round, Formica-top table. 


 ACKLES: Who's Mica? 


 COLLINS: It's Formica. 


 PADALECKI: Did he ever thank you? If it was for him?


 COLLINS: You don't remember Mica, the PA? [Laughs]


 ACKLES: That's sweet. Sounds like he's got a lot of tables. 


 PADALECKI: The quarter vibrating bed machine.


 ACKLES: I employed it a lot. 


 PADALECKI: I'm sure you did. 


 QUESTION 7: Who's a guest star you wanted to see more of? 


 PADALECKI: For some reason, my brain is going to Titus Welliver. I'm such a fan of his work. 


 ACKLES: There's so many. We had such a long list of just exceptional people come through the door. 


 COLLINS: I loved all of them equally. 


 ACKLES: Well, we know that's not true. 


 QUESTION 8: Which scene required the most takes?


 PADALECKI: ""Mystery Spot."" You kept getting it wrong. 


 ACKLES: I don't wanna talk about it. 


 PADALECKI: ""Keeps a ruler by the bed--""


 ACKLES: I don't want to talk about. 


 PADALECKI: ""And every morning when he wakes up, he--"" 


 ACKLES: I don't want to talk about it. 


 PADALECKI: We had to do, like, a thousand times. 


 QUESTION 9: Which scene required the fewest takes? 


 PADALECKI: Probably the barn. Our barn. 


 ACKLES: I don't know, I mean, there were a lot of one-take scenes. 


 PADALECKI: Fair enough, yeah. But I mean, in general that scene took fewer takes.


The CW

 QUESTION 10: What's the scene you're most proud of? 


 COLLINS: For me, I think it's Castiel's goodbye scene. I loved the message that it sent more broadly. I loved the emotional connectedness that I ended up having with the scene. And I thought that I looked great. 


 PADALECKI: You did. It was phenomenal.


 ACKLES: There's a few that stand out. Obviously, the barn scene, the scene when I come back from hell, the really kind of emotional ones. But there's one that was kind of a subtle one that I was proud of, because it wasn't scripted the way that I did it. And it was a scene when Dean confronts God. In the script, I was supposed to be really angry, and I was supposed to be yelling at him, and I was supposed to be hot. And I came in completely the opposite of that. And I just-- 


 PADALECKI: That was you and Mary also, you and Sam [Smith].


 ACKLES: Yeah. 


 PADALECKI: Where there was, like, a mixture of vulnerability and just rage. 


 ACKLES: I don't know, I felt like it was just a more powerful way of presenting that scene in that moment. I liked that one. 


 PADALECKI: One of mine that sticks out, ""Sacrifice,"" I remember feeling proud of it, even when I watched it, which is so rare cause you're like, ""Ah I feel good."" You go home and you go to bed. And you watch it and you're like, ""That sucked."" This was like, I felt proud of it then and I was proud of how it looked. 


Christin Rose

 QUESTION 11: What's one scene you'd like to erase?


 ACKLES: That's easy for me. Fight scene with Lucifer. The marionette fight scene. 


 PADALECKI: Team America? 


 ACKLES: Team America.


 COLLINS: Nothing's coming to mind. 


 ACKLES: Wow, you guys are awfully proud of your work. 


 PADALECKI: Oh! Okay, I got mine. The wig scene in the finale. That one wig was difficult. 


 ACKLES: Yes! [They] should have just put a bald cap on you and called it a day. 


 PADALECKI: Or something.


The CW

 QUESTION 12: Who was an underused villain? 


 ACKLES: Alastair [Christopher Heyerdahl].


 COLLINS: Yep. Same. 


 ACKLES: Chris was amazing. 


 COLLINS: He was a guest star we should've had back.


 PADALECKI: Oh yeah!


 ACKLES: He was a powerhouse. 


 PADALECKI: I think we all agree on that. 


 QUESTION 13: What was the most badass fight sequence? 


 ACKLES: I can tell you which one wasn't. 


 COLLINS: [Laughs] I know what it was. [To Padalecki] You were playing, Gadreel, Samdreel, whatever. And [director] Bob Singer had this idea for a shot that was sort of like a '70s grindhouse movie shot, where the fist comes right into the lens and that's the edit point. We did the first take, and everybody laughed. [To Ackles] And you came out, and you were laughing and you said, ""Misha, that was hilarious."" And I looked at you like, ""What?"" And you were like, ""Oh, you weren't joking?""


 ACKLES: We were like, ""Wow, that's going to make the outtake reel.""


 PADALECKI: [To Ackles] I actually liked the one you directed. 


The CW

 ACKLES: That's funny. I going to say the same thing. I mean, obviously, I'm biased. So that would have been ""Atomic Monster."" It was the whole opening sequence of me going through the bunker and fighting all these guys in a kind of a dream sequence. I think it was right around the time John Wick was really popular, and I was like, ""I wanna do that."" I was really proud of that one. 


 QUESTION 14: How often were you really driving the Impala versus fake driving?


 ACKLES: Anything at night was fake. Anything during the day was real. 


 QUESTION 15: What was the worst wig?


 PADALECKI: [Laughs] Yeah.


 QUESTION 16: Who had the dumbest on-set injury? 


 [Ackles points to Padalecki]


 PADALECKI: When I broke my hand — season 2, season 3 — fighting vampires in a motel, and I tried to play it off. I fell and I snapped my scaphoid in my wrist. 


 ACKLES: Yeah, that was dumb. 


 PADALECKI: It was dumb. 


 QUESTION 17: Which filming location was the most haunted? 


 ACKLES: Riverview. 


 COLLINS: Oh, my God, yeah. It was a mental asylum. Like, an old-- 


 ACKLES: A decommissioned--


 COLLINS: A decommissioned mental asylum from, like, back in the 1950s. 


 PADALECKI: That did lobotomies--


 ACKLES: Electroshock therapy--


 COLLINS: Like torture chambers.


 ACKLES: We finally got ahold of the liaison of the facility and we were like, ""We want to tour the place, like for real."" And she was like, ""Well, we can't go to the fourth floor."" And we were all like, ""We're going to the fourth floor.""


 PADALECKI: See ya on the fourth floor!


 ACKLES: She took us up there and she was like, ""This is the staircase that I got pushed down."" 


 PADALECKI: And she was so matter-of-fact about it. 


 ACKLES: Yeah, she's like, “Nobody else was here. I was doing the rounds by myself."" She's like, ""I won't go into this room."" And we all walk in and hang out. But, yeah, apparently just grossly haunted, that place. There were some other ones, too, but that one takes the cake. 


The CW

 QUESTION 18: What was the most interesting character you got to play that wasn't your main one? 


 PADALECKI: I'll go with Soulless Sam. 


 ACKLES: Interesting. Most interesting. 


 PADALECKI: Again, I'll go with Soulless Sam. [Laughs]


 ACKLES: Jury's out. 


 PADALECKI: You gotta answer it, too. 


 ACKLES: I guess I'll go Michael? Probably. Probably the biggest departure. 


 COLLINS: Future Cas was the most interesting. 


 ACKLES: He was the guru. 


 COLLINS: He was like, “Time to go wash up for the orgy.” 


 ACKLES AND PADALECKI: Yes!


 PADALECKI: Misha thinks that's interesting because that's actually him as a person. [Laughs]


 ACKLES: [Laughs] He's just calling himself interesting. 


 PADALECKI: Burning Man Misha, that's what we call him. 


Christin Rose

 QUESTION 19: When was your first fan convention? 


 ACKLES: Mine was the summer after season 1 aired, in the U.K. It was a multi-show con. And I realized that the show had some substance when the fan reaction was overwhelming. 


 PADALECKI: Mine was a few months prior. It was during season 1. It was in L.A. But one of the actors there who had done a few, who was part of a big science-fiction franchise, was seeing me sign stuff. And he was like, ""You got to simplify your signature."" I was like, ""Huh?"" He goes, ""You got a lot of letters. Just write your first initial and do a line. Your next initial, do a line."" I was like, ""But that's not how I write my name."" [Laughs]


 COLLINS: 2009, there was a Creation convention in New Jersey, I believe. It says ""panel."" You're doing a panel. And in my mind, a panel is with a lot of other people. And then I got up there and I was like, ""Who am I doing the panel with?"" And they're like, ""You're doing panel with your microphone. Go."" 


 QUESTION 20: Which supernatural creature would you defeat in real life? 


 PADALECKI: Zombie. They're so slow. They don't do s---. 


 ACKLES: You just turn and walk away from it. 


 COLLINS: A fairy? 


 PADALECKI: Yes, because, if you drop something, they have to count it all. You can drop 20 Entertainment Weekly questions and then they have to sit there and count it. And then you're like, ""Okay, I'm out of here."" 


 ACKLES: I'm going to go with a changeling.


 PADALECKI: Just punt it? 


 ACKLES: Yep. Just a straight front [kick] to the teeth. 


 PADALECKI: Fair enough. 


 ACKLES: Well, I think that does it for us. [To Padalecki] Anything to add? 


 PADALECKI: Are you talking to me this whole time? 


 [Everyone laughs] 


 ACKLES: Some things never change.

Disney and Pixar's latest animated adventure Elio will begin streaming on Disney+ starting September 17, bringing cosmic family entertainment directly to home screens. The space-themed film follows young Elio Solís on his unexpected journey from Earth-bound dreamer to accidental intergalactic ambassador.

The streaming debut comes just weeks after the film's successful theatrical run and digital release. Families can now enjoy this heartwarming tale of alien encounters and self-discovery from the comfort of their living rooms, making it perfect for cozy movie nights and weekend family viewing.

Elio earned Certified Fresh and Verified Hot ratings from Rotten Tomatoes, indicating both critical acclaim and audience approval. The film represents another successful entry in Disney and Pixar's storytelling legacy, combining humor, heart, and spectacular animation to create an engaging viewing experience for all ages.

The story centers on Elio, a space-obsessed teenager with an active imagination who has spent years trying to make contact with extraterrestrial life. His persistence finally pays off when aliens not only respond to his attempts at communication but beam him up to their cosmic realm called the Communiverse.

However, Elio's dream encounter takes an unexpected turn when the alien civilizations mistake him for Earth's official leader. Suddenly thrust into a position of galactic importance, the young protagonist must navigate complex interplanetary politics while staying true to himself.

Throughout his cosmic misadventure, Elio forms bonds with eccentric alien lifeforms and faces challenges that test both his courage and character. The film explores themes of belonging, friendship, and the importance of maintaining connections with loved ones even when pursuing grand adventures.

Disney and Pixar's animation team created stunning visuals that bring the Communiverse to life with vibrant colors and imaginative alien worlds. The film showcases the studio's technical expertise while maintaining the emotional storytelling that has become their signature approach to animated entertainment.

The voice cast brings authentic performances to their animated characters, with particular attention paid to capturing the wonder and uncertainty that comes with teenage experiences. Elio's journey resonates with viewers who have ever felt like outsiders or dreamed of adventures beyond their everyday lives.

The film's approximately 98-minute runtime provides enough space for character development and world-building without overwhelming younger viewers. The PG rating makes it appropriate for family viewing while still offering enough complexity to engage adult audiences.

The Disney+ premiere offers several advantages for family viewing. Parents can pause for snack breaks, rewind favorite scenes, and watch on their schedule without worrying about theater showtimes or ticket prices. The streaming format also allows for repeat viewings, letting families discover new details and Easter eggs hidden throughout the film.

Disney+ subscribers gain access to Elio at no additional cost beyond their regular subscription fee. This accessibility ensures that more families can enjoy the film regardless of their entertainment budget or geographic location.

The timing of the streaming release coincides with the start of the school year, providing families with fresh content for weekend entertainment and potential educational discussions about space exploration and astronomy.

Elio incorporates real scientific concepts about space travel and the possibility of extraterrestrial life, making it both entertaining and potentially educational. Parents and teachers can use the film as a starting point for discussions about astronomy, physics, and the ongoing search for life beyond Earth.

The protagonist's passion for space exploration mirrors the interests of many real young people who dream of careers in STEM fields. Elio's character demonstrates that curiosity and persistence can lead to unexpected opportunities, even if they don't unfold exactly as planned.

The film's blend of fantasy and science-based concepts creates opportunities for families to explore both imaginative storytelling and factual information about our universe and humanity's place within it.

This latest release continues Pixar's tradition of creating animated films that appeal to both children and adults through sophisticated storytelling and universal themes. Elio joins a catalog of beloved films that have defined modern family entertainment for over two decades.

The studio's commitment to emotional storytelling shines through in Elio's personal growth throughout his cosmic adventure. While the setting may be fantastical, the character's struggles with self-identity and finding his place in the world remain deeply relatable.

Disney+ subscribers can now add Elio to their family movie rotation alongside other Pixar classics, creating opportunities for marathon viewing sessions and cross-generational bonding over shared cinematic experiences.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Psychic","Opinion: When mental-health diagnoses become brands, the real drivers of our psychic pain are hidden","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-mental-health-industrial-complex-diagnoses-brands-social-media/","Fri, 12 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

The Mental Health Industrial Complex profits off the proliferation of psychiatric diagnoses, thrown around like buzzwords on social media

Sami Timimi is a child and adolescent psychiatrist, psychotherapist and author of the new book Searching for Normal: A New Approach to Understanding Mental Health, Distress, and Neurodiversity.

I was talking to my youngest daughter on a cold evening in April, 2022. Still shrouded in the shadows of COVID lockdowns with social distancing signs on London pavements, we sat in a restaurant littered with hand sanitizers accumulating crystalline congealed blobs on the tray below their now mostly empty dispensing levers. Enforced alienation in an already hyper-individualistic culture was contributing to rising referral rates at the child and adolescent mental health service where I worked as a consultant psychiatrist.

Zoe, who was 24 at the time, was in one of those nihilistic moods. Her generally happy-go-lucky predisposition was now often punctuated by pessimism. She was struggling to find a stable job, feel a sense of purpose, and imagine a better life awaited her. She explained that many of her friends and friends of friends felt the same way. An invisible blanket of humdrum gloom and despondency had replaced the ardour and energy of youth. They were getting diagnosed with ADHD, trauma, depression, anxiety, PTSD, autism, and often several such diagnoses. Their conversations were interpolated by references to gender identity, neurodiversity, emotional regulation and “having” mental health. When she explained the circumstances of these peers, which included bereavements, enforced isolation during lockdowns, financial insecurity, struggling to find an affordable place to live, and so on, I realized she was describing an accelerating – and to me, worrying – sociocultural process.

My other daughter, Michelle, had been telling me about chats taking place with other parents at the school gates and nursery car park that my three gorgeous grandchildren attend. “He's probably on the spectrum,” “She's masking all day and then has meltdowns at home,” “Have you considered whether these are traits of ADHD?” Parents, teachers, support workers, and child-care assistants talking the language of psychiatric symptoms and diagnoses as they tried to make sense of three- to 10-year-old children's behaviours. 

As a child and adolescent psychiatrist, I was also noticing a shift toward more young people and/or their parents, teachers, friends and other professionals imagining they had a mental disorder that needed diagnosing. The mother of a 14-year-old patient told me with confidence her son needed medication to address “some sort of chemical imbalance.” A 16-year-old girl was “pretty sure” she was bipolar (“I've looked this up”) and told me that her friends, all apparently medicated, expressed shock when they learned my patient had not been prescribed anything. The mother of another young woman was certain she had autism, ADHD, depression and anxiety. “But I think that's not all that's wrong with her,” she told me, “There's something more. Something deeper. Maybe she has some sort of personality disorder.”

ADHD content on TikTok is misinformed, could steer youth to self-diagnose, study finds

Even my colleagues weren't immune. “I think he may have some neurodiversity, perhaps even autism” was becoming a common utterance I heard from therapists, social workers and psychologists.

A patient information leaflet on “antidepressants” produced by a British national mental health service and passed anonymously to me, included the following advice: “It can sometimes take weeks, months or even years, to get the right medicine at the right dose for you. Think of it as a bit like dating. Some make you feel sick or sleepy; some are great to start with but wear off; others may not be much to start with but after a while grow on you. Then you might have found the one that makes you feel good long-term. So don't lose hope if the first one doesn't work.”

An emboldened and bloated Mental Health Industrial Complex (MHIC) has grown its tentacles beyond the hospital and the clinic, worming its way into the minds of the masses. Is this a sign of a society embracing psychological liberation? Or is it something more sinister – the monetization of distress and difference whilst psychologizing and distracting from the social drivers of psychic pain.

Multiple studies have highlighted the increasing prevalence of anxiety, depression and other mental health conditions in Canada, particularly in its youth. Between 2012 and 2022 the prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders increased substantially, particularly among women and those between the ages of 15 and 24. 

For example, the one-year prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder among young women tripled from 3.8 per cent in 2012 to 11.9 per cent in 2022. Meanwhile, a 2019 survey that asked Canadian youth aged 12 to 17 years to rate their mental health, found that 12 per cent rated their mental health as “fair” or “poor.” That proportion had more than doubled to 26 per cent in 2023, when the respondents were now aged 16 to 21 years. Among the 88 per cent of youth who rated their mental health as “good,” “very good” or “excellent” in 2019, 21 per cent reported experiencing a decline to “fair” or “poor” by 2023.

Some studies suggest these increases may have an element of social contagion. According to Canadian research published in 2023, kids – especially teenage girls – are presenting with self-described Tourette's, eating disorders, autism, Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) and other mental disorders in exponentially increasing numbers. The authors conclude that identifying with and glamourizing certain “disorders” has become a way for some teenagers to express negative emotions in a way that, rather than stigmatizing them, makes them feel part of a community or unique and special.

With this type of concept spread what sometimes happens is young people (particularly girls) watch videos (such as those on TikTok) by content creators who self-identify as having these various “illnesses” (like ADHD). Videos show and describe how the symptoms manifest during everyday activities and how it is an important part of the creator's identity. Then, these youngsters present with the outward symptoms, just as described by the content creator, thus producing sudden outbreaks of a particular condition, or increases of those considered more common (such as ADHD).

While more is being spent on treatment of individuals, the general population prevalence of many mental health conditions is rising. Hence, on the one hand treatment access has improved and become more available, but on the other hand the omnipresence of mental health conditions has not decreased, but instead has increased across all age groups, and particularly in young people. This is known as the Treatment Prevalence Paradox (TPP). 

There has been a cascade of recently written books by psychiatrists, sociologists, psychologists and historians coming to the same conclusion: Our beliefs and practices around mental health have failed to improve either our scientific knowledge or clinical outcomes. 

Despite increasing consumption of therapy and psychiatric medication, mental health in Western countries (which have the most globally developed mental-health services) is getting worse by multiple metrics. Suicide rates have risen, more people are worried and/or depressed, the mortality gap between those being treated for severe mental conditions and the rest of the population is wide and increasing, and there are rising rates of people receiving disability benefits for mental-health difficulties. 

How public therapy programs are quietly re-shaping individuals and communities

International studies show this decline in mental health across all age and gender groups, with English-speaking countries having the lowest levels of mental well-being, and those between the ages of 18 and 24 having the worst mental health of all. The trends keep going in the wrong direction. Wherever you look across the Western world you will find stories about mental-health epidemics and data that shows more people being diagnosed, more services being created, and more psychiatric treatments being consumed.

These worsening outcomes are not true for cancer, not true for heart disease, not true for diabetes, or almost any other area of medicine. Something is going badly wrong.

The growth of mental health diagnoses has not occurred because of any new scientific discoveries. No one has discovered mythical “chemical imbalances,” characteristic brain differences, or robust genetic associations with any psychiatric condition (the two exceptions being with the dementias and intellectual disability). 

Brain scan images showing Alzheimer's dementia, top in dark blue, compared to another scan with early developing spots, in light blue, that researchers said were likely showing the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. The results of the research were published in the new England Journal of Medicine in 1996.The Associated Press

This is why what are called “tests” in psychiatry do not tell you anything about the brains or bodies of those diagnosed. They are largely questionnaires supplemented by impressionable observations. 

In response to these alarming trends, some are calling for more resources to enable better detection and more (early) interventions. But this may further worsen outcomes if the fundamental concepts that build our beliefs and practices rest on inappropriate foundations. For a start, it assumes we know what we mean by “mental health” and therefore what a mental illness or disorder is. You'd be forgiven for thinking that there are specific targeted treatments out there and that people get better with interventions delivered by professionals with special expertise. You'd likely think that our problem with mental health is stigma and lack of services; that the issue is woeful underfunding and long waiting lists, and that more needs to be done to educate the population.

But these are not the real problems. In fact, the above assumptions are likely a major cause of growing mental-health problems, rather than its solution. 

You see there is a truth that we (in the mental-health business) hope no one will notice – we literally don't know what we are talking about when it comes to mental health. We are unable to escape something that all the definitions of mental health or illness have in common. They are all subjective. They are constructed by a belief, an opinion, an idea. They are not phenomena that lend themselves to sitting in the world of objective facts in the same way that a broken bone does. This means they can be expanded in a myriad of ways to capture a kaleidoscope of distress, alienation and dissatisfaction. 

The World Health Organization defines mental health as “a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community.” What does “realize their abilities” mean? Is it in the sense of being aware of them, or in the sense of putting them into effect? What are the normal “stresses of life” and what does it mean to “cope” with them? What does it mean to “work well,” and how does a person know that they are contributing to a community? Which community? How do you define a contribution anyway? There must be many people who, for lack of education, money, or opportunity, are in practice unable to do so. Are these unfortunates by definition mentally ill? I could go on.

The consequences for us adopting this non-scientific, simplistic framework have been catastrophic for our collective mental health and for our understanding of distress. It means definitions can expand horizontally (by taking in new behaviours or lesser extreme versions) or vertically (by incorporating new populations). 

ADHD starts its clinical life as hyperkinetic disorder, rare and thought of as “developmental” – meaning most children were expected to grow out of it. It is then thought of as affecting more children, including lesser disruptive behaviours and incorporating attention difficulties rather than just the “hyperactive” element. Next, it becomes seen as potentially lifelong, but still a mainly male “disorder.” Introducing the concept of “masking” then means that you don't have to display the behaviours, but rather “feel” you have them, thus enabling a whole new cohort (mainly women) to be brought into the ADHD diagnostic realm. 

None of these evolving diagnostic mutations were the result of new biological discoveries. 

Diagnosis is a system of classification based on categorizing a proximal cause. We can take a car to a garage to run diagnostic tests. Computer technicians will run diagnostics looking for software faults or computer viruses causing a program to malfunction. 

In medicine, diagnosis is the process of determining which disease explains, i.e., has caused, a person's symptoms and/or signs. Making an accurate diagnosis is a technical skill that enables effective matching of treatment to address specific disease processes occurring in the body. Health care involves a lot more than this, as it is a human social activity, meaning that patients have a relationship with health care providers as well as an awareness that physical suffering also impacts a person's psychosocial world. But a diagnostic system enables progress on the technical aspects of care.

The availability of empirical measures enables advances in scientific knowledge and clinical outcomes as we classify a case using measurements that map into the world of objective facts, such as measuring a person's blood sugar levels to ascertain whether they may have diabetes.

But in mental health we are reliant on subjectivity. Psychiatric diagnoses therefore cannot point toward any causal agent (apart from a few such as those related to forms of dementia).

Consider the following example: If I were to ask the question “What is depression?” it's not possible for me to answer that question by reference to a particular known abnormality. I cannot say that depression is a disease that occurs due to having abnormally low levels of serotonin in the brain, because no one has found this despite extensive research and so there are no medical tests done to confirm or refute this. 

Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a class of widely prescribed drugs, including fluoxetine, branded by Eli Lilly as Prozac.MATT DETRICH/The Associated Press

Instead, to answer the question I will have to provide a description such as, “Depression is the presence of persistent low mood and negative thinking.” Saying that feeling low is caused by depression is a bit like saying the pain in my head is caused by a headache. If we try to use a classification that can only describe, in order to explain, we end up with a circular thinking trap. 

Technically speaking, therefore, there is no such thing as a psychiatric diagnosis, yet we act as if we know what we're talking about and as if we have explanations for certain states of mind and associated behaviours. So why has this unscientific idea spread so widely?

The mental-illness health epidemic is growing alongside a crisis of economy and political legitimacy in Western societies. The distress and insecurity produced becomes another source of profiteering in the marketized economy where personhood is socially produced through individualized consumption. This individualization has helped create a profitable MHIC where psychiatric diagnoses function more like commercial brands. 

At the same time, this enables distraction from social causes of distress such as poverty, inadequate housing, social injustice, discrimination, exclusion, and chronic financial insecurity; alongside militarism, and appalling levels of violence inflicted by governments on global citizens they control (or try to control). Cancel culture from right and left, impotence of politicians to take us out of seemingly endless cycles of austerity, and loss of trust in mainstream media, leaves a crisis of legitimacy alongside material deprivations in a landscape of growing inequality. The postwar dream of looking forward to a better life than your parents has faded. Job insecurity, high rents, homelessness, crumbling infrastructure, crippling debts, food banks, extortionate bills alongside mental health epidemics are the zeitgeists of our age.

Like identity politics, MHIC shifts the focus away from the political arena of the runaway elite class of the super-rich oligarchs, to competing minority rights and the space between the ears. 

I am continually impressed by the extraordinary ability of even the most severely afflicted of the young patients I see to recover functionality and meaning in their lives. The world may be in crisis, but I remain optimistic. Humans are remarkably resilient. 

Here are a few thoughts:

I'm all too aware that there will be thousands of parents reading this who may have been told by teachers that their child has ADHD or is on the autistic spectrum, or has “anxiety” and therefore needs an assessment. I can understand why a parent may wish to pursue that given that we have publicized the existence of such conditions and encouraged early diagnosis. My advice – don't agree to such a referral. Fight it every step of the way. Love your kids, be patient, and most of you will find a way through.

We should be able to talk about how we feel without jumping into panic mode and imagining that what we're describing could be the onset of some mental disorder. I try to help the young people I see understand that being able to tolerate, live through and find meaning in low mood or anxiety (for example) is a sign of resilience, not a marker of disorder.

Don't try too hard. We live in a society whose politics and economics promotes a compare and compete hyper-individualist model of human nature. This puts pressure on us and our children to perform. We then see our children or ourselves as primarily vulnerable and get drawn into noticing all sorts of ways their mental and behavioural health could go “wrong.” As we are launched into a seemingly never-ending search for the right diagnosis and treatment, we start collecting labels and accompanying interventions. Each step in this journey has the potential to make it harder to accept your child (or yourself) just the way they are with all their uniqueness and the mysterious wonderful variety of ways they might thrive in this maddening world. Be patient and categorize psychological problems in the sphere of the ordinary and/or understandable. 

Opinion: Have you been given an ADHD diagnosis by TikTok University?

Don't fear emotions. When we put emotions in the class of problems that can only be solved with special expertise such as a specific therapy or worse psychiatric medication, we risk losing agency and alienating ourselves from parts of ourselves that are to be experienced rather than feared. Emotions are part of dynamic and multifaceted systems and like any dynamic system (such as the weather) the one constant is change. Our duty as parents (and to each other as adults) is not to prevent our children from experiencing distress (which is impossible), but to be there and take the time and have the patience to be with them and support them when they do.

See nurturing relationships as a greater priority than controlling behaviour. When we are distressed by the behaviour of our children (or other adults in our life) we often hope we can get through to them so that they change in a way that would stop their frustrating/irritating/worrying behaviour. Unfortunately, this can accidentally damage the relationship, leading to further problems and more tension in that relationship. The only bit in a relational dynamic that you can reliably influence is your own contribution. Think about those aspects of your relationship that you want to nurture. It can be incredibly powerful if, even in the worst of times, you can keep in mind, notice, and comment on, those bits of behaviour, however fleeting, small, or temporary that remind you of what you love, what brings you joy, and what you value in your child (or other adult). It's a bit like retraining your internal radar away from picking up all the cues for the things that distress you and reprogramming it to notice the things that you like. 

New hub for teen mental-health data launches with eye on tailoring supports for Canadian youth

Beware of concept creep. As what I call the Mental Health Industrial Complex has burrowed its way into day-to-day language and “common sense,” concepts have been popularized that encourage us to view behaviours and experiences in pathological ways. We no longer become sad or miserable, we get depressed. We now talk about emotional regulation and dysregulation, having “meltdowns,” and “masking.” Strip away this language. You and your children's experiences nearly always sit in the realm of the ordinary and/or understandable. 

There are profound consequences for each of us and our society as a whole of us literally not knowing what we're talking about when it comes to mental health and/or neurodiversity. Arming yourself with some knowledge to help you avoid the prolific spread of scientism (faith masquerading as science) could save you or your child becoming another number in the growing crowds of those who are deemed to have lifelong and incapacitating mental disorder/illness. These conditions were never meant to be a life sentence.

                HOHENFELS, Germany – At the Joint Multinational Readiness Center's (JMRC) Hohenfels Training Area, U.S. Army Reserve soldiers with the 418th Civil Affairs Battalion (CAB), the 13th Psychological Operations Battalion (PSYOP), and multinational partners from Bulgaria and North Macedonia were tested in a high-pressure, civilian displacement scenario during Exercise Saber Junction 25.

This inject tested more than just tactical response. Designed and executed by JMRC's Operational Environment (OE) specialists, this scenario aimed to develop critical skills in synchronization, cross-functional planning, and multinational coordination, all under battlefield pressure. 

The scenario simulated a convoy of displaced civilians, tired, hungry, and separated from loved ones, seeking refuge in NATO-controlled territory after rapidly evacuating a contested combat zone. While fictional, the scenario replicates real-world challenges soldiers may face when civilian populations are caught in or near active military operations.

“There are two outcomes,” said Ben Serbicki, OE specialist, JMRC, who helps design the civil component of the exercise. “Outcome one is they do nothing, and there's an uncoordinated movement of civilians and convoys coming across during an attack. Outcome two is they actually work with those civilian partners to find a window to get supplies in and people out to safety.”

This is a critical training point for Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations soldiers. Stabilizing the environment through civil-military engagement enables maneuver units to operate freely without escalating risks or creating humanitarian crises.

“Keeping civilians calm and in place by understanding the situation and working to help them stabilizes the environment,” added Serbicki. “Allowing soldiers to maneuver and engage their enemies without disrupting operations ensures the safety of both civilians and soldiers by mitigating potential issues.”

The training scenario also forced participants to integrate quickly with unfamiliar partners, reflecting the multinational nature of modern operations. Soldiers worked closely with the 2nd Cavalry Regiment (2CR), the primary training audience for the event, who were conducting combat operations outside the town, while simultaneously acting as a link to civil authorities managing the incoming displaced population.

“They're integrating with their maneuver task board, which is 2CR,” said Maj. Christian Grams, the Observer-Coach Trainer for the 13th PSYOP. “They don't have much experience working with their allies in multinational settings, so this has been fantastic integration there.”

“Getting to see how our counterparts do it from their side is super beneficial for us to see how we can frame different scenarios in the future,” Grams added. “There's a possibility of a different understanding.”

For exercise participants, this wasn't just a box-checking scenario; it was a demonstration of how civil and psychological operations directly support mission success by enabling freedom of movement, maintaining legitimacy, and reducing the likelihood of tactical or strategic missteps.

“Our mission is always to assist the operation,” said Sgt. Joe Kuenstle, a civil affairs specialist with the 418th CAB. “Civil affairs can be a great asset to utilize, connecting the community with the military.”

ByEmma Woollacott,

Senior Contributor.

The shooting of Charlie Kirk has unleashed a wave of conspiracy theories and misinformation, much of it coming from chatbots.

Yesterday, for example, the X account of AI chatbot Perplexity was confidently proclaiming that Kirk was still alive. The post has since been removed.

But Elon Musk's chatbot Grok, meanwhile, was under a similar misapprehension. ""The video is a meme edit—Charlie Kirk is debating, and effects make it look like he's 'shot' mid-sentence for comedic effect,"" it claimed. ""No actual harm; he's fine and active as ever.""

This isn't the first time that chatbots have delivered confidently false information.

""During the Los Angeles protests and Israel-Hamas war, users similarly turned to chatbots for answers and were served inaccurate information,"" the researchers said.

""Despite repeated examples of these tools confidently repeating falsehoods, as documented in NewsGuard's Monthly AI False Claims Monitor, many continue to treat AI systems as reliable sources in moments of crisis and uncertainty.""

Reassuringly, most of the videos currently in circulation are real, according to an analysis by GetReal Security.

""We have analyzed several of the videos circulating online and find no evidence of manipulation or tampering. At the same time, we are seeing some AI-generated videos of the event that are clearly fake,"" said cofounder Hany Farid. ""This is an example of how fake content can muddy the waters and in turn cast doubt on legitimate content.""

Meanwhile, according to NewsGuard, pro-Kremlin sources have been claiming that Kirk was on the Myrotvorets blacklist, a database of perceived Ukrainian enemies. But, said the reliability ratings agency, ""There is no evidence that Kirk was ever on the list, and a NewsGuard search of his name on the database yielded no results.""

And a request for help from the FBI has encouraged internet users to suggest various candidates as the shooter. The FBI has created a form for people to fill in if they have any information, posting a picture of a ""person of interest"".

However, in the replies to the FBI tweet, several people suggest that their clever detective work may have unmasked the shooter.

""I'm a portrait artist and this looks like a match. I used some poor Photoshop work, but given the different angles this could be your guy,"" writes one, with another posting a pair of pictures and the comment ""I'm not saying it's him, but the resemblance is striking.""

And there have been widespread suggestions—as yet unsupported by any evidence—that the killer was left-wing, Mexican or transgender.

Unsurprisingly, the ""deep state"" comes into many accusations - including one from British political figure George Galloway.

""I think the American deep-state murdered Charlie Kirk. The people who tried twice to murder Donald Trump. Who murdered Bobby Kennedy and Dr Martin Luther King. And President Kennedy himself,"" he wrote.

Many internet users, meanwhile, are making a connection with Israel.

""This guy is mossad. he works for israel. mossad killed charlie kirk. netanyahu ordered it. an idf sniper. he's doing secret mossad hand signals. actually like every other big right wing guy works for them and did this,"" one user posted on X. 
 Keyboard detectives are advised to be cautious and share their suspicions only with the FBI, with similar accusations having led to lawsuits in Australia and the U.S..","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","other"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Unsolved+Mysteries","Lost's 10 Worst Unsolved Mysteries, Ranked By How Disappointed We Were (#1 Still Haunts Me)","https://screenrant.com/lost-worst-unsolved-mysteries-ranked/","Fri, 12 Sep 2025 17:15:00 GMT","

Some television mysteries are designed to linger forever. They spark theories, arguments, and rewatches, which is part of what keeps a great show alive long after it's ended. But then there wasLost. The series thrived on mystery, yes, but it was also a great TV mystery that deliberately left questions unanswered.

Over a decade since the finale,Lost remains bold, emotional, and sometimes brilliant, but it also leaves behind a trail of unresolved storylines that remain frustrating to this day. What follows is the 10 most disappointing mysteries that never paid off.

These are some of the most frustrating TV mysteries that needed answers, the questions that felt abandoned, leaving viewers staring at their screens waiting for an explanation that never came.

 The Man in Black was introduced as the show's big bad, the ultimate danger lurking behind the island's mysteries. He could manipulate survivors, take on Locke's form, and bring death in an instant, yet the series insisted he was bound by “rules” handed down by Jacob. The problem is that those rules were never defined or explained.

That made him feel less like a terrifying force and more like a villain the writers didn't know how to handle. Sometimes he was unstoppable, other times strangely powerless, depending on what the story required. By leaning on vague restrictions instead of defined constraints,Lost drained the menace from its most important antagonist.

 Season 5 gave us one ofLost's strangest abandoned mysteries. Sawyer, Juliet, and the group found themselves in an outrigger, only to be attacked by unknown gunmen. The moment was tense and fast-moving, clearly meant to set up a reveal later, except that it was a plot twist that never led anywhere, and the scene was never revisited.

What looked like a carefully planted clue turned out to be meaningless, and instead of rewarding viewers with a clever twist, the writers simply moved on. It's the kind of unresolved mystery that makes you wonder if the showrunners forgot about it altogether.

The fertility issue was one ofLost's biggest teases. Women who became pregnant on the island rarely survived, and the Others treated it like a central puzzle. Entire storylines suggested the answer would unlock some greater truth about the island itself, yet by the end, no explanation was ever offered, leaving the mystery unresolved.

What made this especially frustrating is how many characters were tied to it. What happened to Claire Littleton revolved around her baby, and Juliet's entire purpose was around solving the problem, while the Others seemed obsessed with the experiments. Dropping it completely made those arcs feel unfinished.

Why Could Desmond Time Travel?

 Desmond's time travel powers were some of the show's most memorable moments. His mind could slip between different points in his life, and episodes like “The Constant” showed how powerful that idea could be. Fans expected a real explanation, but the show never settled on one. Was it physics, destiny, or simply another unexplained island gift?

Desmond was framed as crucial to the island's fate, yet the nature of his ability was left hanging. Instead of a brilliant payoff, we got ambiguity. Hints were scattered, but nothing ever added up. What could have been a groundbreaking twist in TV storytelling ended up feeling like another abandoned thread.

 Early on, the island felt nothing short of miraculous. In one of the best Locke episodes of Lost, he regained the use of his legs. Rose's illness also vanished. These events pointed to something larger at work, a supernatural system with its own rules. But over time, that logic unraveled, and the show never explained why some healed and others didn't.

The inconsistency turned a powerful idea into little more than background detail. Locke's recovery initially defined his faith in the island, yet later the show treated it casually, as if it no longer mattered. By leaving the mystery unresolved,Lost squandered what could have been one of its most meaningful storylines.

What made it worse was how deeply healing shaped characters' choices. Locke believed his life's purpose was tied to the island, while Rose finally had hope after years of sickness. Without a clear explanation, those captivating moments of rebirth felt empty in hindsight.

 Early on, Walt displayed abilities that no other character had. Animals behaved strangely around him, and he seemed to sense things others couldn't. The Others even singled him out, treating him as someone unique, and viewers were led to believe his powers would eventually unlock a major part of the island's mystery.

But the storyline collapsed when Walt was written out, and the writers never clarified what made him special. Behind-the-scenes issues may have shaped that choice, but within the story it came across as careless. After so much buildup, leaving his abilities hanging felt like a broken promise to the audience.

The disappointment cuts deeper because Walt was so important and central in the early seasons. He was kidnapped, studied, and framed as vital to the island's fate. To simply drop him without explanation only made fans question whether the show's other mysteries would ever lead anywhere.

 Throughout the series, ghosts appeared to different survivors. Jack saw his father, Hurley spoke with dead companions, and others experienced similar visions. Sometimes these figures offered guidance, and other times they only deepened the confusion. While the show suggested a connection to the island's power or Jacob, it never made clear why only specific characters were affected.

Christian Shephard, Jack's father, appears in 19 episodes across six seasons, but only a handful of those appearances are as a living character. Most of the time, he shows up as either a corpse or a mysterious vision.

Were these encounters supernatural, psychological, or simply tricks of the Man in Black? I'd lean toward the latter, but it was all treated so inconsistently. Without answers, the appearances felt scattered and arbitrary, so instead of expanding the island's mythology in a meaningful way, the ghost sightings ended up as another unresolved thread that left fans unsatisfied.

 Jacob was introduced as Lost's immortal protector, someone bound to its mysteries and unable to leave. But in flashbacks, we saw him moving freely across the world, visiting future candidates and shaping their lives. The series never explained how he could travel so easily if his entire existence was tied to the island.

That gap left Jacob's mythology feeling under-developed. If he could come and go, why couldn't the Man in Black? And if the island required a constant guardian, why was Jacob allowed long absences? Without answers, his character came across as inconsistent, undermining the show's own rules about the island's power.

 The four-toed foot statue in Lost instantly stood out as one of the island's most haunting images. Enormous and mysterious, it suggested a lost civilization had once thrived there. By the time most survivors encountered it, only the foot remained, sparking endless speculation about who created it and what culture had left such a mark.

All fans ever learned was that it represented Taweret, the Egyptian goddess of fertility and protection. Beyond that, the origins were left unanswered. No builders, no history, no explanation for how a monument of that scale ended up on the island, so what could've expanded the show's mythology instead became another dead end.

 The sequence 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 became Lost's most famous mystery. They appeared everywhere: on Hurley's lottery ticket, inside the hatch, in broadcasts, even in Jacob's candidate list. From the beginning, it felt like they held the ultimate key to the island. Naturally, fans expected a major reveal tying everything together.

But no reveal ever came. The numbers were mentioned often but never explained, leaving them as little more than a recurring motif. Were they supernatural, mathematical, or just coincidence? Well, the show never clarified. Considering how central they were, this omission felt like the biggest disappointment of all.

            A person targeted during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement traffic stop dragged an ICE officer with a vehicle while resisting arrest in a Chicago suburb Friday morning, prompting the officer to fatally shoot the person and leaving the officer with injuries, the Department of Homeland Security said.
    


            The slain target of the stop, Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, was an undocumented immigrant with a history of reckless driving, according to DHS. The officer, whose name was not immediately released, suffered severe injuries but is in stable condition,  a DHS official told CNN.
    


            The traffic stop happened in Franklin Park, a community about 15 miles west of downtown Chicago, the DHS official said.
    


            “We are praying for the speedy recovery of our law enforcement officer. He followed his training, used appropriate force, and properly enforced the law to protect the public and law enforcement,” Tricia McLaughlin, Homeland Security assistant secretary, said in a release. “Viral social media videos and activists encouraging illegal aliens to resist law enforcement not only spread misinformation, but also undermine public safety, as well as the safety of our officers and those being apprehended.”
    


            During the stop, Villegas-Gonzalez “drove his car at law enforcement officers,” DHS said in the release.
    


            “One of the ICE officers was hit by the car and dragged a significant distance. Fearing his own life, the officer fired his weapon,” the release reads.
    


            FBI agents were processing the scene on Friday afternoon, a CNN crew observed.

Below, you can review updates, analysis and reactions after Charlie Kirk was shot and killed from Thursday, September 11.

Utah Governor Spencer Cox shared a new video of the suspected shooter of Charlie Kirk. The video shows a person in black clothes running across a roof, climbing down from a building and crossing a street to an area where investigators found the rifle they believe was the weapon used to shoot Kirk.

Cox called on the public to contact authorities if they had any additional information about the suspect. He said local and federal police had received 7,000 leads and tips and conducted over 200 interviews. There is currently a $100,000 reward for information leading to the identification and arrest of the suspect.

The governor did not take questions but said the state would pursue the death penalty against the perpetrator when the person is found. None of the politicians or law enforcement officials, including FBI Director Kash Patel, took questions at the brief news conference on Thursday. 

Utah's Department of Public Safety released additional photos of the ""person of interest"" in connection with the killing of Charlie Kirk just after 6 p.m. local time on Thursday (0000 Friday UTC/GMT).

They asked for all tips to be sent to the FBI.

A day after blaming ""the radical left"" for the murder of Charlie Kirk, US President Donald Trump on Thursday urged supporters to respond peacefully to the conservative pundit's death, calling him ""an advocate of nonviolence.""

""That's the way I'd like to see people respond,"" Trump said.

He added that there had been ""big progress"" in the investigation of Kirk's death, but he did not provide any additional details. A hunt for the perpetrator is ongoing.

""Hopefully we'll have him, and we'll deal with him very appropriately,"" the president said. 

A service at the Pentagon marking the September 11, 2001, attacks was moved to the internal courtyard following the killing of activist Charlie Kirk.

The service was attended by US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump.

The service is traditionally held near the Pentagon 9/11 memorial outside the building. But it was moved inside because of security concerns, according to the AP news agency, which cited a White House official.

The 9/11 remembrances are being held during a time of increased political tensions after Kirk was shot and killed while speaking at a college in Utah.

FBI officials in Salt Lake City released two pictures of someone wearing black long-sleeved shirt, hat and sunglasses they said was a ""person of interest"" in the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

The officials did not say whether the person depicted was the suspected shooter, but appealed to the public to share any information on the person's indetity. 

The FBI also offered a reward of $100,000 for information leading to the identification and arrest of the person or people responsible for the shooting. 

The images were shared hours after the FBI said they recovered a bolt action rifle in a wooded area near the university campus they suspect was used in the shooting. The weapon and ammunition found nearby will be analyzed for clues.

Conservative activist and influencer Charlie Kirk was ""fully affiliated"" with the Trump MAGA movement, supporting many right-wing political positions and conspiracy theories. DW spoke with Georg Loefflmann, a lecturer on US foreign policy, about the possible fallout of the shooting.

Charlie Weimers, a member of the European Parliament (MEP) with the nationalist Sweden Democrats, requested that Speaker Roberta Metsola allow a minute of silence to honor Charlie Kirk. 

Weimers tried to observe the tribute by yielding his speaking time on the floor, but he was cut short by the session chair and told that the request had been denied for procedural reasons, according to the AFP news agency. 

Other MEPs from his party protested, banging on their desks, while most of the other lawmakers applauded the chair's intervention.

French MEP Nathalie Loiseau posted on X that Kirk ""didn't deserve to die.""  

""Whether he deserves to be honored by our parliament is another story,"" she said, linking to past social media posts by Kirk assailing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

The European Commission, the EU's executive body, said it ""condemns all forms of violence, and we offer our sincere sympathies to the families of the victims.""

US President Donald Trump announced that he would posthumously award conservative activist Charlie Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

""Charlie was a giant of his generation, a champion of liberty and an inspiration to millions and millions of people,"" Trump told audience during a ceremony at the Pentagon marking the September 11, 2001 attacks.

Robert Bohls, the top FBI agent in Utah's capital Salt Lake City, has said that authorities recovered a high-powered bolt-action rifle, which they believe to be the weapon used in the Charlie Kirk shooting. 

The weapon was found in ""a wooded area where the shooter had fled.""

Bohls added that  ""we have images of the suspect,"" and that ""this was a targeted event.""

""We're doing everything we can to find him, and we're not sure how far he has gone yet, but we will, we will do our best,"" the agent said.

The shooter ""appears to be of college age"" and ""blended in"" with the college population on the Utah Valley University campus, he added. 

Utah Department of Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason said authorities ""have good video of this individual"" and are ""working through some technologies and some ways"" to identify the suspect.

Robert Bohls, the FBI special agent in charge of the bureau's Salt Lake City office, said at a news conference this morning that agents recovered “a high-powered bolt action rifle” in “a wooded area where the shooter had fled.” The FBI laboratory will analyze the weapon, Bohls said.

US Vice President JD Vance is set to visit Utah and meet Kirk's family, according to a source familiar with the plans. 

Vance was initially planned to attend a ceremony in New York City marking the 24th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks with his wife Usha Vance. 

Kirk's killing is likely to prompt tighter security measures at the World Trade Center site amid tense political climate. 

Vance posted earlier on X a lengthy remembrance of their firendship, saying Kirk played a citicial role in setting up the second Trump administration.

""So much of the success we've had in this administration traces directly to Charlie's ability to organize and convene,"" Vance wrote. ""He didn't just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government.""

Before the Utah campus event, Kirk had just returned to the US from an overseas speaking tour in South Korea and Japan.

He attended a conservative conference in Seoul last Friday, where he said men shifting toward conservativism ""is occurring simultaneously across multiple continents.""

In Tokyo, Kirk spoke at a symposium hosted by the anti-immigration Sanseito party, which made its political breakthrough in a July upper house vote.

""I'm excited ... to learn and to hopefully invigorate the people of your great nation to keep fighting this globalist menace,"" Kirk said in an interview with a Sanseito lawmaker posted on YouTube before the event.

The conservative pundit also stirred controversy in Europe. 

Kirk went on a UK tour in May, debating students at Oxford and Cambridge universities and appearing on conservative media talk shows. He claimed that he saw a cafe where ""every single table was taken by a Mohammed and a fully burqa-wearing woman — not a single native Brit.""

He also went to Greenland with Donald Trump Jr., and later said Greenlanders should ""disconnect from their Danish masters"" and fall under US rule instead. 

On his podcast, Kirk backed a speech by JD Vance at the Munich Security Conference, where the US vice president said freedoms were declining in Europe. 

""German prosecutors say someone can be locked up if they insult someone online,"" Kirk said. ""Free speech is not a German value. Totalitarianism is a German value.""

Although investigators have not yet named a motive, Utah Governor Spencer Cox has called Kirk's killing a political assassination.

The shooting marks the latest instance of political violence in the US.

It comes after Minnesota state Representative Melissa Hortman, a Democrat, was killed along with her husband in June by a gunman who authorities said had a manifesto and a list of other lawmakers and potential targets. 

US President Donald Trump himself survived two assassination attempts last year. The trial of the suspect in the second attempt was due to begin on Thursday. 

Reuters news agency says it recorded more than 300 cases of politically motivated violent acts across the ideological spectrum since supporters of Trump attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he was ""appalled by the murder of Charlie Kirk.""

""There is no justification for political violence and every act of it threatens democracy,"" he said. 

Separately, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer stressed the importance of freedom of speech.

""We must all be free to debate openly and freely without fear — there can be no justification for political violence,"" Starmer wrote on X. ","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

            An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer fatally shot a man who resisted arrest and dragged the officer during a vehicle stop in a Chicago suburb Friday morning, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
    


            The man, Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, was an undocumented immigrant, according to DHS. The officer, whose name was not immediately released, suffered severe injuries but is in stable condition, a Homeland Security official told CNN.
    


            The incident happened during a vehicle stop in Franklin Park, a community about 15 miles west of downtown Chicago. Villegas-Gonzalez drove his car at law enforcement officers, hitting one of them and dragging that officer a “significant distance,” according to the department.
    


            “We are praying for the speedy recovery of our law enforcement officer. He followed his training, used appropriate force, and properly enforced the law to protect the public and law enforcement,” Tricia McLaughlin, Homeland Security assistant secretary, said in a release.
    


            “Viral social media videos and activists encouraging illegal aliens to resist law enforcement not only spread misinformation, but also undermine public safety, as well as the safety of our officers and those being apprehended,” she said.
    


            Immigration enforcement operations have been ramping up in the Chicago area over recent days, marking one of the latest escalations between the Trump administration and Democratic-led cities that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.
    


            This week, the administration announced “Operation Midway Blitz,” which Homeland Security officials have described as intended to target undocumented immigrants in Illinois with criminal records. So far, they say, the operation has led to the arrests of undocumented immigrants convicted of crimes, including assault and driving under the influence. 



            The Franklin Police Department referred questions to the FBI.
    


            FBI agents were processing the scene on Friday afternoon, a CNN crew observed.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","Trump has turned up the temperature after Kirk's killing. Spencer Cox is trying to turn it back down.","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/12/politics/spencer-cox-donald-trump-rhetoric-analysis","Fri, 12 Sep 2025 17:19:00 GMT","


            For the approximately 40 hours between the assassination of Charlie Kirk and the announcement Friday that a suspect had been apprehended, finger-pointing reigned on the right.
    


            Some Republicans and right-wing pundits and influencers spoke of “war” and their side becoming radicalized in response. President Donald Trump, who'd floated cracking down on leftists and liberal organizations he baselessly blamed for political violence, topped it off Friday morning by suggesting conservative extremists have been radicalized for legitimate reasons, while saying that “radicals on the left are the problem.”
    


            At a time when politicians and presidents usually call for calm and unity, his rhetoric was throwing fuel on the fire. And it wasn't difficult to see how that could lead to even more ugly places.
    


            But the tragedy in Utah also happens to have cast a spotlight on Utah Gov. Spencer Cox — a Republican who has spent years calling for quite the opposite approach: a more civil and less angry version of politics. And over the last 24 hours, he's seized the moment.
    


            During two press conferences late Thursday and early Friday, it's Cox who did most of the talking. He used that time to project a far different message than that of Trump and leading MAGA figures.
    


            He at one point explicitly decried the tendency to “point the finger at the other side,” something Trump and others have repeatedly done.
    


            “We can return violence with violence. We can return hate with hate. And that's the problem with political violence,” Cox said. “It metastasizes, because we can always point the finger at the other side.
    


            “And at some point, we have to find an off-ramp, or it's going to get much, much worse.”
    


            At another point, Cox emphasized that “there is one person responsible for what happened here” – a counterpoint to those like Trump who speculatively blamed the rhetoric of the political left even before there was a suspect.
    


            Investigators are still working to develop a fuller idea of the suspect's motivations. Cox said Friday that a family member told the authorities the person in custody had become more political in recent years, and in at least one conversation, he mentioned Kirk and “why they didn't like him and the viewpoints he had.”
    


            (And some on the left have responded to Kirk's assassination with glee, but that's come almost wholly from random internet users rather than high-profile political figures.)
    


            Cox made a point to cite a series of comments from Kirk himself in which he espoused the importance of forgiveness, nonviolence and not getting caught up in internet rage.
    


            “Do we escalate or do we find an off-ramp?” Cox said. “And again, it's a choice. It's a choice, and every one of us gets to make that choice.”
    


            The night before, Cox had urged people to log off social media and cited foreign adversaries – naming Russia and China, specifically – who he said were attempting to foment violence with disinformation.
    


            “I would encourage you to ignore those, to turn off those streams, and spend a little more time with our families,” Cox said.
    


            He added Friday: “I would encourage people to log off, turn off, touch grass, hug a family member, go out and do good in your community.”
    


            This is all very much in keeping with Cox's political brand. At the National Governors Association, he and Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore have spearheaded a  “Disagree Better” campaign focused on healthier political dialogue.
    


            Late in his 2020 gubernatorial campaign, Cox actually cut an ad with his Democratic opponent in which both candidates emphasized civil politics and Cox spoke of the need for a “peaceful transition of power,” just weeks before Trump began trying to overturn his 2020 loss.
    


            This attitude has put Cox in conflict with Trump from time to time. The GOP governor, for example, urged Trump back in May to adopt a more conciliatory style.
    


            “I think if he were here, he'd tell you it's not his top priority,” Cox said at the time, adding, “I think when there's been opportunities for him to reflect and change course to bring people together, he can be really good at it.”
    


            Cox has said he didn't vote for Trump in 2016 and 2020. And in 2024, he said he wouldn't do it that year either. But he reversed himself after the first assassination attempt against Trump, saying the then-GOP nominee had “the opportunity to do something that no other person on earth can do right now: unify and save our country.”
    


            It remains to be seen whether Cox can help turn down the temperature in this moment. Emotions are still running very high, and to the extent a perception of disproportionate political violence sets in, that's difficult for people to set aside.
    


            But it feels like it was a choice for Cox to have been doing the bulk of the talking at press conferences the last two days, even as he stood next to FBI Director Kash Patel and other officials. It came as some on the right have begun urging Trump and his allies to cool their rhetoric.
    


            And quickly after Friday's press conference, Cox earned plaudits from across the political spectrum.
    


            “I know this guy is a Republican and all,” Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz said Friday morning on X, “but I swear you could win all the electoral votes with this message in (20)28.”

The attack in Doha upended a decades-old assumption – and left Arab leaders questioning how much they can still rely on Washington

On Thursday, Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, led a funeral at the state mosque. Flanked by officials in white thobes, he prayed over six caskets – one draped in a Qatari flag and five bearing Palestinian flags.

Israel's strike on Hamas leaders in Doha on Tuesday, which also killed a Qatari officer, marked an unprecedented moment for the Gulf kingdom. The attack undercut the assumption that has underpinned Qatari foreign policy for three decades and reverberated across the Arab region: be useful to the United States, and it will protect you.

Qatar has been useful. It has facilitated peace talks between Israel and Hamas, did the same with the Taliban and the US during the war in Afghanistan, and hosts the Al Udeid air base, the largest American military base in the Middle East.

For decades the arrangement has held. The US supplied arms, parked its aircraft carrier in the Gulf and provided political cover internationally. The support has helped spare Gulf nations from the unrest that has consumed much of the Middle East, despite the rivalry with Iran.

That changed when the US failed to stop the strike on Qatar this week, despite Israel being one of its closest allies. Donald Trump said he tried to give warning, but Qatar said it was only notified after the strike.

Doha strongly condemned the strike, with al-Thani calling it “state terror” in an interview with CNN.

“I have no words to express how enraged we are from such an action … This is state terror. We are betrayed,” he said.

Although Trump tends to view international relationships as transactions, diplomats say that the strike has wounded the trust between the Gulf and the US that has existed since the 1930s.

“This has real repercussions for the relationship,” said Patrick Theros, a former US ambassador to Qatar who helped build the Al Udeid base.

“The Gulf states, beginning with Saudi Arabia, believe that their security and stability still depend on America. For them, preventing an Israeli attack on Qatar was a no-brainer – the US could have done it without barely lifting a finger,” he added.

The message taken from the strike was not that Washington cannot control Israel, which it arms and equips to the tune of tens of billions of dollars, but it does not want to rein it in. Trump's ability to call back Israeli jets on their way to bomb Tehran showed he has leverage when he chooses to.

“The perception in the Gulf is that at worst is that the US didn't want to stop Israel and gave it a green light, or at best, that it doesn't care about the sovereignty of its Gulf allies,” said Yasmine Farouk, project director at the International Crisis Group.

The reaction among Gulf states has been immediate. Despite past rifts with Qatar, its neighbours viewed the attack as an assault on all of their collective sovereignty.

A flurry of diplomacy has followed, much of it spearheaded by the UAE. Qatar has welcomed Jordan's crown prince, the UAE president and Egypt's foreign minister. On Sunday, Doha will host an emergency Arab-Islamic summit.

“The repercussions of Israel's war in Gaza and its military campaigns across the region have been bringing the gulf states closer together,” said Farouk. “I think this will be a moment where they try to move from solidarity to action.”

In the short term, there will likely be little change in Washington relations. The US still underpins security and economic order in the Gulf and a hasty breakup is not in the cards.

But Gulf states may quietly start turning down American requests.

Getting more Arab states to sign up for the Abraham Accords – Trump's major initiative in the region – is farther off than ever. The relationship between the UAE and Israel is already on the rocks, with the former summoning the Israeli ambassador. US access to Gulf capital could also be in jeopardy.

If the US has stopped holding its side of the quid pro quo, the Gulf could quietly re-evaluate the return it is getting on its investments. By the time the US notices, it might be too late.

“It will be the little things being turned down, but they will accumulate. We won't notice at first, but Qatar will stop taking chances on our behalf,” said Theros.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

In the U.S., job creation has been steadily declining while inflation is proving stubborn.Spencer Platt/Getty Images

John Rapley is a contributing columnist for The Globe and Mail. He is an author and academic whose books include Why Empires Fall and Twilight of the Money Gods.

Things may be bad for the Canadian economy, but if it's any consolation, they may be worse in the United States.

The bad news is that Canada appears to be heading toward a recession. The good news is that, as typically happens in a rapidly decelerating economy, inflation is slowing. That makes the course clear for the authorities. Unless Tuesday's inflation report from Statistics Canada reports an upside surprise in the inflation figure, the Bank of Canada will likely cut interest rates again at its meeting the next day. And while the federal government aims to cut its spending in its autumn budget, lower interest costs and a comparatively low fiscal deficit will allow it some cushion to absorb the increased spending a recession would cause.

With never-ending tariff drama, the Canadian economy limps along

However, the picture emerging of the U.S. economy is a good deal murkier. Recent job numbers paint a picture of an economy which is slowing down rapidly – or not. Job creation has been steadily declining since last year and is now near zero. In manufacturing the layoffs have begun. Yet despite that the unemployment rate remains near historical lows and real wages remain positive (although there are early signs this may be changing). As a result, opinion among economists is deeply divided, with some saying the U.S. economy is already in recession, and some saying it's doing just fine.

The picture on the inflation front is at least less ambiguous, if concerning. Inflation is proving a lot more stubborn in the U.S. than in Canada. This week's reports showed that prices keep rising, and food prices are becoming a real problem for Americans. Moreover, price pressures in the pipeline appear to be building further: although producer prices fell this month, underlying core inflation actually rose. Producer prices gained 2.8 per cent while consumer prices rose by 3.1 per cent – both well above the Federal Reserve's 2-per-cent target, and both trending upward. There's some evidence that producers have so far been absorbing the impact of tariffs in order to retain their customers. If they continue to do that, it could eat into their profits, which would ultimately hurt share prices. But if the economy gains speed and consumers keep buying, they could pass on those price increases, driving inflation even further beyond the targets.

U.S. employment growth revised down by nearly a million jobs

These conflicting signals from the economy thus make the task of the Fed a good deal more complicated than the Bank of Canada's. If the economy is weakening sharply, cutting interest rates at this week's Fed meeting will soften the blow. But if inflation is rising, such a step could add fuel to the fire. For investors, that raises the risk of long-term bets: cheaper credit will fuel spending and investment and help drive up share prices, but the risk of an inflation surge could also wipe out all those gains if interest rates go back up in a matter of months.

Amid such rising uncertainty about the economy's future course, global investors have begun quietly reallocating away from the U.S. The flood of money being unleashed in the U.S. via government spending, tax cuts and reduced credit costs has been quietly leaving the States to go elsewhere. Amid the policy confusion, that is likely to continue, since other countries offer a clearer investment picture. Thus, after years of underperformance. the Canadian stock market has begun to beat the U.S. one.

Nor is this is trend peculiar to Canada. Despite the new records it is setting, the U.S. stock market is underperforming most of its peers', mainly because one effect of the increasing availability of money in the U.S. is that Americans are joining the rest of the world and taking their dollars elsewhere. Although the U.S. market is now up by more than 10 per cent his year, China's has risen by 15 per cent, Brazil's by nearly 20 per cent, and Spain's an eye-watering 30 per cent.

Therefore, a Fed rate cut may do more to juice the Canadian economy than the U.S. one. And even though interest rates in Canada are nearly a full percentage point lower than the U.S.'s, the loonie has held its value this year, suggesting continued investor confidence. So, while the situation in Canada may look dire, the country's prospects for navigating the coming recession don't look too bad, comparatively. At 6.4 per cent of GDP, the U.S. fiscal deficit is four times Canada's in proportionate terms and is on track to get worse.

So, when Canada's next budget is revealed, rather than squawk at the size of a deficit that is all but certain to increase, given the state of the economy, Canadians would do better to peer at the details to determine where the money is going. If it's being used just to soften the pain, that wouldn't be good; but if it's being used to build for the future, shaping the economy that will emerge from the recession, it should be welcomed.

CHICAGO (AP) — The Department of Homeland Security said an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer opened fire and killed a suspect in a Chicago suburb Friday after the suspect tried to evade arrest by driving his car at the officers and dragged one of them. 

The department said in a news release that the officer was trying to arrest a man, who had a history of reckless driving.

The department said the man refused orders from the officers and instead drove his car at them. One of the ICE officers was hit and dragged by the car. The department said the officer felt a threat to his life and opened fire. 

ICE said the officer and the subject were both taken to a local hospital where the suspect was pronounced dead. 

“We are praying for the speedy recovery of our law enforcement officer. He followed his training, used appropriate force, and properly enforced the law to protect the public and law enforcement,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement.

ICE says the shooting happened in the Franklin Park suburb, about 18 miles west of Chicago. 

The shooting comes as ICE is a little less than a week into an immigration enforcement operation in Chicago that it has dubbed “Midway Blitz.” 

McLaughlin said, “viral social media videos and activists encouraging illegal aliens to resist law enforcement” have made the work of their officers more dangerous.

Fox News chief Washington correspondent Mike Emanuel discusses the criticism Rep. Ilhan Omar, R-Minn., is facing after making comments about the Charlie Kirk assassination on ‘The Faulkner Focus.'

Conservatives on social media are railing against Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., over a Substack appearance where she criticized conservative commentator Charlie Kirk following his assassination, with some calling for her to be removed from Congress.

""Rep. Ilhan Omar (D) is now ATTACKING and SMEARING Charlie Kirk after he was assassinated,"" conservative influencer account LibsofTikTok posted on X Thursday. ""This is an elected representative. She needs to RESIGN. EVIL.""

Red State writer Bonchie wrote on X, ""Ilhan Omar going on with Mehdi Hasan so they can both mock Charlie Kirk and lie about his ‘actions' to justify his assassination is exactly what you'd expect.""

""Look at their grins,"" conservative influencer account End Wokeness posted on X.

""Yeah I've had it with tolerance for evil,"" conservative influencer Robby Starbuck posted on X. ""Expel Ilhan Omar from Congress and deport her to Somalia. She reportedly committed immigration fraud with her sham marriage to her brother so this shouldn't be hard to do. I have no tolerance left for this evil.""

The clip drew the attention of Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boebert, who wrote on X, ""@IlhanMN, in the United States of America we have freedom of speech.""

Boebert added, ""I understand that in Somalia, where you come from and would do well to go back to, this isn't a thing. In our county, having political disagreements with someone isn't a reason to justify their execution.""

SECRET SERVICE UNDER PRESSURE: WHAT KIRK'S ASSASSINATION MEANS FOR TRUMP'S SECURITY

Fox News Digital reached out to Omar's office for comment and was directed to a social media post from Omar saying she ""disagreed with Charlie Kirk vehemently about his rhetoric"" but does not ""wish violence on anyone.""

""Right-wing accounts trying to spin a false story when I condemned his murder multiple times is fitting for their agenda to villainize the left to hide from the fact that Donald Trump gins up hate on a daily basis.""

The interview in question, a Zeteo Town Hall with Mehdi Hasan, began with Omar expressing condolences to Kirk's family. 

""It was really mortifying to hear the news,"" Omar said when asked about her reaction to the killing. ""All I could think about was his wife, his children, that image is going to live forever.""

Omar added that her heart ""breaks"" for those babies before getting into a conversation about Republicans criticizing violence from the left, calling it ""disgusting"" and then criticizing Kirk and making the comments that infuriated conservatives online.

""But what I do know for sure is that Charlie Kirk was someone who once said, ‘Guns save lives' after a school shooting,"" Omar said. ""Charlie was someone who was willing to debate and downplay the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police … downplay slavery and what Black people have gone through in this country by saying Juneteenth should never exist.""

Omar went on to lament that there are a ""lot of people who are out there talking"" about Kirk ""just wanting to have a civil debate,"" prompting Hasan to interject and call it a ""complete rewriting of history.""

""Yeah,"" Omar responded. ""There is nothing more effed up than to completely pretend that his words and actions have not been recorded and in existence for the last decade or so.""

Omar then criticized GOP Rep. Nancy Mace and President Trump, saying the president has ""incited violence against people like me.""

""And so, you know, these people are full of s---, and it's important for us to call them out, while we feel anger and sadness and have, you know, empathy, which Charlie said it shouldn't exist because that's a newly created word or something,"" Omar said. 

""Like, I have empathy for his kids and his wife and what they're going through because I do not want that. No one should go through that, and we should hold ourselves, I hope, to a higher standard.""

Hasan then claimed that the ""politicizing is being done by the right"" and referred to it as a ""problem"" that you can't say ""anything negative"" about someone when they die.""

""I'm happy to not say anything negative and let the family mourn, but it's when everyone else tries to kind of do a whitewashing of who that person was,"" Hasan continued as Omar nodded along.

The X account for Zeteo News, founded by Hasan, wrote ""this is a lie"" in response to criticism over Omar's comments, noting that Omar reacted with ""sadness"" for Kirk's family. 

On Friday, authorities announced that they had arrested a suspect, 22-year-old Utah resident Tyler Robinson.

President Trump called Kirk's murder a ""dark moment"" for the United States and ordered flags to be flown at half-staff until Sunday evening.

Nate Amendola said the evidence against Brian Walshe is circumstantial, and he believes it will be tough for prosecutors to win the case without Ana Walshe's body.

Brian Walshe, the Massachusetts man accused of dismembering his wife, was attacked in jail on Thursday, weeks ahead of his murder trial. 

Walshe was assaulted inside a housing unit at a correctional center in Dedham just before 10 p.m. The Norfolk County Sheriff's Office didn't identify Walshe as the victim, but his lawyer, Larry Tipton, confirmed to Masslive.com that Walshe was stabbed. 

Walshe was taken to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston for treatment and returned to the jail overnight, the sheriff's office said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

""The other individual involved was subdued by officers, and a makeshift blunt instrument was recovered,"" the statement said. 

The incident is being investigated. 

Walshe is accused of killing and dismembering his wife, Ana, in January 2023. He is scheduled to go to trial in October. 

Ana Walshe, a mother of three young children and a real estate professional who worked in Washington, D.C., disappeared on New Year's Day 2023 and was reported missing a few days later. Her body has never been recovered.

Brian Walshe was captured on Home Depot surveillance video buying various items, including three mops and brushes, two splash-resistant goggles and a utility knife. Investigators believe he used the items to dispose of his wife's body. 

During the search for Ana, investigators found a hacksaw with a ""small bone fragment"" in a dumpster across the street from Walshe's mother's house. In the days after his wife's disappearance, Walshe allegedly used his son's iPad to make over a dozen Google searches about how to discard a body, prosecutors said. 

Before the disappearance, Walshe hired a private investigator because he suspected his wife was cheating on him.

At the time, the couple's marriage was on the rocks because of Brian's unrelated legal troubles. He had been under house arrest as part of his pre-sentencing probation for selling fake Andy Warhol paintings, according to prosecutors.

Mourners united in song for Charlie Kirk following his assassination at Utah Valley University on Sep. 10, 2025. (Alexa Christensen)

After the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk sent shock waves through the political landscape this week, Fox News Digital spoke to several high-profile conservative speakers about the future of the movement and the influence Kirk's legacy and style will have on it. 

""Conservatives will not be silenced,"" Heather Mac Donald, Thomas W. Smith Fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a contributing editor of City Journal, told Fox News Digital, adding that Kirk ""would not have been silenced"" so conservatives should ""emulate his courage.""

Columnist and commentator Bethany Mandel told Fox News Digital that Kirk's assassination was ""absolutely an effort to try to silence conservatives"" and that ""we have to resist the temptation to allow that.""

""We need to keep speaking out and double down on not only Charlie's message, but his methodology,"" Mandel said.

Kirk was assassinated on Wednesday while speaking to thousands of students at Utah Valley University when a gunman positioned on a nearby roof fired a single shot, striking Kirk in the neck.

Kirk was rushed to Timpanogos Regional Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, prompting an outpouring of support from conservatives across the globe, including President Donald Trump, who called the killing a ""dark moment for America.""

On Friday, authorities announced that they had arrested a suspect, 22-year-old Utah resident Tyler Robinson.

""Charlie Kirk was a good man,"" John Ashbrook, co-host of the conservative podcast ""Ruthless"", told Fox News Digital. ""And his legacy will endure because none of us will ever forget his leadership nor the voice he provided for millions of regular people across this country.""

Mac Donald told Fox News Digital that it is ""hard to imagine"" Kirk was killed for ""any other reason than that he was breaking the stranglehold of anti-Western ideology on college campuses and beyond.""

""It was sadly fitting that he was killed at a college campus, and not even one known for its leftward leanings, since colleges are the seed bed of modern day speech suppression and the false equations that political contrarian speech = hate speech and that hate speech may be snuffed out—apparently by any means necessary,"" Mac Donald said. 

""The killer apparently agreed with those would-be censorers.  The self-centeredness and historical and moral ignorance of coddled American students has bloomed into something more pernicious, as the beatification of Luigi Mangione already showed.""

Going forward, in terms of security at events for prominent conservative speakers, Mandel called on campuses and cities that ""claim to care about the future of America and civil discourse"" to step up and ""ensure adequate security.""

""We should not have to pay tax in the form of security in order to safely share our political opinions,"" Mandel told Fox News Digital.

Conservatives have rallied around Kirk's style of speaking out publicly and exchanging ideas with those who disagree, including prominent influencer Ben Shapiro, who wrote on X that ""we will never stop debating and discussing.""

""We will never stop standing up for what America is and what she should be,"" Shapiro said, adding that he intends to continue speaking at colleges across the country despite the inherent dangers. 

Mac Donald told Fox News Digital, ""It is a cliché and self-serving to say: they fear us because we are winning, but presumably, there is less of a perceived need to efface someone who is losing a cause anyway. Kirk was feared because he was winning.""

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox provides details on the arrest of Tyler Robinson, who reportedly 'confessed' or 'implied' to a family member that he had commited the assassination of Charlie Kirk.

A Phoenix sports outlet ""made the decision to part ways"" with its lead Phoenix Suns writer following a series of posts on X about Charlie Kirk's assassination.

Kirk was assassinated Wednesday at Utah Valley University, and Gerald Bourget suggested that he was ""refusing to mourn"" his death.

""'Political differences' are not the same thing as spewing hateful rhetoric on a daily basis, and refusing to mourn a life devoted to that cause is not the same thing as celebrating gun violence. Just so we're 100% clear on that,"" Bourget posted.

Bourget also said that Kirk's killing was the ""Holy Grail of Ironies,"" referencing Kirk's stance on the Second Amendment. He also called Kirk a ""bigot"" who ""spread genocidal propaganda.""

""If you're saddened by today's ‘political violence,' horrified by the video, or repulsed by my response, ask yourself why your reaction was different when it came to school shootings, mass deportations or the HUNDREDS of videos of horrific murders in Gaza (which Kirk cheered on).

""Truly don't care if you think it's insensitive or poor timing to decline to respect an evil man who died. Too many of you are more concerned with being polite and *appearing* to be good people rather than showing some damn backbone and standing on principal (sic) to condemn hate.""

The outlet announced its decision on Thursday.

""The opinions expressed by our employees do not represent the views of PHNX or ALLCITY Network,"" the company wrote on X. ""We take matters involving violence very seriously and are committed to ensuring that ALLCITY remains a safe place for our employees and community alike.

A Carolina Panthers staffer was also fired for similar comments shared online.

Police confirmed Friday that a suspect in Kirk's killing was arrested. He was identified as Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old Utah resident. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox stated that a family member of Robinson's contacted a family friend who then reached out to the Washington County Sheriff's Office ""with information that Robinson had confessed to them or implied that he had committed the incident.""

Authorities identified Tyler Robinson as Charlie Kirk‘s alleged assassin and charged him with murder, which carries the possibility of the death penalty. his arrest Thursday evening after a 33-hour manhunt.

“Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We got him,” Gov. Spencer Cox (R-UT) said Friday morning following a 33-hour manhunt. Robinson was arrested at 10 p.m. local time.

The charges, announced Friday afternoon, include aggravated murder, felony discharge of a weapon causing serious bodily injury, and obstruction of justice, according to the Associated Press. Official release of the charges is expected next week.

Robinson did not have a criminal history.

Cox said a family member told law enforcement that Robinson either confessed or implied that he assassinated Kirk.

Authorities said Robinson had become increasingly political in recent months. At one point, he argued with family members about Kirk at the dinner table, saying he was “full of hate and spreading hate.” Robinson also mentioned Kirk was coming to Utah Valley University and objected to his presence on campus.

Cox confirmed that Robinson engraved the bullet casings with antifascist messages, including “Hey fascist! Catch!” and “Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao,” the lyrics of a famous Italian antifascist song. Cox also described what appeared to be the three-arrow symbol, an antifascist sign made famous during street fights in Weimar Germany.

The fired casings also referenced a nearly decade-old sexual meme, saying, “Notices bulge, OWO, what's this?” The last case was an example of similar trolling: “If you read this, you are gay LMAO.”

Authorities confirmed that Robinson's roommate also assisted law enforcement by showing investigators Discord messages that included him and Robinson. These messages outlined what he did with the rifle used to murder Kirk.

The messages discussed “stating a need to retrieve a rifle from a drop, leaving the rifle in a bush, messages related to a to visually watching the area where a rifle was left, and a message referring to having left the rifle wrapped in a towel,” Cox said. 

Cox said authorities don't have “any information that would lead to any additional arrests,” but the investigation is ongoing.

Robinson was not a student at UVU. Cox also said he gave no indication of having a mental illness.

Robinson was booked at the Utah County Jail. He was a longtime resident of Washington County, Utah, roughly 250 miles away from the UVU campus.

FBI Director Kash Patel praised the public's assistance in narrowing the search. There were 7,000 leads sent to law enforcement Thursday evening. After they released additional footage of the suspect, 4,000 more leads were sent in.

Cox said he “absolutely” believes the assassination is a “watershed” moment in American history, drawing parallels with the political violence of the late 1960s.

“The question is, what kind of watershed and that that chapter remains to be written. Is this the end of a dark chapter in our history or the beginning of a darker chapter in our history?” he asked.

Kirk, the founder and CEO of Turning Point USA, was shot in the neck and killed while speaking at an event at UVU. Authorities said Robinson allegedly sniped Kirk from a position on top of the Sorensen Student Center, several hundred feet away from him, and then made a hasty retreat into a nearby neighborhood.

On Thursday, police recovered the murder weapon: a high-powered, bolt-action rifle. The weapon was left in a wooded area, which has since been swept and secured. Authorities had another breakthrough the same day when they obtained photo and video footage of the alleged shooter. They released it to the public for help in the case.

President Donald Trump broke the news of the shooter's arrest in an appearance on Fox News on Friday morning.

“I think, with a high degree of certainty, we have him in custody. Everyone did a great job,” Trump said.

SUSPECT IN CHARLIE KIRK ASSASSINATION IS IN CUSTODY: TRUMP

The FBI and Utah Department of Public Safety co-led the manhunt “in unison with the Utah County Attorney's Office, the Utah County Sheriff's Office, and the local police departments,” according to a statement from the Utah DPS.

The assassination is one of the most high-profile political killings in modern U.S. history. The shooting and subsequent fallout have drawn international attention and condemnation from leaders around the world. The incident has also sparked comments from nearly all Democratic and Republican lawmakers, though some Democrats focused on openly bashing Kirk or Trump's rhetoric in the aftermath.

Authorities revealed on Friday antifascist slogans and video game references were etched onto bullet casings from the gun the suspect used to kill Charlie Kirk.

Gov. Spencer Cox (R-UT) named Utah resident Tyler Robinson, 22, as the suspect in the murder case during a press conference Friday morning. 

Officials said bullet casings with inscriptions reading “Hey fascist! Catch!” were found in a wooded area near the abandoned bolt-action rifle Robinson is accused of using to kill Kirk. 

“A second unfired casing read, ‘Oh, Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, ciao, ciao,' and a third unfired casing read, ‘If you read this, you are gay, LMAO,'” Cox added. 

Bella Ciao means “hello beautiful” in Italian. It was adopted as an anthem of the Italian antifascist resistance during World War II. It is sung to celebrate the fall of the Mussolini regime.

A third unfired casing held inscriptions of an “up arrow symbol, right arrow symbol, and three down arrow symbols,” Cox said. Some have speculated it is a reference to the Iron Front logo used by antifa organizers. The three downward arrows have different interpretations but can refer to either the Social Democratic Party in Germany, the trade unions, and the modern-day SDP youth group, or to the “political, economic, and physical strength of the working class.”

However, it is more likely connected to the controller code for a bomb air strike in the video game Helldivers, the subject of popular memes, according to other reports.

The governor said investigators found other inscriptions on a fire casing that read “notices, bulges, OWO, what's this?” which appears to be a crude, sexually provocative reference. 

The investigators interviewed a family member of Robinson who said the suspect had “become more political in recent years” and talked about how they believed Kirk was “full of hate and spreading hate” during a recent conversation over a family dinner, according to the governor. 

“The family member referenced a recent incident in which Robinson came to dinner prior to Sept. 10, and in the conversation with another family member, Robinson mentioned Charlie Kirk was coming to UVU,” Cox added, referencing Utah Valley University, where Kirk, 31, was gunned down on Wednesday, leaving behind a wife and two young children. 

Robinson has registered as a nonpartisan voter in Utah, and his parents are registered Republicans, according to the Wall Street Journal. Despite previous speculation, there was no mention of him identifying as transgender.

FBI Director Kash Patel on Friday said the investigation remains “ongoing” and praised Robinson's arrest as a “testament to the dedication of good law enforcement being great, and partnerships in law enforcement.” 

Cox made a rousing call for citizens to reject political violence and embrace good-faith debate, on which he said Kirk built his life and career as the co-founder of Turning Point USA, which conducted political outreach to youth on college campuses across the country. 

“Young people love Charlie, and young people hated Charlie, and Charlie went into those places anyway, and these are the words that have helped me,” the governor said. “Charlie said, ‘When people stop talking, that's when you get violence.' He said, ‘The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong. The only way out of the labyrinth of suffering is to forgive, welcome without judgment, love without condition, forgive without limit.' He said, ‘Always forgive your enemies.'”

PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE WILL ATTEND CHARLIE KIRK'S FUNERAL

The governor praised Utahns for their response to the assassination during the press conference Friday morning. 

“There was no rioting, there's no looting, there were no cars set on fire. There's no violence. There were vigils and prayers and people coming together to share the humanity,” he said. “And that, ladies and gentlemen, I believe, is the answer to this. We can return violence with fire and violence, we can return hate with hate. And that's the problem with political violence is it metastasizes, because we can always point the finger at the other side.”

ICE won't say.

In Justice Brett Kavanaugh's telling, citizenship checks by ICE officers are as straightforward and frictionless as presenting yourself at the entrance to a Costco. Just show a membership card, and you'll be on your merry way.

Kavanaugh wrote an opinion this week, concurring with the Court's majority, that would afford Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers broad latitude to detain and question someone based on factors such as ethnic appearance, speaking Spanish, and speaking English with an accent. The risk that nonwhite Americans will be racially profiled or subject to unlawful detention should be weighed against the brevity of an encounter with ICE, Kavanaugh wrote.

“If the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, they promptly let the individual go,” he wrote.

The problem is that ICE does not say what it accepts as definitive proof of legal status. Is it a driver's license? A green card? A folder of immigration documents? Donald Trump's mass-deportation campaign has swept up U.S. citizens and permanent residents over the past several months, leaving some detained for days despite individuals presenting officers with evidence of their legal status.

Kavanaugh's depiction of an immigration check shows “a fundamental misunderstanding about verification of citizenship,” John Sandweg, an attorney who served as the top official at ICE during part of Barack Obama's first term, told me.

“There is no national database or birth registry,” Sandweg said. “There is no place for ICE to quickly check and do facial recognition. An officer's not going to just take someone's word for it if they have reasons to believe they're in the country unlawfully.”

It can take days or weeks for ICE or someone's attorney to track down their birth records, Sandweg added. “The idea that it's going to be done in a Home Depot parking lot is ludicrous.”

The Supreme Court in Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo lifted a temporary restraining order from a District Court judge in July that barred U.S. authorities from using racial profiling to look for immigrants living illegally in Southern California. The ruling is not a final decision on the matter. But it has given the Supreme Court's blessing—for now—to an enforcement model that allows ICE broad latitude to detain people based on appearance, without setting standards for officers to confirm legal residency as speedily as Kavanaugh envisions.

Jorge-Mario Cabrera, a spokesperson for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, one of the immigrant-advocacy groups in Los Angeles that joined the lawsuit, told me he has started carrying around a passport card for the first time in his life. The organization has reminded immigrants with Temporary Protected Status, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, and other forms of provisional legal status to carry their documents at all times.

A naturalized citizen born in El Salvador, Cabrera described the Trump administration's immigration blitz in Southern California as a “tornado” that scoops up everyone in its path.

“They come in, they sweep through, and they ask questions later, if they ask them at all,” Cabrera told me. “There is no world, as described by Justice Kavanaugh, where common sense and reason exist as federal agents conduct immigration sweeps.”

“The freedom and well-being of all of us who look Latino, who look immigrant, is in danger,” he said.

Several career ICE officials I spoke with said street-level ID checks remain “a gray area,” especially when they involve U.S. citizens, and are different from targeted operations that seek to arrest a specific person who, in many cases, has a criminal record and whose immigration status is known to officers before they arrive. Under Trump, ICE has aggressively increased the number of people swept up because they were in the same house or general area as the officers' primary suspects, a practice known as “collateral arrests.”

“No one willingly arrests a USC, but it's just not always obvious,” one senior ICE official told me, using the agency's shorthand for a U.S. citizen. “Sometimes we need a whole team of attorneys to flush it out and do an analysis depending on when someone entered or the status of their parents.”

The official, who was not authorized to speak to reporters, said that ICE officers have long been trained to avoid lawsuits by quickly releasing U.S. citizens or other legal residents in their custody. But with the Trump administration demanding more and more arrests and deportations, ICE officers have now been told to err on the side of action, not caution.

“This administration would rather have you arrest the U.S. citizen and sort it out later,” the official told me.

I asked ICE's Office of Public Affairs to explain the agency's guidelines for officers attempting to verify the legal status of someone in custody. The DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin sent an email in response stating that allegations of ICE officers engaging in racial profiling are “disgusting” and “categorically FALSE.”

“DHS enforcement operations are highly targeted, and officers do their due diligence,” she wrote. “We know who we are targeting ahead of time. If and when we do encounter individuals subject to arrest, our law enforcement is trained to ask a series of well-determined questions to determine status and removability.”

McLaughlin did not say which identification documents ICE officers accept as proof of legal status or citizenship.

The United States has no national ID card. Attempts to introduce one after the September 11 terrorist attacks were opposed by lawmakers from both parties concerned with privacy issues and the rise of a police state. The United States defined its freedoms during the 20th century in contrast to totalitarian regimes that controlled their subjects with national ID cards that police could demand at any time.

Listen: How ICE became Trump's secret army

Immigrants who are permanent legal residents but not citizens are required to carry their green card, and others with temporary or provisional legal status must also carry proof of their identity. For U.S. citizens, it's a gray area, because no law requires American-born or naturalized citizens to carry a government ID.

The U.S. passport remains the gold standard of identification documents, and ICE officials told me they would typically end a status check if a suspect presents a valid one. Passport books are bulky, however, and mostly remain an accessory of international travel. Only about half of the U.S. population even has a passport, according to the State Department. U.S. birth certificates, printed on paper and issued by states and counties, are even more impractical to carry around as proof of citizenship.

“You shouldn't have to walk around with papers in the United States of America to prove that you belong,” Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker, a Democrat, wrote on social media on Wednesday, blasting the Trump administration's new immigration crackdown targeting Chicago, known as “Operation Midway Blitz.” Pritzker told NPR that he was especially worried about immigrants living in the country legally. “Nothing that they will carry will be good enough for ICE,” he said.

The plaintiffs in Southern California who sued the Trump administration alleged that the government had racially profiled them in violation of their Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure. Their lawsuit cited statements by the White House aide Stephen Miller, widely reported in the media, that ordered ICE officers to ramp up arrests by sweeping through Home Depot parking lots and other sites where laborers seek jobs.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who wrote a dissenting opinion joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, said that Kavanaugh's description of “brief stops for questioning” was inaccurate. She cited the recent case of a California man with dual Mexican and U.S. citizenship who was taken to an ICE detention center and held while officers ran a background check.

Kavanaugh's decision, she said, “improperly shifts the burden onto an entire class of citizens to carry enough documentation to prove that they deserve to walk freely. The Constitution does not permit the creation of such a second-class citizenship status.”

I asked several career ICE officials why street-level status checks don't immediately end when someone presents a government ID such as a driver's license. Several noted that 19 states and the District of Columbia issue driver's licenses to applicants who do not have to show proof of legal residency (although those licenses generally indicate that they are invalid for federal identification purposes).

ICE officers will typically run someone's driver's-license number or other identity documents through a DHS database of criminal records and immigration violations. This summer, officers began using an app called Mobile Fortify, which uses facial recognition and fingerprints to identify detainees in ICE custody. But it's most useful for confirming the identity of recent border-crossers whose biometric information has been already collected by Customs and Border Protection.

Last month, 50 Democratic lawmakers sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security's internal-oversight agencies calling for an investigation into ICE arrests of U.S. citizens since Trump took office this January. The letter cited several cases, including one of a Lowe's employee thrown to the ground and arrested by officers for allegedly throwing a punch at them, and another of a Chicago man seized outside a pizzeria and held for 10 hours.

The lawmakers asked DHS to disclose how often U.S. citizens have been arrested and what protocols were in place to prevent the practice. The internal-oversight agencies at DHS have not responded.

“If U.S. citizens have to start now carrying around their birth certificate or their passport in order to prove their own citizenship, rather than forcing law enforcement to have reasonable suspicion to believe that someone is not here legally, we've completely turned our law upside down,” Representative Dan Goldman, a Democrat from New York who was one of the letter's main organizers, said. “There are no checks and balances on this ICE dragnet right now.”

Nick Miroff: Kilmar Abrego Garcia was never coming back. Then he did.

Cecilia Wang, the ACLU's national legal director, told me that attorneys are gathering a more complete record of citizens and others who have been harmed by discriminatory ICE detentions. The ACLU will pursue its claims at a September 24 hearing asking the district court for a preliminary injunction.

“It would be bad enough to require everyone, equally, to show their papers,” Wang told me. “But it's even more pernicious, and there's a separate constitutional harm, when the government singles out one race or ethnicity and requires them to prove their status.”

“The presumption that appearing to be Latino gives rise to suspicion that you're in the United States unlawfully is really offensive, and that's a premise behind Justice Kavanaugh's concurring opinion,” she said. “And I just want to be really clear: That's not the law.”

Lee Lai's Cannon builds up to an earthshaking moment when its protagonist's anxiety can no longer be contained.

This is an edition of the Books Briefing, our editors' weekly guide to the best in books. 

A panic attack can feel like the end of the world. In his new novel, Pan, Michael Clune writes that during such an episode, “your consciousness gets so strong it actually leaps out of your mind entirely. It starts vibrating your body. It shakes meat and bone.” My colleague Scott Stossel reviewed the book this week, writing that anxiety can make “rays of sunlight come through my eyes and get in my chest, and I feel like I'm gagging on them.” Your stomach might feel like it's falling through the floor; your vision might blur; you might appear glassy, paralyzed by fear. Or, as in Lee Lai's new graphic novel, Cannon, a panic attack might look like a menacing bunch of magpies piling up on furniture.

First, here are four new stories from The Atlantic's Books section:

In Clune's Pan, a teenage boy in the 1990s Chicago suburbs begins having debilitating panic attacks and seeks to make some kind of sense of them, researching the Greek god Pan, from whom the word panic is derived. Lai's Cannon is very different stylistically, but it also attempts to communicate what panic feels like and how one might start learning to live with it. Its protagonist, Lucy, is a line cook in 2017 Montreal who manages her anxiety by running and biking while listening to soothing self-help tapes that remind her to focus on her breathing. Her best friend, Trish, calls her “Luce Cannon” (Cannon for short) as a joke: She's known to be steady, reliable, and contemplative. But underneath her chill facade, Cannon's about to blow her lid. She's taking care of her ill-tempered grandfather almost single-handedly, she's trying to ward off her jerk boss's innuendos without losing her job, and she believes that Trish takes her friendship (and her time) for granted.

The comic focuses on Cannon, but readers don't get to access her internal monologue. Mostly, we have to guess her state of mind based on her body language, her actions, and her words. The biggest hint we get is the birds: Magpies hop on her bike, shed feathers in her apartment, and hop around her grandfather's kitchen. None of the characters, save Cannon, seems to see them. But they're harbingers of an event that's depicted in the book's first panels: Cannon and Trish sit in the ruins of a darkened, wrecked restaurant, birds perched calmly around them. After this flash-forward, the narrative goes back three months, and we watch Cannon get closer and closer to that pivotal moment; all the while, the flock of magpies grows.  Despite its knotty subject, Cannon is a joy to read. Its art manages to be both spare and full of emotion; its dialogue feels lived-in. And it's a cathartic, unexpectedly gleeful story about anxiety. For years, Cannon bottles up all her fears. But as the early scene in the restaurant shows, that's not sustainable. When she explodes, she's on the verge of a panic attack. Instead of turning her worries inward, however, she transmutes them into rage, smashing dishware and overturning tables. The birds triumphantly swoop around with her, diving and flapping across the pages. Afterward, the magpies aren't gone—there's still plenty of stress on her plate—but Cannon finds it a bit easier to breathe.

Room Temperature, by Nicholson Baker

Baker is best known for his experimental debut novel, The Mezzanine, which takes place largely during a single ride up an escalator. In this, Baker's second novel, the author brings the same level of detail to a—only slightly—longer stretch of activity: a father feeding his newborn daughter. Giving the baby a bottle constitutes the surface-level action of the novel while the narration acts like a boomerang, flying past and returning to meditations on the narrator's bond with his wife, Patty. Their partnership is generous and kind. They make up quickly after fighting; they playfully tease each other; they comfort each other—such as when the narrator reassures Patty after she's criticized for her terrible spelling. Baker perfectly captures the intimacy of everyday love. A late chapter in the book detailing the couple's euphemism for defecating—big jobs—and how the phrase takes its place in their personal lexicon is unexpectedly moving, a testament to how the most mundane parts of a shared life can be the most profound. Room Temperature is a book in which not much happens, and everything happens—a fitting description for an excellent marriage. — Isle McElroy

Are Humans Watching Animals Too Closely?

By Ross Andersen

We are not great respecters of boundaries, human beings. Dogs may not have known this about us when they first edged up to our campfires, more than 10,000 years ago. They could not have anticipated the degree to which we would dictate the most intimate parts of their lives, up to and including their sexual partners. Even after these dramatic interventions, which we have used to cultivate in dogs a preference for captivity, we still have to exercise a lot of coercion in order to get them to play along. We have to remove them from their mother while they are still young. We have to keep them behind locked doors and gates, and on leashes.

We can hold two thoughts in our head at the same time.

In the days since the killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, the overwhelming response on the left has been shock and horror. No one of prominence has justified the killing; hundreds, from Democratic Party leadership on down, have condemned political violence.

But below the unanimity is a subtler debate: not about how to respond to Kirk's death, but how to think about his life.

On the one hand are sober commemorations of Kirk's approach to democratic politics. Kirk, these authors say, had an admirable commitment to free discourse — going on tours where he would debate all sorts of people on often-hostile college campuses. He was killed while doing exactly this, answering a question about mass shootings.

I recently watched a video, posted on his own channel, of him debating a student about eating animals. The student easily beat Kirk, who wasn't prepared for the arguments of a pro-life vegan weightlifter. Yet Kirk didn't shirk from the challenge, taking the young man seriously and trying to rebut as best he could. There's something admirably democratic about that.

He wasn't just a guy who went around debating, but a plugged-in political operative close to the Trump White House who actively promoted extremism.

The other side argues that this portrayal leaves out crucial context. Kirk's political activities, they argue, were often destructive of the democratic process he's been suggested to embody. He wasn't just a guy who went around debating, but a plugged-in political operative close to the Trump White House who actively promoted extremism. Mourning him uncritically whitewashes his role in the degradation of our politics.

Kirk vehemently defended Trump's “big lie” about the 2020 election and sent seven buses of activists to the January 6 rally that culminated in the storming of the Capitol. His organization, Turning Point USA, maintained a “professor watch list” designed to chill left-wing speech on campus and lionized vigilante killer Kyle Rittenhouse. He endorsed authoritarian policies, demonized his political opponents, and said a tremendous amount of objectively bigoted stuff — warning of “prowling Blacks [who] go around for fun to go target white people” or that “Islam is the sword the left is using to slit the throat of America.”

So how should we remember Charlie Kirk — as someone who engaged in the process of democratic deliberation, or someone who degraded or coarsened it?

Both. Or, maybe, neither.

Kirk didn't die of old age or even natural causes. Our posthumous conversation about his life is, at least for the moment, inextricably bound up with the manner of his death: He was assassinated in the midst of a public political debate.

Whenever a prominent political figure is killed, it invariably creates mistrust between political factions — something the extreme right is counting on in their post-Kirk killing push for a violent crackdown on the left. It is incumbent on every citizen in a democracy to think about how the way we talk about the killing plays into this dynamic: whether it intensifies partisan hatred or signals a renewed commitment to peaceful civil discourse.

I take that to be the intent of the people praising Kirk's willingness to engage in the democratic process. But I think it's possible to do so without sanitizing the ways in which his persona and political approach degraded that very same process — and how such whitewashing can provide cover for the further degradation of our politics in the weeks and months to come.

Threading this very fine needle, however, requires thinking carefully not just about what we say, but the way we say it.

I want you to think about two sentences.

The first: “Charlie Kirk had terrible politics, but no one should be killed for their beliefs.” The second: “No one should be killed for their beliefs, but Charlie Kirk had truly terrible politics.”

Semantically, the two sentences are the same. Yet the shift in syntax subtly, but fundamentally, changes the message being communicated.

The first sentence puts its emphasis on the killing: The concluding thought, the dominant consideration, is that political killing is wrong. When the speaker cops to their dislike of Kirk, they are doing so to emphasize that Kirk's killing was an awful thing, even though I detested Kirk and what he stood for.

The second sentence, by contrast, uses an observation about Kirk's badness to attenuate the condemnation of his killing. The speaker is signaling that the emphasis shouldn't be on Kirk's killing, but on his low moral character and malign political influence. At worst, such a formulation can seem like a coward's justification: an attempt to insinuate that Kirk deserved to die without risking the social opprobrium that comes with outright saying it.

There is a certain strain of the Kirk conversation on the left that comes across as a lengthier version of that sentence. When the bulk of an article or video is about attacking Kirk, perfunctory condemnations of his killing do not change the impression that what you really want to say is that he kinda had it coming.

Which, to be clear, is an evil sentiment that must be rejected.

The killing of Charlie Kirk is, first and foremost, a tragedy for his family. This was a human being, no more or less human than the rest of us. He was the father of two young children; they and their mother now have to face life without him.

It's also a nightmare for the country. Democracies shouldn't have political killings, or even killings that seem political. They endanger the foundation of the system, the mutual trust between citizens that allows them to place their faith in elections to resolve their disputes.

Standing for democracy means standing on that principle — with no qualifications or cowardly clauses.

At the same time, I also think that there is some reason to prefer the first formulation — “Charlie Kirk had terrible politics, but no one should be killed for their beliefs” — over the shorter, simpler, “no one should be killed for their beliefs.”

Why? Because CBS just hosted Jack Posobiec to eulogize Kirk.

Posobiec is a serially dishonest political extremist who represents everything wrong with our politics. He became famous in 2016 for spreading the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, which led to a man opening fire in a Washington, DC, restaurant under the delusion that he was rescuing trafficked children hidden in its basement. Posobiec spent years associating professionally with white nationalists, including personally targeting Jewish journalists for harassment.

Yet in 2021, Kirk hired him at Turning Point USA and brought him into his confidence. As a TPUSA contributor, his behavior has remained extreme.

In 2024, Posobiec gave an allegedly ironic speech at a conservative conference where he called for “the end of democracy,” holding up a cross and saying, “We will replace it with this, right here.” I say allegedly because his 2024 book, titled Unhumans, explicitly states that “democracy has never worked to protect innocents from the unhumans.” These “unhumans?” Pretty much the entire political left.

The point is not that Charlie Kirk's life can be reduced to his elevation of Jack Posobiec. Rather, it's that Posobiec is an illustration of the kind of politics that Kirk helped drag into the Republican mainstream. When CBS chose to bring him on, on Thursday, to give a fawning interview about Kirk's virtues, they were allowing Kirk's posthumous glow to shine onto a living man who is currently working to set our politics aflame.

In fact, in that very interview, Posobiec implicitly calls for violent retribution. Inexplicably asked by host Major Garrett whether Kirk would prefer an “Old Testament” or “New Testament” response to his killing, Posobiec leaves little room for doubt.

“Charlie was a big fan of the Old Testament,” Posobiec says. “Justice needs to be done here.”

We cannot, as a polity, allow our horror at Kirk's killing to rob us of our moral and political senses. We must not let people like Posobiec, who literally declares his political enemies “subhuman,” be given a perch to call down Biblical vengeance on the left merely because he had some proximity to Kirk, who knowingly embraced radicalism while alive. Just in the past few weeks, Kirk called for arresting anti-Trump mayors and accused Rep. Jasmine Crockett (who is Black) of being part of an “attempt to eliminate the white population in this country.” The method of his politics may have been democratic, but its substantive ends were bent towards repression and exclusion.

We can — and we must — full-throatedly condemn Charlie Kirk's killing, without any cowardly “buts.” Yet we must also not allow the further degradation of our politics by Kirk's living allies, who would turn him into a martyr to the cause of assailing democratic freedoms.

There are lines in both directions. And neither can be crossed.

There's one big guardrail left on Trump's ambitions. Democrats are gearing up for a showdown that could destroy it.

His story about the left and the right doesn't hold up to the facts.

The late Talking Points USA leader built a movement that will outlive him.

They're calling him a martyr for free speech as they demand a violent crackdown on progressive dissent.

Our unmoderated online reality bares its teeth.

Whether this week's drone incursion into Poland was an accident or a provocation, the risks are still growing.

The durability of the iPhone Air — Apple's thinnest phone yet— is being tested. So far, it's passing.

Apple execs Greg Joswiak and John Ternus appeared so confident in the strength of the Air that Joswiak challenged interviewers to try to bend the device during a video published Thursday by Tom's Guide.

""Try to bend it,"" Joswiak, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said in the video.

Tom's Guide's Mark Spoonauer and TechRadar's Lance Ulanoff obliged by taking turns attempting to bend the iPhone Air with their hands. The phone looked like it held up to their tests.

""It bows, but it comes right back into shape,"" Spoonauer said as he bent the phone both ways.

Ternus, Apple's senior vice president of hardware engineering, said the titanium band around the side of the iPhone Air is ""key"" to its durability.

""It is more durable than any previous iPhone,"" Ternus said. ""It exceeds our internal metrics for bend strength, which are really high.""

Joswiak compared the iPhone Air to a ""seismic building"" that has some give but comes back into place. That allows the phone to have a thin and light form factor, which is a big selling point, he said.

Apple debuted the Air on Tuesday at its ""awe-dropping"" fall iPhone event, where it showed off how it fits Pro-level performance into a 5.6-millimeter frame. The Air is available for preorder starting at $999 in select countries beginning Friday, and is set to be released on September 19.

""It does seem like it's going to fly away when you're holding it,"" CEO Tim Cook told The Wall Street Journal, after unveiling the phone.

In the Tom's Guide clip, the iPhone Air appeared to do just that as Joswiak tossed it to Ulanoff for the bend test. It bounced out of Ulanoff's hand and onto the table.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

Shares of Gemini Space Station soared as much as 40% on Friday after the exchange operator raised $425 million in an initial public offering.

The stock opened at $37.01 on the Nasdaq after its IPO priced at $28. At one point, shares traded as high as $45.89. The stock was trading up about 21% at 2:50 p.m. ET. 

The New York-based company priced its IPO late Thursday above this week's expected range of $24 to $26, and an initial range of between $17 and $19. That valued the company at some $3.3 billion before trading began.

Gemini, which primarily operates as a cryptocurrency exchange, was founded by the Winklevoss brothers in 2014 and held more than $21 billion of assets on its platform as of the end of July. Per its registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gemini posted a net loss of $159 million in 2024, and in the first half of this year, it lost $283 million.

The company also offers a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, credit cards with a crypto-back rewards program and a custody service for institutions.

The Winklevoss brothers were among the earliest bitcoin investors and first bitcoin billionaires. They have long held that bitcoin is a superior store of value than gold. On Friday morning, they told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" they see its price reaching $1 million a decade from now.

In 2013, they were the first to apply to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded fund, more than 10 years before the first bitcoin ETFs would eventually be approved. The Securities and Exchange Commission's rejection of the application, which cited risk of fraud and market manipulation, set the stage for the bitcoin ETF debate in the years to come.

Even in the early days, when bitcoin was notorious for its extreme volatility and anti-establishment roots and shunned by Wall Street, the Winklevoss brothers were outspoken about the need for smart regulation that would establish rules for the crypto-led financial revolution.

This may not be an era in which Americans are awash in physical currency fattening their wallets, but we are awash in cash parked inside accounts that have been generating attractive yields thanks to Federal Reserve interest rate hikes to combat inflation. There is a record amount of cash in money market funds, roughly $7.6 trillion, according to Crane Data.

But as the Federal Reserve prepares to cut rates for the first time in a year, maybe by as much as 50 basis points — a policy shift that will, over time, reduce the yields on risk-free cash-equivalent investments — market attention has shifted to whether that cash will be on the move. At the most extreme, Wall Street's so-called ""wall of cash"" theory — which claims that all that cash on the move can create its own stock market rally — has been debunked about as many times as it has been offered.

At the very least, it is a significant moment of change in Federal Reserve rate policy. The latest jobs market data confirmed mounting fears of a labor market heading in the wrong direction and the need for the central bank to move sooner rather than later before unemployment spikes. Meanwhile, the latest inflation data, while far from an all-clear on pricing pressures throughout the economy, did not suggest the Fed will hold off on at least a 25 basis point rate cut next week.

The payrolls data ""cinches the case for a rate cut,"" said Investment Company Institute Chief Economist and lead ETF researcher Shelly Antoniewicz earlier this week on CNBC's ""ETF Edge.""

In line with most market experts and economists, she said the pace of those cuts will remain data-dependent as the Fed watches both the labor market and inflation, and manages its dual mandate of full employment and price stability. But she added on the podcast portion of ETF Edge that as the Fed starts to lower rates, the roughly $7 trillion ""sitting in money market funds"" will gradually flow into more risk-on assets, including stocks and bonds, as savings rates become less attractive.

To be sure, more mutual fund companies are going to be chasing those assets on the precipice of a huge decision from the Securities and Exchange Commission which could allow every asset management company to offer an ETF share class of their funds. Antoniewicz noted that there are 70 applications in with the SEC for exemptive relief and the ICI, the main mutual fund industry trade group, is working with hundreds of fund sponsors to be prepared to add an ETF share class if the SEC says ""go.""

While all that may be true, Peter Crane, president and publisher of money fund research firm Crane Data, has heard it all before, at least when it comes to the Fed and money market funds, and he has a simple response: money fund assets just keep growing, and the only times in recent history when they've gone down as opposed to up is when rates are literally at zero during periods of economic calamity.

""The rates matter but much less than most people believe,"" Crane said.

In fact, in the 52-year history of money market funds, assets have only gone down after the dotcom bust and financial crisis, periods where intense economic stress led to rock-bottom rates, a ""bottom of the rate cycle nailed to zero,"" he said.

If things get bad enough in the economy that the Fed has to cut more aggressively sooner rather than later, that's not exactly a sign of a market where investors are likely to be overly aggressive with their own risk profile, either.

""Dream on Wall Street,"" Crane said. ""It makes for a good talking point, but the $7 trillion is not going anywhere but up.""  

There has also been a shift over time in the usage of money market funds, with what was once mostly a retail investor phenomenon now majority institutional and corporate cash — roughly 60% of the market, according to Crane's data. ""They are not moving, no matter what,"" he said. ""They are not going into the stock market.""

It's not that money fund researchers like Crane deny that lower rates matter, or that some of the money fund assets may indeed move to higher-risk, higher return areas of the market — he thinks that is maybe 10% of the $7 trillion-plus, though he adds there is no precise data to rely on for such an estimate.

But when you consider the roughly $20 trillion that Americans leave in bank deposits, basically giving their money to Wall Street to go off and make more money on while earning no money themselves, a 25 basis point cut in the current interest rate environment does not exactly make money funds a dead option.

""It's more about how big is the rate differentially,"" he said. ""A quarter-point to cash investors, looking several years back to when rates were zero and they were used to getting nothing?"" he asked. 

While investors may get ""re-sensitized"" to yield, at what level will that occur? Currently, money fund investors are earning on average 4.3% annually.

Crane says even if rates move down to 3%, by no means assured since 100 basis points of Fed rate cuts is seen by many as aggressive barring a major downturn in the economy, much of the money will stay put, especially when you consider what banks are paying to hold cash, maybe at best 0.5%. ""Bank deposits wildly underpay,"" he said.

That's why Crane believes it will take a repeat of Fed history for a significant amount of that cash to move. ""Likely, if you go to zero there will be erosion in the base,"" he said. The Fed did cut rates a year ago, before it paused due to fears about inflation, and money funds assets have only gone higher since. ""If we go to 3.80%, 3.85%, is anyone going to care?"" Crane said. 

Additionally, even though the overall balance in the money fund market is huge, individual balances tend to be relatively small. If an investor has $5,000 in a money market fund and it is earning 1% or 2% more or less, Crane says there are better things to think about as far as making money. ""You just spent more money thinking about the problem then you are earning. Nothing is worth doing for less than 1% or one hundred bucks,"" he added.

And, at a time when the bond market has been volatile, there is more danger in fixed-income and in the treasuries market than investors had come to expect, making duration a more dicey proposition for investors.

One thing is certain: the money fund market won't move next week in the immediate aftermath of a Fed decision to cut rates. Unlike treasury bills, money funds have a weighted maturity of 30 days, therefore assuming the Fed cuts next Wednesday at its FOMC meeting, treasuries start to go lower but money funds take a month to move fully lower because they are still owners of higher-yielding. older securities. And at least in the short-term, if the Fed unveils a jumbo cut, Crane would expect money market assets to go up for the same comparative reason.

""But over the long term, it is a negative,"" he said. ""Eventually, less interest is being generated compared to other investments.""

But the fact that the market keeps hitting record highs and money fund assets are also hitting record highs doesn't suggest the game is one where whatever benefits stocks hurts money markets.

If you are among the investor set that has built up a more sizable balance than you necessarily need in cash-equivalent accounts, there are options, according to Todd Sohn, a technical strategist and ETF strategist for Strategas Asset Management. But he stressed that it all depends on risk tolerance, as well as tax factors.

""Once money market fund rates start flirting with the lower 3% area, your after-tax yield isn't great,"" Sohn said. But while that may not be ideal for the returns that can be generated, ""perhaps you are risk averse and just want to keep it there,"" he added.

For investors that do determine that a move out of money funds is warranted, the first step to consider is moving out on the treasury curve, for example, a treasury ETF with a duration of two to five years. Sohn concedes that at a time of greater fixed-income market volatility, it means investors are taking on more duration risk and more volatility, but no credit risk. ""At least you'll gain yield plus price appreciation,"" he said. 

To manage any surprises in the fixed-income market, investors can use what is called a ""bond ladder"" ETF.

""There's a handful of ETFs out there that will ladder treasuries so you have exposure across the curve,"" he said. ""The balance of a ladder can keep volatility lower as opposed to adding too much duration,"" he added, a factor that burned many investors in recent years. 

Amid recent bond market volatility, many investors within the ETF market gravitated towards the shortest-term treasuries of all.

Investors could also consider adding to stock holdings, but Sohn warned that any investor who already has a diversified portfolio is unlikely to need more exposure to large-cap growth or tech, with the record market being propelled by those stocks, and the eight biggest tech stocks now representing close to 40% of the U.S. stock market.

""But perhaps you see holes in your equity sleeve,"" Sohn said. ""Assess your portfolio to see if you need small-, mid-cap or international exposures. There are a ton of low cost options for this,"" he added.

In this article

The Federal Aviation Administration said Friday it is launching a pilot program to speed up the rollout of air taxis.

Archer Aviation and Joby Aviation, major players in the electric vertical takeoff and landing, or eVTOL, space, said they are participating in the program. Shares of each were higher on Friday.

The program will establish at least five projects through public-private partnerships with state and local governments to promote safe usage of eVTOL aircraft.

""The next great technological revolution in aviation is here,"" said U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in a release. ""The United States will lead the way, and doing so will cement America's status as a global leader in transportation innovation.""

Archer said supervised trials could begin in the U.S. as soon as next year, ahead of FAA certification. Joby is set to begin FAA flight testing early next year.

The announcement follows President Donald Trump's executive order in June that included the creation of an eVTOL pilot program to foster safe development and deployment in the U.S.

Proponents of eVTOL have touted the technology as a method to slash emissions and ease traffic. Archer, Joby and their competitors have been steadily working toward FAA approval.

Joby called the program a ""critical step"" in the path toward widespread air taxi service in the U.S. Archer CEO Adam Goldstein dubbed the announcement a ""landmark moment"" that allows the company to work with partners such as United Airlines to trial aircraft.

""These early flights will help cement American leadership in advanced aviation and set the stage for scaled commercial operations in the U.S. and beyond,"" he wrote.

Both companies have made strides testing their products through partnerships in the Middle East.

Late designer Giorgio Armani has instructed heirs to gradually sell the fashion brand he created 50 years ago or seek a stock market listing, his will said, marking a surprising turn for a company highly protective of its independence and Italian roots.

The will, reviewed by Reuters, states heirs should sell an initial 15% stake in the Italian fashion house within 18 months and later transfer an additional 30% to 54.9% stake to the same buyer between three and five years after Armani's death. The designer, known in the industry as ""King Giorgio,"" died on Sept. 4 at 91 and with no children.

The will also says that priority should be given to luxury giant LVMH, beauty heavyweight L'Oreal, eyewear leader EssilorLuxottica or another group of ""equal standing"" identified by a foundation the designer set up to preserve his legacy with the agreement of Armani's business and life partner, Pantaleo Dell'Orco.

Alternatively, an initial public offering should be pursued, in Italy or in a market of equal standing, it said.

The explicit mention of stake sales and of France-listed players as potential buyers is in stark contrast with Giorgio Armani's persistent refusal to dilute his control or list his fashion group on the stock market.

Over the years, the maker of popular unstructured suits that gained him international fame received several approaches, including one in 2021 from John Elkann, scion of Italy's Agnelli family, and another from luxury brand Gucci, when Maurizio Gucci was still at the helm.

Armani was the sole major shareholder of the company he set up with his late partner Sergio Galeotti in the 1970s and over which he maintained a tight rein — both creative and managerial — until the very end.

He has left behind no children to inherit the business, which generated relatively stable revenue — 2.3 billion euros ($2.7 billion) in 2024 — but whose profits have shrunk amid a broad luxury industry recession.

The will gives the Fondazione Giorgio Armani and life partner and right-hand man Pantaleo Dell'Orco 70% of voting rights in the Armani group combined. 

The foundation will retain a 30.1% stake in the event of a listing, according to the will.

Heirs should consider other fashion and luxury companies with which Armani's company has commercial ties for a future sale, the will also said.

For decades, shows like ""Star Trek"" and novels like ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" have showcased fictional universal translators, capable of seamlessly converting any language into English and vice versa.

Now, those gadgets once limited to works of science fiction are inching close to reality.

During its iPhone unveiling event on Tuesday, Apple included a video of many travelers' dream scenario. It showed an English-speaking tourist buying flowers in an unnamed Spanish-speaking country. The florist addressed the tourist in Spanish, but what the tourist heard was in clear, coherent English.

""Today all the red carnations are 50% off,"" the tourist heard in English in her headphones, at essentially the same time that the clerk was speaking.

The video was marketing material for Apple's latest AirPods Pro 3, but the feature is one of many of its kind coming from tech companies that also include Google parent Alphabet and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.

Technological advancements spurred by the arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022 have ushered in an era of generative artificial intelligence. Almost three years later, those advancements are resulting in real-time language translators.

For Apple, Live Translation is a key selling point for the AirPods Pro 3, which the company unveiled on Tuesday. The new $250 earbuds go on sale next week, and with Live Translation, users will be able to immediately hear French, German, Portuguese and Spanish translated to English. Live Translation will also arrive as an update to AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2 on Monday.

And when two people are speaking to each other wearing AirPods, the conversation can be translated both ways simultaneously inside each user's headphones. In Apple's video demo, it looked like two people talking to each other in different languages.

Analysts are excited that the feature could mark a step forward for Apple's AI strategy. The translation feature needs to be paired with a new-enough iPhone to run Apple Intelligence, Apple's AI software suite.

""If we can actually use the AirPods for live translations, that's a feature that would actually get people to upgrade,"" DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told CNBC on Wednesday.

Translation is emerging as a key battleground in the technology industry as AI gets good enough to translate languages as quickly as people speak.

But Apple is not alone.

In the past year, Google and Meta have also released hardware products featuring real-time translation capabilities.

Google's Pixel 10 phone has a capability that can translate what a speaker is saying to the listener's language during phone calls. That feature, called Voice Translate is designed to also preserve the speaker's voice inflections. Voice Translate will start showing up on people's phones through a software update on Monday.

In Google's live demo in August, Voice Translate was able to translate a sentence from entertainer Jimmy Fallon into Spanish, and it actually sounded like the comedian. Apple's feature does not try to imitate the user's voice.

Meanwhile, Meta in May announced that its Ray-Ban Meta glasses would be able to translate what a person is saying in another language using the device's speakers, and the other party in the conversations would be able to see translated responses transcribed on the user's phone.

Meta will hold its own product keynote on Wednesday, where the company is expected to announce the next generation of its smart glasses, which will feature a small display in one of the lenses, CNBC reported in August. It's unclear if Meta will announce more translation features.

And OpenAI in June showcased an intelligent voice assistant mode for ChatGPT that has fluid translation built in as one of many features. ChatGPT is integrated with Apple's Siri, but not in voice mode. OpenAI is planning to release new hardware products with Apple's former design guru Jony Ive in the coming years.

The rise of live translation could also reshape entire industries. Translators and interpreters are the No. 1 type of job threatened by AI, and 98% of translators' work activities overlap with what AI can do, a Microsoft Research study published in August found.

In the past several years, a number of purpose-built translation gadgets have entered the market, taking advantage of global high-speed cellular service and improving online translation services to produce puck-like devices or headphones with translation built-in for a couple hundred dollars.

""What I love about what Apple is doing is it really just illuminates the fact that how pressing of an issue this is,"" said Joe Miller, U.S. general manager of Japan-based Pocketalk, which makes a $299 translation device that goes between two people conversing in different languages and translates their conversation in audio and text.

Given that Apple shipped about 18 million sets of wireless headphones in the first quarter alone, according to Canalys, the company's entry into the market will expose a wider subset of customers to improvements translation tech has made in recent years.

Despite Apple's entry into the market, makers of purpose-built devices say their focus on accuracy and knowledge of linguistics will provide better translations than what's available for free with a new phone.

""We actually hired linguists,"" said Aleksander Alski, head of U.S. and Canada for Poland-based Vasco Electronics, which is releasing translation headphones that can imitate the user's voice, like Google's feature. ""We combined the AI with with human input, and thanks to that, we were able to secure much higher accuracy throughout all the languages we offer.""

There's also home-field advantage. Vasco Electronics' largest market is Europe, and Apple's Live Translation isn't available for EU users, Apple said on its website.

Some of the products being introduced by tech companies are less than universal, and are limited to a small number of languages for now. Apple's feature is only available in five languages, versus Pocketalk's 95.

Pocketalk's Miller believes that the potential of the technology goes far beyond a tourist ordering a glass of wine in France. He says that it's most powerful when its used in workplaces like schools and hospitals, which require privacy and security features that go beyond what Apple and Google provide.

""This isn't about luxury tourism and travel,"" Miller said. ""This is about the intersection of language and friction, when a discussion needs to be had.""

Apple didn't respond to a request for comment.

WATCH: If the AirPods live translation features work, it's a breakthrough in AI, says DA Davidson's Luria

 Bitcoin price sees a modest recovery driven by derivatives, with big overhead resistance above $116,000 in place and several key support levels below. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin price rose 1.5% to over $115,000, with onchain indicators suggesting market momentum is picking up. 

BTC must hold above $115,000 to secure the recovery, with resistance at $116,000-$121,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) price was up on Friday, rising 1.5% over the past 24 hours to trade above $115,000. Several technical and onchain indicators suggest the BTC market is “advancing on firmer footing” to higher levels, according to Glassnode.

Bitcoin's ability to stage a sustained recovery has been curtailed by weak spot demand and softening ETF inflows. 

“Attention now shifts to derivatives markets, which often set the tone when spot flows weaken,” Glassnode wrote in its latest Week Onchain report. 

The chart below shows that Bitcoin's volume delta bias, measuring the imbalance between buying and selling pressure, recovered during the rebound from $108,000, signaling seller exhaustion across exchanges like Binance and Bybit.

This suggests that futures traders “helped absorb recent sell pressure,” said the market intelligence firm, adding:

Meanwhile, options open interest (OI) reached $54.6 billion, an all-time high, up 26% from $43 billion on Sept. 1. This reflects growing investor interest in the derivatives market, which can positively affect BTC price.

Note that when options OI reached its previous record high in mid-August, it was accompanied by Bitcoin's rise to new all-time highs above $124,500.

Additional options OI data shows a clear bias toward calls over puts, “highlighting a market that leans bullish while still managing downside risk,” Glassnode said, adding:

As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin's $4.3 billion options expiry on Friday favors bullish bets, and could open the door for BTC rally to $120,000 as long as the price stays above $113,000.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows Bitcoin price trading at $115,400 after running into resistance around $116,000. The BTC/USD pair must hold above $115,000 for a sustained recovery. 

There is a major supply zone stretching from $116,000 to $121,000, which Bitcoin will have to overcome to continue its uptrend toward all-time highs.

Conversely, the bears will attempt to defend the $116,000 level and push the price back down. A key area of interest lies between $114,500, where the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) currently sits, and $112,200, embraced by the 100-day SMA.

Another area of importance stretches from the local low at $107,200 (reached on Sept. 1) to the  $110,000 psychological level.

Bitcoin is “now pushing to the previous monthly open,” said pseudonymous trader KillaXBT in an analysis on X, referring to the August open around $115,700.

The BTC/USDT liquidation heatmap shows the liquidity clusters between $116,400 and $117,000, per data from CoinGlass.

If broken, this level could spark a liquidation squeeze, forcing short sellers to close positions and driving prices toward $120,000.

On the downside, heavy bid orders are sitting around $114,700, with the next major cluster sitting between $113,500 down to $112,000.

Allied Gaming & Entertainment, a Nasdaq-listed esports and gaming company, announced that it has invested in Bitcoin and Ethereum as part of a new “corporate treasury management strategy.”

In response, its stock, traded under the ticker AGAE, soared 105% to $1.87 earlier Friday and has since dipped to $1.65, according to TradingView—still up 71% on the day.

The company explained that this was just the “first step” to incorporating crypto into its balance sheet, as it plans for a broader embrace of the blockchain and teased real-world asset initiatives.

The exact figure of its Bitcoin and Ethereum investment was not stated in the release. Decrypt reached out to confirm the details, but did not immediately receive a response.

“We see cryptocurrency not only as a store of value, but also as a strategic building block for the future of our business,” Yangyang James Li, CEO of AGAE, said in a statement. “Integrating blockchain and digital assets into our ecosystem is a natural progression of our vision to connect people through gaming, entertainment, and innovative financial technologies.”

Allied Gaming & Entertainment is a company focused primarily on entertainment in the esports gaming scene. It owns and operates the HyperX Esports Arena, a 650-person capacity venue in Las Vegas that has hosted events like the 2019 League of Legends All-Stars match, as well as an event for Ethereum-based card battler Parallel just last year.

It went public in 2017, debuting at $9.54 and hitting an all-time high of $12.11 in October 2018, according to TradingView. Since then, the stock has been on a gradual downward grind. However, its latest crypto announcement has given it a much-needed boost, momentarily doubling its value.

Future initiatives for the esports company will include allowing for crypto payments, creating tokenization models for IP monetization, as well as integrating stablecoins and utility tokens within the “company's digital ecosystem,” the release said.

The announcement is just the latest addition to the flood of publicly traded crypto treasury companies emerging in the U.S.

It first started with Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy, now just Strategy, which pivoted from being a business intelligence software company to focus on acquiring Bitcoin. It now holds 638,460 BTC, or $73.6 billion worth of Bitcoin, and Saylor says it could acquire as much as 7% of the total supply.

Strategy's raging success in the markets since its crypto pivot has led many others to follow suit.

Notably, SharpLink Gaming and BitMine Immersion Technologies have emerged as the leading Ethereum treasury companies, with BMNR holding $9.4 billion worth of ETH and SBET amassing $3.8 billion of ETH, per data from Strategic ETH Reserve—totalling 2.4% of the Ethereum supply between them.

It's not just the big hitters, though. Crypto treasury companies also exist for Elon Musk's favorite meme coin Dogecoin, Solana meme coin BONK, and altcoins Solana, XRP, and Sui.

The trend has led some industry observers to grow concerned that it could be the black swan event that drags crypto down this cycle, akin to the FTX collapse of the past. 

However, SharpLink Gaming's co-CEO, Joseph Chalom, told Decrypt last week “absolutely not.” Rather, he said, the Ethereum treasury push will be a positive “white swan” event by educating institutional investors about the cryptocurrency.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Best Altcoins to Buy as Ethereum Breaks $4.5K, Signals Potential Alt Season","https://bitcoinist.com/is-altcoin-season-heating-up-ethereum-break-4-5k/","Fri, 12 Sep 2025 15:28:16 GMT","

For years, crypto traders have waited for the elusive altcoin season – a period when coins other than Bitcoin deliver the market's strongest returns.

Recent data suggest the next cycle may already be underway; but with shifting market structures, regulatory uncertainty, and volatile liquidity dynamics, traders will need to tread carefully.



According to CoinMarketCap's Altcoin Season Index, the threshold is simple: if 75% of the top 100 non-stablecoin tokens outperform Bitcoin over the past 90 days, it's officially altcoin season. If fewer than 25% outperform, the market is in Bitcoin season.

The Altcoin Season Index offers a quantitative way to cut through hype. It smooths returns across a rolling 90-day window, avoiding the noise of day-to-day volatility. In practice, though, it tends to lag behind sentiment shifts; altcoin rallies often begin before the index confirms them.

The past two months have seen notable movement. In August, the Altcoin Season Index jumped from 39 to 58. Bitcoin dominance began to ease from its summer highs, historically a precursor to altcoin outperformance.

Large-cap altcoins led the charge. Ethereum ($ETH) has closed the gap with Bitcoin, holding strong above $4K; it currently trades at $4.5K with a $500B market cap. while tokens like Chainlink ($LINK), Uniswap ($UNI), and several exchange tokens ($OKB, $CRO) have also gained ground.

Meme coins also haven't been left behind; the total meme coin market cap is up 8% over the month.



Altcoin seasons rarely happen in isolation. Institutional flows, political shifts, and macroeconomic conditions all play a role. But, as always with crypto, sentiment plays a huge role.

It's a strangely uncertain-but-confident market, worried about inflation and macroeconomic pressures but still eagerly looking for the next big thing.

That's where these three projects come in. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), Solana ($SOL), and the Snorter Token ($SNORT).

Take Bitcoin's strength and stability and add in a dash of Solana's programmability and speed.

The result is Bitcoin Hyper, a Layer 2 solution that uses a Bitcoin Canonical Bridge to move Bitcoin to the new Layer 2, creating wrapped Bitcoin that can be used for DeFi, staking, and more.



The presale flew past $15M earlier in the week as investors realized just how much potential $HYPER has. Check out our price prediction, which shows that the token could go from its current $0.012905 to $0.32, a 2000%+ increase.

Visit the Bitcoin Hyper presale page to learn more.

Solana continues to outperform in 2025, fueled by the growing Solana treasury movement. The latest boost came from Forward Industries' massive $1.65B private placement to further its $SOL acquisitions.

$SOL is up over 20% in the past month and currently trades over $240.



Solana treasuries have a key advantage over their Bitcoin counterparts: yield generation. Solana's programmability and DeFi integration mean Solana treasuries can provide long-term yield for investors.

The Snorter Bot gives traders a critical advantage when it comes to the wild-and-woolly world of Solana meme coins. No more guessing at which tokens could make big moves – and no more wondering how to find the next big thing.

Snorter Bot gives traders automated sniping tools, protection from rug pulls and honeypots, and even limit orders and copy trading. Deploy Snorter to sniff out the low-cap meme coin gems before they make it to major exchanges.



With the $SNORT token, traders get even lower rates on Snorter Bot trades and cheaper swaps. The $SNORT token is currently in presale at $0.1041, but our price prediction shows the potential for that to increase to $1.92 by the end of next year.

What is Snorter Bot? It's a meme coin trader's best friend.

Check out the presale page for the latest.

The index suggests that the market is somewhere in the middle of the Bitcoin-altcoin cycle. Will it evolve into a full-blown altcoin season – and how high will $HYPER, $SOL, and $SNORT go if it does?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Best Altcoins to Buy as Solana and Dogecoin Rally Amid Growing ETF Momentum","https://coincentral.com/best-altcoins-to-buy-as-solana-and-dogecoin-rally-amid-growing-etf-momentum/","Fri, 12 Sep 2025 18:00:24 GMT","

Crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have become the “fuel” driving the market these days. Think of them as a bridge – they let traditional investors dip their toes into crypto through regular brokerage accounts, with no wallet required.

We've already seen what these funds can do. Spot BTC ETFs launched early in 2024 and crushed it, pulling in billions of dollars within weeks. That helped push BTC from around $40,000 all the way past $70,000 by March. Spot ETH ETFs came next, and they're still seeing capital flowing in.

Now everyone's trying to figure out which cryptos will be next. Traders are betting big on Solana and Dogecoin, pushing both tokens higher as ETF rumors heat up. We've seen double-digit gains in just the past week for both coins.

But newer projects are getting attention too. Bitcoin Hyper has become the talk of crypto Twitter lately, with investors calling it a potential Layer-2 breakthrough that could outrun both SOL and DOGE. Is this the best altcoin to buy in September?

Solana has been on an incredible run lately, hitting $237 as of today – the highest it's been since January 31. SOL is up 6% in the past 24 hours and 15% this week, pushing its market cap over $128 billion.

The token's rally makes sense when you look at what's happening with ETF approvals. Major players like VanEck, Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, and Grayscale have recently updated their S-1 filings. And Polymarket is assigning a 99% chance to an ETF approval before the end of the year.



Analysts think an approval could unlock anywhere from $3.8 billion to $7.2 billion in institutional money. If that happens, Solana could be staring down its biggest wave of capital inflows to date.

Regulatory conditions are looking favorable, too. The SEC extended Franklin Templeton's filing to November 14 – that's the maximum delay they're allowed, which suggests we're getting close to final decisions. All of these factors make the odds of another SOL bull run feel stronger than ever.

Dogecoin finally broke through the stubborn $0.25 resistance level, and it's now trading around $0.259. The coin's up 4% in 24 hours and nearly 19% this week, with over $4 billion worth of DOGE changing hands in the past day alone.

Optimism around the REX-Osprey DOGE ETF is what's driving this rally. Smart money has been positioning for this ETF to go live – whale wallets have expanded by 22%, with 2 billion DOGE added in August alone.



Binance now holds more than 820 million DOGE, giving the ETF all the liquidity it needs for large trades. With infrastructure like this in place, Dogecoin looks ready to attract serious institutional flows for the first time.

Some traders believe we could see DOGE's price react like BTC and ETH's did when their ETFs went live. That suggests Dogecoin may be on the verge of another breakout.

While Solana and Dogecoin are getting all the headlines, Bitcoin Hyper is quietly becoming the project that has everyone talking. Its presale is adding around $150,000 every day, with total funding standing at $15.2 million. That kind of momentum tells you how excited investors are.

Their excitement stems from how Bitcoin Hyper is aiming to solve Bitcoin's speed problem. Its Layer-2 network is anchored to Bitcoin for security and final settlement, but runs applications at Solana-like speeds using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM).

Developers can basically copy-and-paste their Solana-based apps with minimal tweaks while tapping into Bitcoin's huge liquidity pool. The result is you get a chain that's faster than Ethereum's dApp environment but much more programmable than Bitcoin.

Investors are excited about the potential of this new Layer-2. And several top analysts are as well. Alessandro De Crypto, for example, said “don't miss out” on the Bitcoin Hyper presale – speculating HYPER could “pump” after listing.

Right now, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012895 in presale. Early buyers can secure exposure using crypto (such as ETH or USDT) or a credit/debit card. All that's required is a compatible crypto wallet.

With millions raised, institutional-style interest building, and a design that could completely change how people use Bitcoin, Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself as potentially the next altcoin to explode this year.

Oops, something went wrong

This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

On Thursday, Figure Technology (FIGR, Financials) rose 44% in its first day on Nasdaq, giving the blockchain lender a market value of $7.62 billion. Figure and its backers made $787.5 million by selling 31.5 million shares, which opened at $44, far higher than the IPO price of $25. The offering price was higher than the company's new range of $20 to $22, showing that investors were interested during what has become the biggest week for U.S. IPOs since 2021. Mike Cagney, who co-founded SoFi Technologies before starting Figure in 2018, has put the company at the crossroads of housing finance and blockchain. The company made $6 billion in home equity loans in the year ending June 30, 29% more than the year before. Cagney says that 10 of the top 20 U.S. mortgage companies now use its Provenance blockchain to process and verify loans. David Chao, an early investor in DCM Ventures, noted that more than 20 big banks are already using Provenance. This shows that the technology is becoming increasingly popular in the financial services industry. The strong start comes after a number of successful IPOs from companies tied to cryptocurrencies, even as corporations that own a lot of digital assets have had their stock prices drop sharply. Cagney claimed that Figure's business model is based on lending and infrastructure, not treasury speculation. He also said that the long-term potential for blockchain lies in financial applications. As the IPO market opens up again, investors will be keeping an eye on Figure's first earnings report as a public business to see how loan growth and Provenance adoption are doing.","{'href': 'https://uk.finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'uk.finance.yahoo.com'}","cryptocurrency"

Lobby groups from the finance and technology sectors
are pressing the UK government to ensure blockchain is included in a planned
cooperation deal with the United States, Bloomberg reported. 

The calls come ahead of President Donald Trump's visit
to London next week, where he will be accompanied by senior US tech executives.

In a letter to Business Secretary Peter Kyle and
Treasury Minister Lucy Rigby, more than a dozen associations urged the
government to make blockchain a “core strand” of the so-called UK-US Tech
Bridge. 

The groups, which include the UK Cryptoasset Business
Council, UK Finance, and TheCityUK, said leaving digital assets out would risk
sidelining Britain in global financial innovation.

According to the Financial Times, the UK and the US are preparing to announce new partnerships in artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Trump, who has backed crypto assets during his second term, is
expected to raise digital assets during his state visit. His delegation reportedly includes OpenAI's Sam Altman and Nvidia's Jensen Huang.

Students are behind a whopping 57% of personal data breaches in schools. 

by

Kids in the UK aren't just sneaking extra snacks into their backpacks. They're sneaking into their schools' computer systems. 

According to the country's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), students are behind a whopping 57% of personal data breaches in schools. Yes, more than half.

The watchdog looked at 215 reported breaches that originated inside schools and found that a lot of them were surprisingly low-tech. 

About a third came down to kids either guessing super obvious passwords or stumbling across login details teachers had left lying around. Turns out Post-it notes are the real enemy of cybersecurity.

That's not to say the students didn't occasionally flex some actual hacker cred. 

In one example, three Year 11 students managed to crack into a school's information system by brute-forcing passwords and bypassing security protocols. 

Two of them even admitted to hanging out on a hacking forum, because nothing says “future cybercriminal” like swapping tips online between homework assignments.

The ICO's report reads less like a dry government memo and more like a cautionary tale: today it's dares, rivalries, and revenge. Tomorrow, it could be ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure. (Via: TechCrunch)

Heather Toomey, principal cyber specialist at the ICO, put it bluntly: “What starts out as a dare, a challenge, a bit of fun in a school setting can ultimately lead to children taking part in damaging attacks.” Translation: today's detention is tomorrow's FBI watchlist.

The breaches weren't all kids' fault, though. 

About a quarter stemmed from teachers letting students borrow their devices, 20% came from staff mixing personal and professional devices, and another 17% happened because of sloppy access controls on platforms like SharePoint. 

Basically, weak security gave students an open invitation to snoop around.

Calling the findings worrying, the ICO urged schools to refresh their GDPR training, tighten up cybersecurity practices, and, importantly, report breaches on time. 

Because while students might think hacking into the system is just a bit of fun, regulators are quick to point out it's also a bit illegal.

Should schools focus more on cybersecurity education to channel students' hacking interests constructively, or implement stricter punishments to deter these breaches? Is the real problem student curiosity, or are schools simply not taking basic security measures seriously enough to protect sensitive data?

The first Dogecoin ETF is set to go live next week, becoming the first memecoin ETF ever to launch. Market experts have shared their opinions on what this could mean for the future of crypto, as well as insights into how the fund would operate. 

In an X post, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas stated that the meme coin ETF era is about to kick off as REX-Osprey's Dogecoin ETF (DOJE) is set to launch under the 40 Act. He added that this is likely the first-ever U.S. ETF to hold something that has no utility on purpose. The analyst noted that there are also other DOGE ETF filings under the 33 Act, which are awaiting the SEC's approval, meaning there are more meme coin ETFs on the horizon. 

As the Bloomberg analyst pointed out, the Dogecoin ETF will be the first U.S. fund without utility, given that DOGE is a meme coin that originated as a joke. Balchunas had doubled on his “utility” comment as he questioned in another X post what DOGE's utility was, seeing as it literally started out as a joke. 

Besides lacking any utility, it is worth mentioning that a Dogecoin ETF will differ from most altcoin ETFs, as DOGE is a proof-of-work (PoW) coin, just like Bitcoin. As such, there is also no staking utility that could bring in yields for investors like proof-of-stake (PoS) coins like Ethereum and Solana. This further strengthens the argument that DOGE lacks any utility. 

However, Incyt CEO Mike Maloney said that Dogecoin may have started as a joke, but it has become a serious altcoin that has attracted real investors and engineers to the space. He added that community engagement is as real for a coin as it is for a stock. 

There are notable projects on the Dogecoin network that have moved to provide real utility for the meme coin. One of them is DogeOS, whose CEO, Jordan Jefferson, remarked that Dogecoin started as a joke and now, Wall Street is finally getting it. 

In an X post, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart provided insights into how the REX-Osprey Dogecoin ETF will operate, considering that it was filed under the 33 Act, which is the normal route. He noted that the fund is slightly different from the spot Bitcoin & Ethereum ETFs, which everyone is accustomed to. 

REX-Osprey's Dogecoin ETF will spot DOGE but not for 100% of its holdings, like the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which hold 100% BTC and ETH. Seyyfart revealed that the DOGE fund will hold a combination of spot and other spot ETFs. As such, it will still offer spot exposure to the meme coin, but it can also use derivatives, too. The DOGE ETF was scheduled to launch this week, but the Bloomberg analyst has revealed that it has been delayed until next week. 

At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.26, up over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Solana's SOL rallied above $239 on Friday, extending its sharp September gains, as Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz described the blockchain as “tailor-made” for global financial markets and analyst Ali Martinez charted a potential path to $1,314.

Martinez, a well-known crypto analyst, highlighted Solana's breakout from what chart technicians call a cup-and-handle pattern, a formation that often signals the start of a long-term rally. 

In his chart, Martinez marked $1,314.41 as the main technical target, using Fibonacci retracement levels to project Solana's upside. The pattern reflects a multi-year basing structure: Solana's deep decline in 2022 and 2023 formed the “cup,” while the sideways consolidation of 2024 and early 2025 formed the “handle.” 

According to Martinez, the breakout above resistance near $220 validates the structure and opens the way to much higher levels if momentum persists.

Novogratz, speaking on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" Thursday, laid out a sweeping bull case for Solana and crypto more broadly. He began by pointing to treasury companies tied to both ETH and SOL, which he said are raising billions of dollars and bringing “lots of energy and money” into the digital asset ecosystem.

He then pivoted to bitcoin, predicting the world's largest cryptocurrency should see a surge toward the end of the year. 

But his most detailed remarks focused on Solana and the changing regulatory landscape. Novogratz said U.S. SEC Chair Paul Atkins has made clear that he wants all markets to move on-chain, citing a speech earlier in the week where Atkins declared, “On-chain capital markets and agentic finance are on the horizon, and the world is watching.”

As part of that backdrop, Novogratz flagged Nasdaq's proposal to the SEC to allow tokenized securities to be traded directly on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Combined with the new U.S. stablecoin framework, he argued, crypto finally has both the technology and the regulatory clarity to serve as financial market infrastructure.

On the technology side, Novogratz emphasized Solana's raw capacity, saying the blockchain can handle 14 billion transactions per day — enough, in his words, “to process all the transactions in equities, fixed income, commodities and foreign exchange combined.” He went on to call Solana a blockchain that is ""tailor-made"" for financial markets.

Adding it up — scalable infrastructure, a pro-blockchain regulatory stance and billions in new institutional inflows — Novogratz concluded that “this is the season of SOL,” a moment when Solana is positioned to take a leading role as capital markets shift on-chain.

 The former White House crypto adviser, who joined Tether in August, will become CEO of its planned US-regulated, dollar-backed stablecoin project. 

Tether announced a new dollar-backed stablecoin and said former White House crypto adviser Bo Hines will become CEO of Tether USAT. 

The new stablecoin will be consistent with the reserve requirements and compliance standards of the recently passed GENIUS stablecoin bill, and will use Tether's Hadron real-world asset tokenization platform, according to a Friday announcement.

Stablecoins recently crossed the $270 billion milestone, according to RWA.XYZ. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said:

Stablecoins have become a geostrategic policy issue for the administration of US President Donald Trump and are quickly becoming a focus in other countries such as  China.

Metagenomics provides access to the genetic diversity of uncultured bacteria through analysis of DNA extracted from whole microbial communities. Long-read sequencing is advancing metagenomic discovery by generating larger DNA assemblies than previously possible. However, harnessing the potential of long-read sequencing to access the vast diversity within soil microbiomes is hampered by the challenge of isolating high-quality DNA. Here we introduce a method that can liberate large, high-quality metagenomic DNA fragments from soil bacteria and pair them with optimized nanopore long-read sequencing to generate megabase-sized assemblies. Using this method, we uncover hundreds of complete circular metagenomic genomes from a single soil sample. Through a combination of bioinformatic prediction and chemical synthesis, we convert nonribosomal peptide biosynthetic gene clusters directly into bioactive molecules, identifying antibiotics with rare modes of action and activity against multidrug-resistant pathogens. Our approach advances metagenomic access to the vast genetic diversity of the uncultured bacterial majority and provides a means to convert it to bioactive molecules.

Sequencing has primarily been driven by massively parallel short-read methods, particularly Illumina sequencing. As adoption of this technology rose and costs were driven down, there was an explosion of bacterial isolate whole-genome sequences1. The majority of bacteria, however, remain recalcitrant to laboratory culture, preventing direct analysis of their genetic diversity. While short-read-based 16S amplicon profiling of metagenomes (that is, whole-DNA extracts of microbial communities) has been used to provide glimpses at microbial diversity hidden in the uncultured majority2, a key limitation of direct short-read exploration is the inability to deconvolute complex metagenomes and reconstruct sequences of individual microorganisms within the community. Binning of short-read assemblies by computationally predicted similarity into metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) as a means to explore the genetic potential of environmental bacteria has now become routine; however, MAGs tend to be smaller than bacterial genomes, fragmented and often contain sequence contamination through erroneous binning1,3,4,5. Exploration of soil microbiomes presents a particularly difficult challenge because of not only the immense microbial diversity they contain but also the challenges associated with isolating high-quality metagenomic DNA6,7. Efficient exploration of environmental microbial genetic potential requires the development of methods that can generate large contiguous assemblies. This is especially important when exploring the biosynthetic potential of the global metagenome, as biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) can be tens if not hundreds of kilobases long and are challenging to identify within fragmented assemblies8. Long-read sequencing technologies have advanced metagenomic sequencing by producing larger assemblies that can be efficiently interrogated using bioinformatic algorithms (Fig. 1a)9,10,11,12,13 and updated nanopore flow cells (R10.4) and sequencing chemistries (V14) can now generate high-quality assemblies without the need for short-read polishing14,15.

a, The limitations of short-read technology restrict complete genomic sequencing to cultured isolates; emerging long-read sequencing may overcome this challenge. b, Nanopore sequencing read-length distribution comparison of soil metagenomic DNA prepared by direct hot CTAB extraction (old) and the newly developed and optimized nycodenz method (new). c, Assembly summary of high-quality nanopore soil metagenomic sequencing at metaFlye's input limit. d, Assembly length plot of >1 Mbp metaFlye generated contigs with an estimation of genome completeness based on the presence of all rRNA genes (5S, 16S and 23S) and at least 18 unique tRNAs. Plots are separated into circular and linear assemblies.

Numerous methods have been developed to extract metagenomic DNA16 but the focus has been on DNA quality without the need to optimize these protocols for isolating large DNA fragments. Here, we developed a nanopore long-read sequencing pipeline with size-optimized DNA isolation and preparation that, when applied to a complex soil metagenome, yielded read lengths with N50 > 30 kbp. This is 200 times longer than the commonly used 150-bp short-read technology. The increased read size led to assemblies of contiguous DNA sequences on the order of megabase pairs, including hundreds of complete circular metagenomic genomes. Using a synthetic bioinformatic natural product (synBNP) approach, which couples bioinformatics and total chemical synthesis to abiotically decode BGCs17, we directly converted unearthed nonribosomal peptide BGCs within the large contiguous assemblies into bioactive molecules. This led to the discovery of a potent cardiolipin-binding broad-spectrum antibiotic and a ClpX-targeting antibiotic.

A critical barrier to sequencing soils is the copurification of contaminants when isolating metagenomic DNA6,7. To improve soil DNA extraction, we developed a method that first separated bacteria from the soil matrix by nycodenz gradient centrifugation and then used a skim-milk wash to remove impurities from the isolated cells. This process generated a bacterial suspension that appeared similar to a lab-grown culture (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Using standard hot CTAB metagenomic DNA extraction18 on this cell suspension yielded a cleaner metagenomic DNA extraction with far larger fragments compared to direct soil extraction (Supplementary Fig. 1b). The ‘clean' microbial suspension allowed us to test a variety of metagenomic DNA extraction and size-selection approaches to maximize nanopore read length (Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Our final method used commercially available DNA extraction (Monarch's high-molecular-weight (HMW) DNA extraction kit) and size selection (Oxford Nanopore's small fragment eliminator kit), allowing for simple and scalable DNA preparation. We expanded our approach using the original test forest soil sample to generate almost 1 Tbp of sequence data with an N50 of 32.82 kbp. For comparison, a representative nanopore sequencing result using our method and the direct soil hot CTAB extraction method is shown in Fig. 1b. In total, 2.5 Tbp of long-read sequencing data were generated from a single forest soil sample during testing and scaling. All data were pooled for bioinformatic analysis. A summary of all the sequencing runs is given in Supplementary Table 2.

MetaFlye19, the state-of-the-art algorithm for metagenomic assembly, has an input limit of 239 bp (550 Gbp) and could not process all the data simultaneously because of the high sequencing depth. We, therefore, used two independent approaches to generate assemblies. This included global assembly at metaFlye's input limit using the highest-quality and longest reads and a targeted approach that used extraction and subassembly of reads containing sequences of interest.

To gain broad insight into the metagenomic content of the forest soil, we assembled a 528.5-Gbp subset of our data consisting of the highest-quality and longest reads (Q20+ reads longer than 20,000 bp). Assembly yielded almost 32 Gbp of sequence with an N50 of 262 kbp (Fig. 1c), including over 3,200 contigs > 1 Mbp. As a comparison, previous short-read sequencing explorations of soil metagenomes returned assemblies with an N50 of ~1.6 kbp even with over 3 Tbp of sequencing data20,21. In addition, a recent PacBio long-read exploration of a soil metagenome generated read lengths with a N50 of 4 kbp, leading to assemblies with an N50 of 36 kbp (ref. 22). Our optimized nanopore exploration substantially increased assembly length and provided a unique opportunity to explore genome-sized contiguous metagenomic assemblies without the reliance on computationally inferred MAG binning.

We focused our exploration on a subset of single contiguous assemblies that likely captured complete or near-complete bacterial genomes. To do this, we determined the subset of >1 Mbp of circular and linear assemblies that contained 5S, 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes with at least 18 transfer RNAs (tRNAs) (Fig. 1d). These combined criteria are part of the field benchmark for near-complete MAGs1 and yielded 563 single contiguous assemblies (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 3). These contained 95% (206) of the circular assemblies in the >1-Mbp dataset, which was in line with the expectation that large circular assemblies represent complete contiguous bacterial genomes (Fig. 1d). Among the group of assemblies containing the requisite rRNA and tRNA, the circular subset was on average 4.95 ± 2.05 Mbp in size with the linear assemblies 3.99 ± 1.88 Mbp in size. To put this advance into context, we collated MAGs from soil-linked samples within the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) (Supplementary Table 4)23, the most up-to-date repository of bacterial sequences. From 5,640 entries across 91 bioprojects, we only identified two single-contig MAGs exceeding 1 Mbp that contained the required repertoire of rRNA and tRNA genes. In fact, only 26 total MAG bins contained an assembly over 1 Mbp, two orders of magnitude lower than the >3,200 in our single assembly.

In addition to the rRNA and tRNA criteria, for a MAG to be considered near complete, it must be rated >90% complete with <5% contamination by CheckM, a software tool designed to assess the quality of genome bins. Irrespective of the rRNA and tRNA content, a MAG is considered of high quality at >70% completeness and medium quality at >50% completeness, both with <10% contamination1,24. Of the 206 circular assemblies, only three were below 80% completeness, with 79% (163) matching the near-complete criteria (Supplementary Table 3). The 357 linear assemblies were split into 32%, 29% and 21% near-complete, high-quality and medium-quality MAGs, respectively. Only 15 (2.7%) assemblies within the 563 complete or near-complete dataset exceeded the contamination criteria, with many only by a small margin (Supplementary Table 3). As a comparison, a recent Illumina-based large-scale exploration of soil yielded a total of 679 MAG bins, of which 5% (33) and 14% (92) were >90% and >70% complete, respectively24. These high-quality MAGs were on average 3.05 ± 1.25 Mbp in size and composed of 567 ± 417 assemblies with an N50 of 11.8 ± 9.8 kbp. Overall, this analysis continued to demonstrate the advance in metagenomic exploration provided by long-read sequencing, with our optimized protocol greatly increasing the number of complete or near-complete contiguous genomes that can now be assembled from a complex soil metagenome.

To gain an estimate of the species diversity found in each subset of our data, we used 16S profiling. In total, we detected >4,500 unique species within the 2.5-Tbp dataset. Over 90% of these were detected in the global assembly data, 25% were detected in the >1-Mbp dataset and over 12% were detected in the complete or near-complete genome dataset (Supplementary Table 5). Next, we sought to explore the complete or near-complete genome dataset within the comprehensive phylogenetic profiling of the GTDB framework.

Our complete and near-complete metagenome dataset resolved into 16 phyla (Fig. 2a), with only four sequences (0.7%) matched to known species (Supplementary Table 3). To highlight underexplored bacterial sequences within the dataset, we determined which underrepresented and largely uncultured taxa within the GTDB were most expanded by our assembled data (Supplementary Table 6). These taxa included the UBP17 phylum, the Capsulimonadaceae family and the Lustribacter and DAIDGS01 genera from the Eremiobacterota phylum (Fig. 2b). In addition, we also saw a notable expansion of diversity of the Palsa-744 genus within the well-represented Actinomycetota phylum (Supplementary Fig. 2), the fifth most sequence-rich phylum within the GTDB. Apart from a single completely sequenced cultured representative in the Capsulimonadaceae family, our data added the first complete contiguous genomes for each of the abovementioned taxa. Of these, the most striking was a 12.56-Mbp circular assembly belonging to the UBP17 phylum, which stood out because this mysterious phylum consisted of only ten total MAGs that were on average much smaller and highly fragmented. The theme of highly fragmented MAGs being the only genetic resource for a taxon was common throughout our comparisons (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 2). Assembly of large contiguous sequences provided not only an unprecedented resolution of a complex microbial community but also an opportunity for the bioinformatic exploration of biosynthetic potential within microbial dark matter.

Generating complete BGC sequences within fragmented assemblies generated by short-read technology is challenging. Furthermore, the mobile nature and rapid evolution of BGCs25 may hamper MAG binning where computational similarity would need to link core genomic regions and varied BGC content. We rationalized that our long-read sequencing data would allow us to explore biosynthetic systems found in complex microbiomes without these limitations. To gain a broad overview of the biosynthetic content captured within our complete and near-complete metagenomic genome dataset, we bioinformatically identified and summarized BGC content at the taxonomic family level (Fig. 2a). On average, there were 1.3 ± 0.7 BGCs per Mbp across the families, with four families (UBA5704, Pseudonocardiaceae, Streptomycetaceae and UBA11063) exceeding 3 BGCs per Mbp. UBA stands for ‘uncultured bacteria or archaea' and was coined to phylogenetically characterize MAGs that provided the first example of a bacterial or archaeal lineage26. UBA5704 is a family within the Acidobacteriota phylum under the order Multivoradales, while UBA11063 is a family within the Pseudomonadota phylum under the order Burkholderiales. UBA5704 contains five genera and UBA11063 only contains a single genus (Aquella), for which a cultured representative was isolated and sequenced in 2019 (ref. 27). In Fig. 2c, we highlight the two most BGC-rich assemblies within the taxa with >3 BGCs per Mbp, as well as one of the five UBA11063 (Aquella) assemblies. Even with their relatively small genome sizes, our data indicated that Aquella species within our dataset contained a disproportionally large biosynthetic repertoire. Notably, the clusters were overwhelmingly nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS)-type BGCs (Fig. 2d). Even though the GTDB contained 37 Aquella entries (one isolate and 36 MAGs), analysis of the total 76.4-Mbp sequence yielded only 85 total BGCs (1.1 BGC per Mbp). This may indicate that, because of difficulties in assembling NRPS BGCs using short reads, this genus may have been previously overlooked as a rich source of natural products. Overall, our large contiguous assemblies offered an avenue for natural product discovery by pointing toward BGC-rich taxa that have remained hidden or overlooked because of a lack of quality assemblies. To access this previously hidden biosynthetic diversity, we used a total synthesis approach of bioinformatically predicted nonribosomal peptides.

NRPS BGCs encode large modular proteins where each module functions to incorporate a monomer building block into a growing peptide-like structure28. The synBNP approach exploits this modular organization to predict the NRPS product by decoding which monomer is selected by each NRPS module to predict the assembled peptide; then, the predicted structure is accessed by total chemical synthesis.

A small number of bacterial species dominate soil biomass29 and obscure the rare microbiome that contains the majority of genetic diversity within a metagenome. To explore the complete set of genetic diversity captured in our whole 2.5-Tbp dataset, we devised a partitioned assembly approach where a hidden Markov model (HMM) search was used to identify reads containing specific sequences of interest for subassembly. While we targeted NRPS adenylation (A) domains, this approach could be used to target any sequence of interest. The HMM search identified 6.17 million reads containing an A-domain, which assembled into 118,000 contigs with an N50 of 111 kbp (Fig. 3a). We then narrowed our search to contigs that contained four or more A domains to focus on large NRPS BGCs, which are generally problematic for short-read assemblies to fully capture. This yielded 338 contigs. BiG-SCAPE analysis of the captured NRPS BGCs on these contigs revealed 366 clusters, of which only six could be found in the MiBig database of characterized molecules (Fig. 3a). Notably, only 20.5% of the clusters from our targeted assembly could be mapped to the global assembly dataset, indicating that our partitioned assembly approach did indeed access a larger proportion of the rare microbiome.

Results in d,e are representative of two and three biologically independent replicates, respectively.

A possible limitation of the targeted assembly approach was that removing genomic context by restricting assembly to reads only containing NRPS genes may have led to erroneous or chimeric assemblies. While it is not possible to know the extent to which this problem may exist, we believe that it is unlikely to be pervasive because of two key points. First, previously characterized NRPS BGCs identified in the BiG-SCAPE analysis were correctly assembled. Second, as a control, we cultured and sequenced a collection of microorganisms from the same forest soil sample used in this study, which yielded multiple NRPS BGCs that matched those found in our targeted assembly dataset (Supplementary Table 7, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Note 2).

We selected 20 NRPS BGCs with diverse predicted phylogenic origins for synBNP structure prediction and synthesis (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Tables 8–10). While the peptide sequence generated by an NRPS BGC can be predicted through the A-domain signatures present within each module, the final product can be released as either a linear or cyclic peptide, which remains difficult to predict bioinformatically. Therefore, for each of the 20 predictions, we synthesized a range of possible products (Fig. 3c; linear (L), cyclized through the terminal amine (H), cyclized through the 3-OH fatty acid (F) and cyclized through a nucleophilic amino acid side chain (C#)) to generate a library of 55 synBNPs (Supplementary Table 11). Myristic or hydroxymyristic acid was used when lipidation was predicted to be present as it is the most commonly seen lipid in characterized lipopeptides.

All synBNPs were assayed for antibiotic activity against Gram-positive model organisms Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as the Gram-negative model organism Escherichia coli (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Table 11). Five synBNPs, based on predictions from four NRPS clusters, had notable activity (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ≤ 8 µg ml−1) against at least one of these bacteria and were, therefore, screened for wider activity against the ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae) and for human cell toxicity (Fig. 3e). We then selected the two most potent synBNPs for further characterization. SynBNP 25, inspired by the BGC found on contig 112034, was a potent broad-spectrum antibiotic and lacked cytotoxicity. This compound was named erutacidin after the Latin erutus for ‘dug out'. SynBNP 27, inspired by the BGC found on contig 97355, was selected for its potent activity against S. aureus (MIC = 2 µg ml−1). This compound was named trigintamicin after the Latin word for ‘30', the temperature at which activity was detected. In our initial screen, racemic 3-OH myristic acid was used for the synthesis of fatty acid cyclized synBNPs that included trigintamicin. Upon resynthesis and more thorough purification, the two trigintamicin isomers were resolved, with only the S-isomer showing antibiotic activity against S. aureus (Supplementary Table 12).

To determine the MOAs of erutacidin and trigintamicin, we first attempted to raise resistant mutants. Direct plating of S. aureus on trigintamicin (Fig. 4a) at 8× its MIC generated resistant mutants. Genomic sequencing of resistant clones revealed mutations at two genetic loci, ytrA and clpX (Supplementary Table 13). Mutations in ytrA have been previously linked to nonspecific antibiotic resistance30,31; hence, we focused on clpX. ClpX is an ATPase that unfolds and translocates proteins into the ClpP serine protease for degradation32. In S. aureus, ClpX is essential at 30 °C but dispensable at 37 °C (ref. 33). Our antibiotic activity assays were conducted at 30 °C and we found that shifting the assay conditions to 37 °C abolished trigintamicin activity, further suggesting ClpX as the target (Supplementary Table 12). We then performed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to confirm the interaction between trigintamicin and ClpX. These studies found that trigintamicin bound ClpX, whereas its biologically inactive R-isomer did not (Fig. 4b). No thermal changes were observed in the absence of ClpX (Supplementary Fig. 4). Collectively, our MOA studies indicated that trigintamicin was a ClpX-targeting antibiotic. The targeting of ClpX by trigintamicin explains the narrow antibacterial spectrum, as clpX is not essential in most bacteria. It also explains human cell cytotoxicity, as mitochondrial ClpXP is essential and an emerging target for cancer therapy34.

Source data

Neither direct plating nor prolonged passage of S. aureus or A. baumannii in the presence of erutacidin (Fig. 4c) generated resistant mutants (Fig. 4d). Time-dependent killing curve analysis of S. aureus treated with erutacidin showed a rapid bactericidal effect (<10 min at ≥2× MIC) (Fig. 4e). This suggested disruption of membrane integrity as a potential MOA. To test erutacidin for membrane depolarization activity, we used a DiSC3(5)-based fluorescence assay. Treatment of S. aureus with erutacidin increased fluorescence similarly to the known depolarizer gramicidin, confirming membrane depolarization (Fig. 4f). Antibiotics that depolarize the bacterial membrane frequently interact with specific membrane components. For example, the antibiotics telomycin and daptomcyin interact with cardiolipin (also known as diphosphatidylglycerol) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG), respectively35,36. In each case, the activity of the antibiotic can be suppressed by the addition of its binding partner to the growth medium (Supplementary Fig. 5)36,37. To further investigate erutacidin's MOA, we tested whether its activity could be suppressed by supplementation with various membrane lipids. Erutacidin's antibacterial activity was strongly inhibited by the addition of cardiolipin, reducing its activity eightfold at just a 0.5:1 molar ratio of cardiolipin to erutacidin (Fig. 4g). Supplementation of PG also caused a notable inhibition of activity, with an eightfold decrease in MIC at a 2:1 molar ratio of PG to erutacidin. Minor protection was provided by the supplementation of membrane lipids related to cardiolipin and PG, including phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) but no effect was observed for any other lipids tested or menaquinone (Fig. 4g). These data suggest that erutacidin interacts strongly and preferentially with cardiolipin but may also interact with related lipid structures. This may explain the lack of observed in vitro resistance for erutacidin, as acquiring mutations to overcome multiple inhibited molecular targets is very difficult. Cardiolipin binding is a rare MOA that is not represented among clinically used antibiotics. As such, we expected that multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates would not show cross-resistance to erutacidin. Indeed, erutacidin maintained potent activity against all MDR S. aureus and MDR A. baumannii clinical isolates we tested (Supplementary Table 14).

By achieving a substantial increase in read length, we show that it is possible to resolve complete contiguous metagenomic genomes from a complex soil sample. This not only advances our understanding of the composition of environmental bacterial communities but also provides a deeper understanding of encoded biosynthetic potential. Notably, the number of NRPS BGCs uncovered in the global assembly (0.53 Tbp) compared to the targeted A-domain assembly accessing the full dataset increased linearly, suggesting that even 2.5 Tbp was not sufficient sequencing depth to saturate the diversity found in the soil sample. The distribution of bacterial taxa in soil is uneven, with a small number dominating the biomass29, and it is unclear what sequencing depth would be required to fully uncover very rare microbial dark matter. However, similar to trends observed with short-read sequencing38, continued improvements in efficiency and accuracy should allow deep long-read sequencing to increasingly become a routine tool in metagenomics. As with the rapid growth of short-read data38, this will necessitate the development of improved bioinformatic tools and computation infrastructure to assemble and explore terabase-scale long-read datasets. Nanopore specific assemblers are already becoming increasing powerful, with a very recent preprint introducing nanoMDBG as a fast and less computationally intensive assembly algorithm39. Bioinformatic algorithms for predicting the chemical output of BGCs are also improving, particularly with the incorporation of artificial intelligence and machine learning methods40,41, and we expect that the number and diversity of BGCs that can be decoded using a synBNP approach will continue to increase. Even in the small number of BGCs examined in this study through the synBNP approach, we could identify a broad-spectrum antibiotic with no detected resistance and with activity against very-difficult-to-treat MDR pathogens including the Gram-negative A. baumannii. By combining improved long-read access to metagenome sequence space with synBNP discovery, we established a pipeline to leverage the vast genetic diversity of microbial dark matter for the systematic detection, synthesis and screening of previously inaccessible bioactive molecules. This represents a scalable strategy to identify molecules inspired by BGCs from within the near-limitless uncultured bacterial majority.

All strains, unless otherwise specified, were grown in Luria–Bertani (LB) at 30 °C with 200-rpm shaking. Antibiotic activity test strains and ESKAPE pathogens were: B. subtilis 168, S. aureus SH1000, E. coli ATCC 25922, E. faecium COM15, K. pneumoniae ATCC 10031, A. baumannii ATCC 17978, P. aeruginosa PAO1 and E. cloacae ATCC 13047.

In late May 2023, we collected samples from Rockefeller University's 1,200-acre Center for Field Research in Ethology located in Dutchess County, New York. In order of collection, these comprised soil from a healthy forest (forest 1), sediment from a muddy bog, soil from the edge of a lake (forest 2), soil from a grove of dead trees (forest 3), decaying material from a dead tree and soil from a dry forest area (forest 4). Soil from a maximum depth of 10 cm was collected from an area of 50 cm2 into a gallon-sized Ziploc bag. A single collected bag of forest soil 1 was used for testing and scaling. After collection, bags were stored at 4 °C.

Gradient centrifugation for separation of cells from the soil matrix and testing washes for removal of copurified contaminants were motivated by previous approaches in the field42,43,44. Soil (62.5 g) was added to 200 ml of prechilled 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate (Sigma) and blended (Hamilton Beach 10 speed) for 1 min using the LO/batter setting. The container was then placed on ice for 5 min. The 1-min blending and 5-min ice break were repeated two more times. Blended soil was then filtered through a cheesecloth (grade 90, bleached) to remove large insoluble particles and the filtrate was gently layered onto 8 ml of 36% w/v nycodenz (Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corporation) to the top of 50-ml conicals (Sarstedt). The tubes were centrifuged at 4 °C, 5,000g for 1.5 h in a swing bucket rotor yielding a fuzzy beige cell layer at the interface of the top (aqueous) and bottom (nycodenz) layer. The cell layer was gently aspirated and combined in a fresh 50-ml conical. The cell suspension was mixed 1:1 with sterile water and the mixture centrifuged at 4 °C, 5,000g for 1 h. The supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet was washed twice with 40 ml of JSM buffer (0.9% w/v NaCl and 1% w/v instant nonfat dry milk (Nestle)), followed by two washes with 40 ml of TE lysis buffer (25 mM Tris, 25 mM EDTA and 50 mM glucose). Lastly, the cell pellet was resuspended in a small volume (1–5 ml) of lysis buffer, the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) was checked and the bacterial suspension diluted as necessary for the desired DNA extraction protocol.

DNA extraction directly from soil was performed as previously described18. Briefly, 2.4 ml of CTAB lysis buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM Na EDTA, 1.5 M NaCl, 1% w/v CTAB and 2% w/v SDS, pH 8.0) was added to 2 g of soil in a 5-ml tube and the slurry was incubated at 70 °C for 2 h. For the nycodenz-isolated bacteria, 3 ml of a 30-OD600 bacterial suspension was pelleted, then resuspended in 4 ml of CTAB lysis buffer and incubated at 70 °C for 2 h. After incubation, the suspensions were centrifuged at 20,000g for 10 min and the supernatant was moved to new tubes. Supernatants were combined with 0.7 volumes of isopropanol and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Samples were centrifuged at 20,000g for 30 min and the resulting DNA pellets was washed twice with 1 ml of 70% ethanol. The pellets were then air-dried for 1–2 h at room temperature and resuspended in 100–200 µl of 5 mM Tris pH 8 overnight at 4 °C.

This protocol is an adaptation of gel plug lysis described by Walter et al.45 Nycodenz-isolated bacteria were resuspended in lysis buffer to 10 OD600. The bacterial suspension was mixed 1:1 with 1.5% UltraPure low-melting-point agarose (Thermo Fisher Scientific) prepared in lysis buffer and cooled to 50 °C. The mixture was used to cast gel plugs in CHEF Mapper XA system 50-well plug molds (BioRad, 1703713). Gel plugs were then suspended in a solution of 5 mg ml−1 lysozyme and 1 mg ml−1 achromopeptidase prepared in lysis buffer and gently rotated at 37 °C overnight using a Roto-therm plus (Benchmark Scientific). The buffer was decanted and the plugs were topped up with TESP buffer (50 mM Tris, 100 mM EDTA, 1% w/v SDS and 1 mg ml−1 proteinase K) and incubated overnight with gentle rotation at 50 °C. The gel plug suspension was decanted and the plugs were topped up with fresh TESP and once again incubated overnight with gentle rotation at 50 °C. TESP was then decanted and the gel plugs were rinsed several times with milli-Q water before being suspended in T10E50 (10 mM Tris and 50 mM EDTA, pH 8) with 1 mM PMSF and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The liquid was decanted and the plugs washed four times with T10E50 with each wash lasting 1 h on ice. Gel plugs were then stored suspended in T10E50 in the fridge.

Cell lysis was performed similarly to previously established approaches46,47. Nycodenz-isolated bacteria were resuspended in lysis buffer to 10 OD600 and 500 µl of the suspension was pelleted by centrifugation for 1 min at 20,000g. The cell pellet was resuspended in 800 µl of lysis buffer containing 5 mg ml−1 lysozyme and 1 mg ml−1 achromopeptidase and the suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. After incubation, 1 mg of proteinase K powder was added, followed by 200 µl of 5% w/v SDS. The sample was very gently inverted to mix and incubated for 3 h at 55 °C. The viscous solution was then layered onto a sucrose gradient for size selection.

About 1 ml of 10-OD600 nycodenz-isolated bacteria was centrifuged at 20,000g for 1 min and the cell pellet was resuspended in 300 µl of TE lysis buffer containing 5 mg ml−1 lysozyme and 1 mg ml−1 achromopeptidase. The sample was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and then carried forward using the New England Biolabs protocol for HMW DNA extraction from bacteria using the Monarch HMW DNA extraction kit for tissue (New England Biolabs, T3060). Briefly, 20 µl of proteinase K was added and the sample was incubated at 56 °C with varied shaking speeds (1,900, 1,700, 1,400 or 650 rpm) using a Fisherbrand Heat/Cool Thermal Mixer II (Fisher Scientific). After 30 min, 10 µl of RNase A was added and the sample was incubated a further 10 min with shaking at the same speed. Then, 300 µl of protein separation solution was added and the sample was mixed by inversion for 1 min. The sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000g and the upper phase was then transferred to a Monarch 2-ml tube using a wide-bore pipette tip. Two DNA capture beads were added, followed by 550 µl of isopropanol. The sample was mixed by gentle rotation using the Roto-therm Plus on the lowest speed setting for 5 min. The liquid was then discarded and the beads were washed twice with 500 µl of genomic DNA wash buffer. Finally, DNA was eluted by addition of 100 µl of elution buffer II and incubation at 56 °C for 10 min with 300-rpm agitation. The DNA solution was left to resuspend at 4 °C overnight.

The electroelution protocol was performed as previously described18 with minor modifications. Briefly, a 0.9% agarose gel was run in 0.5× TBE (VWR) at 6 V cm−1 for 2 h to size-select crude DNA extracts. The compression band containing HMW DNA was then excised, the gel slice was placed in dialysis tubing (Spectra/Por; 12,000–14,000-kDa molecular weight cutoff (MWCO)) and topped up with 0.5× TBE. DNA was then electroeluted in 0.5× TBE at 6 V cm−1 for 2 h. The gel slice was removed from the dialysis bag and the remaining liquid was concentrated to dryness against 25% PEG 8000 with 5 mM Tris pH 8. DNA was then rehydrated in the dialysis bag against 5 mM Tris pH 8 for isolation.

Linear 10–40% sucrose gradients, with 10 mM Tris pH 8, were prepared using the freeze–thaw method48. Gradients were prepared by liquid nitrogen flash-freezing at the end of the day and immediately placed to thaw at 4 °C until use 22–24 h later. Two sizes of polypropylene tubes were used, 25 × 89 mm and 14 × 95 mm (Beckman), with 8-ml and 2.9-ml sucrose layers, respectively. Larger tubes were centrifuged using an SW28 rotor, while the smaller tubes were centrifuged using an SW40 Ti rotor. In both cases, centrifugation was at 4 °C, 40,000g for 16 h. After centrifugation, fractions were gently pipetted from the top of the tubes using wide-bore tips. Pulse-field gel electrophoresis was used to analyze the fractions. For shorter-fragment purification (that is, DNA from hot CTAB and Monarch 1,900 rpm), analysis was conducted using 0.9% agarose with 1× TAE at 6 V cm−1 for 4 h with a 5-s switch time. For ultralarge DNA, analysis was conducted using 0.9% agarose with 1× TAE at 6 V cm−1 for 16 h with a linear 3–7-s switch time. Ultralarge DNA from direct lysis was isolated using large tubes from fractions at 14 ml to 32 ml. Hot CTAB DNA was purified using small tubes from fractions at 2.5 ml to 4.5 ml. DNA from Monarch 1,900 rpm was purified using large tubes from fractions at 6 ml to 8.5 ml, aiming to isolate DNA ~40 kb in size.

DNA size selection with the SFE kit (Oxford Nanopore EXP-SFE001) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.

DNA from gel-plug-extracted metagenomic DNA was isolated using the NucleoSpin gel and PCR cleanup kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A-domain amplicon sequencing was performed as previously described49. Read counts were 1,424,301 for forest soil 1, 923,413 for forest soil 2, 551,873 for forest soil 3, 1,965,137 for forest soil 4, 717,416 for the muddy bog and 467,043 for the decaying tree. A-domain amplicons were trimmed to remove primer sequences using vsearch (version 2.28.1)50 fastx_filter and then assembled into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) clustered at 95% nucleotide similarity using vsearch cluster_size. A-domain OTUs for each soil were then compared across all samples at 95% similarity. Parallel processing was achieved using GNU parallel (version 20230922)51.

Ultralong DNA sequencing kit V14 (SQK-ULK114) preparation was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three DNA inputs were attempted, one following Oxford Nanopore directions on the Monarch HMW DNA extraction kit for tissue extraction, the manufacturer-recommended protocol for Monarch HMW DNA extraction kit for tissue and sucrose gradient purification. An additional attempt using the Monarch extracted DNA input was tried with a slightly altered protocol; instead of heat-killing the fragmentation mix, proteinase K was added to 1 mg ml−1 for 1 h at room temperature, followed by the addition of 3 mM PMSF for 1 h at room temperature to inhibit the proteinase K before continuing the protocol.

Oxford Nanopore's ligation sequencing kit V14 (SQK-LSK114) was used to prepare sequencing samples, with DNA extraction and size selection as indicated, according to the manufacturer's instructions and minor modifications. Input DNA was increased to 3 µg, blunting and end-repair mix reaction incubation times were extended to 15 min at 20 °C and 10 min at 65 °C and adaptor ligation incubation time was increased to 30 min. Library solution was used for all samples and the DNA concentrations loaded are indicated in Supplementary Table 2. On the basis of our optimization experiments, the 1,700-rpm Monarch isolation and SFE size-selection protocol applied to 62.5 g of the forest soil would be sufficient to generate >2 Tbp of sequence.

PromethION R10.4.1 flow cells were used to generate all of the sequencing data. Nanopore sequencing was conducted using a P2 solo with MinKnow 23.04.6 (ultra kits) or 23.11.4 (Ligation kits) and a P24 with MinKnow 23.07.12 (scaled ligation). All raw data were duplex-basecalled with standalone Dorado 0.4.1 + 6c4c636 for subsequent analysis.

The longest, highest-quality reads (>20 kbp, Q20+) were extracted from the 2.5-Tbp sequence dataset using Chopper (version 0.6.0)52. The resulting 528.5-Gbp dataset was assembled using Flye (version 2.9.3-b1797) in metagenomic mode (metaFlye) with parameters ‘--nano-hq --i 0 --threads 64 --meta' (ref. 19). The assembly was run on Rockefeller University's large-memory high-performance computing node (64 cores, 3 TB of RAM) and took just under 8 days to complete with RAM usage peaking at 845 GB. The assembly was polished once (the emerging best practice53) with Medaka (version 1.11.3; https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka) and annotated by Bakta (version 1.10.4)54. Assembled contigs > 1 Mbp were extracted and their taxonomy assigned using the GTDB toolkit (GTDB-tk version 2.4.0)55 classify workflow with GTDB release 09-RS220. The presence of rRNA was detected within the Bakta annotation using a GNU AWK script (version 5.3.0), while tRNAscan-SE (version 2.0.9) was used to quantify total unique tRNAs. A set of 563 contigs > 1 Mbp were identified containing all rRNAs and at least 18 unique tRNAs to establish the complete or near-complete metagenomic genome dataset. The dataset was then frame-shift-corrected using proovframe56 and completeness was estimated by CheckM (version 1.2.3)57. The taxonomic classification of these contigs was plotted as a Sankey diagram using the networkD3 R package 0.4 (Fig. 2a). AntiSMASH (version 6.1.1)58 results from the output JSON files were used to generate the appended BGC summaries. Subtrees expanding previously underexplored clades were generated by extracting the alignment information from the GTDB-tk classify workflow for desired sequences and plotting with FastTree (version 2.1.11)59 using default settings. Additional information was then manually added.

HMMER (version 3.1b2)60 was used to scan the total sequencing dataset for AMP-binding domains using an available HMM (AMP-binding, Pfam PF00501.23). Reads containing AMP-binding domains were assembled (metaFlye), polished (Medaka) and annotated (Bakta), as described above. The AMP-binding domain search using HMMER was repeated on the assemblies to extract the subset containing at least four AMP-binding domains. Similar to the complete and near-complete genome assembly dataset, frameshifts were minimized using proovframe and then the subset was analyzed by antiSMASH (version 6.1.1). For analysis of NRPS content, the antiSMASH results were analyzed by BiG-SCAPE (version 1.1.5) to generate Fig. 3a. The phylogeny of NRPS containing BGCs was determined using the mmseqs2 (ref. 61) toolkit's easy-taxonomy workflow and the National Center for Biotechnology Information nonredundant protein database.

Reads containing 16S rRNA sequences were extracted from the 2.5 Tbp of sequencing data using barrnap 0.9 (https://github.com/tseemann/barrnap). The 16S rRNA read subset was then assembled (metaFlye), polished (Medaka) and annotated (Bakta) as described above. Annotated 16S rRNA gene sequences were then extracted and, using vsearch, dereplicated and clustered at 99%, the recommended threshold for clustering full-length 16S sequences62. Lastly, to ensure full-length sequences, only OTUs between 1,400 and 1,700 bp were retained. The same extraction, dereplication and clustering process was used to identify 16S rRNA genes within the global assembly dataset. Phylogeny was assigned using mmseqs2 and the SILVA database (release 138.2)63.

Forest soil 1 microorganisms were isolated using the nycodenz method with the last two washes replaced with Dulbecco's PBS (DPBS; Gibco). The purified suspension was diluted to 0.05 OD600 in DPBS and 200 µl was spread on individual agar plates (150 mm × 15 mm). Ten plates each were used with three different media: R2A agar (Fisher Scientific), which was previously used to isolate the Aquella species27, and two versions of dilute nutrient broth (Criterion). In one case, nutrient broth was diluted 200-fold compared to the manufacturer's recommendation; in the second case, dilute nutrient broth was with supplemented 1:1 (v/v) with soil extract64. In all cases, nystatin (50 µg ml−1) was added to limit fungal growth. Plates were incubated at 30 °C with R2A colonies picked after 3 days and nutrient broth colonies picked after 10 days. Attempting to maximize isolate diversity, colonies were picked to maximize different morphologies. Liquid R2A or unmodified nutrient broth were used to culture isolates for sequencing (3 ml, 30 °C, 200-rpm shaking).

Bacterial cells were pelleted from turbid cultures (1–1.5 ml) by centrifugation for 1 min at 20,000g. The supernatant was removed and the cell pellets were caried forward for genomic DNA isolation using the PureLink microbiome DNA purification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as per manufacturer's instructions for soil samples with elution volume lowered to 50 µl. Oxford Nanopore's native barcoding kit 24 V14 (SQK-NBD114.24) was used as per the manufacturer's instructions to prepare sequencing samples. From R2A medium culturing, 22 genomes were individually barcoded and sequenced. From nutrient medium culturing, 20 genomes were individually barcoded and 12 were barcoded as pools of three. Each medium set was sequenced using a PromethION flow cell.

Isolate genomes were assembled using Flye with Medaka polishing and Bakta annotation. Genome assemblies were dereplicated by extracting 16S rRNA genes, clustering sequences at 99% identity and then selecting a single assembly per cluster. This yielded 30 genomes (Supplementary Table 7). BGCs were identified in each dereplicated cultured genome using antiSMASH. Large NRPS BGCs (that is, ≥4 A domains) were compared to those from the targeted metagenomic assembly using mmseqs2. Matches are shown in Supplementary Fig. 3.

SynBNP prediction was carried out according to our standard workflow65. Briefly, ‘bioinformatically tractable clusters' were identified and their products were predicted as follows. BGCs were scanned for NRPS domains and modules. The order in which these domains are likely to function was predicted on the basis of canonical NRPS module organization combined with the principle of collinearity. The following BGCs were then removed: (1) BGCs lacking predicted initiation or termination domains; (2) BGCs with modules that do not follow canonical NRPS domain organization (that is, condensation domain, A-domain and thiolation domain); (3) BGCs rich in tailoring genes; and (4) BGCs having fewer than four A domains, as these make poor synBNP targets. Structure predictions were then generated on the basis of A-domain specificity and derived structural modifications predicted on the basis of an analysis of additional domains present in the BGC (for example, epimerization and N-methylation). These data were combined on the basis of the initial domain order analysis to generate the linear structure encoded by a BGC. Specificity codes were compared to both the antiSMASH output and an in-house specificity code table collated from previously characterized natural products. The highest A-domain matches were solely considered for predictions. In rare cases where multiple amino acids share the same code, one was selected from the consensus of predictions generated by NRPSPredictor2 within antiSMASH. If multiple predictions were tied after the consensus stage, one was selected at random. The set of bioinformatically tractable clusters considered and their corresponding predictions are given in Supplementary Table 8. This represented roughly 19% of detected NRPS BGCs. On average, A domains matched at 90.1% ± 13.9%. The average A-domain match per peptide was 89.9% ± 8.0%. From the subset of predictions that contained at most one <70% A-domain specificity code (~83% of the predictions passed this cutoff), we randomly selected 20for synthesis. These covered a range of phylogenetic classifications (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 9). Contig_44957 had two mismatched codes but was retained as the codes were closely related and predicted to specify the same amino acid. While we used a cutoff of NRPs containing at most a single A-domain that matched <70%, this can be loosened or more restrictive if desired. A breakdown of predictions that passed different cutoff levels is provided in Supplementary Table 10.

Reagents and solvents used for synthesis were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification. Chromatography solvents were of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade or higher. Peptides were purified using a CombiFlash EZ Prep purification system with ultraviolet detection and equipped with a RediSep gold HP C18 column (30 g), RediSep gold HP C8 column or Phenomenex Luna 5 µm C18 prepHPLC column using a 5–95% acetonitrile–water gradient supplemented with 0.1% formic acid. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data were acquired on a SCIEX ExionLC ultra-HPLC (UPLC) instrument coupled to an X500R quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer with a Phenomenex Kinetex PS C18 100-Å column (2.1 mm × 50 mm, 2.6 µm) and analyzed using SCIEXOS software. 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained on a Bruker Avance DMX 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with cryogenic probe (Rockefeller University) and all spectra were analyzed using MestRe Nova software.

Linear peptides were synthesized using standard Fmoc-based solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) methods. 2-Chlorotritylchloride resin (0.1 mmol) was swollen in dichloromethane (DCM) at room temperature for 30 min. After draining, the resin was washed with DCM (three washes, 5 ml each). The C-terminal Fmoc-protected amino acid (four equivalents, 0.4 mmol) was dissolved in 5 ml of DCM and treated with N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA; five equivalents, 0.5 mmol). This mixture was added to the swollen resin and agitated for 1 h. The solution was drained and the resin was washed with DCM (three washes, 5 ml each). The resin was then capped by treatment with a 17:2:1 mixture of DCM, methanol and DIPEA. The resin was agitated for 30 min, drained and washed with DCM (three washes, 5 ml each) and dimethylformamide (DMF; three washes, 5 ml each). For peptide couplings, the Fmoc group was removed by treating the resin with 20% piperidine in 5 ml of DMF for 7 min. The solution was drained, the deprotection reaction was repeated and the resin was washed with DMF (five washes, 5 ml each). The next Fmoc amino acid to be coupled (three equivalents, 0.3 mmol) and hexafluorophosphate azabenzotriazole tetramethyl uronium (HATU; three equivalents, 0.3 mmol) was dissolved in 4 ml of DMF and treated with DIPEA (three equivalents, 0.3 mmol). This solution was added to the resin and agitated for 45 min. The solution was drained and the resin was washed with DMF (three washes, 5 ml each). This deprotection and coupling process was repeated for each subsequent amino acid. Finally, the N-terminal Fmoc amino acid was deprotected with 20% piperidine in DMF (two cycles of 5 ml for 7 min) and reacted with myristic acid (three equivalents, 0.3 mmol), HATU (three equivalents, 0.3 mmol) and DIPEA (three equivalents, 0.3 mmol) in DMF (4 ml). The reaction was agitated for 45 min, at which point the resin was washed with DMF (three washes, 5 ml each) and DCM (three washes, 5 ml each). The peptide was cleaved from resin and the side-chain-protecting groups were removed by treating the resin with a trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) cleavage cocktail containing 95% TFA, 2.5% water and 2.5% triisopropylsilane for 2 h. The solution was evaporated under air flow and the resulting residue was purified on a CombiFlash EZ Prep system (30-g HP C18 column, water–acetonitrile with 0.1% v/v formic acid 5%–95%).

Peptides cyclized through the side chain of an amino acid were synthesized starting from the penultimate amino acid following the same Fmoc SPPS loading, Fmoc deprotection and coupling procedures described above. Side-chain serine and threonine residues at which cyclization was predicted to occur were added to the peptide with the side chain unprotected. After the N-terminal amino acid was deprotected, myristic acid was coupled to the terminal amine as described above (for peptides not predicted to have a lipid tail, the Boc-protected N-terminal amino acid was coupled). Next, the C-terminal amino acid was esterified onto the free serine or threonine side chain by adding a solution of Fmoc amino acid (15 equivalents, 1.5 mmol), N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC; 15 equivalents, 1.5 mmol) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP; 0.5 equivalents, 0.05 mmol) in 5 ml of DMF to the resin and agitating for 16 h. The solution was drained and the resin was washed with DMF (three washes, 5 ml each) and DCM (three washes, 5 ml each), followed by deprotection of the Fmoc group using 20% piperidine in DMF (two cycles of 5 ml for 7 min). The linear precursor peptide was gently cleaved from resin by treating with a solution of 20% hexafluoroisopropanol in 6 ml of DCM for 45 min. The solution was collected and the process repeated once more. After removal of solvent under air flow, the resulting peptide was dissolved in DMF (50 ml, 0.002 M) and treated with (7-azabenzotriazol-1-yloxy)tripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (seven equivalents, 0.7 mmol) and DIPEA (30 equivalents, 3 mmol). After stirring for 2 h, the solution was diluted with ethyl acetate and washed with brine (three washes, 100 ml each). The organic layer was dried (Na2SO4), filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The resulting cyclic peptide was globally deprotected by treatment with TFA cleavage cocktail for 2 h. After evaporation under air flow, the crude cyclic peptide was purified on a CombiFlash EZ Prep system as described above.

Peptides cyclized through the fatty acid were synthesized starting from the penultimate amino acid residue following the Fmoc SPPS method described above. After synthesis of the linear precursor was completed, the N-terminal Fmoc group was removed using 20% piperidine in DMF (two cycles of 5 ml for 7 min) and reacted with (±)-3-hydroxymyristic acid (three equivalents, 0.3 mmol), HATU (three equivalents, 0.3 mmol) and DIPEA (three equivalents, 0.3 mmol) in DMF (4 ml). The reaction was agitated for 45 min, at which point the resin was washed with DMF (three washes, 5 ml each) and DCM (three washes, 5 ml each). Next, the C-terminal amino acid was esterified onto the hydroxyl group of the fatty acid by adding a solution of Fmoc amino acid (15 equivalents, 1.5 mmol), DIC (15 equivalents, 1.5 mmol) and DMAP (0.5 equivalents, 0.05 mmol) in 5 ml of DMF to the resin and agitating for 16 h. The solution was drained and the resin was washed with DMF (three washes, 5 ml each) and DCM (three washes, 5 ml each), followed by deprotection of the Fmoc group using 20% piperidine in DMF (two cycles of 5 ml for 7 min). The linear precursor was cleaved from resin, cyclized, deprotected and purified as described above.

Successful peptide synthesis was confirmed by UPLC, HRMS and/or NMR (Supplementary Table 15 and Supplementary Figs. 6–9). All compounds that displayed antibacterial activity were confirmed to have >95% purity.

To avoid solubility issues, each synBNP concentration was prepared individually in DMSO before addition to LB. A series of eight concentrations were tested, with the last one being a DMSO only control. First, the synBNP was diluted to 3.2 mg ml−1 in DMSO and then serially diluted twofold six times in DMSO. Then, 4 µl of each concentration was added to 100 µl of LB dispensed across a 96-well plate (Costar, 3370). Test bacteria were grown overnight shaking at 200 rpm at 30 °C and the culture was diluted to an OD600 of 0.005. Next, 100 µl of the dilution was added to the antibiotic dilution series, yielding a test range of 64 to 1 µg ml−1 along with a control (0 µg ml−1). The plate was then incubated statically at 30 °C for 18 h, followed by visual inspection. The MIC was determined as the lowest concentration within the dilution series that did not exhibit turbidity. MICs were determined by two biologically independent replicates for the initial synBNP screen and three independent replicates for all other determinations.

The inhibitory activity of synBNPs was assessed using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay66. HEK239 and HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 µg ml−1 penicillin–streptomycin, 2 µM glutamine and nonessential amino acids. Cells were passaged and seeded in 96-well plates at the exponential growth phase, inoculated at ~1 × 105 cells per ml and maintaining a cell density below 1 × 106 cells per ml. The plates were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. All assays were performed using 5,000 cells per well, with 50 µl of a homogeneous cell suspension at 1 × 105 cells per ml seeded in each well. For screening, synBNPs were diluted to 6.4 µg ml−1 in DMSO to prepare a 200× stock solution. For the high-concentration assays (32 µg ml−1), 1.5 µl of synBNP stocks were used to prepare a master solution by dilution in 150 µl of DMEM without phenol red. Two 50-µl aliquots of the master solution were added to cell-seeded plates, obtaining duplicate 100-µl wells with synBNPs at 32 µg ml−1 (0.5% DMSO). For the low concentrations (3.2 µg ml−1), 15 µl of the master solution was diluted to 150 µl with DMEM and 50 µl was added to cell-seeded plates to obtain duplicate wells of 100 µl at 3.2 µg ml−1 (0.05% DMSO). DMEM solutions containing 0.5% and 0.05% DMSO were used as vehicle controls to define 100% cell viability. Camptothecin at 40 µg ml−1 was used as a positive control to define 0% cell viability. After treatment, plates were incubated for 48 h followed by addition of 10 µl of 5 mg ml−1 MTT solution in DPBS and the plate was incubated for an additional 4 h (SK-N-SH was incubated for 5–6 h). After incubation, 90 µl of solubilization solution (40% DMF, 16% SDS and 2% acetic acid) was added to each well and formazan crystals were allowed to dissolve overnight. The absorbance of each well was measured at 570 nm using a TECAN Infinite M NANO+. Absorbance values were normalized to the positive and negative controls and percentage survival values were calculated.

S. aureus SH1000 was streaked onto a LB agar plate and incubated overnight at 30 °C. Three independent colonies were then inoculated into 3 ml of LB and grown overnight at 30 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. The cultures were diluted 1:100 and grown at 30 °C and 200 rpm until they reached an OD600 between 0.4 and 0.6. The growing cultures were then diluted into a preprepared series of 3 ml of LB containing the indicated antibiotic concentrations to ~6 × 106 colony-forming units (cfu) per ml using the expectation that 1 OD600 of S. aureus contained 5 × 108 cfu per ml. When a series was inoculated, a 100-µl sample was taken, representing 1 min of treatment. The cultures were then placed shaking at 200 rpm and 30 °C and samples were taken at 10 min, 30 min, 1 h and then every subsequent hour for a total of 6 h. For cfu quantification, 100-µl samples were placed immediately into the top well of a 96-well plate and serially diluted tenfold (20 µl into 180 µl of LB) down to 10−7. Then, 6 µl of each dilution from the series was spotted onto LB agar, the spots were air-dried and the plate was incubated overnight at 30 °C. Resulting colonies were enumerated to calculate the cfu per ml.

S. aureus SH1000 was streaked onto an LB agar plate and incubated overnight at 30 °C. A single colony was inoculated into 3 ml of LB and grown to confluence overnight at 30 °C. The culture was then diluted to roughly 1 × 107 cells per ml in LB containing antibiotic at 8× MIC. Five 96-well plates were then seeded with 100 µl of the dilution and grown stationary overnight at 30 °C. Mutants appeared as small colonies at the bottom of the well and were picked into fresh 8× MIC medium to ensure resistance. The confirmation culture was then streaked onto LB agar and incubated overnight at 30 °C; two colonies per mutant were inoculated for an overnight culture in LB at 30 °C. The MIC of each mutant was checked to confirm resistance. For erutamicin, no resistant colonies appeared and the direct plating was repeated at 4× and 2× MIC concentrations, which also did not produce resistant mutants.

S. aureus SH1000 and A. baumannii ATCC 17978 were streaked onto LB agar and incubated overnight at 30 °C. Three independent colonies for each of the bacteria were then inoculated into 3 ml of LB and grown overnight at 30 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. The cultures were used to prepare a MIC assay as described above with the indicated antibiotics. The following day, 1 µl was taken from the well containing the highest concentration of antibiotic exhibiting turbid growth and mixed into 1 ml of fresh LB. This dilution was used to seed a new MIC assay. This was repeated for each subsequent day and the change in MIC was plotted.

Genomic DNA from resistant mutants was extracted for sequencing using the PureLink microbiome DNA purification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) per the manufacturer's instructions. Isolated DNA was then Illumina-sequenced using standard Nextera preparation and the MiSeq reagent kit v3 with 2× 300-bp reads. Reads for both parent and mutants were mapped to a reference genome using minimap2 (version 2.28-r1209)67. Changes detected in the parent strain were eliminated from consideration and mutations were uncovered using snippy (https://github.com/tseemann/snippy).

The clpX gene was amplified from S. aureus SH1000 genomic DNA by PCR using the primers ClpXF (TATTACTCGAGATGTTTAAATTCAATGAAGATGAAG) and ClpXR (TAATAGGATCCACATCAATGATTAAGCTGATG). The pET19b (Sigma) vector backbone was amplified by 19BF (TAATAGGATCCGAAAGGAAGCTGAGTTGG) and 19BR (TATTACTCGAGCATATGCTTGTCGTCGTCGTC). The two PCR products were then digested with XhoI and BamHI and ligated together; the ligation reaction was transformed into E. coli EPI300 for colony screening on LB agar plates containing 100 µg ml−1 carbapenem. The successful construction of the ClpX expression vector pHisClpX (which added a 10× His tag to the N terminus of ClpX) was confirmed by Sanger sequencing performed by Genewiz using the universal T7 primer.

The pHisClpX vector was transformed into E. coli Rosetta 2(DE3) (Sigma) and a single colony was inoculated into 5 ml of LB containing carbapenem to grow overnight at 37 °C and 200-rpm shaking. The overnight culture was then added to 1 L of LB + carbapenem prewarmed to 37 °C and grown at 37 °C and 200-rpm shaking until an OD600 of 0.2–0.4. Once the desired OD range was achieved, the culture was transferred to 16 °C and 200-rpm shaking for 30 min, after which IPTG was added to 1 mM to induce protein expression, which continued overnight at 16 °C and 200 rpm. The culture was pelleted by centrifugation at 4,000g for 45 min and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of protein lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 0.1 mM EDTA and 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol). The suspension was sonicated using a Fisherbrand sonicator for a total of 7.5 min of sonication time, with 45 s on and 45 s off at 45% amplitude. The sonicated suspension was then centrifuged at 4,000g for 30 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 23,000g for an additional 30 min. The His-tagged ClpX was isolated from the cleared supernatant using Ni-NTA agarose (Quiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, a column containing 2 ml of Ni-NTA was washed with 20 ml of protein lysis buffer, followed by passage of the cleared lysate. Bound ClpX was then washed with 20 ml of increasing concentrations of imidazole in protein lysis buffer (10 mM, 20 mM and 30 mM), followed by elution with protein lysis buffer containing 250 mM imidazole, while collecting 0.5-ml fractions. The protein content in the eluted fractions was checked by absorbance at 280 nm, with any fractions at an OD > 0.6 pooled together. About 1 ml of the pooled fractions were then dialyzed (MWCO: 12,000–14,000 kDa; Spectra/Por) against 1 L of protein storage buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 200 mM KCl, 25 mM MgCl2, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 10% glycerol) for 3 h at 4 °C, followed by an additional dialysis against 3 L of protein storage buffer overnight. The protein concentration was then determined to be 5.83 mg ml−1 (117 µM) by spectroscopy at 280 nm with the calculation of 1 OD corresponding to 3.69 mg ml−1 of His-ClpX. A sample (50 ml) of the 3-L storage buffer after dialysis was saved for resuspending trigintamicin and its isomer for ITC.

ITC measurements were carried out at 25 °C using a Malvern ITC PEAQ system. The ligands (trigintamicin and its biologically inactive isoform) were dissolved in storage buffer taken post dialysis of ClpX. The concentration of ClpX was adjusted to ~30 μM and the ligand concentrations were adjusted to ~300 μM using the postdialysis storage buffer batch. Then, 300 μl of ClpX solution was placed in the sample cell and titrated by ligand solution through 19 successive injections of 2 μl with a 2.5-min interval between injections and a reference power of 5 μcal s−1. Titration data were analyzed using the PEAQ-ITC analysis software (version 1.41). The isotherm curves were best fitted to a single-site binding model.

An overnight culture of S. aureus SH1000 was pelleted, washed twice in equal volume of DPBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and diluted to 0.35 OD600 in DPBS. Then, 100 µl of the dilution was added to 300 µl of DPBS, followed by the addition of 50 µl of 20 µM DISC3(5) dye in DPBS. The mixture was incubated at room temperature in the dark for 15 min, followed by the addition of 50 µl of 2 M KCl and another 15-min incubation. The samples were then transferred into a 384-well flat, clear-bottom black microtiter plate with 30 µl per well. The initial fluorescence intensity of each well was recorded using a TECAN Infinite M NANO+ (excitation, 620 nm; emission, 675 nm) at 10-s intervals until the baseline stabilized. After signal stabilization, 30 µl of test compounds diluted in DPBS were added to the indicated concentrations and readings resumed. Gramicidin at 16 µg ml−1 (2× MIC) was used as a positive control for depolarization.

Test lipids were dissolved in the manufacturer's recommended solvent to 0.5–1 mg ml−1. An aliquot containing the appropriate amount of lipid for the desired molar ratio to a target antibiotic was transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf and dried under vacuum for 1 h. The dried pellet was then resuspended by pipetting with 6 µl of the test antibiotic dissolved in ethanol at 1.28 µg ml−1. The suspension was then topped up with 114 µl of LB and the sample was mixed by pipetting. Then, 100 µl was transferred to a 96-well assay plate and 50 µl was transferred down a column to generate a 1:2 dilution series. An overnight culture of S. aureus SH1000 was diluted 1:1,000 into LB and 50 µl was added to the dilution series to generate a final antibiotic concentration range of 0.25 to 32 µg ml−1. The plate was then incubated overnight at 30 °C for 18 h, after which growth was visually inspected. For experiments with telomycin and daptomycin, all LB was supplemented with Ca2+ to 50 mg L−1 (183 mg L−1 CaCl2).

As US and Chinese technology firms have competed in the race to be innovators in artificial intelligence (AI), Europe has fallen behind. But on 5 September, a European supercomputer called JUPITER officially reached the exascale threshold, a milestone in computing power. The device could boost European research.

JUPITER is the fourth-fastest computer in the world. Having surpassed one quintillion (1018) operations a second, it joins an exclusive league of exascale supercomputers. According to the European Union, it is also 100% powered by renewable energy, and ranks first in energy efficiency among supercomputers.

JUPITER's computational speed serves its main purpose — to push the capabilities of research in areas such as AI, weather modelling, astrophysics and biomedical research. It gives researchers in Europe access to their own top-level supercomputer, rather than having to rely on machines in the United States and elsewhere.

The milestone is “absolutely” a big deal for Europe, says Kirk Cameron, a computer scientist at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) in Blacksburg, particularly with regards to AI and large language models (LLMs). “There's this race going on in the world of who will be the innovators in AI,” he says. “It's taken a little bit to get [Europe] into the race. So it's really nice to see them making that progress.”

Nature examines what JUPITER can actually do, and what it will be used for.

JUPITER, which stands for Joint Undertaking Pioneer for Innovative and Transformative Exascale Research, has been in development since 2018, with the explicit aim of giving Europe a foothold in the supercomputer race taking place around the world. Funded by the European Commission and EU member Germany, it is located at the Jülich science research centre in Germany.

JUPITER booted up and performed its first computations in July, says Thomas Lippert, the project lead on JUPITER at Jülich. Running on some 24,000 NVIDIA chips, JUPITER is capable of exceeding 1,000 petaflops — one exaflop, or one million trillion operations per second — at its peak performance. For comparison, a typical laptop operates at one teraflop, or one trillion calculations per second.

Officially, JUPITER is the fourth-fastest supercomputer in the world, with a benchmark performance of about 800 petaflops, after the United States' El Capitan (1.7 exaflops), Frontier (1.35 exaflops) and Aurora (1 exaflop).

Lippert says that having a supercomputer such as JUPITER will enable Europe to develop the talent necessary to build and operate such machines in the future. “Our economy and welfare depend on these technologies,” he says.

The EU says that JUPITER “runs entirely on renewable energy” to limit its impact on the environment. Lippert says that this is achieved by paying to use only renewable energy from Germany's national grid.

When it is running at full load, JUPITER will use 17 megawatts of power, which is equivalent to powering about 11,000 homes. Cameron says such supercomputers can be extremely power-hungry and cause problems. “You're competing with cities for power,” he says. “These things start to impact the infrastructure of communities around these areas.”

Researchers will be able to apply to use the supercomputer up to twice a year, and 30 projects have already been selected. These include research on AI applications, such as foundation models and video generation, climate models, particle physics, energy applications and biomedical research for drug development and disease control.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","Favored Google Search Results Can Cost Consumers Cash","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/favored-google-search-results-can-cost-consumers-cash-179905.html","Fri, 12 Sep 2025 05:15:36 GMT","

In most cases, a misleading result from a Google search is harmless, but a case study by a consumer financial information website released Monday shows how those results can cause economic harm to searchers.

In its study, WalletHub did a Google search for “best 0 APR credit cards.” Here's what it found:

“Google results have gone so far downhill, they're practically underwater, and it's costing people a lot of time and money — especially those who mistakenly believe the top results are still the best results,” WalletHub CEO Odysseas Papadimitriou said in a statement.

Although the case study has a narrow focus, WalletHub Managing Editor John S. Kiernan contended it's a microcosm of a much larger issue. Determining the quality of search results can be subjective, so it's hard to see what Google is getting right and wrong, he explained. “That's why we chose this particular example, because it's pretty straightforward,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“But we definitely think that this is an issue that is happening across search results and across the verticals and segments of the market,” he said. “It's by no means limited to your APR credit cards.”

“This is an example of how Google has let down the consumer,” he added.

Kiernan maintained that there has been a decline in the quality of Google search results for the last two years. “The landmark event that led to this was when Google's CEO decided to put the head of the ad team in charge of Google Search, also. Previously, there was a kind of church and state separation there,” he explained.

“When they put those two teams together, it seems like the faction that really wants to go about maximizing clicks and ad revenue is blending out of the faction that wants to have the best possible results for consumers,” he added.

“This so-called ‘analysis' is based on flawed methodologies and recycled claims,” Google spokesperson Davis Thompson told TechNewsWorld. “Our systems work to connect people with content that is useful and original, from a diverse range of sites across the web, so that they're able to make informed decisions.”

According to Google, its research shows that its search engine satisfies the overwhelming majority of user needs for people around the world, and it launches thousands of improvements every year to make it even better for people.

It added that for “Your Money or Your Life” queries — where information quality is critically important, like financial queries — it has an even higher bar for showing supporting information from reliable and trustworthy sources.

“From a consumer perspective, Google's search results seem to have lost value,” said Danny Goodwin, managing editor of Search Engine Land & SMX, a digital marketing and advertising technology publication.

“Users are forced to wade through more ads before even seeing organic results, and too often they still struggle to find the right answer or website,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“Google boasts that searches are increasing — but that may reflect people digging deeper because they can't find what they need right away,” he added.

There seems to be mixed perceptions about the quality of Google search results, noted Greg Sterling, co-founder of Near Media, a market research firm, in San Francisco. “Many industry insiders perceive a decline in search quality, but that's not necessarily true of the general public,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“But I do believe that the quality of Google results and the user experience have declined,” he said. “Google is largely focused on maximizing ad revenue, retaining users, and fending off competitors by copying or incorporating features into search.”

Jared Navarre, founder of Keyni Consulting, a business consulting company in Wasilla, Alaska, argued that not only has there been a decline in the quality of Google search results, but a potential sharp cliff for them may be on the horizon.

“There are many metrics outlining that search referrals from Google are falling,” he told TechNewsWorld. “I think the bigger story here is the double-edged sword of Google's AI initiative and how it's been implemented into search.”

“Users will often see a consolidated answer to their search query at the top of the page,” he explained. “This alone eliminates the past standard practice of needing to click through a few of the top sites to find what you're looking for.”

“On top of that,” he continued, “search volume is down globally. AI is rapidly changing how information is searched for, delivered, and interacted with. No one quite knows how this will look in a year's time, but the Google we once knew may become an afterthought.”

He added that there may be a ray of hope for consumers from the recent antitrust decision against Google. In the Sept. 2 opinion by U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta, Google was found to have illegally monopolized online search through exclusive distribution deals.

“[The decision] didn't block default search placement deals or require any divestment of Chrome, but requiring Google to share search index data with competitors alone could have some small wins for consumers and users,” Navarre said, “but I don't foresee any fundamental change without dismantling some of the exclusive deals and Google's deep integration, but it's a start.”

Some other search watchers were less sanguine about the impact of the antitrust decision. “I think it's probably most likely to make things worse,” WalletHub's Kiernan said. “I think Google feels like they got off scot-free for the most part.”

“I would imagine they're feeling a little bit emboldened that they can continue their current practices and even take them to the next level a little bit,” he added.

Search Engine Land's Goodwin explained that the antitrust ruling has nothing to do with search quality. “It's about Google's business practices and market dominance, not how results are ranked,” he said. “The only way Google search results will improve is if the search team makes it happen, or if Google's AI and machine-learning systems get better at what results users see.”

“The remedies decision, which still may be overturned on appeal, is relatively weak and will do little or nothing to boost competition or force Google to improve results,” added Near Media's Sterling.

Despite criticism of Google's search results, it remains the king of internet ferrets — with no challenger in sight.

Habit and ubiquity are two drivers of users' loyalty to Google, Sterling argued. “Google was the best search engine and, in some ways, may still be,” he said, “but most people continue to use Google out of habit and because it's everywhere you turn: the iPhone and the most popular browser. People are comfortable and familiar with Google. Change is possible — see ChatGPT — but there's tremendous inertia around Google usage.”

“Google dominates because it's the default,” Goodwin asserted. “Its technology and products are deeply integrated into people's lives, and it's still ‘good enough' for the average person. That won't change unless a competitor delivers a much better experience, as it seems like U.S. regulators will be unable to make it easier for alternatives to compete.”

“Only truly disruptive AI-fueled software or an AI-powered device would be able to do anything more than slowly chip away at Google's market share,” Keyni's Navarre added. “I think we are watching that happen, but, ironically, I think Google's own AI initiatives could end up having as much impact on its own market share versus external competitors. Only time will tell.”

WalletHub's study breaks down how much consumers could lose by relying on Google's top search results for “best 0% APR credit cards.”

Micro1, a three-year-old startup that helps AI companies find and manage human contractors for data labeling and training, has raised a $35 million Series A funding round that values the company at $500 million. The round was led by O1 Advisors, a venture capital firm co-founded by Dick Costolo and Adam Bain, the former CEO and COO of Twitter.

The startup is one of many companies looking to fill the gap in the data market created by recent changes involving Scale AI. After Meta invested $14 billion in Scale AI and hired its CEO, AI labs including OpenAI and Google said they planned to cut ties with the startup, presumably over concerns that their research could end up in Meta's hands. (Scale AI denies that it shares confidential information with Meta as part of its partnership).

However, AI labs still need these data services, and startups like Micro1 aim to pick up the slack.

Micro1 CEO Ali Ansari — who is just 24 years old — tells TechCrunch that his company has been working with leading AI labs, including Microsoft, as well as several Fortune 100 companies. Ansari said Micro1 is now generating $50 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), up from $7 million at the start of 2025.

That's still a far cry from larger competitors like Mercor, which is generating more than $450 million in ARR, and Surge, which reportedly brought in $1.2 billion in 2024. However, Micro1's growth and adoption among AI labs seems to be growing at a healthy rate.

As part of the new funding, Micro1 is also adding Bain to its board of directors, alongside Joshua Browder, founder and CEO of the AI legal assistant DoNotPay.

“Really the only way models are now learning is through net new human data. Micro1 is at the core of providing that data to all frontier labs, while moving at speeds I've never seen before,” Bain said in a statement to TechCrunch.

Reuters previously reported details of Micro1's fundraising efforts.

All these companies — Micro1, Surge, Mercor, and Scale AI — supply AI labs with access to a large base of human contractors who can label and generate data for AI training. It's become a crucial service that companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Google need to build cutting edge AI models.

Scale AI was first to dominate this space, with the initial insight that it could pay relatively little for low-skilled contractors around the world to help label data for AI model training. However, Ansari says that the demands of AI labs have shifted in recent years, and that companies now need high-quality data labeling from domain experts — such as senior software engineers, doctors, and professional writers — to improve their AI models. The hard part became recruiting these types of folks.

This led Micro1 to build its AI recruiter, Zara, which interviews and vets candidates who apply to work as one of company's contractors, or as Ansari calls them, experts. Micro1 says Zara has recruited thousands of experts — including professors from Stanford and Harvard — and that the company plans to add hundreds more every week.

The market for AI training data appears to be changing yet again. Now, many AI labs are interested in working with startups to develop “environments” — virtual workspaces that can be used to train AI agents on simulated tasks. Ansari says Micro1 is building new offerings in the environments space to meet this demand.

Luckily for startups like Micro1, AI labs seem to be working with multiple training data providers. The nature of the business is such that it's difficult for any one company to handle all of one AI lab's data needs. That means there's plenty of business to go around, at least, for now.

Maybe not impossible using shared/lossy storage if they were sparsely scattered over a large space ?But anyways - minutes. Thanks.Edit: Gemini suggested that this sort of (lossy) storage size could be achieved using ""Product Quantization"" (sub vectors, clustering, cluster indices), giving an example of 256 dimensional vectors being stored at an average of 6 bits per vector, with ANN being one application that might use this.

Beijing is souring on Nvidia.

China, which used to be one of Nvidia's largest markets, seems largely conflicted about reaccepting Nvidia's lower-tech H20 chips that Trump administration finally allowed to resume sales of in July. The Chinese tech industry might be excited about the Nvidia chip flow resuming, but the government is allegedly not.

Chinese authorities have discouraged local tech companies from purchasing Nvidia chips citing national security concerns, and even questioned industry titans like Tencent over their purchases of Nvidia chips, according to Reuters.

In response, tech giants like Alibaba and Baidu have begun using their own chips to train smaller AI models, the Information reported on Thursday, but they will reportedly continue to use some Nvidia chips.

“The competition has undeniably arrived,” an Nvidia spokesperson told Gizmodo. “Customers will choose the best technology stack for running the world's most popular commercial applications and open-source models. We'll continue to work to earn the trust and support of mainstream developers everywhere.”

Chinese development is ramping up. China chip stocks have experienced a major boom so big that the Beijing-based company Cambricon had to warn investors recently. Tech giants like Huawei and Alibaba are leading the push, but smaller companies are also making strides. 

Shanghai-based tech company MetaX told the Wall Street Journal last month that it's preparing to start mass production of a new chip that has bigger memory than Nvidia's H20.

Still, largely no chip offering so far has been considered completely up to par with Nvidia's best offerings. Reuters reported last week that top Chinese tech firms like Alibaba and ByteDance are still very keen to get their hands on Nvidia chips. That's despite the fact that the Nvidia chips that are being sold to China are downgraded versions of existing models, developed to abide by U.S. exports restrictions.

Some experts in Washington think any supply of American tech to China has sizable national security risks attached to it. They also claim the chips can assist China in outpacing American AI innovation.

The Biden administration was first to enforce export restrictions on Nvidia chips sold to China, in an effort to curb the entry of high-tech chips into China off of those fears.

Beijing landed a particularly big blow to domestic AI confidence earlier this year with Deepseek's R1, an AI model that rivaled the best of American companies offerings using lower cost chips, inadvertently showing Americans that Chinese innovation did not require the top Nvidia chips.

That fueled the blanket ban decision which turned out to be less effective than expected when a Financial Times report found that Nvidia's highest tech chips were being smuggled into China in the absence of the lower tech H20s. 

The decision was also a big hit to Nvidia: executives shared in a May earnings call that they had to revise revenue expectations down for the quarter by about $8 billion due to the restrictions.

After an intense lobbying effort by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Trump reversed his decision in July, allowing H20 chips sales to China. In exchange, Trump demanded that Nvidia, and fellow American chipmaker AMD, both give the U.S. government a 15% cut of all of their chips revenue in China.

Just when Nvidia thought all was finally well, Beijing started raising concerns about the new Nvidia chips coming into China having kill switches and backdoors, urging Chinese companies to not use them. Nvidia has denied the claim.

The remaining political uncertainty has continued to cast a shadow on Nvidia's performance in China. The company conceded in its latest earnings call that they were facing disappointing numbers from the region still and were yet to begin H20 shipments.

China has a long relationship with Nvidia. The downturn in that relationship began after the first export restrictions went into effect, ramped up after an antitrust probe in December and has developed a life of its own under Trump's trade war. 

Chinese officials have voiced security concerns related to the latest round of chips set to enter the country, but this attitude change has less to do with Nvidia itself and more about China's own chip industry.

Chinese AI industry is currently dependent on American chipmakers like Nvidia, and that gives Americans an edge. In the absence of Nvidia chips, China will have to develop their own high-tech chips that can rival and even surpass the quality of Nvidia chips. If that happens, the United States can be at jeopardy to lose its hold on the global chips demand, and China is the runner-up.

The country is making a big bet on AI, announcing an $8.2 billion AI-investment fund earlier this year, in an effort to spur innovation and reach independence. 

“It's unfortunate to see that we in Asia, including China, are emulating the U.S. when it comes to developing algorithms and large models,” Wei Shaojun, an adviser to senior Chinese government officials and a professor at top Beijing university Tsinghua University told a forum in Singapore on Thursday. He warned that staying on this path of dependence could be “lethal” for the region, according to Bloomberg.

Along with the chips push, the country has increasingly emphasized global cooperation in AI, and center to that initiative is Beijing's desire to cement itself at the center of the global AI trade. 

It seems China is coming to terms with the fact that aspiration won't be achievable as long as the industry is dependent on the U.S. for chips, especially when Washington has demonstrated that its trade policy decisions are volatile.

The next time someone tells you the youth aren't engaged enough in politics, just point them to Nepal. According to multiple reports, the youth of the South Asian nation managed to oust the existing government following an attempted ban of major social media platforms and took to Discord to hold an impromptu convention to elect an interim prime minister.

Earlier this week, demonstrations led primarily by students and youth groups took to the streets of Nepal to protest the decision of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli to ban operations of social platforms (including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube, and Twitter) in the country after accusing the companies of failing to appoint liaisons to hear the demands of the Nepali government. Some citizens of the country believe the crackdown came for another reason, though: social media had become a primary source of directing discontent at the current administration, including a recent “Nepo Kid” campaign that alleged corruption throughout the government, highlighted by the lavish lifestyles of the children of elected officials.

Those demonstrations quickly turned violent, as Nepali police killed at least 19 anti-corruption protesters. The demonstrators responded by setting government buildings on fire, including the prime minister's office. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Oli resigned and fled the country. With the military in charge and imposing strict crackdowns on gatherings, the youth of Nepal reportedly took to Discord, according to the New York Times, to organize.

A server set up to act as a digital convention space attracted more than 100,000 users, organized by a civic group known as Hami Nepal and dominated by activists who spearheaded and took part in the demonstrations that ultimately led to the ouster of the former prime minister. Within the server, discussions as to who the group wants to lead the country have taken place. Per the Times, the Discord server has hosted conversations with candidates for the role, and members have voted on the platform for their choice: Sushila Karki, a former chief justice and well-known anti-corruption crusader within the country.

The organizing appears to have worked. On Friday, the military accepted the recommendation of the protest group and named Karki the interim prime minister. Karki, who accepted the role, is expected to pick a new cabinet and eventually hold elections. According to the Times, that is expected to happen within the next six months or so.

Gizmodo reached out to Discord for comment on the situation, but did not receive a response at the time of publication.

Testing shows Cyberpunk 2077 running over an hour longer after the upgrade

With only a few months since its launch, the modding community has already started tinkering with the Switch 2 and has come up with a practical solution to battery life issues. A YouTube video posted by user naga shows the entire process of replacing the stock 5,220mAh battery with a higher-capacity 8,000mAh unit to extend the console's battery life. Interestingly, such replacement batteries are being sold for under $40 on Goofish, an international online marketplace owned by the Alibaba Group.

The Nintendo Switch 2 launched with relevant upgrades over its predecessor, including a faster processor along with a bigger and brighter 7.9-inch 120 Hz LCD display. It also features an updated design with larger and sturdier Joy-Con controllers that improve the overall experience of the device. The company also included a larger battery this time, promising longer playtime sessions when you are on the go. However, in our testing, we found that the bump in battery life isn't as impressive, making it one of the few areas where the Switch 2 falls short.

The modder dismantled the console by removing all screws and carefully taking off the backplate and the metal shield covering the internals. After disconnecting the battery and various cables, they applied isopropyl alcohol to dissolve the adhesive beneath the battery. Using pry tools, the stock unit is lifted out along with any remaining glue.

Since the replacement battery is larger, the metal frame that holds it is trimmed down to create extra space. The metal shield is also modified to fit the 8,000mAh battery. Once everything is reassembled, the backplate snaps back into place without any issues.

There's no clear data on the overall increase in runtime with the larger battery, but the modder does note that Cyberpunk 2077 running at 40 Hz gained over an hour of playtime, jumping from 2 hours 18 minutes to 3 hours 25 minutes. That's a substantial improvement and should translate to even better results in less demanding games.

While the mod is certainly enticing, it's not recommended unless you have prior experience handling delicate electronics. Opening up the console will void the warranty, and since the replacement battery isn't verified by Nintendo, it could impact both performance and long-term stability.

An air combat sim enthusiast just built a “realistic” fighter jet cockpit that goes way beyond simulating motion. u/Ok_But_1351 shared the video on Reddit from the Chinese platform bilibili, allegedly documenting a project from the same person who built this wild three-person World of Tanks sim rig. However, the video shows a different username, so we're unsure if this is accurate. Nevertheless, the sim rig is quite impressive, even though it doesn't look anywhere near a real fighter jet.

The fighter jet sim rig features a three-axis motion seat that simulates the motion of the game running on the screen. While it can't fully mimic the 360-degree motion you'd get while doing aerobatics in an aircraft, it's still way ahead of just sitting stationary on the floor. The creator didn't stop there, though. They also added an “Energy Management System” that accepts a container that seemingly serves as the fuel tank for the chair's afterburner. When you push the throttle to its limits, two nozzles on the lower left and right of the seat spew flames, like how a real jet would do so when going to max power.

Naturally, there's also what looks to be a pneumatic cannon that flashes whenever the pilot fires the in-game gun, and a rocket pod that shoots fireworks when launching missiles. And when you fire off chaff and flares to evade missiles, the sim rig does the same, filling the room with aluminum strips.

This is quite an effort for one session, especially as you can imagine that all of these must be reloaded after every use. There were also a few people saying that there's only one display, and that it isn't mounted directly on the chair, so the player cannot see the display when they're pulling up. Nevertheless, this could just be an initial concept, just like how the tank sim rig was first built with separate physical controls spread around in a room.

Aside from using a triple-monitor setup and mounting them directly to the seat, the creator could also add improvements to make the experience more realistic. For example, they can use a VR or AR headset for full visual immersion, or they can use TrackIR so that the screens will show what they're supposed to see when they move their head. It would've also been nice to use realistic aircraft control panels instead of the custom-made ones we see in the video. Most importantly, they should double-check the safety of their system, as we see the “Energy Management System” spew flames out the back, followed by the player spraying it with their fire extinguisher.

 September 12, 2025  

SCOTTSDALE, AZ — While most of the research on the role of GLP-1 receptor agonists (RAs) in thyroid cancer has focused on their potential to trigger such cancer, new research found that among patients with existing differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), treatment with GLP-1 RAs did not increase the risk of recurrence or progression.

“We evaluated for the first time the association between GLP-1 RA exposure and risk of thyroid cancer recurrence/progression on a population with a prior or current diagnosis of differentiated thyroid cancer,” first author Armando Patrizio, MD, of Pisa University Hospital in Italy, told Medscape Medical News. 

“We did not find a significant association between GLP-1 RAs and recurrent/progressive DTC, so based on the current evidence, these drugs should not be denied in patients with obesity and/or diabetes when they are clinically indicated,” he said of the study, which was presented at the 2025 American Thyroid Association (ATA) Annual Meeting in Scottsdale, Arizona.

The risk of obesity is known to be increased in thyroid cancer, therefore these patients may benefit not only from the weight-loss and diabetes effects of GLP-1 RAs but from the known cardiometabolic and kidney protective attributes.

However, GLP-1s are contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer, despite most evidence on the association derived from mouse studies, and there is also conflicting evidence regarding the effects of the drugs in follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer.

To evaluate the effects of GLP-1 RAs in patients with a previous or active diagnosis of DTC, the most common type of thyroid cancer, Patrizio and colleagues conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study of 536 patients with DTC who had been treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and exposed to GLP-1 RAs between 2005 and 2025.

These patients were matched 1:1 with a control group of 536 patients with DTC who had never been exposed to GLP-1 RAs. The patient pairs were matched based on date of DTC diagnosis, tumor stage, BMI, and diabetes status.

In the combined cohort of 1072 patients, the median age was 49, and 71% were female. The patients had a mean BMI of 35; 54% had diabetes.

The majority (84%) had stage 1 disease, and 58% were of ATA intermediate or high risk for structural recurrence.

The median exposure to GLP-1 RAs was 16 months, and 61% of patients received therapy for more than a year. 

With patients being followed for a median of 68 months, a univariate analysis showed no significant association between GLP-1 RAs and an increased risk of disease recurrence or progression.

A further multivariate analysis showed a trend toward a reduced risk of recurrence or progression (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73), after adjusting for age, tumor size, lymph node metastasis, radioactive iodine therapy, and diabetes.

Key factors associated with disease recurrence or progression included ATA high or intermediate risk versus low, treatment with radioiodine therapy, and age over 55 (all P < .0001).

Patrizio noted that the findings are consistent with what has been observed in the clinical setting.

“In practice, we do not find evident progression of disease among patients exposed to GLP-1 RAs, so it was not surprising to find no significant association between the drugs and recurrence or progression of well-differentiated thyroid cancer.”

He added that the trend of a decreased risk of recurrence or progression observed should be interpreted with caution, “because we did not find a significant association of GLP-1RA with recurrence or progression of disease in sensitivity analyses comparing pairs of patients exposed and not exposed to GLP-1RAs with the same duration of follow-up.” 

Commenting on the current study, Ashish Chintakuntlawar, MBBS, PhD, a professor of medicine in the Division of Hematology-Medical Oncology at the Mayo Clinic, in Phoenix, commended the study's relatively large number of patients and “excellent design,” noting some key limitations.

“It is heartening to see that these relatively commonly used drugs do not have any detrimental effect on the prognosis of differentiated thyroid cancer,” Chintakuntlawar told Medscape Medical News. “However, I would caution as this is still relatively short follow-up and hence continued monitoring, observation, and continued research on large scale population is required.”

He added that the DTCs included in the study “have excellent prognosis to begin with, and hence any small detrimental effect could get diluted.”

While intriguing, Chintakuntlawar agreed that the finding of a trend toward improved outcomes with GLP-1s “should also be taken with caution, as it is not statistically significant and the study was not designed for it.”

The question of a potential link between GLP-1s and thyroid cancer has prompted a plethora of studies in the years since the drugs exploded onto the market, with findings ranging from one recent meta-analysis showing an odds ratio of 1.55 for an increased thyroid cancer risk, to another study suggesting the potential to lower cancer incidence with GLP-1s, to still another study showing an increased risk — but only in the first year, suggesting the increased reports are likely the result of increased neck ultrasounds among newly prescribed patients, explained Bryan R. Haugen, MD, a professor of medicine and pathology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, in Aurora, in addressing the ongoing issue at the meeting's Year in Review session.

Importantly, many studies have had limitations such as not including patients with medullary thyroid cancer, the rare cancer that is the subject of the FDA warning; not including important design features such as latency assessments or cohorts of patients on tirzepatide, a dual agonist, or the novel drug retatrutide, a triple agonist; and not having long-term follow-up, Haugen noted.

“My summary [of the conflicting evidence] is I think it is unlikely that there is an association between GLP-1 RAs and DTC,” he concluded. As the one study shows, “the early detection of small disease is likely due to [greater ultrasound testing] in some of the patients.” 

Ultimately, “I think the cardiometabolic effects of the drugs far outweigh the potential risks,” he said. 

Patrizio and Chintakuntlawar had no disclosures to report. Haugen is a clinical liaison for ThyroSeq and Sonic Healthcare USA and has received research support from Veracyte.

Emily Keogh talks about USWNT forward Alyssa Thompson's potential move to Chelsea from Angel City. (2:16)

Chelsea head coach Sonia Bompastor is hopeful Alyssa Thompson can make her Women's Super League debut at Aston Villa on Sunday.

United States women's national team winger Thompson signed last week from NWSL side Angel City for a reported $1.3 million, is waiting for WSL approval over a cast she wears to protect her left arm.

The 20-year-old has never revealed exactly why she wears the cast, but Bompastor is confident her new signing will be given the go-ahead in time to feature against Villa.

""We are hoping for her to be able to play. We haven't had confirmation yet, but we are hoping for her to be able to play in this game,"" Bompastor said.

""My staff are trying to bring as much clarity as we can on the situation and they'll be updating me as quick as they can about the cast.""

Bompastor confirmed Sam Kerr could make her first appearance in 20 months off the bench on Sunday having recovered from a serious knee injury.

The Australia striker was an unused substitute in last week's opening-day win against Manchester City, while USWNT centre-back Naomi Girma is still out.

Tottenham Hotspur boss Martin Ho hopes his side can build on a first WSL victory in nine months when they visit his former club Everton.

Disney+ will be the only place football fans can watch all 75 matches live each season. Visit the Disney+ website to get access.

Ho experienced success in his debut fixture in charge with a 1-0 win over West Ham last Sunday, which marked the club's first three points in the division since January.

Liverpool-born Ho, former assistant boss at Everton, said: ""I think there is still a long way for us to go and a lot to build on, but more importantly it was for the players especially because not having a win in nine months is difficult for anyone. That is staff included.

Manchester United will bid to bounce back from their midweek Champions League qualifier defeat to Brann with victory at newly promoted London City.

Marc Skinner's United, who thrashed Leicester 4-0 in their opening game last week, slipped to a 1-0 first-leg defeat in Bergen on Thursday, are in the middle of a hectic schedule of four games in 11 days.

Leicester play their first home league game of the season against Liverpool, who also conceded four goals on the opening day, losing 4-1 at home to Merseyside rivals Everton.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

The world according to Jim:

• Whee! The U.S. men's national team won a soccer friendly the other night, beating Japan 2-0, and all is well. World Cup, here they come!

And if your first response is to yawn, who can blame you? …

• It's a weird run-up to next year's extravaganza, held mostly in this country but co-hosted by Mexico and Canada (and we will refrain, for the time being, from any mention of the geopolitical stresses currently taking place with longtime allies). The host countries are automatically in, so there's no qualifying crucible where guys play their way on (or off) the roster in serious match conditions. …

• Instead we have a selection process that's way too low-key, with a leader in Mauricio Pochettino who I'm not sure understands the soccer culture here or how to work around it. And you have what seems like the same old, same old in the player pool, not exactly confidence inspiring on the brink of a tournament with (so we're told) the potential to change the sport's profile in this country. …

• Right now the USMNT is doing hardly anything to get its fan base excited. Pochettino insists that nothing really matters until the World Cup actually begins – which for the U.S. is June 12 at SoFi Stadium – but his team right now may be worse than the one that got Gregg Berhalter fired after the Copa América in July 2024. And the biggest news story of the past few months involved Christian Pulisic taking time off. …

• This isn't the 1993-94 window, a more innocent time when Our Boys were still a novelty act going into the first U.S.-hosted World Cup after unexpectedly qualifying in 1990, the USA's first berth in 40 years. They were a feel-good story, they reached the Round of 16 by upsetting Colombia at the Rose Bowl – in part because of an Colombian own goal that ultimately got the guy scoring it, Andrés Escobar, shot and killed after returning home – and they made eventual champ Brazil sweat before a 1-0 loss in the knockout round.

And I still second-guess coach Bora Milutinović for essentially playing rope-a-dope with the Brazilians in the second half of that match when his team had a man advantage. …

• Pochettino, the former Chelsea and Paris St. Germain manager, has picked up some of the finer points of the way we do things on this continent. Last week, asked about a particular player's omission from the lineup, he said: “If people want to talk about (fertilizer), they can talk about (fertilizer), but we feel the responsibility to provide (chances for) the whole group of players that we think can be important for this country in the World Cup.”

He didn't actually say (fertilizer), but you get the point. Did he get his hands on some old Tom Lasorda recordings, perhaps? …

• And, of course, Pochettino wasn't happy about playing “home” games with the majority of the crowd rooting for the opponents, which happened last weekend against South Korea and previously during the Gold Cup against Guatemala.

Here's a hint: Play better, create some excitement – and oh, by the way, US Soccer, make ticket prices more consumer-friendly – and your own fan base might respond in kind. …

• Worth noting: Peyton Manning is recruiting Pope Leo XIV to appear on ESPN's ManningCast this season, saying he'd been sending handwritten letters to the Holy Father. Well, gee, if THAT'S all it takes …

• This week's quiz, with a hat tip to reader Ken Rowe: Sandy Koufax (as noted earlier this week) shut out Minnesota in Game 7 of the 1965 World Series. Beyond winning the Dodgers a second championship in three seasons, that game carries another distinction. What is it? …

• Bonus quiz, this one from reader Ruth Stern: Harvey Kuenn made the final out of Koufax's perfect game in 1965. How else are the two linked? Answers to both below. …

• The National League's batting champion this year may not crack .300, which (a) reminds us how much batting average has been devalued as a statistic, and (b) also reminds us of 1968, when Carl Yastrzemski won the AL crown at .301 in The Year of the Pitcher – and the mound was lowered the next season. Any suggestions this offseason? …

• I've got to admit, those “influencers” who appeared on the YouTube stream of last Friday's Chargers-Chiefs game in Brazil (shown here over the air on Channel 4) added something to the broadcast. I still haven't figured out exactly what it was, but whatever. …

• The viewership for that game within the U.S. was 16.2 million, which isn't bad. International viewership was 1.1 million, probably not what Roger Goodell anticipated but not unexpected, either. It's not the world's game yet, Mr. Commissioner. …

• This from the New York Daily News' Mike Lupica: “So wait – Kawhi Leonard has another no-show job besides basketball?” Ouch. …

• St. Louis' loss is L.A.'s gain. The Kings announced their broadcast personnel Thursday and John Kelly, son of legendary Blues play-by-play man Dan Kelly and an awfully talented broadcaster in his own right, will assume the lead play-by-play role vacated by Nick Nickson's retirement.

Right now it's a tossup as to the Kings' best move of the offseason: Kelly in the TV booth or Ken Holland in the general manager's suite. …

• Answer to quiz No. 1: Koufax is the only non-Twins pitcher to win a World Series game in Minnesota. The Twins have been in three World Series, all with the home advantage. They won in 1987 and '91 (both in the Metrodome) and were 11-1 at home over the three series. It took a future Hall of Famer to beat them in '65. …

• And the answer to quiz No. 2: Kuenn also was the final out in Koufax's second no-hitter, against the Giants in May 1963. That time he grounded back to the box.

The experimentation for the United States men's national team is over after a September international window that saw them defeat a rotated Japan side while falling to South Korea. The USMNT did break out a new formation with a back three against Japan, but while that was a positive, it does also lead to more questions about how the USMNT roster will look for the World Cup. A back three could provide defensive cover, but it also means that fewer midfielders are needed as well.

Playing time concerns are still an issue in the squad with members of the side such as Weston McKennie, Yunus Musah, and Gio Reyna not playing consistently for their clubs, but with some key players getting moves to new teams during the summer transfer window, that could change. Even if it doesn't, Pochettino will need to weigh a player's talent and fit in the USMNT with their current form and playing time, which are some of the tough differences between club management and the international game. But as time dwindles before the USMNT kicks off another international break where they'll face Ecuador and Australia in October, let's take a look at predicting the roster as we're less than a year out from the World Cup in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

A section that has been dwindling as regression has hit the USMNT pool, this is a group of players who, if healthy, are still expected to be in the squad and likely start matches. 

The locks are beginning to shift as more players are staking claims to their spots after the September international window. Matt Freese is doing everything that he can in order to make sure that he's the number one keeper for the USMNT when the World Cup kicks off, but, at a minimum, he has done enough to be on the roster, even if it is only as a penalty shootout specialist. At the other end of the field, after scoring against Japan and showing that he can bring a dimension to the USMNT attack that no one else can, Folarin Balogun showed why he's a lock in the side and barring injury, he should be starting the World Cup as the number nine for the Red, White and Blue.

Missing out on the September international window, Weston McKennie may be the most likely name to fall out of this group of players, but alarm bells won't start to ring unless he's not present in the October international window either. Sergino Dest also got his first appearance under Pochettino, and despite having mixed results during camp, he's still someone who will be in the mix during the World Cup due to what he brings to the USMNT going forward.

This shows just how open things are for the USMNT, with only nine spots in the roster being close to what I'd consider locks ahead of the 2026. There are other players like Malik Tillman who are likely locks, but considering that not only did he just move into a new environment at Bayer Leverkusen, but Tillman also now has a new head coach in Kasper Hjulmand after Erik ten Hag was fired after only two matches in charge of the German side, and with Champions League soccer on the horizon, it's a time when anything could happen, putting his World Cup spot at risk. Tim Ream is also likely a lock, but at 37, the World Cup is still a long way away.

Looking at somewhere like midfield, it seemed like the trio was set for this upcoming World Cup as Yunus Musah, Adams, and McKennie wowed at the 2022 World Cup, but as things have changed, Musah has now moved to Atalanta and will need to earn playing time or he'll find himself missing out on the World Cup entirely in 2026.

Here's a look at those who have missed the cut in this projection:

Goalkeepers (3): Matt Freese (New York City FC), Matt Turner (New England Revolution, Patrick Schulte (Columbus Crew).

Defenders (8): Sergino Dest (PSV), Antonee Robinson (Fulham), Miles Robinson (FC Cincinnati), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace), Tim Ream (Fulham), Alex Freeman (Orlando City SC), Max Arfsten (Columbus Crew), Tristan Blackmon (Vancouver Whitecaps).

Midfielders (7): Weston McKennie (Juventus), Tyler Adams (Bournemouth), Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake), Luca De La Torre (San Diego FC), Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver Whitecaps), Malik Tillman (Bayer Leverkusen), Johnny Cardoso (Atletico Madrid).

Forwards (6): Christian Pulisic (Milan), Folarin Balogun (Monaco), Ricardo Pepi (PSV), Tim Weah (Marseille), Patrick Agyemang (Derby County), Haji Wright (Coventry City), Gio Reyna (Borussia Monchengladbach).

This past international window for the United States men's national team, which was highlighted by a 2-0 victory over Japan, might end up being more than a morale boost for a group that desperately needed it; it instead could be a confirmation of a significant learning under head coach Mauricio Pochettino — a tactical shift.

Following a challenging period — a seven-game winless streak against Top 25-ranked opposition — Pochettino's decision to experiment with a three-back system, specifically the 3-4-2-1 formation, proved to be a resounding success.

If the September window's primary objective was to learn and integrate new players, the formation itself emerged as the biggest winner. The adoption of the 3-4-2-1 system (hallelujah!), which had been previously used in brief spells, was deployed from the start against Japan and provided a potential path forward.

Pochettino's blueprint for success has been questioned by many — but this was a good reminder that these things take time, and this appears to have been the last window for experimentation in terms of personnel and tactics. It might have taken longer than people had hoped, but while the Gold Cup was a hugely successful step forward in creating the culture that Pochettino wanted, the friendlies served as an important step in zoning in on the formation. 

But the biggest takeaway is: Pochettino should stick to the 3-4-2-1 until the World Cup — and never look back.

Defensive Solidity and Clean Sheets

The USMNT's recent struggles against top-ranked teams were well-documented, marked by a seven-game winless streak. The win against Japan was not only a break from this trend, but it also resulted in the team's first shutout against a Top-25 opponent since the 2022 World Cup match against Iran.

If you watched our ""State of the Union"" episode after the loss to South Korea, you'd have seen how animated and passionate I was about this team stopping conceding chances and switching to this formation — something I've been calling for dating back to the 2022 World Cup.

Heading into Qatar, there was a lot of concern about the center-back position, with both Miles Robinson and Chris Richards ruled out of the tournament with injuries. Then it was Tim Ream who emerged as this standout player and became a huge force in the back, and a big reason the U.S. had success in the back was the partnership he developed with Walker Zimmerman.

Since then, nobody has really developed in that position, and the trend of conceding goals and being unable to keep clean sheets against top opposition persisted, which is why I've continued to push hard that the U.S. should start to look at a 3-4-2-1 formation with an extra center back, as opposed to a 4-3-3. Tuesday provided some validation.

The shift to a back three gave the defense a sense of security and a noticeable increase in confidence from the center-backs, who were more aggressive in their pressure and challenges without the fear of a costly breakdown. The formation's inherent structure, with an extra body in the backline, addresses a long-standing vulnerability in the United States' defense, especially with the holding presence of Cristian Roldan or Tyler Adams in front of them. The solid block of five were rarely pulled out of position in transition opportunities.

Dynamic Fullback/Wingback Roles

The 3-4-2-1 formation unlocked a new level of freedom for the wingbacks. While this was evident with Max Arfsten and Alex Freeman, the potential of this system with the likes of Antonee Robinson and Sergino Dest is immense.

The tactical change allowed Arfsten and Freeman to operate as true wing-backs, playing to their strengths as attacking players. Arfsten, who had previously been a defensive liability in a four-back system, thrived in this role, delivering one of his better performances for the national team.

For a player like Freeman, the formation highlighted his offensive potential while also exposing his need for improvement in the final third — a crucial area for development if he is to become a high-potential fullback.

Improved Positional Balance and Attacking Freedom

Analyzing the team's passing graphs and average player positions reveals a much more balanced and consistent shape.

Passing graphs vs. Japan via TruMedia. 

This tactical stability provided a ""comforting predictability"" for the players and allowed key game-changers like Christian Pulisic and Folarin Balogun to be more impactful in dangerous spaces. The system solves a long-standing tactical dilemma of where to play Pulisic, giving him a more central role where he can influence the game while lessening his defensive responsibility. The formation's structure allows for a more aggressive counter-press, with the center-backs and holding midfielders confidently winning aerial battles and applying pressure higher up the field.

It's important to note that as of now — Folarin Balogun is in pole position at the striker position, once again — and it will be up to Ricardo Pepi to work his way back in as he continues to work back from injury. It's a good sign for USMNT fans in the way in which he moved off the ball, held up the ball back to goal, and ultimately finished off a chance in front of goal. Go with the Flo!

Being in Sync on Pressuring the Ball

While the formation showed great promise, there are still areas to refine. 

The U.S. struggled at times to apply consistent pressure on the ball from a lower block setup. Some of these issues are to be expected as this group had limited time to train it and develop partnerships/relationships across the field, which is what I would imagine the focus of the October window will be. 

It starts with the center-backs and an understanding of the different roles within the back 3. If you are one of the wide defenders — in this game, Tim Ream and Tristan Blackmon — you have to pick the right moments to step into the midfield and be aggressive in your pressure. As you do that, there needs to be cover and balance from the other two defenders. Think about it like good rhythm and dancing — if someone is stepping to a different beat, it's not going to work!

The other interesting role to watch is Chris Richards. Richards has played in this system consistently for Crystal Palace, but as a right-sided center-back. That highlights some of his real strengths as a defender ± his athleticism, his 1-v-1 defending, his passing, and his aggression. As the middle center-back, it's more about the reading of the game and organization, and this will take a bit of learning for Richards if he is indeed going to play that role for the USMNT.

The midfield pressing will also take some work and I saw moments where Pulisic and Alex Zendejas were unsure of which players to press from the Japanese midfield. In turn, we also saw the wing-backs in Freeman and Arfsten not rotating over to press the opposing midfielder as the center-backs shuffled across. That will come after the team has watched the tape and is a relatively easy fix that will absolutely improve with repetition (you could see some of the improvement after Pochettino made changes at half-time).

The biggest focus needs to be their understanding of the system and moving as a collective, as opposed to as individuals. When you achieve that harmony in defense, it can be liberating and give the team confidence.

Need For a Forward-Passing Midfielder

On the night, I felt that Roldan and Adams were generally solid as a partnership, especially considering this was Roldan's first start for the USMNT in over two years. Defensively, they kept the shape well and were constantly an option in possession for the center-backs as the USMNT were trying to build through Japan's pressure.

I did note, however, a number of times throughout the game where the passes were backwards, sideways and the ""safe"" option,"" as opposed to taking some risk and bypassing players in the Japanese midfield. It presents the question: who can be that player for the USMNT?

When it was a three-man midfield of Yunus Musah, Weston McKennie and Tyler Adams, it was a midfield that relied mostly on the strength of the group: it's athleticism. Remember the England match in the World Cup, where the three of them completely dominated England in midfield? The creativity was supposed to come from the wide areas, Pulisic and Tim Weah.

But if we're now going to bring Pulisic and Tillman into the pockets and channels, we need players that can find them with the ball and maintain the defensive structure and organization of the team. That could really favor a player like Johnny Cardoso, who we have yet to see the best for the USMNT, and who has a good sense for rhythm, tempo, and forward passes.

Looking ahead to the next international window, the following lineup would be an intriguing test for this new system, combining established players with emerging talents:

Liverpool boss Arne Slot has called for patience when it comes to Alexander Isak due to the striker's lack of preseason with Newcastle. (2:17)

Spanish second-tier side CyD Leonesa have announced the signing of Mamelodi Sundowns' Lucas Ribeiro Costa on Friday, with the Brazilian's legal representative confirming that he has received his FIFA International Transfer Certificate.

Leonesa referred to 26-year-old Ribeiro as having signed as a ""free agent"" in their announcement, despite Sundowns' reluctance to let him leave three years before the end of his contract.

Ribeiro had attracted interest from various quarters, particularly after his impressive performances at the FIFA Club World Cup for South African champions Sundowns. He terminated his contract with the club, which had been due to run until 2028, following their alleged refusal to allow a move to a club in Europe or Qatar.

Ribeiro enlisted the services of law firm Dupont-Hissel, who argued that a previous ruling in a dispute involving Lassana Diarra and former club Lokomotiv Moscow meant that FIFA was obligated to ensure Ribeiro was given clearance to leave for new pastures.

Furthermore, they said that his subsequent employer after Sundowns would not be involved in his dispute with the South African club before the FIFA Football Tribunal.

Dupont-Hissel had argued that Sundowns had not been willing to listen to bids even well above his market valuation, thus restricting his freedom of movement.

Sundowns said in an Aug. 21 statement that: ""It has always been the policy and commitment of Mamelodi Sundowns to engage and negotiate with football clubs in Africa and worldwide, that are interested in recruiting and acquiring the services of the Club's players. The objective of Sundowns in these discussions and negotiations has always been to advance the interests of the player and the Club and to be fair and just, and to contribute to the fulfilment of the interests of all parties.""

In a press release sent to ESPN on Friday -- shortly after Ribeiro was unveiled by Segunda División side Leonesa -- Jean-Louis Dupont said that Ribeiro had received his International Transfer Certificate (ITC), leaving him free to play for Leonesa.

""Following a decision by FIFA, Lucas Ribeiro Costa has received the International Transfer Certificate (ITC) allowing him to play in official competitions for his new club, Cultural Leonesa, with immediate effect,"" said the press release.

""On 1 August, Lucas Ribeiro Costa terminated his contract with South African club Mamelodi Sundowns FC, based in particular on the recent Diarra ruling by the CJEU (Court of Justice of the European Union).

""On 31 August, Lucas Ribeiro Costa signed a new employment contract with Spanish club Cultural Leonesa.

""Mamelodi Sundowns FC and the South African Football Association opposed the issuance of the ITC through various manoeuvres.

""On 11 September, Lucas Ribeiro Costa and Cultural Leonesa submitted a request to FIFA for the issuance of the ITC.

""In accordance with its new rules, which recognised the obligation to issue the ITC immediately as imposed by the CJEU in its Diarra ruling, FIFA has now issued the ITC, allowing Lucas Ribeiro Costa to play in official competitions for Cultural Leonesa.

""The merits of the dispute between Lucas Ribeiro Costa and Mamelodi Sundowns FC will now be heard and decided, in the first instance, by the FIFA Football Tribunal and, if necessary, on appeal, by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

""These proceedings will be conducted in a calm manner and will in no way interfere with Lucas Ribeiro Costa's ability to practise his profession in Spain.

""It should be noted that these proceedings only concern Lucas Ribeiro Costa and Mamelodi Sundowns FC, but not his new club, Cultural Leonesa.

""According to standard practice, such proceedings are expected to last between one and two years.""

Ribeiro played 88 times for Sundowns after joining in 2023 from Belgian club Beveren, scoring 37 goals and picking up 23 assists. His goal against Borussia Dortmund earned him the Goal of the Tournament honour at the Club World Cup. He now has the opportunity to test himself in Europe again.

After a draw and three defeats in their first four LaLiga 2 games, Leonesa will continue their Segunda División campaign against table-toppers Racing de Santander away from home on Sunday.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Tjen was already the first player from Indonesia to reach a WTA quarterfinal in over two decades.ByDavid KanePublished Sep 12, 2025 copy_link

Published Sep 12, 2025

Janice Tjen continued a spectacular breakthrough onto the Hologic WTA Tour at the SP Open in Sao Paulo, stunning Alexandra Eala, 6-4, 6-1 to reach the semifinals.“It still feels unbelievable to me,” Tjen said on court after the match. “It hasn't hit yet.

“It still feels unbelievable to me,” Tjen said on court after the match. “It hasn't hit yet.

Tjen was already the first woman from Indonesia to make a WTA quarterfinal since Angelique Widjaja in 2004 (Bali), and the 23-year-old went one round deeper over the streaking No. 3 seed in one hour and 12 minutes on Quadra Central.

Born in Jakarta, Tjen burst onto the scene less than a month ago at the 2025 US Open, winning three rounds of qualifying and shocking No. 24 seed Veronika Kudermetova in her Grand Slam main draw debut. Playing at the WTA 250 event in Sao Paulo, she knocked out No. 7 seed Leolia Jeanjena in straight sets and backed up the win with a 6-1, 6-0 win over Slovak qualifier Martina Okalova to book her spot in the last eight.“I was focusing on every point, especially playing against Alex Eala,” Tjen said. “We all know that she can come back at any time, and I was just trying to focus and stay in it until the end.”Waiting for her there was an in-form Eala, fresh off her first WTA 125K title run at the Guadalajara 125 Open earlier this month. The 20-year-old from the Philippines has been one of the biggest stories of the 2025 season, reaching the Miami Open semifinals with wins over Jelena Ostapenko, Madison Keys, and Iga Swiatek. She made her first WTA final three months later on grass in Eastbourne and dropped just two sets en route to the title in Guadalajara, rallying from a set down to defeat Pann Udvardy in the final.

She made quick work of her SP Open opposition to reach the quarterfinals and took a quick 2-0 lead on Tjen when their match began on Friday. But Tjen quickly caught fire from there, winning 12 of the final 15 games to surge into the semifinal in just over an hour.Standing between Tjen and her first WTA final will be either No. 2 seed Solana Sierra or No. 6 seed Francesca Jones, who each won their second-round matches in straight sets.

A trip to Seville is always worthwhile. The city's iconic landmarks, the magnificent cathedral with its famous Giralda bell tower and the Royal Alcázar Palace, are must-see attractions. But for a truly special experience that blends top-level tennis with local culture, a visit to the Copa Sevilla is essential.First held in 1991, the tournament is one of the oldest events on the ATP Challenger Tour. Its night sessions under floodlight create a striking backdrop at the more than 90-year-old Real Club de Tenis Betis, offering an unforgettable setting to enjoy world-class tennis. The energy of Spain's fourth-largest city and the charm of Andalusia as a whole are reflected in the tournament's unique character.For years, a distinctive yellow surface known as Albero was a trademark of the event, connecting it with Spanish tradition and creating countless memorable moments — from Rafael Nadal's Challenger debut in 2001 to the titles claimed by then-17-year-olds Casper Ruud and Félix Auger-Aliassime in 2016 and 2017.

Yellow has deep roots in Spanish culture, appearing in the national flag and in the country's many bullfighting arenas. The Albero at Real Club de Tenis Betis dated back to the club's beginnings in the 1920s and posed a distinctive challenge for players on tour.“There's less sand on the court, which makes it a bit faster overall,” said Frenchman Hugo Gaston after his first experience on the surface two years ago.“It might take a moment to adjust, but in terms of play it's quite similar to traditional clay courts,” added Sweden's Elias Ymer.“This event is part of the history of Spanish tennis with a great tradition. The tournament is very popular. That makes us proud, but also gives us the drive to keep improving,” explained former tournament director Santiago Pérez Romero.That drive eventually led to the end of an era. Broadcasters had long complained that the yellow court made the yellow ball hard to follow on television. Rising maintenance costs also played a role in the decision to switch to Europe's more standard red clay in 2024.

Last week saw the 62nd edition of the Copa Sevilla played on red clay for the second time. How do players feel about the change?“I've played on both surfaces and reached the second round both times,” said Spain's Carlos López Montagud. “It is different. On Albero the balls bounced higher, and it was a bit more slippery on the baseline. You also had to adjust your eyes to the surface. Overall, red clay is definitely the better court.”The most successful player in the tournament's history is Roberto Carballés Baena. The 32-year-old Spaniard, born in Tenerife but based in Granada, captured the Copa Sevilla title three years in a row from 2022 to 2024. “I didn't enjoy playing in Seville because of the unique Albero, but because of the people who make this tournament so special,” he said.With the three-time champion sidelined by injury this year, Peruvian youngster Ignacio Buse seized his chance and was crowned the new champion. His triumph not only marks another milestone in his promising career but also ensures that the vibrant story of the Copa Sevilla will continue to unfold - now on red clay.

'We have a mission that we're trying to reach, and we need to fill up the gas tank. That's what this process has done for us,' Angel CEO Neal Harmon told THR.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	Utah-based Angel Studios, the company founded by three brothers attempting to upend the Hollywood system by allowing under-served audiences to help build a slate of faith-based and value-centric films, including 2023 sleeper hit Sound of Freedom, has found a new nesting ground.


	On Thursday, Angel founders Neal, Daniel and Jeffrey Harmon rang the closing bell of the New York Stock Exchange in celebration of becoming a publicly trading company under the ticker symbol ANGX, the result of a long-gestating SPAC merger that will infuse the company with cash as it seeks to disrupt the Hollywood establishment.

	The company's share price rose by 10%, suggesting an eagerness from the public to buy into their vision. Angel is based in Provo, Utah, where the siblings are well-known members of the Church of Latter Day saints.

	“Hollywood is out of touch with mainstream audiences,” Neal Harmon told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview minutes before rrngingthe bell. “This is a step in the process for us. We have 1.5 million Angels Guild members who are deciding what content we release, and then we have almost 70,000 investors to provide the liquidity. We have a mission that we're trying to reach, and we need to fill up the gas tank. That's what this process has done for us.”


	Thursday's festivities included treating investors on boat trip to the Statue of Liberty, followed by a celebratory private dinner. For the three Harmon siblings, the only bittersweet moment of the day was grappling with the brutal assassination earlier this week of Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist and podcast who lived in the Provo area and whom they knew (Jeffrey Harmon  was scheduled to appear on the late Kirk's podcast next week). 

	











	Among the company's digital marketing and crowdfunding innovations is, as Harmaon noted, its Angel Guild program, in which its members pay a monthly fee for access to the studio's releases as well as a vote in the greenlight process of future films and TV series. Angel is also a pioneer in using crowdsourcing to raise money for marketing costs. It is based in the Provol 


	“Now that we have the tank full, it's all about execution as long as we execute and we continue to grow the Guild, we had planned to list that when we had 1 million Guild members, now we have 1.5, so we're ahead in that respect, but we now need to grow the Guild to 5 million Guild members and 10 and a hundred,” Harmon adds. “That's what we intend to do is to grow this community and reach more people and the price of the stock will take care of itself. We're not worried about it in the short term. There'll be a lot of volatility in the short term, but this is a long term company.”


	The outfit has endured its share of challenges, however, and was involved in an acrimonious breakup with the The Chosen filmmakers (the series was an early victory for Angel's digital platforms).


	Angel Studios opted not to go the traditional IPO route when deciding to go public. Rather it completed a SPAC merger with Southport Acquisition (SPAC stands for special purpose acquisition company) after securing a $100 million credit facility with Trinity Capital. The combined entity is valued an $1.6 billion in pro forma enterprise value. 

	











	Neal Harmon, co-founder and CEO, will continue to lead the company post-merger. Jordan Harmon is president, and Jeffrey Harmon is chief content officer.


	Angel doesn't turn out just faith-based fare. Its overall mission is to build a home for stories that “amplify light” and promote value-driven storytelling, such as Sound of Freedom, which earned north of $250 million at the global box office in summer and made Angel a household name. And its online platform carried the hit series The Chosen. To date, the company has released 36 films and 21 television series, whether in cinemas, on television or on its digital streaming platforms.


	Most recently it released the 2024 comedy fantasy film Sketch. 


	According to the Harmons, Angel had the highest per-release domestic box office average of any independent studio from 2023-2025, including A24, Focus Features and Searchlight Studios. After Sound of Freedom, its biggest office win was this year's animated The King of Kings, which earned north of $77 million globally. And in summer 2023, Angel became the talk of the town when Sound of Freedom outgrossed such event pics as Indiana Jones at the Dial of Destiny.


	“The SPAC doesn't exist anymore now that we're a publicly traded company,” said Neal Harmon. “This vehicle allowed us to have control of the company in the public markets so that we can make sure that the Guild continues to call the shots and greenlight our films. Rather than being acquired or having some kind of a hostile takeover of Angel's mission, we get to control the mission moving forward.”

	











	Earlier this year, Angel was among the official studios presenting its slate to theater owners at CinemaCon. Upcoming Angel theatrical releases include The Senior, starring Michael Chiklis (Dec. 19) and the December release Zero A.D., starring Jim Caviezel and directed by Alejandro Monteverde, who directed Sound of Freedom.


	Angel inked a 10-year deal with Monteverde last year.


	And the company is beginning to pursue a more aggressive international strategy, taking its films around the world.


	The company was born out of the collapse of the Harmon Brothers' previous endeavor, VidAngel, which distributed versions of Hollywood studio films, edited to make them “family-friendly.” In 2016, the majors, including Disney, Warner Bros., 20th Century Fox and Lucasfilm, filed a multi-million dollar lawsuit against VidAngel, alleging copyright violation. The studios won $62.4 million in damages, eventually reduced to a $9.9 million settlement after VidAngel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.


	Rebranded as Angel Studios in 2021, the company shifted focused to producing and distributing original content through equity crowdfunding. Despite the pivot, Angel Studios has encountered further legal disputes, notably with the producers of Biblically-themed TV series The Chosen, which resulted in an arbitration ruling that Angel Studios breached its contract and was ordered to pay $5 million in fees and costs.


	Roth Capital Partners and Lake Street are serving as capital markets advisors to Angel. Oppenheimer & Co. is serving as financial and capital markets advisor to Southport. Mayer Brown LLP is acting as legal advisor to Angel, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz to Southport.

					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


UPDATE: Taylor Swift is calling BS on Justin Baldoni. 


	As a flurry of letters land in the federal docket from lawyers for the It Ends With Us co-star/director and Blake Lively about will the Lover singer end up giving a deposition or not in the sexual harassment and retaliation lawsuit, Swift and her own attorney have weighed in.


	And she's backing her old friend Blake's side of the story. 


	“As counsel for the parties know, since the inception of this matter we have consistently maintained that my client has no material role in this action,” wrote lawyer Douglas Baldridge to Judge Lewis Liman this afternoon. 

	











	“Further, my client did not agree to a deposition, but if she is forced into a deposition, we advised (after first hearing about the deposition just three days ago) that her schedule would accommodate the time required during the week of October 20 if the parties were able to work out their disputes.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	That schedule of course works around the release of Swift's new The Life of a Showgirl album, which comes out on October 3. 


PREVIOUSLY, 10:24 AM: Justin Baldoni's latest attempt to pull Taylor Swift into his defense against sexual harassment and retaliation allegations from It End With Us co-star Blake Lively looks to be going off the rails faster than the Grammy winner's upcoming The Life of a Showgirl album is expected to rocket to the top of the charts.


	Not yet approved by a judge in the case that goes to trial next spring, Baldoni and his Wayfarer Studies inner circle want to see Swift deposed “during the week of October 20-25 due to Ms. Swift's preexisting professional obligations. However, the recently engaged singer has not been “agreed” to the sit-down next month, which comes weeks after discovery in the matter was supposed to be over, and Baldoni's side has presented no “evidence” to justify it, says a sharply worded filing by Lively's lawyers today.












	Calling the effort first made public by Baldoni in a September 11 letter to the court, another move “to fuel their relentless media strategy,” Lively attorney Michael J. Gottlieb wants federal Judge Lewis Liman to deny the Swift deposition, its dates and the discovery extension effort. “Even if one were to take the Wayfarer Defendants' representation at face value, they have not come close to establishing good cause for their requested relief,” the Willkie Farr & Gallagher partner insists. 


	“The Wayfarer Defendants assert that Ms. Swift is not available for a deposition until October 20, 2025, yet are silent about their efforts (if any) to schedule this deposition during the existing discovery period,” Gottlieb adds. 


	“That is likely because, as explained in the attached correspondence between the parties, see Exhibit A, the Wayfarer Defendants do not appear to have contacted Ms. Swift's counsel regarding a date or location about the deposition until earlier this week,” Lively co-lead lawyer states. 


	“In this respect, the Wayfarer Defendants' lack of diligence, and disrespect for Ms. Swift's privacy and schedule, is astounding. Discovery has been ongoing for more than six months, and Ms. Swift is someone whose calendar should be presumed to be packed with professional obligations for months in advance,” Gottlieb continued. “At any point over the past six months, the Wayfarer Defendants could have noticed a deposition, served a subpoena, and negotiated an agreeable time and place for this deposition. But they did not.”


	As the overall matter heads towards its March 9, 2026 trial date start, Judge Liman will have the final word – for now – on bringing Swift on board and giving Baldoni and his Wayfarer co-founders more time for their own depositions. 


	Having been round this maypole before over the months since December 2024 when Lively first made her claims to California Civil Rights Department of what went down on the IEWU production and the online smear campaign that allegedly followed, Swift's reps did not respond to Deadline's request for comment on the supposed deposition next month and the back-and-forth correspondence. Baldoni and Wayfarer's PR team also did not answer a request to respond to today's damning letter from Livley's side. 


	Swift and Lively's long friendship had been a distinct sub-plot in the IEWU legal battles, with tabloid fodder that the duo have fallen out over the controversy adverse Eras Tour performer getting tainted with the whole thing. Swift was name checked in the self titled Scenario Planning document that Baldoni crisis PR chief Melissa Nathan, who is also a defendant in the case, put together in the summer of 2024 as IEWU‘s premiere loomed. “As part of this, our team can also explore planting stories about the weaponization of feminism and how people in BL's circle like Taylor Swift, have been accused of utilizing these tactics to ‘bully' into getting what they want,” the five-pager said in a section called “Scenario 3: Ryan comes forward in defense of his wife.”


	On the docket, Swift talking to Baldoni's Bryan Freedman-led lawyers was a media storm back in  May and June. Even before that, Swift, who contributed her ‘My Tears Ricochet' tune to the Lively cut of IEWU, made a cameo or two in various filings with IEWU director Baldoni feeling ganged up on when Swift's name was brought up as one of Lively's “dragons” who backed her suggestions for changes to the movie. 

	











	While it does seem that Swift and Lively may not be hangin out that much of late, at least publicly, but the former is still the godmother to one of the latter and Ryan Reynolds' children. No word, if Lively and Reynolds are going to Swift's wedding with repeat Super Bowl champ and Kansas City Chief player Travis Kelce – but then again there is no word when that American royalty nuptial day is happening and who is going besides Swift and Kelce. 


	What we do know is that Swift's new Life of a Showgirl album is se to drop on October 3 — a few weeks before the deposition Team Baldoni want her to give.

Every Friday, A.V. Club staffers kick off the weekend by taking a look at the world of gaming, diving in to the ideas that underpin the hobby we love with a bit of Game Theory. We'll sound off in the space above, and invite you to respond down in the comments, telling us what you're playing this weekend, and what theories it's got you kicking around.

Fragility is a tricky thing in video games. It's an unforgiving concept, for one thing, and good game design usually incorporates some element of shriving—a way to claw your way back from the edge and make up for past mistakes. Hollow Knight: Silksong, which came out last week after years of anticipation, and which has been consuming my hours mercilessly ever since, understands this concept. Some of its most thrilling moments come from the hard-fought scrabble, as I find the one safe inch of space on its gorgeously realized screens in which to slowly, so terribly slowly, bind my wounds before a boss can launch its next attack. But oh, my little friend Hornet is a fragile lil' thing.

Silksong—the expansion-turned-straight-up sequel to Team Cherry's 2017 indie hit Hollow Knight—has been subsumed almost instantly into The Great Internet Video Game Difficulty Discourse, because of course it has. Partly that's because of the hype machine, and partly it's because the game looks like it could be for everybody, with its ugly-cute bug designs. (Capable of appealing to a far wider swath of players than its inherent disinterest in mercy could seamlessly support.) It is also, from the jump, quite a bit nastier than the original Hollow Knight, which is one of those game design foibles that sequels fall into sometimes. You assume (not without evidence) that your audience for a second game will be made up in large part of players who mastered the first one, and so you tend to feel a little more comfortable throwing some serious roadblocks at them as early as the first or second boss.

(In this case, Team Cherry may have allowed time to trick them a bit; yes, we all devoured Hollow Knight… eight years ago. The spirit may be strong, but the muscle memory, not so much.)

Difficulty in Silksong arrives from two angles, neither of which has been mitigated by anything in the way of chooseable difficulty options. The first is straight-up numerical: Many enemies in the new game hit for two pips of Hornet's extremely limited health, while taking a heavy number of expertly-aimed needle slashes to take down. Since you start with just five points of life (fragile lil' thing!), that renders many of the game's more frenetic battles a “three strikes and you're out” ordeal. You can heal, spending the Silk resource that builds up when you attack, but in-battle healing is a fraught affair. Screw up the timing, and you don't just get knocked out of the animation—you lose the Silk, too. Combined with attack patterns that put a lot of sturm und drang on the screen (even if, on second or third blush, they tend to be easier to find the loopholes in than you might expect) and you have a recipe for a lot of very quick trips back to your nearest life-restoring bench.

The other difficulty angle, and the one more fundamentally rooted in Silksong's narrative goals, is the basic hostility of its world. This expresses most cleanly (in another element lifted wholesale from the original game) in how its mapping works: Every time Hornet pushes forward into a new area, she does so without a map at all—scrap paper apparently being in short supply in the land of Pharloom. Those initial pushes are harrowing every single time the happen, as the player blindly chooses paths, trying not to get themselves hopelessly lost. (Do I go for the upper path, which is clearly harder, or down, where I might get trapped in a path I have no good way to get back out of?) The relief of finally stumbling into the NPC who sells the maps—of hearing her happy little hums, or seeing evidence of the Xena chakrams she's buried in enemies' cute little skulls—is profound. You can't have a safe haven, after all, without making most of the world feel profoundly unsafe.

Even beyond that one element, though—or the fact that such luxuries as tracking Hornet's position on the map requires giving up a precious crest slot that could be spent on survivability—Silksong is even more interested in creating the sensation of pushing into hostile territory than Hollow Knight was. The Knight, after all, was essentially a blank-slate meanderer, wandering into fights almost at random as he slowly explored the king of Hallownest. Hornet, by contrast, is a crusading killer, hunting down Pharloom's highest figures, and Silksong isn't shy about making you feel how daunting her trip into enemy territory can be. The game emphasizes this insecurity with a few stand-out moments, sequences that blow apart and surprise expectations and feelings of safety, and some of the only parts of the game that don't just feel like Hollow Knight, But More So. But it also captures the exhausting feeling every time it asks Hornet and her player to dive into yet another impenetrable, foggy labyrinth of secrets. I have stopped the game more than once simply on account of sheer existential exhaustion.

The Big Question of The Great Video Game Difficulty Discourse always boils down, in the long run, to this: “Who should decide how hard the video game should be: The developer, or the player?” Part of the reason Hollow Knight and Silksong‘s lack of difficulty options rankles some people, I think, is because it'd be so easy to implement—at least, for the more frankly numerical kind of hardness. (Change the numbers so that enemies hit half as hard against twice as much health, and you can basically call it a day.) As I noted back when Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree‘s final boss repeatedly kicked me in the teeth, difficulty in video games is an act of authorship, and, like any act of authorship, it carries an inherent “you can take it or leave it” philosophy. There are people, and not a small amount of people, who will never see the good (the map, the world design, the surprisingly heartfelt writing) or the bad (fuuuuuuuuuck those semi-random sidequests) of Silksong, because it is very determinedly hard. By refusing to cede control of the game's difficulty to players—potentially allowing them to remove frustration, struggle, and misery from its emotional palette—Team Cherry has essentially written these players off. That's harsh, hostile, alienating, and even potentially ableist, even while conveying a certain flavor of artistic confidence that's hard for me to outright condemn.

For me, personally, I mostly love Silksong—even when I don't always necessarily like the experience of playing it. The numerical difficulty I could give or take, even as I tend to get more thrills than screams out of the many attempts it takes me to master each of its highly mobile bosses. But the dark, cruel hostility of its world is the stuff that keeps me addicted. Fragility is a tricky thing, in video games, and rare. Few games have ever made me feel more like a little bug in a big, horrible world.

Sharon Osbourne, 72, courageously stepped back into the public eye seven weeks after the death of her beloved husband, Ozzy Osbourne. The TV personality shared a special moment with daughter Kelly Osbourne, 40, enjoying a day of falconry in Cornwall, England, a glimpse of hope and healing after profound loss. Kelly shared the outing on Instagram, capturing Sharon's rare smile as a brown owl perched gently on her gloved hand. 

She wrote, “Today I introduced my mom to falconry and she loved it! Thank you @gerardsulter for putting a smile on my mom's face too!”

A post shared by Kelly Osbourne (@kellyosbourne)

In the video, Kelly could be heard saying, “Mom, put your hand out.” The bird flew to Sharon and landed on her arm. Sharon, who was spotted in the video wearing baggy black pants, a black blazer, and a white T-shirt, candidly replied, “I don't have anything to give you.”

A post shared by Sharon Osbourne (@sharonosbourne)

Kelly later added that the trip “put a smile back on mum's face.” Fans immediately took to the comment section to share their love and support. 

One wrote, “There she is!!!! We've all missed seeing Sharon ❤️ Thank you Kelly!” Another added, “Makes my heart happy to see your mom out and happy.”

Another fan wrote: “When it panned to Sharon, she looked absolutely ethereal.” Another sweet comment read: “Mrs. O's outfit is straight fire. Damn” 

Another sweet comment read, “I've been watching The Osbornes on Prime. Sharon was always so supportive and such a great mom. It's nice seeing her. 💜🦉”

A fan praised Kelly's efforts and shared: “Oh Sharon! We missed the beautiful face of yours! ❤️ So happy to see you and Kelly, what an amazing experience to give your lovely mum! ❤️” 

Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne passed away on July 22 at the age of 76. His death was caused by cardiac arrest, acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, and Parkinson's disease.  Ozzy performed weeks before his passing during his final concert, “Back to the Beginning,” in Birmingham, attended by more than 40,000 fans.

Reflecting on the show, Sharon told Pollstar, “I never wanted Ozzy to just disappear without some big event. And it's the best way then to go home to where it all started, to go to his favorite stadium in the world, which is [home to] his beloved Aston Villa team, and it was just perfect.” She added, “It was a huge success, because it was a phenomenal event.”

Sharon's last public appearance was at Ozzy's funeral on July 30, which included a procession through his hometown of Birmingham. She was seen in tears, surrounded by her children, Jack, Aimee, and Kelly, as well as Ozzy's son from his first marriage, Louis.

Today, fans continue to rally around Sharon and the Osbourne family as they navigate life without Ozzy. Small, joyful moments, like her falconry outing in Cornwall, show her strength and resilience, offering a hopeful glimpse of healing and the courage to embrace life again.

“One Battle After Another” has screened for press and industry, and Paul Thomas Anderson's raved-about action thriller (which is also a comedy!) is now an Oscar frontrunner, as IndieWire's Anne Thompson already said. (IndieWire's David Ehrlich also called it possibly the best American studio movie since he became a film critic. That's setting down some big shoes to fill.)

Nevertheless, on this week's episode of IndieWire's “Screen Talk” podcast, co-hosts Anne Thompson and Ryan Lattanzio catch up on the movie, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a former revolutionary searching for his missing daughter (Chase Infiniti) after a fabled former enemy (Sean Penn) returns. Benicio Del Toro, Teyana Taylor, and Regina Hall also star in an epic that may run 2 hours, 40 minutes, and change, but it feels like 90 minutes. Ryan thinks “One Battle After Another” will go all the way to win multiple top Oscars and probably Best Picture, while Anne makes the case for Ryan Coogler's “Sinners” and Chloé Zhao's “Hamnet” to do the same.

Speaking of, Ryan finally caught up on “Hamnet” after missing out on Telluride and Toronto. Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal give moving performances as a grieving William Shakespeare and his wife after their son dies of the plague, but Ryan had a bone to pick about the use of Max Richter's “On the Nature of Daylight” in a key emotional climax, a piece we've already heard in “Arrival,” “The Last of Us,” and “Shutter Island” in similarly cathartic moments. Plus, Richter had a whole original score (one likely to be Oscar-nominated) written and ready, right there!

Lou “Easy” Evans isn't a particularly gifted singer, but he's got swagger and pizzaz and panache, and a real gift for choosing the songs he croons on various little stages around the slightly scuzzier side of Las Vegas. Tiny bars and iffy lounges and downbeat casinos are his domain, and set lists full of upbeat jams (Whitney Houston and Stevie Nicks, Mike and the Mechanics and Pat Benatar, oh my!) turned into real heartbreakers are his currency. 

Being the biggest star on The Strip has never been his goal, but he'd sure like the opportunity to not feel like such a loser all the time, not to have to scrape by for every penny. And in Vegas? That kind of optimism — “I'd like to have a paid off credit card bill!” — is a liability.

 








Related Stories The Movies Are Meeting the Moment, but Distributors Are Still Scared of Palestine (and Three Other Lessons We Learned from the Fall Fests) Can ‘One Battle After Another' Beat ‘Sinners' and ‘Hamnet' at the Oscars? — Screen Talk 

It's “another magical day here in Las Vegas, Nevada” when Nic Pizzolatto's surprisingly low-key feature directorial debut “Easy's Waltz” opens, though you wouldn't know it from the Evans brothers. Easy (Vince Vaughn) is gearing up for another throwaway show with his band, The Grifters, in a “budget-friendly” downtown Vegas joint. Sam (Simon Rex) has slinked off to a dim bar, rather than doing his actual job (managing Easy and other local acts), and his eyes light up when he spots a pretty gal (Kate Mara as Lucy) across the way.

 










And while, as Sam tells it, “the number one rule is to know when to leave the fucking casino,” that doesn't seem to be happening for either of the Evans men. In a city of people always hoping for the next big score, they're no different than anyone else, but time is running out, patience is wearing thin, and something has to change. Their luck, it seems, has to turn. Right? Talk about a gamble.

Despite the dire-sounding set-up of Pizzolatto's film (he also wrote the film's script), “Easy's Waltz” isn't nearly as downbeat as most might expect from the guy behind “True Detective,” but grinding it out in Vegas is never a walk in the park. Not nearly as dark — or deep-feeling — as last year's “beloved star takes on a vibe shift in a Vegas-set drama,” what “Easy's Waltz” has in common with that Pamela Anderson vehicle is obvious enough: a solid turn from its star. Vaughn pours himself into the role, but he also seems to understand that going big and broad for this one is a misstep. Easy isn't a caricature, even if the people and events around him increasingly feel that way.

When Easy catches the eye of local manager (and much, much more) Mickey Albano (a well-cast Al Pacino), his star is suddenly on the rise. Mickey books him into a residency at the swanky Wynn Casino, passing the whole thing off as part of his newfound interest in giving back to the little people, not his bone-deep interest in looking out for himself. Entanglements abound: Mickey is also friendly with Lucy, whom Sam pretends not to know, if only because he's got the good sense not to show Mickey all his cards. And when Sam cooks up a truly stupid scheme to make some quick cash, there's little doubt a heavy like Mickey isn't going to like it.

 










What Easy lacks up for in obvious vocal ability — though everyone around him, especially Sam, is always quick to remind him he's the best singer in town — he more than makes up for with flash. But that sort of flash is not the most natural fit for Pizzolatto, whose own sensibility seems to be at odds with the story at hand. Tonal disparities are often on offer, with Pizzolatto going for darker stuff (someone is gonna break your legs, sucka!) and Vaughn infusing the whole thing with non-stop, hangdog charm. Easy is the kind of dude who sings “The Little Drummer Boy” like it's the saddest song in the world, but that's not good enough for Pizzolatto, who opts to shoot that performance in black and white, because why not.

Despite the various dramas that swirl around this group of Vegas locals and wannabes, “Easy's Waltz” meanders toward the bulk of its real punch, with its plot only kicking in long past its halfway mark. By then, Easy has become a viral hit, Sam has dug himself in way too deep, and Mickey is itching to show his true colors. Audiences might almost be eager to hear a classic limb-breaking threat by then, because far too much of this has been, well, a bit too easy going down.

“Easy's Waltz” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

DJ Qualls (Z Nation, The Man in the High Castle) played recurring character Garth Fitzerald IV on Supernatural. Garth had been a ward of Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver) who mentored him as a demon hunter. Garth eventually turned into a kindly, dentist, family man, and werewolf. In real life he's been an avid SPN convention attendee, keeping in touch with his former castmates — and even finding his life partner at a con.

Below, DJ Qualls reflects on Supernatural, his convention experience, and more.

Do you remember your first SPN convention?

DJ Qualls: Even though we were both on Supernatural, I met my partner Ty Olsson [who played vampire Benny Lafitte] in 2012 at the Birmingham, England, convention. I was walking past the place where all the actors' headshots were up, and I'm like, “Who's that?” And it was Ty dressed up as Benny. He invited  himself on my trip to Prague, and I was there with my buddy and he was like, “Where are you guys going after this?”  I'm like, “Prague.” And he said , “Can I come?”

I had worked mostly with Jared [Padalecki] and Jensen [Ackles] and Alex Calvert and Misha [Collins], so many of us who recurred know each other through conventions. Samantha Smith had been saying, “Hey, what's up?” at different shows over the years. Then we had our friendship breakthrough moment, and now we talk every day. The beauty of this is when you have such a large cast, these are our meeting points; this is where we forged real friendship.

What's your favorite con memory?

We celebrated Ty's birthday at our show in Indianapolis last year. It was really special because I got to bring him out a cake. And it was a nice moment that the fans were there for. They were stoked.

What do you love about SPN cons?

My deal with Creation [the owners of many fan conventions] is that I work from 9am until midnight on Friday. On Saturday nights, I always get off at 5, and I take some staff and fans out to see the city we're in. If we're going to a bar, I'll say, “Please don't tell a thousand people!”

What do you hear most from fans? “

Every single person who meets me in the whole world says how tall I am. I hear it 50 times a day. I'm 6-feet, 2-and-a-half inches, but a lot of my characters are meek, which projects small. But aside from that, I've worked for so many years outside of Supernatural, I hear with pride, “I knew you before Supernatural.” The  good things about the early teen comedies I did is that kids who watch the series get introduced to those movies by their parents. It's like, “If you like him in Supernatural, let me show you The New Guy.”

Do you have a favorite episode?

“Party on, Garth” [Season 7, Episode 18]. To have your name on an episode is a pretty cool thing. But the episode was all fun  The monster was amazing, kind of looked like the monsters from The Ring, and I got to do a stunt where they pulled me out of a sugar glass window, which was really great. That's when I  realized our hunter coats' interior pockets are cut out and people hand you all that stuff because there's no way you can pull the stuff that we pull out of those coats. [Laughs]

You're one of the few people in Supernatural who didn't die for real.

I did not die.

Is that something special?

It's really special. It's a badge of honor. I mean, if you died on Supernatural, there's a high chance you were going to be revived, go back to life. But I didn't have to even go through any of that. Garth, I think, was so beloved, it would've been a hard sell to kill him. And also I think his function in the later years of the series was to show a life beyond hunting. I was really not happy when they made me a werewolf because I thought they were trying to kill me. The lore of the show is that Dean is going to have to kill me or at least ostracize me. But they wrote a beautiful dinner party scene where he got to see that we werewolves were normal monsters or normal people living as monsters or …

How about a dentist!

Yeah. Garth's first kill was the tooth fairy, and the dentist was a great callback to that.

Did you take home anything from the set?

So Supernatural is notoriously stingy about giving away props. I tried to take a silver bullet necklace, and they asked for it back, and I got it out of a bucket of like 20 of  them 'cause everybody in the scene had to have one. They gave me Mr. Fizzles, though, the little puppet that I used to talk to and scare children with. My dog was special needs — he was born with too much water on his brain and he could only walk in a circle — so the voice that I used to talk to him was the voice that I gave to Mr. Fizzles. My dog passed, and two days before Christmas, [the show] sent a messenger to my house with the puppet and I cried in my entryway. But then they sold my hunter coat at a yard sale for $10 without asking me, and I'm still mad about it. If anybody out there has my hunter coat, I want it back! I'll give you a thousand dollars for it right now. [Laughs]

That was mean.

I know.

If there's ever a reunion movie or some kind of limited series, what do you think Garth would be doing?

I think that Garth in his retirement is going to get restless and go back to hunting. In the last episodes, it was called a hero's journey. Garth got to hunt one last time. And I can't imagine as time goes on and his children grow up that he wouldn't want to go back to doing what he has done since childhood. Bobby sort of taught him how to hunt and set him on that path. I think as an older man, maybe when he is Bobby's age, there would be a callback to that. Also, who knows what's going to happen in the monster world. Maybe things will get rough, and some vampires or some werewolves have to be taken out. Garth would be the guy to do it. He has super werewolf strength. Here's a little inside note: The reason I became a werewolf is because I was supposed to do a lot more episodes, but I booked The Man in the High Castle, which was a great show.

You were great in it.

Thank you. So they had to explain where I was; I was in a werewolf commune.

Why do you think Supernatural became one of the biggest cult shows?

At one point Baywatch was one of the biggest shows in the world. And it's because the optics. No matter what language you speak and what culture you're from, hot people chasing bad people or monsters is universal. On the most superficial level, I think that's a really good reason. I mean, also, the storytelling's great, but it's the whole thing of beautiful people doing good and evil, right? You're always going to be on the side of the hot people.

Supernatural seemed to be like catnip to actors. So many of them have told me how much they loved working on the series. What made it special to you?

On my second episode, they gave me a chair back with my name on it. When you guest star on a show, you usually feel like you're playing in somebody else's yard the whole time you're there. To give me a chair back with my name on it — that's what they do for series regulars! It was a way of saying, “Hey, welcome back. You're one of us.” And that carries a lot of weight. Not just the sense of belonging, but the execution of the work. Usually when you guest star, you have so much pressure to know every single line and every single word. If you falter, you feel like you've made a giant mistake. But when they basically said, “Hey, this is your backyard, too,” it frees you up and it makes the work better, too. And also on Fridays, a woman brought hot sandwiches. Every actor asked about the hot sandwiches on Friday.

What would you write in a letter to fans?

First, I would tell them how important it is how much love we get back from them.  They tell us what the show means to them, but what they don't realize is loving the [cons] and coming to see us when we appear allows the actors to be present in each other's lives, more than just texting. That's a really cool thing. Tell me another cast that gets to see each other over and over again on a regular basis. It's a reunion for us that we get to have many times a year. When Jared had his accident, we all knew about it before anybody did.

On Jan. 21, at 12:22 a.m. local time, in the silence and darkness of Chile's Patagonia region, a camera trap used to monitor wildlife for a project run by the University of Magallanes (UMAG) captured, in 2 seconds, three photographs showing intense lights moving downward.

Everyone was baffled.

""On a camera located at the edge of a meadow, quite far from any public road and focused on a flat horizon, some lights appeared that we cannot explain,"" biologist Alejandro Kusch said in a UMAG podcast in August. ""Apparently, these lights, which are initially distant, approach and remain in front of the camera, dazzling it, in a movement that appears to be descending.""

Kusch is one of the leaders of the Public Baseline project, which uses 65 camera traps distributed between continental Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, on the southern tip of Chile, to record terrestrial animals, particularly felines. Since the project began in November 2023, at least 365,000 images and videos have been collected; however, only these three photographs show this phenomenon.

UMAG shared the images with a variety of organizations, from Chile's General Directorate of Civil Aeronautics (SEFAA)to the La Serena UFO Museum, and to several people who analyze anomalous aerial phenomena.

Potential explanations ranged from an arachnid coming very close to the camera lens to that of a ""plasmoid,"" a short-lived form of plasma rarely observed in nature that may be behind phenomena such as ball lightning. However, all specialists agreed: for now, there is no conclusive explanation.

This sighting is unique because it was recorded within the framework of a scientific project, said Rodrigo Bravo, a researcher with the Environmental Studies Group (GEA) at UMAG and a member of the Public Baseline project. That means there is no possibility of fraud or manipulation, as the camera traps operate under rigorous protocols and are equipped with an infrared system, motion sensor, and other features that would preclude people tampering with them, he argued.

""This is not the first time these phenomena have been described in the area, but it is the first time they have been recorded in this way,"" Bravo told Live Science.

The local Mapuche people traditionally speak of ""bad lights,"" which they believe are spirits that appear in the fields. This raises the possibility that the camera traps are finally capturing a phenomenon that has long been recognized in the region.

But even if these strange flashes are the ""bad lights"" the Mapuche speak of, what are they?

One possibility is that the lights are unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), possibly from a mysterious flying object. Some declassified Pentagon files on UAP show similar characteristics, Bravo added. Generally poor-quality data means that most UAP sightings cannot be confirmed or explained, but common explanations include foreign spy drones and ""airborne clutter"" such as birds and weather balloons.

To address that possibility, UMAG sent photos and video to Freddy Alexis, who discusses UFOs and other unknown phenomena on his TV programs on UCVTV, the station of the Catholic University of Valparaíso.

Alexis wrote two reports on his findings, which included trajectory, spectrographic, and relief analyses of the photographs and videos. In the second report, he wrote that only a single ""luminous stimulus"" is visible, not two, and that the other ""lights"" are internal lens reflections.

According to Alexis, the primary light may be a plasmoid, or a bubble of incandescent ionized gas that is confined by Earth's local magnetic field, and that can remain stable for a few seconds. The most familiar atmospheric example is ball lightning, usually associated with storms. But that is where his explanation hits a wall. ""It was summer, with 48  degrees Fahrenheit [8 degrees Celsius], and there were no electrical storms,"" Alexis told Live Science. ""There were no atmospheric conditions for a storm, so it is very unlikely that ball lightning could have formed.""

 




But more exotic plasmoids have been proposed under special conditions, such as transient, localized changes in Earth's magnetic field.

Still, Alexis noted that there may be other, poorly understood atmospheric plasmoids, similar to the ""mysterious lights"" of Hessdalen, Norway. Like the Magallanes phenomenon, these lights defy conventional explanations and could involve plasma structures that are still poorly understood.

In one of his reports, Alexis also calculated that, assuming this was a distant, flying object, it would have been moving at a speed of 590 mph (947 km/h), or roughly 0.7 times the speed of sound. Alexis suggested that the lights might not be a flying object, but some plasmoids can move at high speeds, he added.

In a separate report, technicians from La Serena UFO Museum suggested that a spider or moth may have inadvertently tripped the camera's sensor. That's because in the first photo, what appears to be an insect or arachnid can be seen along one edge of the image. However, the insect does not appear in the subsequent photos.

While one possibility is that the insect triggered the camera, this would only explain why the photo was taken, not why a bright, blob-like light appears, said

Cristian Riffo, director of the La Serena UFO Museum, who was also consulted for the UMAG report.

Riffo noted that the camera traps are designed to minimize false positives caused by insects, lasers or other stimuli. He thinks the rapid sequence of photos, in which the light appears to move toward the camera, is baffling and hard to explain.

""It could be two different phenomena: one natural, which triggered the camera, and the other, a light phenomenon, which remains unexplained,"" Riffo told Live Science.

 




Museum researchers analyzed before and after photographs taken by the same camera, during the day and at night, in the presence of wildlife and under different atmospheric conditions, and reviewed the manufacturer's manuals to rule out technical failures. So far, ""they have not found an explanation,"" Riffo said.

For this reason, researchers from the La Serena UFO Museum are planning to carry out their own on-site fieldwork in the area to collect additional data and analyze other local parameters, such as the terrain, lighting conditions, and environmental factors.

—Cosmic rays could help support alien life on worlds outside the 'Goldilocks zone'

Bravo added that the monitoring project in the area is scheduled to continue for up to 10 more years, and more camera traps are planned, raising hopes that this strange phenomenon may be captured again.

""The scientists involved are eager to know what this was. This is also science: it's about discovering what happens in nature,"" Bravo said.

Meanwhile, the mystery remains, and so scientists and those interested in anomalous aerial phenomena are working together to understand it.

An elderly shopkeeper in Turkey almost lost his left arm after his hand became seriously infected as a result of a human bite during an attempted robbery.

Doctors frequently warn that another human's bite is often more dangerous than that of a dog or a cat, but a 60-year-old man in Istanbul, Turkey, found that out the hard way after nearly losing his arm. The case occurred last year, but it was only reported by Turkish media this year, after it was published in a scientific journal by the doctors who treated the patient. In early 2024, a 60-year-old shop owner was robbed while working at his store in Üsküdar, a district of Istanbul. Two masked men entered the shop after closing with the clear intention of stealing, so the owner tried to stop them. In the physical struggle that ensued, the 60-year-old managed to immobilize one of the thieves, who bit his hand hard in a desperate attempt to escape.

Overwhelmed by the pain, the shop owner had no choice but to let go of the thief, who escaped with his accomplice. Both men are still at large to this day, but the 60-year-old man is less worried about that and more thankful for having an unexpected ordeal. He went to a local clinic to have his hand wound tended to, and he was sent home after receiving the necessary medical attention. Unfortunately, his health worsened soon after, as he began experiencing fever and tremors. He went to the Sultan Abdulhamid Han Training and Research Hospital, where doctors informed him that he was suffering from an infection caused by the robber's bite.

Despite the hospital staff's best efforts to stave off the infection, the elderly man's situation worsened over the next two weeks and the infection climbed up his arm. It had changed color and swollen to double its normal size, but doctors were powerless to stop it. Faced with the risk of amputation, the hospital decided to try hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which can help wounds, especially infected ones, heal more quickly.

The doctors' bet paid off, and within a week, the patient had made significant improvements. After cleaning the wound and removing the necrotic tissue, the hospital was able to save the man's arm. After three months of physiotherapy, he regained the full function of his arm.

“Bacteria from the human oral flora can cause serious problems by penetrating the subcutaneous tissue. In this case, the patient's hand size increased significantly, complicating his recovery,” Dr. Yavuz Aslan told the Demirören News Agency (DHA).

This case is currently being documented in the medical literature, highlighting the severity of infections caused by human bites. As for the shop owner, he recently had to deal with another robbery, but this time there was no biting.

            Missouri's Republican-controlled Senate on Friday passed a new congressional map, taking final legislative action to target one of the state's Democratic seats in the US House and boost the GOP's chances of retaining its fragile majority in the chamber.
    


            The 21-11 vote came just two weeks after the state's GOP Gov. Mike Kehoe first unveiled the map and ordered a special legislative session to approve it. It targets longtime Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver by carving up his Kansas City-area district and stretching its boundaries into rural, Republican-friendly areas of central Missouri.
    


            Cleaver has pledged to fight the map in court and has said he plans to seek reelection. Opponents also intend to attempt to put the map before voters in the form of a referendum. They have 90 days after the map is signed into law to collect the signatures needed to force a statewide vote.
    


            “Together, in the courts and in the streets, we will continue pushing to ensure the law is upheld, justice prevails, and this unconstitutional gerrymander is defeated,” Cleaver said in a statement.
    


            Missouri is the latest state to undertake a mid-decade redistricting as part of an extraordinary, multi-state campaign by President Donald Trump and his allies to  preserve the balance of power in the House by changing district lines.
    


            Republicans hope to win seven of Missouri's eight congressional seats under the new map in next year's midterm elections. The GOP currently controls six seats, and Democrats hold two.
    


            Trump celebrated the new map Friday afternoon, writing on Truth Social that he hoped it would yield an additional GOP seat. “It is wonderful to see Republicans in the “Show Me State” standing up to Save our Country, and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,” he said.
    


            Democrats in the state legislature fiercely opposed the changes but could do little to stop or slow its passage because Republicans hold supermajorities in both chambers.
    


            Democratic state Sen. Stephen Webber argued during floor debate Friday that Republicans were surrendering their independence and bending to Trump's will. “We're no longer the ‘Show Me State,'” he said, referring the state's motto. “We're the ‘Yes, sir state.'”
    


            Democratic state Sen. Barbara Washington of Kansas City called the map a “blatant political attack.”
    


            “This erases the voice of our community,” she said, her voice rising with emotion. “Carving up Kansas City and silencing our constituents is terrible.”
    


            No Republican senators spoke in favor of the new lines Friday, but during the course of the special session, several GOP lawmakers argued that the map was fair. They repeatedly maintained it had originated with Kehoe's office.
    


            A group called People Not Politicians said they would file paperwork to kick off the referendum process Friday. “This fight is not over. Missouri voters — not politicians — will have the final say,” spokesperson Elsa Rainey said in a statement.
    


            Missouri is the third state in recent weeks to undertake a redistricting effort. Last month, the GOP-controlled legislature in Texas redrew lines with the goal of helping Republicans pick up five additional seats. Democrats in California have responded with their own revised map that aims to flip five Republican-held seats. It must be approved by voters this fall. Trump's allies are weighing new maps in other states, including Florida, Kansas and Indiana. Republican lawmakers in Indiana met behind closed doors this week to discuss options, according to the Indiana Capital Chronicle.
    


            Democratic governors in Illinois, New York and Maryland, meanwhile, have indicated they might respond with changes of their own to benefit their party. Should Democrats win control of the US House, the party would have the power to block Trump's agenda and launch investigations into him and the actions of his administration during the final two years he's in the Oval Office.
    


            Typically, states carry out redistricting once every decade after the Census to account for population shifts and ensure that each congressional and state legislative district holds roughly the same number of people.

President tells Fox News ‘the radicals on the left are the problem' and refuses to seek common way forward

Charlie Kirk shooting – follow the latest updates

Full report: Utah governor confirms arrest of suspect

A video, a pastor and a tense meeting: timeline of arrest

Donald Trump has declined to call for the US to come together as a way of fixing the country's divisions in the wake of the assassination of his close associate, the rightwing activist Charlie Kirk, preferring to cast “vicious and horrible” radicals on the left of US politics as the sole problem.

In an interview on Fox & Friends on Friday morning, the US president was asked what he intended to do to heal the wounds of Kirk's shooting in Utah. “How do we fix this country? How do we come back together?” he was asked by the show's co-host Ainsley Earhardt, who commented that there were radicals operating on the left and right of US politics.

Less than 48 hours after Kirk was shot in broad daylight on the campus of Utah Valley University, Trump replied: “I tell you something that is going to get me in trouble, but I couldn't care less.”

He went on: “The radicals on the right are radical because they don't want to see crime … The radicals on the left are the problem – and they are vicious and horrible and politically savvy. They want men in women's sports, they want transgender for everyone, they want open borders. The worst thing that happened to this country.”

Trump's refusal to seek a common bipartisan way forward at a time of profound national anger, fear and mourning was a stunning move for a sitting US president, even by his standards.

The US has a long history of presidents using their rhetorical powers to try to overcome political fissures. The pinnacle perhaps was Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address towards the end of the civil war, in which he sought to “bind up the nation's wounds” and made a point of striving for unity “with malice toward none, with charity for all”.

In more recent times, Joe Biden used his inaugural address in 2021, just days after the insurrection by Trump supporters at the US Capitol on January 6, to call for unity, without which, he said, “there is no peace, only bitterness and fury”.

Trump's appearance on Fox News made clear he has no intention of following that rhetorical tradition. Instead, the tenor of his response to the Kirk shooting has been hyper-partisan and grounded in retribution.

In Friday's comments, he threatened the philanthropist George Soros with a Rico investigation of the sort normally reserved for organised crime. He accused Soros of funding “professional agitators” who were engaging in “more than protest, this is real agitation, this is riots on the streets”.

In an Oval Office address delivered hours after Kirk was pronounced dead, Trump made menacing remarks indicating he would seek revenge against “organizations that fund and support” political violence. He laid blame for the current plight entirely on what he called the “radical left”.

The president has already used his second term in the White House to turn the heat up on those he regards as his political enemies. He has authorised an investigation into the main fundraising channel for the Democratic party, ActBlue, and threatened to rescind the tax-exempt status of progressive groups such as Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew) and environmental groups.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The man accused of assassinating Charlie Kirk reportedly confessed he had killed the Maga influencer.

Tyler Robinson, 22, was arrested on Thursday and is expected to be charged with aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury and obstruction of justice.

According to Spencer Cox, the governor of Utah, Mr Robinson told a family friend he was behind the shooting of the 31-year-old father of two.

After the family friend contacted law enforcement, Mr Robinson's father convinced him to turn himself in.

His dislike for Kirk, a Trump ally who spread the president's conservative message at college campuses around the country, was said to have been made clear at a family dinner.

A family member told the FBI Mr Robinson had grown increasingly political recently, Utah's republican governor Spencer Cox said at a press conference on Friday.

He had expressed a hatred for the Kirk in the days before the attack. He also mentioned that the political commentator would soon be coming to town to give a talk at Utah Valley University.

Wartime anti-fascist slogans were found engraved on unused bullet casings found after the shooting.

One read: “Bella ciao” - an Italian phrase referencing the Second World War Italian anti-fascist song Bella Ciao.

Another read “Hey fascist! Catch!”

A third inscription read: “If you read this, you are gay LMAO.”

Mr Cox said the casings were found by a rifle Robinson is alleged to have used to kill Kirk 20 minutes into his address to students.

Officers found a high-powered bolt-action rifle containing one spent cartridge and three more, unused rounds in the woods just off campus.

The alleged shooter, who had studied electrical engineering for one term at university before dropping out, is said to have discussed the shooting on the Discord messaging app.

He is alleged to have discussed details of the bullet engravings, as well as retrieving a rifle from a drop point and stashing it in a bush.

“The content of these included messages affiliated with the contact Tyler, stating a need to retrieve a rifle from a drop point, leaving the rifle in a bush, messages related to visually watching the area where a rifle was left, and a message referring to having left the rifle wrapped in a towel,” Mr Cox added.

We are closing our live coverage for today, thank you for joining us. Here are the latest developments:

Robert White writes:

Hundreds of people gathered at a vigil in memory of Charlie Kirk in central London on Friday evening.

Crowds gathered opposite Downing Street at 6pm, waving Union Flags, St George's crosses and the stars and stripes.

New Zealanders at the vigil, which was next to a statue of Field Marshal Montgomery, performed a haka, the traditional Maori dance, before the Lord's Prayer was recited.

Several Maga caps were worn by members of the crowd, while one person in attendance raised a sign reading “We are all Charlie”.

More than 20 police were patrolling the peaceful vigil, which then moved to the statue of Winston Churchill outside the Houses of Parliament.

Charlie Kirk's alleged killer changed his clothes to evade detection, officials said.

Tyler Robinson was pictured on CCTV arriving at Utah Valley University on Wednesday morning dressed in a plain maroon t-shirt, light-coloured shorts, a black hat with a white logo and light-coloured shoes, Utah governor Spencer Cox said earlier.

Pictures shared by the FBI later showed that he had changed into a black t-shirt with blue jeans and blue converse.

When encountered by investigators on Thursday evening, Robinson was wearing clothes “consistent” with those on video, the governor said.

Alleged killer Tyler Robinson's father told him to turn himself in, reports suggest.

Law enforcement sources said that Matt Robinson recognised his son from images released by the FBI.

They added that his father urged him to turn himself in after he confessed to the killing.

Kash Patel the FBI director earlier announced that Robinson was taken into custody on Thursday evening.

Gabby Giffords, the Democratic congresswoman who was shot in 2011, pleaded for tighter gun laws in a Time magazine oped following Charlie Kirk's murder.

She recalled the attempt on Donald Trump's life and the murder of Democrat politician Melissa Hortman.

“Our stories are unique, but what Charlie Kirk, president Trump, Melissa Hortman and I all have in common is that someone who wanted to kill us had a gun,” she wrote.

“I was gutted to learn that Charlie Kirk died yesterday in Utah – and it's also true that in Utah, someone dies from gun violence every 20 hours. Too many families know the pain of having a loved one killed by guns, in that state and across the country.”

Utah, she added, had lax gun laws and had seen fatal shootings increase by 45 per cent between 2014 and 2023.

More details are emerging about Tyler Robinson, the alleged killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

He does not appear to have any criminal history, according to state records reviewed by Reuters. He was a registered voter but was not affiliated with a political party, according to state voter records.

Records show he was an “inactive” voter, which means he had not cast a ballot in recent elections and had not responded to a mailing from the county clerk's office.

Robinson briefly attended Utah State University in Logan for one semester in 2021, the school confirmed to Reuters. It was not immediately clear why he left the college.

In a video posted by his mother on Facebook, Robinson can be seen reading aloud from a letter offering him a four-year scholarship from Utah State University. Another post said Robinson had earned a score of 34 on the ACT college entrance exam, which would put him in the top 1 per cent of test takers, according to the Princeton Review test preparation company.

At the time of his arrest, he was living at his family's home in Washington County, in the south-west corner of Utah near the Nevada border, Utah governor Spencer Cox said.

He has two younger brothers, according to his parents' Facebook posts. His mother is a social worker at a non-profit healthcare company, while his father's occupation was not immediately clear.

The parents of the alleged killer of Charlie Kirk were Republicans voters, records shows.

Voter registration records seen by the Telegraph show that Tyler Robinson's mother, Amber, registered as a Republican voter in 2018, during Joe Biden's presidency.

His father, Matt, registered as a Republican voter in 2000, records show.

Both registrations allegedly remain active.

US president Trump has said his 19-year-old son Barron “was very hurt” by the death of Charlie Kirk.

“He was very hurt when he saw this. But, I mean, everybody was,” Mr Trump said on “Fox & Friends.”

Mr Trump said his youngest child had admired Kirk and once asked for an introduction.

“Barron came to me and he said, ‘Dad, I'd like to meet somebody that you know, Charlie Kirk.' … I thought he was gonna say he wanted to meet like King Charles or something… and he came back said, ‘That guy's great, Dad. That guy's great.' It was cute,” Mr Trump said.

US vice president JD Vance has been pictured carrying Charlie Kirk's coffin.

Mr Vance flew to Utah to meet with Kirk's family and to fly his casket to Arizona, where he lived with his wife and family, on Air Force Two.

US vice president JD Vance has said that a “big step” was taken this morning in “getting justice for Charlie”.

Mr Vance thanked Utah officials and the FBI for their efforts to track down a suspect in Charlie Kirk's killing.

“This is a big breakthrough, and everyone who helped – from the law enforcement professionals to the people giving tips – deserves our credit and gratitude,” he wrote on X.

“We took a big step this morning in getting justice for Charlie, and for his family,” he added. “Thanks be to God for that.”

Anti-fascist slogans were inscribed on two of the unused bullet casings found after the fatal shooting of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, US authorities said Friday.

One cartridge had written on it, “Hey, fascist! Catch!”, and another featured “Bella ciao,” apparently a reference to a World War II-era Italian anti-fascist song, said Utah governor Spencer Cox.

A photo circulating online shows the Charlie Kirk assassination suspect, Tyler Robinson, dressed up in a Donald Trump costume on Halloween in 2017. He is pictured next to a man dressed up as a gunman.

One journalist asked whether Charlie Kirk's death represented a “watershed moment” for the US.

“This is a watershed moment, but we don't yet know what kind,” Spencer Cox, the Utah governor, replied.

He said this moment “feels a lot like the late 60s” and described social media as a “cancer”, adding that humans are not “biologically capable of processing... violent imagery”.

Spencer Cox, the Republican governor of Utah, has said that there is currently no information that would lead to further arrests.

Spencer Cox, the governor of Utah, has described the killing of Charlie Kirk as “an attack on the America experiment”.

“This is certainly about the tragic assassination of Charlie Kirk,” he said, adding it is “also much bigger than an attack on an individual”.

“It is an attack on all of us. It is an attack on the American experiment. It is an attack on our ideals. This cuts to the very foundation of who we are, of who we have been and, and who we could be in better times.”

An emotional Kash Patel, the director of the FBI, has paid tribute to his “friend” Charlie Kirk.

“Rest now brother, we have the watch, and I'll see you in Valhalla,” Mr Patel said.

Mr Patel described the “large” crime scene at Utah Valley University and thanked local and state authorities, who he said “processed the crime scene rapidly”.

The FBI director said he “had the ability to walk through that crime scene, and walk through the steps the suspect took to learn more about what was needed and what resources were needed to bear to create a full picture for the FBI and leadership back in Washington”.

He added: “We will continue to process evidence as we see it and as we collect it.”

Mr Cox has also just confirmed that bullets found in the weapon used by the gunman had messages engraved on them.

One message on a fired casing read: “Notices. Bulges. OWO. What's this?”

Spencer Cox, the Republican governor of Utah, has confirmed that Tyler Robinson has been arrested in connection with the death of Charlie Kirk.

“Good morning ladies and gentleman, we got him,” Mr Cox said.

One of Mr Robinson's family members told police he had become “more political” in recent months.

In a previous family dinner, Mr Robinson spoke about how much he did not like Kirk and how he was “spreading hate”, according to Mr Cox.

Several posts from Mr Robinson on Discord included details on the location of the rifle, as well as technical details about the weapon, such as its scope, Mr Cox added.

The press conference in Utah has just got underway.

We'll bring you updates as they come in. You can also watch the conference at the top of this page.

The White House has been forced to defend Kash Patel, the FBI director, who we're about to hear from in Utah.

Mr Patel had wrongly claimed that the FBI had arrested the suspect in the shooting before backtracking.

The White House said: “Director Patel is working night and day on this case. Anyone who doubts his resolve and dedication - especially when Charlie was such a close friend to him - simply is using this extremely sad moment in a disgusting act of political gamesmanship.

“The focus is justice, and this killer will face the full wrath of the justice system.”

If you're just joining us, here's what we've learned this afternoon:

We'll bring you updates shortly from Kash Patel's press conference.

The man accused of killing Charlie Kirk on a Utah university campus has been identified as Tyler Robinson.

His capture follows a two-day manhunt for the alleged gunman, who fired a single lethal shot before jumping off a roof overlooking the event and escaping.

Donald Trump, the US president, said the suspect's father helped to turn his son in after the FBI released two pictures of a “person of interest”.

Donald Trump has confirmed he will attend Charlie Kirk's funeral. 

The president had come under fire after refusing to attend the funeral of Melissa Hortman, the Democrat politician who was shot dead alongside her husband in their home in Minnesota. Police said the killings were politically motivated. 

A press conference involving Kash Patel, the FBI director, was expected to start at 9am but has been delayed by around 30 minutes, according to one official testing the microphones.

We'll bring you the latest updates as they come in.

Kash Patel will hold a press conference at 9am ET (2pm in the UK), according to Fox News.

The FBI director is expected to give an update on the alleged assassin who is said to have been turned by his father.

You will be able to watch the press conference at the top of this page. 

Charlie Kirk's suspected assassin was turned in by his father, according to Mr Trump, who is still speaking on Fox News.

The president said the “person” who recognised the suspect was a “person of faith, a minister”.

“The father convinced the son,” the president said, adding that he may need to be corrected.

Mr Trump said he hoped that Kirk's killer received the death penalty, describing the conservative activist as the “finest person…he didn't deserve this”.

Kirk was shot in front of 3,000 spectators on Wednesday afternoon as he debated university students at Utah Valley University in Orem.

Federal investigators and police on Thursday released photos and video of the person they believed to be responsible for Kirk's death.

New CCTV footage released yesterday showed the alleged assassin running across a roof at the university shortly after Kirk was killed.

Donald Trump said he found out that police had arrested Charlie Kirk's suspected assassin “five minutes before I walked in” to the Fox News studio.

The president said the person was turned in by someone “very close” to him and said he didn't know if he was part of a larger network.

He said that local authorities “did a great job, everybody worked together…It all worked out.”

The shooter fired a single shot from the top of a building near the university event where Charlie Kirk was speaking. 

CCTV footage released on Thursday showed an individual running and jumping from a building after the attack.

The suspect in the killing of Charlie Kirk is “28 or 29”, Donald Trump has said.

Beau Mason, the commissioner of the Utah Department of Public Safety, had said the suspect appeared to be college-aged, allowing him to disappear into the crowd of students after the shooting.

“We have tracked his movements on to the campus, through the stairwells up to the roof, across the roof to a shooting location,” he said on Thursday. 

“After the shooting, we were able to track his movements as he moved to the other side of the building, jumped off of the building and fled off of the campus into a neighbourhood.”

The FBI released two photographs of a “person of interest” on Thursday.

They offered a $100,000 reward for anyone with information that would lead to the killer's arrest.

The grainy picture shows a white man wearing sunglasses, a baseball hat, and a black sweatshirt that appears to feature an American flag and an eagle.

Investigators said they recovered a hunting rifle with ammunition engraved with “transgender and anti-fascist ideology” in a wooded area close to Utah Valley University.

Authorities believe the sniper fired a single lethal shot before jumping off a roof overlooking the event and escaping.

            Attorneys for Justin Baldoni said in a court filing that Taylor Swift agreed to be deposed in the ongoing civil litigation between “It Ends With Us” co-stars Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, but Swift's attorneys dispute that she ever agreed to sit for a deposition.
    


            In a letter to the court from Baldoni's legal team, filed Thursday, they wrote that Swift has agreed to be deposed in the case but was unable to do so prior to October 20, due to prior professional commitments. (Swift's 12th studio album, “The Life of a Showgirl,” is set to be released on October 3.)
    


            But in a letter to the court in response, dated Friday and obtained by CNN, an attorney for Swift said she had not agreed to be deposed and would only do so if required by the court.
    


            “Since the inception of this matter we have consistently maintained that my client has no material role in this action,” an attorney for Swift wrote.
    


            “Further, my client did not agree to a deposition, but if she is forced into a deposition, we advised (after first hearing about the deposition just three days ago) that her schedule would accommodate the time required during the week of October 20 if the parties were able to work out their disputes,” Swift's filing states. “We take no role in those disputes.”
    


            CNN has reached out to a representative for Swift for further comment.
    


            In a separate court document, also dated Friday and obtained by CNN, Lively's attorneys suggested Baldoni's legal team was seeking media attention for the case by referencing Swift.
    


            “The Wayfarer Defendants have repeatedly sought to bring Ms. Swift into this litigation to fuel their relentless media strategy. In this latest effort, the Wayfarer Defendants assert—though, notably, without evidence—that Ms. Swift has supposedly ‘agreed' to sit for a deposition sometime between October 20-25,” the filing from Lively's legal team states. “The Wayfarer Defendants do not appear to have contacted Ms. Swift's counsel regarding a date or location about the deposition until earlier this week. In this respect, the Wayfarer Defendants' lack of diligence, and disrespect for Ms. Swift's privacy and schedule, is astounding.”
    


            CNN has reached out to Lively and Baldoni's representatives for additional comment, beyond their court filings.
    


            While Baldoni's suit against Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds was dismissed, Lively is still pursuing her claims of sexual harassment and retaliation against Baldoni.
    


Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively's legal fight isn't over



            Swift – a longtime friend of Lively's – was first mentioned in connection to the dispute when text exchanges were revealed to include the name “Taylor” as part of Baldoni's since-dismissed countersuit.
    


            One of the text messages appeared to show an exchange between Baldoni and Lively about the script for a scene in “It Ends With Us”: “I really love what you did. It really does help a lot. Makes it so much more fun and interesting. (And I would have felt that way without Ryan and Taylor),” Baldoni wrote with a wink emoji. “You really are a talent across the board. Really excited and grateful to do this together.”
    


            Swift received a subpoena in the case in May that was subsequently withdrawn.
    


            “Taylor Swift never set foot on the set of this movie, she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions, she did not score the film, she never saw an edit or made any notes on the film, she did not even see ‘It Ends With Us' until weeks after its public release, and was traveling around the globe during 2023 and 2024,” a spokesperson for Swift said at the time.
    


            “The connection Taylor had to this film was permitting the use of one song, ‘My Tears Ricochet.' Given that her involvement was licensing a song for the film, which 19 other artists also did, this document subpoena is designed to use Taylor Swift's name to draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case,” the spokesperson added.
    


            Trial in the case is set for next spring in federal court in New York.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Family members of the young Utah man accused of shooting Charlie Kirk told authorities he had recently become “more political” and saw the ally of President Donald Trump as a person spreading hate, according to authorities.

Tyler James Robinson, 22, of Washington, Utah, was arrested on suspicion of aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily harm, and obstruction of justice, all felonies, according to a probable cause statement filed in court and released Friday. A judge ordered that he be held without bail.

Robinson is registered to vote but is not affiliated with a political party, according to Utah state records. He was also listed as inactive, meaning he had not voted in at least the last two general elections.

State and federal court records do not show any prior criminal cases involving him.

His listed address in the probable cause statement is the six-bedroom home of his parents, who own a granite countertop business and are registered to vote as Republicans.

It wasn't immediately clear Friday whether Robinson had a defense lawyer who could comment on his behalf. Messages seeking comment left Friday with family members including his parents received no response.

Robinson has two younger brothers and his parents have been married for about 25 years, according to social media posts. The family lives in a suburb of St. George, a city in the southern part of the state about a 3 1/2 hour drive from the Utah Valley University campus where authorities say Robinson shot and killed Kirk.

An honor roll student in high school who scored in the 99th percentile nationally on standardized tests, he was admitted to Utah State in 2021 on a prestigious academic scholarship, according to a video of him reading his acceptance letter posted to a family member's social media account. He attended for only one semester, according to a university spokesperson.




Robinson is currently enrolled as a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College in St. George.

Social media posts by Robinson's mother reflect an active family with vacations to Disneyland, Hawaii, the Caribbean and Alaska. They frequently spent time outdoors — boating, fishing, riding ATVs, zip-lining and target shooting. A 2017 post shows the family visiting a military facility and posing with assault rifles. A young Robinson is shown smiling as he grips the handles of a 50-caliber heavy machine gun.

After graduating from high school in 2021, Robinson's mother praised her eldest son for his smarts and academic success on her social media page, and both his parents helped him move into his dorm at Utah State that fall. She didn't have any public Facebook posts after 2022.

The break in the case came after a family member of Robinson reached out to a family friend with information that Robinson had “confessed” or implied involvement in the shooting, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox told reporters Friday, shortly after Robinson was taken into custody.




Cox said it is believed that Robinson acted alone. Family members said Robinson “had become more political in recent years,” Cox said, describing a recent family dinner in which Robinson mentioned that Kirk planned to speak at UVU.

“They talked about why they didn't like him and the viewpoints that he had,” Cox said, referring to Robinson and an unnamed family member. “The family member also stated Kirk was full of hate and spreading hate.”

Authorities then interviewed a friend of Robinson's who showed them a series of messages on the social media platform Discord in which Robinson discussed obtaining a gun.

When authorities took him into custody, court records show, Robinson also was wearing clothing “consistent” with surveillance photographs of the person of interest. 

Cox said ammunition found at the scene had engravings that reference meme culture and referred to fascism.

CHICAGO (AP) — A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer fatally shot a suspect who tried to evade arrest Friday in a Chicago suburb by driving his car at officers and dragging one of them, officials said.

The shooting just outside the city follows days of threats by the Trump administration to surge immigration enforcement in the nation's third-largest city and less than a week into an operation labeled “Midway Blitz” by federal officials targeting the so-called sanctuary policies in Chicago and Illinois.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a news release that the officer was trying to arrest a man who had a history of reckless driving, but he refused officers' orders and instead drove his car at them. An ICE officer who was hit and dragged by the car felt his life was threatened and opened fire, the department said. 

ICE said both the officer and the driver from the shooting in the Franklin Park suburb, about 18 miles (29 kilometers) west of Chicago, were taken to a local hospital, where the suspect was pronounced dead. 

“We are praying for the speedy recovery of our law enforcement officer. He followed his training, used appropriate force, and properly enforced the law to protect the public and law enforcement,” Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said he is aware of the shooting and demanded “a full, factual accounting of what's happened today to ensure transparency and accountability.”

Video from the scene shows police tape and traffic cones blocking off parts of the street where a large food distribution truck and gray car can be seen from a distance. Multiple law enforcement vehicles were surrounding the area.




Erendira Rendón, chief program officer at a local advocacy group called the Resurrection Project, said the shooting “shows us the real danger that militarized enforcement creates in our neighborhoods.”

“A community member is dead, and an officer was injured,” Rendón said in a statement. “These are outcomes that serve no public safety purpose and leave entire communities traumatized. ... When federal agents conduct unaccountable operations in our communities, everyone becomes less safe.”

Chicagoans, meanwhile, have been preparing for weekend Mexican Independence Day celebrations that include parades, festivals, street parties and car caravans, despite the potential immigration crackdown.

McLaughlin said that “viral social media videos and activists encouraging illegal aliens to resist law enforcement” have made the work of ICE officers more dangerous.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt condemned members of the media for being slow to report a shocking murder.

The White House unleashed on The Washington Post for its reporting on the stabbing murder of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska by a career criminal on a train in North Carolina in August. 

""White House: The career criminal who murdered Iryna Zarutska should've been locked up. Murderer's mother: My son should've been locked up. Washington Post citing 'experts': Actually, locking up violent criminals is draconian!"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted to X on Wednesday.

Leavitt was reacting to a Washington Post article titled, ""Trump blames Democrats for Charlotte stabbing. Records complicate the story,"" which detailed the White House's position that left-wing cities have created violent trends via soft-on-crime policies such as no-cash bail. The article focused on the murder of Zarutska and the suspect allegedly behind the tragedy, Decarlos Dejuan Brown Jr. 

Brown had a lengthy arrest record ahead of Zarutska's death, racking up 14 arrests over the last decade, as well as convictions including larceny and breaking and entering in 2013, and a 2015 conviction for robbery with a dangerous weapon, which landed him behind bars for six years, Fox Digital previously reported.

More recent charges included communicating threats and misuse of the 911 system earlier this year. Brown, however, was not under state supervision at the time of Zarutska's killing. 

Brown's own mother, whom the Washington Post noted in its Wednesday report, told local media that her son should have been detained at the time of the killing, and lamented the court system released him despite previous arrests and mental health concerns. The White House provided its own statement to the outlet arguing violent criminals should be detained and not out on the streets, which the Washington Post included. 

""This is not a ‘complicated issue,' like many Democrats and left-wing media outlets have tried to claim; it is very simple: violent criminals belong behind bars, not sitting behind innocent bystanders on public transportation,"" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told the Washington Post for the story in question. 

The White House took issue with the outlet, noting the mother's concern over her son's release, and Jackson's statement, before citing experts who reported to the outlet that ""permanently confining people who are mentally ill for minor offenses is a ‘draconian' and inhumane response.""

CHARLOTTE MAYOR SLAMMED OVER COMMENTS AFTER WOMAN STABBED TO DEATH ON TRAIN

""The Trump Administration will not let it go unnoticed that the failing left-wing media and out-of-touch, privileged reporters continue to bend over backwards to defend career criminals instead of the innocent victims that are murdered by these monsters,"" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Fox Digital of the media report. ""Enough is enough: the American people deserve better and that begins by acknowledging the truth about how soft-on-crime policies fuel this unacceptable violence.""

Fox News Digital reached out to The Washington Post for comment on the White House's response. 

Brown's mom, who did not identify herself, told local outlet WSOC-TV in August that her son had long struggled with mental illness, noting that he ""started saying weird things"" after his release from prison for the 2015 robbery conviction. 

""My heart goes out to the victim's family. What he did was atrocious. It was horrible. It was wrong,"" she told outlet WSOC-TV.

Ahead of the murder, Brown was charged by police for misusing the 911 system in January, when he claimed to operators that he was being controlled by a microchip, the New York Post reported. He was released from jail on cashless bail and provided a ""written promise"" to appear in court at a later date. 

There were concerns over his mental health, however, with a prosecutor questioning if Brown could proceed in the court case before a judge ordered a forensic evaluation, according to WSOC-TV. Brown was not detained despite the concerns.

His mother told the local outlet that the court should not have allowed him to be among the community, citing his mental state and previous arrests, while adding that ""the system failed him.""

The Department of Justice announced on Tuesday that it federally charged Brown with one count of committing an act causing death on a mass transportation system.

""This is madness. This monster should have been locked up, and Iryna should still be alive, but Democrat politicians, liberal judges, and weak prosecutors would rather virtue signal than lock up criminals and protect their communities,"" Leavitt said on Tuesday. ""Perhaps most shamefully of all, the majority of the media, many outlets in this room, decided that her murder was not worth reporting on originally because it does not fit a preferred narrative.""

Fox News' CB Cotton provides details on the identification of the suspect accused of killing Charlie Kirk in Utah Wednesday.

A Secret Service employee was placed on immediate leave after celebrating Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk's assassination in a social media post, Fox News Digital confirmed. 

""The U.S. Secret Service will not tolerate behavior that violates our code of conduct. This employee was immediately put on administrative leave, and an investigation has begun,"" a U.S. Secret Service spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Friday afternoon when asked about the employment status of Anthony Pough. 

Pough had celebrated Kirk's shocking assassination in a Facebook post, which included accusing the slain conservative firebrand of spewing ""racism."" 

""If you are Mourning [sic] this guy .. delete me. He spewed hate and racism on his show,"" he wrote, according to Real Clear Politics, which first reported on Pough's post on Thursday.

Real Clear Politics reported Pough was in ""Phase 2"" of his career with the agency but had not yet been assigned a detail regularly protecting President Donald Trump. The Secret Service has three phases for special agents, with Phase 2 focused on protective assignments and Phase 3 focused on ""post-protective field, protection, or headquarters assignment,"" according to the Secret Service's website. 

Pough blamed ""karma"" for Kirk's assassination in the inflammatory Facebook post.

""At the end of the day, you answer to GOD and speak things into existence. You can only circumvent karma, she doesnt [sic] leave,"" he wrote. 

Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn called for the Secret Service employee's immediate termination in a letter to Secret Service Director Sean Curran on Thursday. 

""As our nation mourns the devastating loss of Charlie Kirk, a rogue @SecretService agent posted on Facebook suggesting that he deserved to be murdered. I am calling for this agent's immediate termination. It's time to root out the rot in the Secret Service,"" she posted to X, accompanied by a screenshot of her letter to Curran. 

Kirk was attending a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday afternoon when a single shot rang out and struck Kirk in the neck. He was transported to a local hospital and was pronounced dead just hours later. 

Kirk leaves behind his wife, Erika Kirk, as well as their two children, ages 1 and 3. The Kirks married in 2021. 

Vice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance accompanied Kirk's casket back to Arizona, where he resided with his family, on Thursday via Air Force Two. 

Trump announced on Friday morning during an appearance on ""Fox & Friends"" that police had apprehended a suspect in the case. Tyler Robinson, 22, was later identified as the suspect in the assassination. 

""We got him on the evening of Sept. 11,"" Utah Gov. Spencer Cox announced Friday morning.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Ukraine is betting on this Western country to build thousands of its interceptor drones","https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-bets-on-uk-help-boost-drone-program-2025-9","Fri, 12 Sep 2025 15:31:00 GMT","

The UK is planning to mass-produce thousands of interceptor drones for Ukraine to help the embattled country fend off worsening Russian bombardments.

The first-of-its-kind deal to build Ukrainian-designed weapons in a European country further underscores the UK's leading role in supporting Kyiv's various drone programs; Britain's government also announced several other ongoing initiatives this week.

UK officials on Wednesday said the joint project — dubbed ""Octopus"" — is an advanced, low-cost interceptor drone that's designed to chase down incoming threats like drones and missiles and knock them out of the sky. This conserves much more expensive air-defense missiles for Russia's more powerful weapons.

The drones to be built in the UK were designed by Ukraine with support from UK scientists and technicians, and have already been tested in combat against Russia's Shahed-style one-way attack drones. The UK said the interceptors have been ""highly effective"" on the battlefield.

The UK said each interceptor drone will cost less than 10% to produce compared to the value of their Russian targets, estimated to be worth just tens of thousands of dollars. The goal is to make ""thousands"" a month to provide to Ukraine. The Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank estimated that each Shahed drone costs roughly $35,000.

The defense ministry declined to say which manufacturer is behind the project or where, exactly, the drones will be produced in the UK. Russia has threatened countries that provide weapons to Ukraine and has reportedly plotted to kill the CEO of a leading German arms manufacturer.

Ukrainian Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal praised the interceptors for their success against the Shaheds. ""We will scale up production, attract investment, and improve technologies to better protect our cities and civilians from air attacks,"" he said on Thursday.

Interceptor drones have emerged as a key air defense tool for Ukraine in recent months as Russia expands its nightly drone attacks. In July, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy set a goal for companies to produce 1,000 of these drones a day, pushing manufacturers to scale up production to keep pace with Moscow, which has invested heavily in the production of one-way attack drones.

Russia has significantly expanded the main factory where it produces variants of the Iranian-designed Shahed-136, and has built new drone launch sites. Moscow is already capable of sending hundreds of them into Ukraine in a single night; some Western assessments suggest this figure could soar to 2,000.

Project Octopus comes just months after UK and Ukrainian leaders announced a new industrial partnership between the two countries, and after European countries were forced to scramble to respond to an unprecedented Russian drone incursion into Poland.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Wednesday that Britain and its allies would ""step up"" support to Kyiv amid Moscow's unrelenting bombardments. He called the new partnership ""a landmark moment, bringing together British and Ukrainian ingenuity to deliver cutting-edge defense drone technology to fight back against Russian aggression.""

According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, the UK is the third-highest provider of military aid to Ukraine, having allocated nearly 14 billion euros ($16.5 billion) since Russia's full-scale invasion began in February 2022. Only Germany ($19.4 billion) and the US ($75.4 billion) have sent more security assistance.

Project Octopus is not the only area where the UK is helping provide Ukraine with much-needed drone support.

On Tuesday, Britain's defense ministry said it will fund the delivery of thousands of UK-made long-range attack drones — essentially cruise missiles that can be remotely piloted to their targets — which are considered ""vital"" for Ukraine's defense, over the next year. The Trump administration, by contrast, has signaled it won't provide Ukraine with longer-range missiles like the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS.

This initiative is part of the UK-led International Fund for Ukraine, which turns contributions from partner nations into high-priority military equipment for Kyiv.

Ukraine has used long-range drones to carry out deep strikes into Russia, targeting high-value military and energy targets sometimes hundreds of miles behind the front lines. These include key air bases, ammunition depots, weapons production facilities, and oil terminals.

This campaign initially emerged as a way for Ukraine to work around restrictions set in place by Western countries, which barred Kyiv from using the powerful cruise and ballistic missiles that they had donated to strike inside Russia. These restrictions have since been loosened, with the exception of the US.

Meanwhile, Ukraine's largest drone manufacturer, Ukrspecsystems, announced plans last week to invest £200 million ($271 million) in two new UK facilities, a plan that will create hundreds of local jobs.

""It marks the first major investment by a Ukrainian defence company into the UK,"" John Healey, the UK defense minister, said during his closing speech at the Defence and Security Equipment International expo on Thursday.

Polymarket, a popular betting platform for real-world events, is raising new funding that would sharply increase the startup's valuation, according to two people with knowledge of the matter not authorized to speak publicly.

Investor demand has intensified as Polymarket appears to be readying for a US launch. The valuation has been fluctuating, though it will likely at least triple the $1 billion it reached in a round that closed only this summer, the people said.

At least one investor offered a term sheet valuing the company at as much as $10 billion, one of the people said.

A spokesperson for Polymarket declined to comment.

Polymarket was founded in 2020 by Shayne Coplan and gained prominence during the 2024 US presidential election, when it accurately predicted a win for Donald Trump while most traditional polls showed him losing. It also allows traders to bet on sports outcomes and pop culture events, like the engagement of Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift.

The prediction market has even spawned other apps tracking volatility on the site.

But for all its popularity, Polymarket has not been allowed to operate in the US.

Earlier this month, Coplan posted on X that regulators had given the company ""the green light to go live in the USA.""

The announcement came after Donald Trump Jr. joined Polymarket's advisory board in August, and the firm where he is a partner, 1789 Capital, made a strategic investment in the company.

""Polymarket is the largest prediction market in the world, and the U.S. needs access to this important platform,"" Trump Jr said in a statement announcing the investment.

Peter Thiel's Founder's Fund led the company's last round of financing at a $1 billion valuation, bringing total funding to $255 million, according to Pitchbook.

Ethereum could be headed for its strongest cycle yet, according to analysts at CryptoQuant.

At the time of writing, Ethereum has been changing hands for $4,603 after having gained nearly 4% in the past day and over 7% compared to this time last week, according to crypto price aggregator CoinGecko.

CryptoQuant Head of Research Julio Moreno credits institutional demand—from treasury companies and spot ETFs—and a steep uptick in staking as primary drivers boosting the price of ETH.

“This synchronized accumulation indicates that Ethereum is increasingly viewed as a long-term strategic asset by large capital allocators, similar to Bitcoin's trajectory post-ETF approval,” Moreno wrote. “This level of institutional endorsement provides a robust long-term tailwind for Ethereum's price and perceived legitimacy.”

It's normal during big bull runs to see whales wake up and sell at least a portion of their holdings to take profits. After all, multi-year whales are usually sitting on substantial paper profits. But despite the bullish price action waking a few Ethereum whales, several woke up to buy more—and at least one large scale holder moved $645 million in ETH so they could stake it.

“Meanwhile, exchange inflows have declined, easing selling pressure, but realized price bands indicate ETH is approaching historically significant price resistance,” he wrote in a report shared with Decrypt, adding that “consolidation or correction is likely unless ETH decisively breaks above this band.”

Momentum is building among users on Myriad, a prediction market owned by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN, that Ethereum will surge to $5,000 before it pulls back to $3,500. Optimists who think ETH will reach $5,000 have grown from about 61% at the start of the week to 73% at the time of writing. Over the same period, Ethereum's price has increased by about 7%.

There are also signs that futures traders are feeling more certain of where ETH could be headed.

Open interest, which is a measure of outstanding futures and options contracts on derivatives exchanges, has increased 3.4% in the past day. Total ETH open interest now sits at $62.45 billion, according to crypto analytics platform CoinGlass.

Today Tether unveiled its planned USAT stablecoin, an onshore digital currency that aims to be compliant with the GENIUS Act. Tether's main stablecoin has a market capitalization of $169 billion, but the current makeup of its reserves would not comply with the new legislation. For example, some of Tether's reserves are in Bitcoin, gold and commercial loans. Tether also revealed the appointment of Bo Hines, former Executive Director of the White House Crypto Council, as the future USAT CEO.

It was previously announced that Hines was joining Tether following his White House departure, but not that his role would be CEO of the US subsidiary. This shuffling of positions could add fuel to the ongoing ethical objections by Democrats, which risk is a distraction that risks delaying legislation for crypto market infrastructure.

Beyond the political implications, Tether faces practical challenges in establishing credibility for USAT. The onshore Tether ideally needs to have a different team to the current one,  given Tether's previous infractions. Tether notoriously made mis-statements about the backing of its stablecoin when it lent a substantial proportion of its reserves to a sister company with a hole in its balance sheet. As a result, it was sanctioned by both the State of New York and the CFTC. Since that period, Tether has become enormously profitable, earning $13 billion in 2024.

To help with shortcutting the legal process, USAT will not issue the coin itself, but will partner with Anchorage, the first, and currently only, national digital asset trust bank, although several other applications for a trust charters are now in progress.

Child's Death Shows How Measles in the Brain Can Kill Years after an Infection

A child in Los Angeles County has died from a rare but always fatal brain disorder that develops years after a measles infection. Experts underscore the need for vaccination to protect the most vulnerable

A school-aged child in Los Angeles County has died from a rare but always fatal complication from a measles infection they acquired when they were an infant who was too young to be vaccinated. The first dose of the vaccine is typically not administered until one year of age. Experts say the death underscores the need for high levels of vaccination in a population to protect the most vulnerable against the disease, as well as from side effects that can occur long after the initial illness has passed.

“This case is a painful reminder of how dangerous measles can be, especially for our most vulnerable community members,” said Los Angeles County Health Officer Muntu Davis in a recent statement.

The child who died suffered from subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a progressive brain disorder that usually develops two to 10 years after a measles infection. The measles virus appears to mutate into a form that avoids detection by the immune system, allowing it to hide in the brain and eventually destroy neurons.

“It's just a virus that goes unchecked and destroys brain tissue, and we have no therapy for it,” said Walter Orenstein, an epidemiologist and professor emeritus at Emory University, to Scientific American earlier this year.

People with SSPE experience a gradual, worsening loss of neurological function and usually die within one to three years after diagnosis, according to the Los Angeles County Health Department. The disorder affects only about one in every 10,000 people who contract measles. But the risk may be as high as about one in 600 for those who are infected as infants.

“There is no treatment for this. Children who suffer from this will always die,” said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, in a previous interview with Scientific American. Offit, who had measles himself in the 1950s, has seen five or 10 cases of SSPE in his career.

SSPE is one of several side effects of measles that go beyond the coughing, runny nose and characteristic rash of the original infection. Measles can also cause encephalitis, a faster-occurring brain inflammation, in one in every 1,000 people who are infected because the virus causes the immune system to attack a protein produced by certain brain cells. This inflammation kills about one in five people who develop it.

Measles also causes “immune amnesia”: the virus seems to attack the immune system's B cells, which remember previous pathogens the body has been exposed to, resulting in reduced immunity. There is some evidence this effect can last for a couple of years, making those who get measles more susceptible to other infectious diseases.

These side effects are of particular concern because the measles virus is highly contagious—an order of magnitude more than seasonal influenza. With measles, viral particles emitted by coughing or sneezing can linger in a room for hours after the infected person has left. One infected person infects 15 more people on average.

This year the U.S. saw its largest single measles outbreak since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000;the recent outbreak occurred mainly in Texas, New Mexico, Kansas and Oklahoma. Most of those infected were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. Of those infected, 12 percent were hospitalized, and three died of complications from the infection. The fatal cases included the first death of a child from measles in the U.S. in 22 years.

Measles used to infect three million to four million people in the nation every year until vaccines became available in 1963.

The measles vaccine is administered in two doses: typically, the first is given between 12 and 15 months of age and the second is given at four to six years. One dose is 93 percent effective at protection against infection, and two doses are 97 percent effective.

Contrary to claims by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., measles cannot be treated by vitamin A or cod liver oil. There is no cure or treatment for the disease beyond treatment of symptoms. The only effective means of combatting measles is widespread vaccination. At least 95 percent of a population must be vaccinated to prevent the spread of the disease and to protect either those who are too young to receive it or those who cannot be vaccinated because of other health conditions.

“Infants too young to be vaccinated rely on all of us to help protect them through community immunity,” Davis said in his recent statement. “Vaccination is not just about protecting yourself—it's about protecting your family, your neighbors, and especially children who are too young to be vaccinated.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Scientists Just Proved Einstein and Hawking Right About Black Holes","https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/deep-space/a66042152/high-res-black-hole-merger/","Fri, 12 Sep 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

Ten years after the first gravitational wave detection, a new suite of instruments has captured distinctive ringing signals before and after a black hole merger.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Black holes—whether in their stellar, intermediate, or supermassive sizes—are among the most fascinating objects in the universe. They also happen to be some of the hardest to study. After all, how do you analyze an object with such massive gravity that not even light can escape? 

Well, in 2015, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) provided a compelling option by detecting the very first gravitational wave, one that happened to be the result of two black holes colliding long ago. For such a cataclysmic cosmic event, the resulting “chirp” of the collision doesn't sound like much to the uninitiated. But to astrophysicists studying black holes, the ringing frequencies of these mergers—both leading up to and following the collision—can provide an immense amount of information. 

Due to technological limitations at the time, records from the original 2015 merger didn't contain enough data to confirm two prominent black hole theories: The idea that black holes could be described by just mass and spin, and Stephen Hawking's area theorem—that a black hole's event horizon can only grow over time. 

After a decade of improving detection technologies and methods, scientists finally have “an exquisitely detailed view of the signal both before and after the black hole merger,” Maximiliano Isi, an astrophysicist at the Flatiron Institute's Center for Computational Astrophysics, said in a press statement. Isi, along with dozens of other members of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaborations, published a study in the journal Physical Review Letters detailing this new high-fidelity “ringing” data on black hole mergers. This study builds upon Isi's previous work, which tried to isolate these deep-space tones using the 2015 data. 

“This is the clearest view yet of the nature of black holes,” Isi said. “We've found some of the strongest evidence yet that astrophysical black holes are the black holes predicted from Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity.”

In this new paper, scientists analyzed another black hole merger (GW250114), which formed a black hole with a mass of 63 Suns and spun at a stunning 100 revolutions per second. Being the “clearest gravitational wave signal to date,” according to the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, the authors were able to actually “hear” both black holes growing as they merged into one, confirming both Hawking's area theorem and the Kerr metric (describing black holes using only mass and spin). 

Confirmation of Hawking's area theorem draws parallels to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which states that entropy must increase or remain constant over time. The authors suggest that by probing the thermodynamics of black holes, we could learn more about about even bigger cosmic mysteries—most notably, quantum gravity. 

“It's really profound that the size of a black hole's event horizon behaves like entropy,” Isi said in a press statement. “It has very deep theoretical implications and means that some aspects of black holes can be used to mathematically probe the true nature of space and time.”

In the next decade, gravitational wave detectors will be 10 times more sensitive than they are today, and plans are already in motion to build LIGO's successor, known as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), which will investigate gravitational waves at even lower frequencies (including those originating from supermassive black holes). 

For more than a century, the study of black holes has been largely theoretical, but the ever-increasing fidelity of gravitational wave detectors is revealing a once-hidden part of the universe.

Trophoblast organoids can provide crucial insights into mechanisms of placentation, however their potential is limited by highly variable extracellular matrices unable to reflect in vivo tissues. Here, we present a bioprinted placental organoid model, generated using the first trimester trophoblast cell line, ACH-3P, and a synthetic polyethylene glycol (PEG) matrix. Bioprinted or Matrigel-embedded organoids differentiate spontaneously from cytotrophoblasts into two major subtypes: extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) and syncytiotrophoblasts (STBs). Bioprinted organoids are driven towards EVT differentiation and show close similarity with early human placenta or primary trophoblast organoids. Inflammation inhibits proliferation and STBs within bioprinted organoids, which aspirin or metformin (0.5 mM) cannot rescue. We reverse the inside-out architecture of ACH-3P organoids by suspension culture with STBs forming on the outer layer of organoids, reflecting placental tissue. Our bioprinted methodology is applicable to trophoblast stem cells. We present a high-throughput, automated, and tuneable trophoblast organoid model that reproducibly mimics the placental microenvironment in health and disease.

Organoids derived from single cells offer a powerful model for studying organ-like structures that recapitulate key features of native tissues1. However, their widespread reliance on animal-derived matrices such as Matrigel introduces variability and limits reproducibility, hindering biological insights and translational potential2,3. Given the critical role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in guiding cell behaviour, including differentiation, organisation and function, there is a pressing need for tuneable, biologically relevant alternatives4,5,6,7,8. Emerging bioprinting technologies, including extrusion and droplet-based methods, enable precise deposition of cells within natural or synthetic hydrogels, offering scalable and reproducible platforms for 3D cell culture that are capable of supporting high-throughput workflows4. The placenta plays a vital role in supporting foetal development, and its dysfunction is implicated in numerous pregnancy complications, including preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), miscarriage, preterm birth, stillbirth, placental accreta, increta and percreta5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. These conditions not only affect pregnancy outcomes but also have long-term health implications for both mother and child, increasing the risk of future cardiovascular, endocrine and neurological diseases15,16. Despite this, treatment options remain limited and deeper insights into placental biology are urgently needed.

Placental organoids, first described in 2018, offer a promising model for studying early placental development and the pathogenesis of pregnancy complications17,18. While current protocols have advanced our understanding, they often rely on Matrigel, primary tissue from pregnancy terminations or invasive chorionic villous sampling, and costly media components, limiting reproducibility and accessibility19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29. Additionally, many trophoblast organoids display an inverted cellular architecture, hindering the study of key physiological processes, including diffusion across placental surfaces and cell secretions.

In this study, we evaluate the organoid-forming potential of the immortalised first-trimester trophoblast cell line, ACH-3P, using both traditional Matrigel embedding and droplet-on-demand bioprinting with a synthetic, polyethylene glycol (PEG) based matrix. Organoids form in both conditions and differentiate into major trophoblast subtypes, with matrix composition influencing lineage specification: Matrigel driving organoids towards syncytialisation and PEG promoting an EVT phenotype.

We further apply our bioprinted organoids to model inflammatory conditions and assess the effects of current and emerging therapies for preeclampsia, aspirin and metformin30,31,32. We report that these treatments at 0.5 mM concentration cannot rescue the impact on organoid metabolic activity or the reduction in STBs. To better mimic placental architecture, we implement a suspension method that reverses organoid polarity, promoting syncytialisation at the outer surface. Finally, we demonstrate that trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) form organoids in both matrices, although growth is restricted in the stiffer PEG matrix using bioprinting.

Our findings underscore the importance of matrix properties in guiding organoid architecture and trophoblast differentiation, offering an automated, precise, scalable and reproducible platform for studying placental development and high-throughput drug testing for placental dysfunction disorders, including preeclampsia and IUGR.

Firstly, we performed a matrix selection to determine which PEG matrix is optimal for ACH-3P organoid formation by comparing three 1.1 kPa PEG formulations: (i) a blank matrix with no adhesion peptides, (ii) a matrix containing α- and β-laminin peptide chains (IKVAV and YIGSR), and (iii) a matrix containing collagen type I peptide mimetic (GFOGER) based on proteins expressed in human placental tissue19,20,33. These were manufactured and provided by a company called Inventia Life Sciences in Australia without any further modification; thus, reproducibility is ensured through the manufacturer's QC methods for any lab utilising the RASTRUM bioprinting platform. The matrix components are tailored to the placental microenvironment by matching the stiffness and ECM components of the placental tissue and underlying decidua basalis21. A matrix stiffness of 1.1 kPa provides an initial scaffold that supports cell organisation into tissue structures, which are expected to progressively stiffen beyond the parameters defined by the starting matrix. ACH-3P cells formed significantly more organoids (15.7 ± 0.9) in the blank PEG matrix compared with those containing IKVAV and YIGSR (8.6 ± 0.7) or GFOGER (9.5 ± 0.7) peptides (Supplementary Fig. 1a–d; ****p < 0.001). No significant difference in cell viability was observed between synthetic matrix conditions (blank 72.1% ± 3.7 vs. IKVAV and YIGSR 70.7% ± 2.5 vs. GFOGER 59.8% ± 5.7, p = 0.151; Supplementary Fig. 1d). For this reason, the blank PEG formulation was chosen for the subsequent bioprinting experiments.

ACH-3P cells embedded in Matrigel or bioprinted matrix spontaneously formed organoids within 3–4 days in growth medium used for basic 2D culture (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Movies 1 and 2). Bright-field imaging revealed that morphologically, organoids grown in Matrigel had prominent pseudopodia projecting from their outer surface and individual cells were also seen budding from organoids, both consistent with described features of EVT organoids (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1e). In comparison, bioprinted organoids did not appear to project pseudopodia into the matrix, instead they were observed invading through the matrix microenvironment, often fusing upon contact (Supplementary Movie 2). There was no significant difference in 2D area between the Matrigel and bioprinted organoids (31,355 µm2 ± 4806 vs. 27012 µm2 ± 4152, Fig. 1b, c). Cell viability was assessed using calcein AM (live) and ethidium homodimer-III (dead) staining, revealing a significant increase in the proportion of live cells in Matrigel compared to bioprinted organoids (Fig. 1d, e and Supplementary Fig. 1f; 92.93% ± 1.9 vs. 48.00% ± 7.2, **p = 0.004). However, incubation with a resazurin-based solution, Alamar Blue, revealed that both Matrigel and bioprinted organoids were metabolically active (Fig. 1f; 2829 ± 30.7 vs. 2516 ± 149.3, p = 0.109). When assessed over time, the metabolic activity and proliferation of cells in both conditions were seen to increase over time, with Matrigel organoids demonstrating a steep incline in cell activity (Supplementary Fig. 1g). Organoid-conditioned medium collected from Matrigel and bioprinted organoids tested positive for β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) using over-the-counter pregnancy tests (Fig. 1g).

Organoids were investigated for the presence of trophoblast subtypes by whole-organoid immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. E-cadherin, a marker of cytotrophoblasts (CTBs), was present extensively throughout the organoids grown in Matrigel and bioprinted conditions (Fig. 1h). EVTs were detected on the periphery of both Matrigel and bioprinted organoids with no significant difference in the number of human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G)+ trophoblasts between each condition (Fig. 1h, i; 12.33% ± 0.8 vs. 11.23% ± 3.7, p = 0.784). Single β-hCG+ cells and syncytialised clusters were seen sporadically throughout the organoids, representing the STB subtype (Supplementary Movie 3). Image analysis of DAPI-labelled organoids revealed no significant difference in the number of β-hCG+ nuclei between Matrigel and bioprinted organoids (Fig. 1h, i; 10.37% ± 2.6 vs. 9.23% ± 2.1, p = 0.753).

Organoid staining with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) allowed further visualisation of the cellular organisation and architecture of organoids, and processing of whole matrix plugs provided the opportunity to view organoids in situ. Organoid sectioning revealed cavities in the inner cores of organoids (Fig. 1j and Supplementary Fig. 1h). While cavities were seen in both groups, the bioprinted organoids generally appeared more compact and contained fewer cavities. Areas of syncytialisation were observed in organoids from both groups (Fig. 1j).

Organoid transcriptomes were profiled to screen for trophoblast subtypes within Matrigel and bioprinted organoids at the single-cell level using the 10x Genomics Chromium platform. After quality control and normalisation, a total of 6081 cells and 17,159 genes were retained for subsequent analysis of Matrigel and bioprinted organoid samples. As previously established by the creators of the ACH-3P cell line22, these cells are devoid of vimentin, stably express Cyk7 and contain an HLA-G-expressing population of EVTs, which is consistent with our results (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) analysis of Matrigel and bioprinted organoids was performed to further elucidate the populations of trophoblast subtypes. Through manual annotation based on published markers, the three major trophoblast cell types, including CTB, STB, and EVT, were identified (Fig. 2a): the proportion of CTB cells in each sample remained consistent, at 44% in Matrigel and 43% in bioprinted organoids. Although the EVT population made up 33% of cells in Matrigel organoids, they contributed a higher proportion at 54% in bioprinted organoids. In addition, the STB population formed 22% of cells in Matrigel organoids but only 3% of bioprinted.

In further investigations, we observed two additional subclusters—a metal regulating CTB and maturing EVT population—totalling five distinct cell clusters (Fig. 2b). Single cell ordering by pseudotime trajectory analysis was performed to track the relatedness and differentiation of trophoblast subtypes, using SPINT1 expression as the origin point and root of cell differentiation (Fig. 2c)23. A differentiation pathway emerged from the major CTB cluster down two main arms: one extending to the EVT subtypes and another extending to the STB cluster.

The CTB clusters were characterised by their increased expression of paternally expressed gene 10 (PEG10), integrin alpha-6/beta-1 (ITGA6) and cadherin 1 (CDH1) genes (Fig. 2b, d and e). A metal-regulating CTB subcluster (CTB_2) was distinguished by increased expression of metallothionein 2A (MT2A), a metal transporter protein (Fig. 2b and f).

The EVT clusters progressively displayed less PEG10, ITGA6 and CDH1, with increasing expression of EVT markers, integrin subunit alpha 5 (ITGA5), HLA-G and matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2) (Fig. 2d and g). One EVT cluster (EVT_1) displayed increased expression of proliferation marker, ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1), and retained a high G2M phase profile (Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 2b, c). This suggests it may represent a progenitor population of cells transitioning from CTB to maturing EVTs. The second EVT subcluster (EVT_2) displayed increased expression of Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3 (EBI3), an interleukin 27 subunit shown to have roles in maternal immune tolerance during pregnancy (Fig. 2i)24,25,26,27. The EVT_2 subcluster also expressed increasing levels of integrin subunit alpha-1 (ITGA1), a marker of mature EVTs (Fig. 2d).

On the other hand, the STB cluster showed increased gene expression of STB markers including chorionic gonadotropin subunit beta 3 (CGβ3), endogenous retrovirus group FRD member 1 (ERVFRD-1), SDC1, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) and matrix metallopeptidase 15 (MMP15) (Fig. 2d, j, k). Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis revealed expression differences in the main cell clusters depending on their organoid type of origin (Supplementary Fig. 2d).

To determine how confidently our Matrigel- and bioprint-derived trophoblast organoids recapitulate in vivo trophoblast biology, we compared the single-cell transcriptomes of CTB, EVT and STB in our organoids with (i) two primary placental tissue transcriptomes—the first-trimester chorionic villus (8–12-week) dataset28 and an independent 6-week placenta dataset29, and (ii) a published patient-derived trophoblast organoid scRNA-seq dataset34. MetaNeighbor analysis35, which ranks cross-dataset cell-type relatedness by the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC), revealed strong concordance across all comparisons. Using an a priori threshold of AUROC > 0.88 to denote high similarity, each of CTB, EVT, and STB from our organoids formed exclusive, high-confidence links with their cognate in vivo counterparts in every reference dataset, while non-matched pairings remained below background (<0.5) (Fig. 2l and Supplementary Fig. 2e–g). Collectively, the genetic comparisons to in vivo trophoblasts demonstrate that our ACH-3P organoid system preserves the key transcriptional identities of primary placental trophoblast lineages. This finding supports its utility as an experimental placental tissue platform that closely recapitulates the human placenta and can be used to elucidate mechanisms of placentation and as a drug screening platform for placental dysfunction disorders such as preeclampsia.

Following a screening of trophoblast transcriptomes, we further analysed the expression profiles of Matrigel and bioprinted organoids at the protein level. Matrigel or bioprinted organoids were isolated from their matrices and characterised alongside 2D cultured ACH-3P cells and Matrigel matrix using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 4984 proteins were detected across all samples and z-scores mapped (Fig. 3a). There were only 33 proteins significantly upregulated in Matrigel organoids compared to bioprinted, while 1.238 proteins were significantly upregulated in bioprinted compared to Matrigel organoids (Fig. 3b and c). When searched in Reactome (https://reactome.org/), this corresponded to a significant upregulation of 2 pathways in Matrigel organoids, namely the biosynthesis of ubiquinol and haem. On the other hand, 114 biological pathways (p < 0.05) were upregulated in bioprinted organoids, with many relating to mRNA processing.

(ISG15 p = 0.0344; SCD p = 0.0033; SNX2 p = 0.0067; CDH1 p = 0.0089; Ki67 p = 0.0124; HLA-G p < 0.0001; ITGA5 p = 0.0274; QSOX1 p = 0.0161). All protein mass spectrometry raw data is available in a ProteomeXchange partner repository with identifier PXD056796.

Though a distinct TSC population was not noted at the transcriptome level, proteomic analysis revealed a significant increase in TSC markers such as ubiquitin-like interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) and sorting nexin-2 (SNX2) in bioprinted compared to Matrigel organoids (Fig. 3d). There was also a significant increase in abundance of CTB marker, CDH1, and proliferation marker, Ki67, in bioprinted organoids. Consistent with the scRNAseq data, bioprinted organoids had a greater abundance of EVT proteins, including HLA-G, ITGA5 and quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase 1 (QSOX1). Interestingly, there were no significant differences observed in the protein abundance of STB markers. Syncytin 2 (SYCY2), 3 beta- and steroid delta-isomerase 1 (3BHS1) or cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily A member 1 (CP19A), between Matrigel and bioprinted organoids. In fact, the Matrigel expressions of these markers were highly variable between repeats.

To establish a preeclampsia-like organoid model, bioprinted organoids were initially screened against varying concentrations of TNFα (1, 5, 20 ng/ml), an inflammatory cytokine that is highly expressed in women with preeclampsia (Supplementary Fig. 3)30. While there was no significant difference in the number (p = 0.520), size (p = 0.244) or organoid viability (p = 0.890) between control or TNFα (1, 5, 20 ng/ml) groups (Supplementary Fig. 3a–c), and all concentrations of TNF-α reduced organoid proliferation (p < 0.05; Supplementary Fig. 3d); the concentration of C reactive protein (CRP) secreted by organoids exposed to 20 ng/ml TNFα was around 25× higher than all other groups (Supplementary Fig. 3e), demonstrating an inflammatory status. For this reason, we proceeded with 20 ng/ml TNFα. Aspirin is prescribed prophylactically to women at high risk of developing preeclampsia due to its established effects in preventing preterm preeclampsia (delivery <37 weeks)31. On the other hand, therapeutics already deemed safe for pregnancy, such as metformin, are being assessed for their repurposing capacity to treat severe preeclampsia with promising results and can ameliorate stress-induced placental cell dysfunction32,36,37.

Bioprinted organoids were used for a drug screening with aspirin (0.5 mM) or metformin (0.5 mM) to investigate their ability to ameliorate inflammation-induced (TNFα 20 ng/ml) trophoblast dysfunction in the context of preeclampsia (Fig. 4a). Although there was a statistically significant difference across all the groups in the organoid number (Fig. 4b; p = 0.043), post-hoc tests showed no differences between any groups. Organoid size remained similar across different organoid conditions (Fig. 4c; p = 0.109). Trophoblast organoid metabolic activity or proliferation was reduced from Day 9 onwards following TNF-α or aspirin/metformin treatment (Fig. 4d, e; p < 0.01), which was not rescued by aspirin (p < 0.001) or metformin (p < 0.01) and aligned with our previous findings in 2D culture36. Furthermore, we also determine the impact TNF-α ± aspirin/metformin treatment has on inflammatory markers, CRP and interleukin 6 (Il-6). CRP was significantly higher in organoid media containing TNF-α compared to all other conditions, which was substantially reduced in the presence of aspirin/metformin possibly suggesting that aspirin/metformin can reduce inflammation associated with trophoblast organoids (Fig. 4f). Although there were no statistically significant differences across the groups in Il-6 gene expression within trophoblast organoids, Il-6 gene expression is overall lower in the presence of TNF-α + aspirin, compared to TNF-α alone, which was not applicable to metformin (Fig. 4g). Next, we investigated the impact TNF-α ± aspirin/metformin had on ACH-3P cytotrophoblast differentiation within organoid culture (Fig. 4h–j). Interestingly, the number of β-hCG+ STBs was reduced in all groups (p < 0.05) except TNF-α + metformin (p = 0.07), compared to control (Fig. 4h, j), suggesting the presence of STB stress induced by TNF-α, which was not restored by aspirin/metformin at 0.5 mM concentration. On the other hand, no changes in the number of HLA-G+ EVTs were observed following treatment with aspirin/metformin and/or TNF-α (Fig. 4i, j).

To reverse the polarity and organisation of trophoblast subtypes within organoids, we harvested 3-day-old organoids from their respective conditions and cultured them in suspension for up to 12 or 28 days. In the absence of a matrix to confine them, suspended organoids grew comparably larger over time and were occasionally seen fusing together (Fig. 5a). Further to this, since there was no adhesive matrix present to interact with, the organoids retrieved from both gel conditions displayed spherical morphology. Histological processing also revealed that internal cavities continued to increase in size as organoids grew (Fig. 5b).

To examine the inversion of cellular organisation within the suspended organoids, another marker of STBs, syndecan-1 (SDC-1), was immunolabelled and imaged in whole organoids. Individual z slices of representative organoids are presented in Fig. 5c. SDC-1 expressing cells were observed on the periphery of organoids grown in suspension, with areas of syncytialisation depicted by arrows. Higher resolution images reveal the potential presence of a microvillus brush border on the outer edge of these syncytialised regions (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Suspended organoids were also immunolabelled for E-cadherin, HLA-G and β-hCG to confirm the presence of each trophoblast subtype (Supplementary Fig. 4b).

Organoids grown in Matrigel or bioprinted conditions were harvested from the matrices after 3 days before transferring to a low-attachment plate for suspension culture. a Live cell images of gel-embedded and suspended organoids at days 12 (D12) and 28 (D28); scale bar = 100 µm.

Arrows depict syncytialised areas on the outer surface of organoids. Scale bar = 100 µm. Suspension of organoids was independently repeated twice.

To assess the translation of our bioprinting conditions to TSC organoid formation, we manually embedded CT29 ‘Okae' TSC line in Matrigel or bioprinted cells in the same blank 1.1 kPa matrix. Organoids formed in both conditions, but they were significantly smaller in the bioprinted matrix, even after stimulation with STB or EVT differentiation medium (STB-DM and EVT-DM, respectively; Fig. 6a, b). Organoids from both conditions secreted β-hCG (Fig. 6c). There was also a significant reduction in organoid formation efficiency in bioprinted conditions (Fig. 6d). Both Matrigel-embedded and bioprinted organoids could differentiate into SDC-1+ STB organoids, and HLA-G+ EVT organoids under predefined medium (Fig. 6e–g). There was no difference in the number and size between undifferentiated trophoblast organoid medium (TOM), STB-DM or EVT-DM treated organoids within each condition (Fig. 6e, f). However, within bioprinting conditions, ‘rich' matrix containing fibronectin, laminin, collagen IV peptides, laminin-511 and hyaluronic acid increased the number (p < 0.0001) and size (p < 0.05–0.001) of TSC-derived organoids compared to either subtype alone bioprinted with ‘blank' PEG matrix (Fig. 6f).

Early placental development is a complex and tightly regulated process that can be disrupted in various pregnancy complications. 3D cultures of cells from the maternal-foetal interface provide tools to understand the elusive mechanisms dictating placental physiology more thoroughly and screen potential treatments38. In this study, we describe the generation of trophoblast organoids from the ACH-3P first-trimester trophoblast cell line and TSCs within Matrigel or bioprinted into a synthetic, PEG-based matrix. Bioprinting offers an innovative opportunity to produce low-cost, high-throughput and reproducible organoid models with high precision and resolution. Here, we aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of bioprinting trophoblast organoids and assess the impact of ECM on trophoblast differentiation.

Establishing the most appropriate matrix environment for 3D placental models is crucial, given the growing recognition of mechanical cues and cell–matrix interactions influencing stem cell differentiation, trophoblast fusion and trophoblast spheroid formation39. Alternative natural and synthetic hydrogels, such as PEG-based formulations, have been gaining attention for their tuneable composition and stiffness properties40. Based on our initial matrix selection, we demonstrated increased ACH-3P organoid formation efficiency within a naked PEG matrix containing no adhesion peptides or proteins. This condition may be due to the production of ECM components by trophoblasts, both degrading and contributing to the ECM environment they embed and invade into41. In fact, the decidua basalis, where trophoblasts embed within the uterus, has a reported stiffness of 1.25 kPa, likely due to the trophoblast deposition of ECM components including laminin, fibronectin, collagen IV, heparan sulfate, and fibrillin 121.

Within both Matrigel and bioprinted PEG and basic growth medium, ACH-3P single cells gave rise to organoids that grew steadily over time with no observable differences in size. Both Matrigel and bioprinted organoids contained the three major trophoblast subtypes of CTBs, EVTs and STBs as shown by immunofluorescence labelling. This is consistent with the results of recent work comparing the organoid formation of ACH-3Ps alongside HTR-8/SVneo and Swan-71 trophoblast cell lines in Matrigel42. Despite rapid organoid formation, bioprinted cultures encountered reduced viability, likely due to shear stress applied to the cells during bioprinting, an important consideration for primary cell work. Alternatively, this result may highlight a need to further elucidate the ECM composition and stiffness requirements at different stages of organoid expansion and differentiation, as investigated in intestinal organoids43. Transcriptomic analysis confirmed the spontaneous differentiation of major trophoblast subtypes, originating from a CTB signature and directed towards either EVT or STB transcriptomic profiles. Interestingly, detailed clustering analysis revealed a distinct subpopulation of CTB in both organoids, distinguishable by the expression of MT2A, a metallothionein. The MT2A form of metallothionein is strongly expressed in the placenta and increases throughout gestation44,45. MT2A in the placenta is believed to have roles in detoxifying trace elements, protecting the developing foetus from heavy metals, clearing reactive oxygen species, trophoblast differentiation and as a regulator of labour-associated genes46,47,48,49,50. Metallothionein, and specifically MT2A, expression has previously been reported in HTR-8/SVneo, BeWo and JAR trophoblast cell lines and induced human pluripotent stem cells resembling trophoblasts45,47,51,52. Further, when Okae and colleagues were establishing their TSC lines, they performed transcriptomic comparisons of isolated primary trophoblast subtypes versus cultured TSCs stimulated to differentiate. RNAseq-based profiling revealed that MT2A had the highest expression in primary CTBs compared to other trophoblast subtypes, and in 3D TSC cultures being directed to differentiate into STBs53.

Our data showed that single cells emerged from organoid structures, thereby reflecting the physiology of EVTs in vivo. Immunofluorescence labelling for HLA-G confirmed the presence of an EVT population of cells in both types of organoids, but no statistically significant difference in the proportion of these cells was observed by imaging (12.3% Matrigel vs. 11.2% bioprinted). However, single-cell transcriptomics indicated that bioprinted organoids contained a higher proportion of EVT cells (33% Matrigel vs. 54% bioprinted). This analysis also provided a greater insight into trophoblast subtypes, detecting at least two distinct populations of EVTs with varying expression of HLA-G that may have been indistinguishable by confocal fluorescence microscopy alone. Given this subcluster demonstrated greater expression of ITGA1, a marker of EVT maturity, we consider EVT_2 a more mature EVT subcluster22,54,55,56. The impact of a stiffer PEG matrix in directing EVT differentiation is corroborated by a recent study showing that trophoblast migration and invasion are increased in correlation with an increasing ECM stiffness57. Greater EVT presence was reinforced at the protein level using proteomics analysis, with bioprinted organoids showing increased abundance of several EVT markers.

Concomitant to this, the activity of STBs in the organoids was first signalled by the positive result of a pregnancy test. At the morphological level, Matrigel and bioprinted organoids contained internal cavities, although bioprinted organoid cavity formation appeared less frequent. These cavities are consistent with those observed in published trophoblast organoid models and resemble the lacunae formed by early STBs where maternal blood pools for diffusion across the syncytial membrane17,18,58. Immunofluorescent quantification of β-hCG+ nuclei revealed no significant difference between Matrigel or bioprinted organoids (Matrigel 10.4% vs. bioprinted 9.2%), which is aligned with in vivo STB proportions of 9.7%29. This was supported by our proteomic analysis demonstrating no significant differences in STB protein markers between Matrigel and bioprinted organoids, although the key STB marker, hCG, was not detected. Contrarily, scRNAseq detected significantly fewer STB cells in bioprinted organoids compared to those in Matrigel. However, a caveat of the application of scRNAseq to placental tissue is that it is unable to separate individual nuclei within a shared cytoplasm, as occurs in multinucleated STBs. This limitation makes transcriptomic conclusions around trophoblast subtypes present in our organoids difficult to draw. Thus, methods such as single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq), recently applied to STB analyses and to other multinucleated skeletal muscle myofibers, may be more suitable28,59.

Comparison of our scRNAseq datasets to publicly available in vivo data from 6- and 8-week human first-trimester placental tissue and first-trimester primary trophoblast organoids demonstrated strong similarity to these tissues. In fact, the bioprinted ACH-3P organoids showed stronger associations with the 6-week placental tissue than our Matrigel-derived organoids, with the CTB subtype lacking significant similarity in Matrigel organoids compared to those from this tissue. The utility of our bioprinted trophoblast organoids to be used for drug screening of conditions caused by placental dysfunction, such as preeclampsia, was also demonstrated. We applied inflammatory stimuli, TNF-α, to mimic a preeclamptic placenta and treated organoids with clinically used treatments, aspirin and metformin. We showed that TNF-α induced a pro-inflammatory environment that impeded metabolic activity or proliferation of bioprinted trophoblast organoids, and reduced the percentage of STBs, which aspirin or metformin were unable to rescue at the concentration of 0.5 mM. STB stress plays a central role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia, suggesting that our model of TNF-α-induced stress in bioprinted trophoblast organoids resembles a preeclamptic placenta60,61. Our previous work in 2D in vitro ACH-3P models shows the ability of aspirin and metformin to rescue stress-induced trophoblast dysfunction; however, not in the presence of TNF-α but rather hypoxia mimic or oxidative stress36. Aspirin has been shown to increase EMT transition and trophoblast invasion, likely causing a shift in proliferation towards EVT formation in these organoids62. Here, aspirin in the presence of TNF-α showed a reduction in the number of STBs, but it did not affect the EVTs abundance. Metformin has been shown to regulate trophoblast metabolism and increase expression of STB markers63. In our drug screen, metformin did not have a significant impact on the number of STBs or EVTs in the presence of TNF-α, although it reduced STBs in the absence of TNF-α. These differences with aspirin or metformin treatment in relation to the STB or EVT content of organoids could be dose- or context-dependant, as we have shown previously36. Additionally, pathway analysis of aspirin and metformin treatment in inflamed trophoblast organoids could provide further insights into the effect of these agents on placental growth and development. Overall, we demonstrated that our automated, high-throughput and precise bioprinted trophoblast organoid model can provide a myriad of useful parameters to screen potential treatments for preeclampsia and accelerate drug discovery by investigating organoid number, growth, metabolism, proliferation, viability and differentiation. This is particularly important as preeclampsia is still a condition without a cure. The same platform can be used to extract mRNA and protein from bioprinted organoids and investigate mechanisms of placentation or mechanisms of action of potential treatments.

To mitigate the inside-out architecture of trophoblast organoids, we performed a suspension culture method like that applied in other organoid models64,65,66,67. Suspension of immature Matrigel or bioprinted organoids resulted in STB localisation to the outer surface, detected by expression of SDC-1. Higher magnification imaging of suspended organoids also revealed microvilli-like structures on the periphery of SDC-1+ cells, potentially reflecting the brush border of the in vivo STBs. The reversal of trophoblast organoid polarity by suspension culture is in line with a recently published study, where primary trophoblast-derived organoids were grown in suspension with gentle agitation, resulting in consistent layers of STBs on their outer surface68. Orbital rotation was also proposed to improve polarity reversal by inducing gentle shear stress that mimics early placental physiology and promotes trophoblast fusion69. Fluid flow in trophoblast organoid culture could also improve the viability of suspended organoids for long-term culture by facilitating nutrient permeation through to the core and preventing necrosis70.

Finally, we tested TSC organoid formation in Matrigel compared to a bioprinted PEG matrix. It was interesting, though somewhat unsurprising, to observe reduced organoid formation and growth of TSCs in the stiffer matrix. Given that the endometrium is reduced in stiffness during the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle and decidualisation during the window of implantation, we expect that TSCs arising from this early blastocyst stage would require a softer environment for expansion71,72. Additionally, the secretory phase is marked by altered expression of ECM proteins, with the upregulation of collagen IV and V, laminin and fibrillin73,74,75, which is aligned with TSC organoids showing improved growth profile in the ‘rich' matrix in our bioprinted model. This highlights an important distinction in the ECM environment requirements of TSCs in the stem cell niche and their mature progeny, such as ACH-3Ps. Since increased placental stiffness has been observed in tissue from pregnancy complications, a system that supports screening of a multitude of matrix stiffnesses and proteins would enable further investigation into these crucial mechanisms.

To extend this model, the matrix stiffness could be tuned to induce changes consistent with gestational age or pregnancy disorders, including preeclampsia, foetal growth restriction and gestational diabetes mellitus76,77,78,79,80,81,82. Organoid proliferation and cell fate may be further dictated by introducing adhesion factors required for growth and differentiation. To advance this bioprinted model of placental organoids to investigations of maternal-foetal interactions, uterine endothelial cells, stromal cells, fibroblasts or immune cells (e.g. decidual natural killer cells or macrophages) can be incorporated. Additionally, while most cell cultures are maintained at 21% oxygen, the early placenta develops within a physiologically low oxygen environment of around 2.5%83. Given that stem cell niches also often reside in 2–8% oxygen, culture in low oxygen conditions may improve the expansion of organoids and their biological relevance84. While we acknowledge that a limitation of this study is the influence of choriocarcinoma within the ACH-3P cell line, we have demonstrated at the transcriptomic level that ACH-3P bioprinted organoids closely resemble human first-trimester placental tissue. Also, we have shown the application of our approach to biofabricating TSC organoids that need further matrix tuning, perhaps using a softer matrix, in the future. This study has demonstrated that ACH-3P organoids can be used as a low-cost, low-risk, reproducible and biologically relevant model to supplement the use of primary cells that require intensive sampling and culture conditions with expensive components. Likewise, PEG matrix formulations open opportunities to control organoid formation and differentiation, with a 1.1 kPa blank matrix suitable for studies of placental EVT formation and invasion. Further, the application of bioprinting facilitates accurate orientation of low volumes of PEG components, ensuring precise cross-linking and reproducible organoid formation. This bioprinted organoid model can therefore be used to study important physiological processes, pathogenic mechanisms driving impaired EVT differentiation and invasion, and assess potential therapeutics at low cost and risk. This opens new avenues to assess the molecular pathways involved in EVT differentiation by removing the need for exogenous chemical stimuli to drive differentiation. At the same time, we have shown that suspended organoid cultures offer the opportunity to more accurately study STB physiology, including barrier effects and syncytial shedding of nuclear aggregates or extracellular vesicles for the diagnosis of pregnancy complications60,61,85,86,87,88.

The use of ACH-3Ps and TSCs in this study was approved by the University of Technology Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee in accordance with the requirements of the NHMRC National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research (2007).

The ACH-3P first-trimester trophoblast cell line was generously donated by Professor Gernot Desoye (Graz Medical University, Austria), which was established in 200722. ACH-3Ps were immortalised by the fusion of primary first-trimester trophoblasts isolated from a 12-week gestation placenta and choriocarcinoma cell line AC1-1, resulting in a hybrid male cell line. This cell line was chosen due to its cytotrophoblast-like phenotype and demonstrated capacity to form HLA-G− and HLA-G+ subtypes, suggesting differentiation potential22,89. ACH-3P cells were cultured in Ham's F12 nutrient mix (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. 11765062) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. 10099141) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. 15140-122). Every 2–5 passages, cells were treated with a selection medium containing azaserine (5.7 µM, Sigma-Aldrich) and hypoxanthine (100 µM, Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h to prevent the overgrowth of choriocarcinoma. Cells were dissociated using Accutase (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. A6964) and experiments were performed with passages 13–15.

A male TSC (“Okae”) line, CT29, was obtained from Riken (Japan). Culture surfaces were pre-coated with 0.5 µg/ml iMatrix-511 (FUJIFILM Wako, cat. 385-07361). CT29 cells were maintained in TSC 2D medium consisting of DMEM/F12 with 2.5 mM L-glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. 11320033), 0.15% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. A8806), 1% insulin–transferrin–selenium–ethanolamine (ITS -X, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. I3146), 1% KnockOut™ serum replacement (KSR, Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. 10828010), 0.2 mM L-ascorbic acid (FUJIFILM Wako, cat. 1713265-25-8), 0.5% penicillin–streptomycin (P/S, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 2.5 µM Y27632 (Selleck Chemicals, cat. S6390), 25 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF, FUJIFILM Irvine Scientific, cat. 100-26), 0.8 mM valproic acid (VPA, Selleck Chemicals, cat. 99-66-1), 1 µM A83-01 (Selleck Chemicals, cat. S7692), 2 µM CHIR99021 (Selleck Chemicals, cat. S1263) and SB431542 (Selleck Chemicals, cat. S1067)53. Organoids were generated using passage 24.

Cell cultures were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere and were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination.

To prevent two-dimensional cell attachment, the wells of a black-walled, 96-well plate (Perkin Elmer, cat. 6055300) were precoated with 15 µL of 0.5% agarose (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. A9539). Dissociated cells were filtered through a 70 µm filter to separate aggregates before 500 ACH-3P cells were seeded in 20 µL droplets or 1200 TSC cells were deposited in 5 µL droplets using cold, growth-factor reduced Matrigel (Corning, cat. CLS356231). The cell-laden Matrigel droplets were incubated at 37 °C for 40 min to polymerise prior to the addition of 150 µL ACH-3P growth medium or TSC organoid medium (TOM), respectively. TOM contained DMEM/F12 with 2.5 mM L-glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #11320033), 0.15% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich, #A8806), 1% insulin–transferrin–selenium–ethanolamine (ITS-X, Sigma-Aldrich, #I3146), 1% KnockOut™ serum replacement (KSR, Thermo Fisher Scientific, #10828010), 0.2 mM L-ascorbic acid (FUJIFILM Wako, #1713265-25-8), 0.5% penicillin–streptomycin (P/S, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 2.5 µM Y27632 (Selleck Chemicals, #S6390), 25 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF, FUJIFILM Irvine Scientific, #100-26), 1 µM A83-01 (Selleck Chemicals, #S7692) and 2 µM CHIR99021 (Selleck Chemicals, #S1263). Matrigel cultures were grown for 12 days, with culture medium changed every 3–4 days in ACH-3P cultures or 2–3 days in TSC cultures.

Large Plug 3D cell models (7.2 µL/well) were generated using the RASTRUM drop-on-demand bioprinter (Inventia Life Science). The wells of a black-walled, 96-well plate were initially printed with an Inert Base to prevent 2D attachment. Dissociated and filtered ACH-3P cells were primed and printed at 10,000 cells/well in a synthetic PEG-based matrix (Inventia Life Science, cat. Px02.00). The system uses a two-droplet process, with the PEG-4MAL bioink meeting the cells suspended in an MMP-cleavable activator that immediately polymerises as the two active bioink components make contact and crosslink90. The RASTRUM matrix formulations used were all 1.1 kPa stiffness, resembling that of the decidua basalis, the site of placental invasion. A matrix selection was performed to compare (i) a naked ‘blank' PEG containing no additional adhesion peptides, (ii) a matrix containing α- and β-laminin peptide chains (IKVAV and YIGSR), and (iii) a matrix containing collagen type I peptide mimetic (GFOGER) given the high expression of laminin and collagens in the native placenta75,91,92,93. Bioprinted TSC organoids were produced in Large Plug models in either naked PEG, as used for ACH-3P, or a ‘rich' matrix of ~1.1 kPa and containing RGD (fibronectin, laminin), YIGSR (laminin) and CNYYSNS (collagen IV) adhesion peptides with laminin-511 and hyaluronic acid (Inventia Life Science, cat. Px02.72). These cells were printed at a seeding concentration of 2,780,000 cells/mL which equated to a density of 10,000 cells/well. Bioprinted cultures were immediately overlaid with ACH-3P or TSC organoid growth medium and grown for 12 days, with culture medium changed every 3–4 days for ACH-3P or 2–3 days for TSCs.

TSC organoids were differentiated from day 7 using either STB or EVT differentiation medium (STB-DM and EVT-DM, respectively). STB-DM contained DMEM/F12 with 2.5 mM L-glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. 11320033), 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. A8806), 1% insulin–transferrin–selenium–ethanolamine (ITS-X, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. I3146), 4% KnockOut™ serum replacement (KSR, Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat 10828010), 0.2 mM L-ascorbic acid (FUJIFILM Wako, cat. 1713265-25-8), 0.5% penicillin–streptomycin (P/S, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 2.5 µM Y27632 (Selleck Chemicals, cat. S6390), 50 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF, FUJIFILM Irvine Scientific, cat. 100-26) and 2 µM forskolin (FUJIFILM Wako, cat. 067-02191). EVT-DM contained DMEM/F12 with 2.5 mM L-glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. 11320033), 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. A8806), 1% insulin–transferrin–selenium–ethanolamine (ITS-X, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. I3146), 4% KnockOut™ serum replacement (KSR, Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. 10828010), 0.5% penicillin–streptomycin (P/S, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 2.5 µM Y27632 (Selleck Chemicals, cat. S6390), 7.5 µM A83-01 (Selleck Chemicals, cat. S7692) and 100 ng/mL neuregulin-1 (Antibodies.com, cat. A63582-10).

ACH-3P cells were bioprinted into a blank PEG matrix at a cell density of 8,000-14,000 cells/well. Following bioprinting, 150 μL of ACH-3P growth medium was added to each well, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. To assess the impact of TNFα concentration on bioprinted organoids, we first exposed them to varying concentrations (0, 1, 5 and 20 ng/mL) from day 5 of culture. For subsequent experiments, TNFα (20 ng/mL) was added to respective wells from day 5 of culture. Aspirin (0.5 mM) and metformin (0.5 mM) were added to respective wells from day 8 of culture. Imaging and downstream analysis were conducted as described below.

After three days in matrix-embedded culture, wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and organoids from both Matrigel and bioprinted conditions were retrieved from their matrices. To retrieve organoids from Matrigel, 100 µL of 1 U/mL dispase (StemCell Technologies, cat. 07913) was added to each well and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C until gel dissolved. Bioprinted organoids were retrieved from their matrix by incubating each well with 75 µL of Cell Retrieval Solution (Inventia Life Science) for 30 min at 37 °C. Matrix digestion was halted by adding complete growth medium, well contents were collected and washed twice with PBS. Organoids were resuspended in complete growth medium and transferred to an ultra-low attachment 24-well plate (Corning, United States). Organoids were maintained in suspended culture for up to either 12 or 28 days with medium changed every 3–4 days.

Live cell imaging was performed using an IncuCyte organoid assay module (Sartorius, Germany) with ×10 brightfield and phase images acquired every 6 h per well. Higher resolution brightfield images were acquired with a Nikon Ti inverted microscope (Nikon, Japan) using a Nikon DS-Qi2 camera, NIS Elements Advanced Research software (v. 5.30.06), ×4 (Plan Apo λ, NA 0.2), ×10 (Plan Fluor Ph1 DLL, NA 0.3), and ×20 (Plan Apo λ ×20 Ph2 DM, NA 0.75) objectives.

Organoid count was taken at day 7 in Matrigel versus bioprint experiments to account for progressive fusion of organoids. Organoid area was measured using ×10 magnification images acquired from 5 wells of each experimental replicate, totalling at least 800 organoids per matrix condition.

Cell viability was assessed in Matrigel and bioprinted models using a live/dead cell viability kit for mammalian cells (Biotium, cat. 30002). Encapsulated cells were washed with PBS and incubated with calcein-AM (1 µM), ethidium homodimer 3 (EthD-III, 2 µM), and Hoechst 33342 (10 µg/mL; Invitrogen, cat. H3570) in PBS to label live cells, dead cells and nuclei, respectively. Wells were incubated with the fluorescent dyes for 30 min at 37 °C and washed twice with PBS prior to imaging. Images were acquired at ×10 magnification using the IncuCyte green and red channels for live and dead cells, respectively. Higher resolution representative fluorescent images were acquired as a z-stack of 20 slices at 1 µm step size using a Leica Stellaris confocal microscope. Images were acquired using a ×20 objective (HC PL APO CS2 ×20, NA 0.75), DAPI (ex 450 nm), FITC (ex 495 nm) and TRITC (ex 590 nm) channels and a pinhole size of 66.7 µm at 590 nm. Wells containing Matrigel or inert base only, calcein-AM only or EthD-III only were used as staining controls.

Alamar Blue (Invitrogen, cat. DAL1100) was prepared in complete cell culture medium (10%) and added to culture wells on days 1, 4, 7 and 11 in Matrigel versus bioprinted conditions or days 6, 9 and 12 in the drug screening assay. After 2 h incubation, the metabolised Alamar Blue medium was transferred to a new plate and the fluorescent intensity at 530 nm excitation and 590 nm emission was recorded using a Tecan M Plex plate reader. At least 3 wells were measured per time point per condition.

Organoid growth medium from the TNF-α concentration curve and drug screen assays was collected at day 12. Medium from the 3 wells of each condition was pooled and assessed using a CRP ELISA (Abcam, cat. ab260058) as a measure of inflammation94. Experiments were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Matrigel-embedded organoids were harvested using dispase enzyme, and bioprinted organoids were collected using Cell Retrieval Solution as described above. Retrieved organoids from both conditions were washed twice with PBS to remove residual matrix prior to downstream analysis.

A whole organoid immunolabelling protocol was adapted from Rios et al.95. Harvested or in situ ACH-3P organoids and in situ TSC organoids were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma-Aldrich, P6148) for 1 h at 4 °C and washed three times with PBS. When immunolabelling for intracellular proteins (β-hCG and Cyk-7), organoids were first permeabilised for 30 min at room temperature in a penetration buffer (PBS, 20% DMSO, 0.3 M glycine, 0.2% Triton X-100). Permeabilised organoids were washed twice with organoid washing buffer (OWB; containing PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.1% Triton X-100) for 5 min at room temperature. All organoids were incubated in blocking buffer (PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 3% normal goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 1 h at 4 °C by gentle rocking. Organoids were incubated with primary antibodies prepared in blocking buffer according to dilutions (Supplementary Table 1) overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Primary antibodies were removed, and organoids were washed three times with OWB for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Secondary antibodies were prepared in blocking buffer and incubated with organoids overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Secondary antibodies were removed, and organoids were washed three times with OWB for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. OWB was removed and organoids were optically cleared using a fructose (2.5 M)–glycerol (60% v/v) clearing solution, incubated at room temperature for 20 min and transferred to a microscope slide. Organoids incubated with secondary antibodies only were used as labelling controls.

Fluorescent images of mounted ACH-3P organoids were acquired using a Nikon A1R inverted confocal microscope with PMT and GaAsP detectors and NIS Elements Advanced Research software (v. 5.30.06). Z-stacks taken at 1 µm slices to a depth of 60 µm were acquired by Nyquist sampling for each organoid using a ×20 long working distance objective (S Plan Fluor LWD, NA 0.7). Laser excitation lines of 405, 488, 561 and 637 nm were used with a line average count of 2 and 33.2 µm pinhole diameter. Higher resolution images were also acquired with a ×100 oil immersion objective (Plan Apo λ, NA 1.45). Representative images were processed using NIS Elements denoise.ai. Fluorescent images of in situ ACH-3P or TSC organoids were acquired using a Leica Stellaris (LASX 4.8.1) inverted confocal microscope with HyD X and HyD S detectors, white light laser and a ×25 water immersion objective (NA 0.95). Z stacks were taken at 1.5 µm slices with a line accumulation count of 2 and a pinhole of 55.82 µm (1 Airy unit).

Organoid viability was calculated using IncuCyte software (v2022B.rev2) by applying a mask to the areas occupied by green or red fluorescence. Viability data were presented as an area positive for calcein-AM (live)/total cell area (live + dead). Maximum intensity projections were created using ImageJ (v1.53j; https://imagej.net/software/fiji/). The proportion of cells positive for HLA-G and β-hCG was assessed using Bitplane Imaris (v9.6.0) software. At least 10 confocal z stacks were processed using Bitplane Imaris Surfaces module to quantify nuclei and respective immunofluorescent markers for each condition and experimental repeat (n = 10–92 per experimental replicate).

Organoids and bioprinted matrix plugs harvested for histology were fixed in 4% PFA at room temperature for 1 h. Organoids were washed with PBS and stored in 70% ethanol overnight at 4 °C. The ethanol was removed, organoids were suspended in approximately 100 µL molten 1% low-gelling temperature agarose (Sigma-Aldrich, A4018) and transferred to a plastic surface to set as a droplet. After 20 min, the agarose droplet was transferred to a histology cassette and processed through the following for 45 min each: 80% ethanol, 90% ethanol, 100% ethanol, 100% ethanol, xylene, xylene, molten paraffin wax. The wax-perfused agarose droplets were then embedded in paraffin wax for microtome sectioning at 5 µm thickness.

Dried microscope slides containing sections of organoid droplets were passed through the following reagents for 2 min each, unless otherwise stated: xylene (3 times), 100% ethanol (3 times), 95% ethanol, 70% ethanol, water, Harris Haematoxylin (5 min), water, acid alcohol (15 s), water, Scott's Bluing solution, water, 1% alcoholic Eosin (3 min), 100% ethanol (3 times), xylene (3 times). Coverslips were applied using DPX mounting medium (LabChem, AJA3197) and images acquired at ×20 (NA 0.50) using an Olympus BX51 upright microscope.

To isolate RNA, harvested organoids were washed twice with PBS before extraction with 1 mL QIAzol (QIAGEN, 79306) according to the manufacturer's protocols. RNA lysates were assessed using a NanoDrop One spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and gene expression quantified by RT-qPCR using a Luna Universal One-Step kit (New England Biolabs, E3005) and C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Relative gene expression was quantified using the 2−ΔΔCt method. The primers were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich: β-actin (#NM_001101; forward: GACGACATGGAGAAAATCTG, reverse: ATGATCTGGGTCATCTTCTC); Il-6 (#NM_000600; forward: GCAGAAAAAGGCAAAGAATC, reverse: CTACATTTGCCGAAGAGC).

For single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), 7 wells of each condition were harvested and pooled, producing roughly 700 organoids. Organoids were washed twice with PBS and centrifuged for 5 min at 300 × g. Organoids were dissociated into single cells by adding 1 mL Accutase to each sample, followed by incubation on a shaker for 30 min at 800 rpm. The cell suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 300 × g and washed twice with sterile 0.04% BSA in PBS, centrifuging between each step. Cells were then resuspended in 100 µL 0.04% BSA and passed through a 40 µm filter. Cell viability and count were assessed using trypan blue, ensuring viability was >80%.

Single cells were prepared for sequencing according to the 10× Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3' Kit user guide at the Single Cell Technology Facility at the Faculty of Engineering and IT at UTS. Briefly, to create Gel Beads-in-emulsion (GEMs), approximately 5000 single cells from each sample were suspended in a Chromium master mix and combined with barcoded Single Cell 3' v3.1 Gel Beads and partitioning oil was loaded onto a Chromium Next GEM Chip G for partitioning. In each resulting GEM, the Gel Bead was dissolved and co-partitioned with cell lysed, incubated with reverse transcription reagents and a unique molecular identifier (UMI) to produce barcoded, full-length cDNA. Barcoded, full-length cDNA was amplified via 12 PCR cycles to generate sufficient mass for library construction. A sample index PCR was performed to generate a 3' gene expression dual index library, which was double-sided size selected. Quality control was performed using an Agilent TapeStation and analysed using TapeStation Analysis Software (v4.1.1). The libraries were sequenced by the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF) on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument using a NovaSeq S4 kit (200 cycles) v1 chemistry at an aimed depth of 30,000 paired-end reads per cell. The sequencer generated raw data files in binary base call (BCL) format.

The BCL files were demultiplexed and converted to the FASTQ file format using Illumina Conversion Software (bcl2fastq v2.19.0.316). The 10x Genomics cellranger-v (3.1.0) count pipeline was used for alignment, filtering, barcode counting, and UMI counting from FASTQ files and was executed on a high-performance cluster with 2.6.32-754.17.1.el6.x86_64 operating system.

The single-cell datasets were analysed with Seurat. Cells with at least 100 genes and <15% mitochondrial genes were kept. Genes expressed in fewer than 5 cells were discarded. The 2000 most variable genes were used in PCA calculations. Cells were analysed with 30 principal components (PCs) and clustered with 0.2 and 0.3 resolution. DEG between clusters for each compartment were calculated with FindMarkers with min.pct = 0.25 and logfc.threshold = 0.4 using the Wilcoxon algorithm. Gene set enrichment analysis of cluster-specific markers was performed with the fgsea package. Reactome or Gene Ontology gene sets were downloaded from the MSigDB and obtained from “h.all.v2023.2.Hs.entrez”. The Monocle3 R package was used to explore the differentiation of ACH-3P trophoblasts. The raw counts were loaded into Monocle3 for semi-supervised single-cell ordering in pseudo-time, using SPINT1 expression to denote the origin. Branched expression analysis modelling (BEAM) was applied to observe the expression of the CTB progenitor gene markers along pseudo-time trajectory towards either STB or EVT.

To quantify how closely our organoid trophoblast lineages resemble their in vivo counterparts, we benchmarked scRNA-seq profiles from Matrigel- and bioprint-derived organoids against three reference datasets: (i) a first-trimester (8–12 weeks) chorionic-villus atlas28, (ii) a 6-week placental trophoblast dataset29, and (iii) a published patient-derived trophoblast organoid dataset34. All raw count matrices were processed in Seurat v4.4 with log-normalisation. Cells annotated as CTB, EVT or STB were subset. Organoid cells were labelled by culture platform (Matrigel, Bioprint), and public cells retained their native study identifiers at the resolution of only CTB, EVT and STB. SCE objects were merged, and MetaNeighbor35 was applied to identify the set of study-invariant, highly variable genes (variableGenes function) and to compute pairwise area-under-the-ROC (AUROC) similarity scores between every cell-type–by-study pair using the fast_version = TRUE implementation. AUROC values range from 0.5 (random overlap) to 1 (perfect concordance); we considered scores > 0.88 as evidence of strong transcriptional similarity. Results were visualised as a similarity network (igraph v1.6.0, ggraph v2.2.1) in which edges connecting two nodes (cell-type-by-study labels) were drawn only when AUROC > 0.88, and node size was scaled to the within-dataset self-AUROC. The analysis was repeated with organoid cells pooled (Matrigel + Bioprint) and with each platform analysed separately to assess platform-specific fidelity (Supplementary Fig. 2).

For proteomic analysis, 8 wells of each condition were harvested as described above and pooled, amounting to approximately 800 organoids per sample for each of three experimental repeats. Harvested organoids were washed twice with PBS, PBS was removed, and the dry organoid pellet was stored at −80 °C prior to downstream analysis. Undiluted Matrigel (20 µL) and ACH-3P cells grown in 2D were prepared as controls. Organoid pellets were thawed and solubilised with 30 µL SDC Master Mix (Supplementary Table 2) at 95 °C for 10 min. Samples were cooled at room temperature for 50 min prior to the addition of 2 µL trypsin solution and overnight incubation at 37 °C. Load Buffer was added to each sample (300 µL) and samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 × g. Stage tips were prepared using styrene divinylbenzene- reverse phase sulfonate (SDB-RPS), and 165 µL of supernatant was transferred to each tip96. Tubes with stage tips were centrifuged for 2 min at 2100 x g. Stage tips were washed with 100 µL Wash Buffer and centrifuged for 2 min at 2100 × g. Stage tips with bound peptides were transferred to new tubes containing inserts (Agilent), 50 µL fresh Elution Buffer was added to each sample and then centrifuged for 2 min at 2100 × g. Insets containing eluted peptides were evaporated in a centrifugal vacuum concentrator for 1 h.

Peptides were resuspended in 25 µL MS Loading Solvent. Using an Acquity M-class nanoLC system (Waters, USA), 5 µL of the sample was loaded at 15 µL/min for 3 min onto a nanoEase Symmetry C18 trapping column (180 µm × 20 mm) before being washed onto a PicoFrit column (75 µm ID × 350 mm; New Objective, Woburn, MA) packed with SP-120-1.7-ODS-BIO resin (1.7 µm, Osaka Soda Co, Japan) heated to 45 °C. Peptides were eluted from the column and into the source of a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) using the following programme: 5–30% MS buffer B (98% Acetonitrile + 0.2% formic acid) over 90 min, 30–80% MS buffer B over 3 min, 80% MS buffer B for 2 min, 80–5% for 3 min. The eluting peptides were ionised at 2400 V. A data-dependant MS/MS (dd-MS2) experiment was performed, with a survey scan of 350–1500 Da performed at 70,000 resolution for peptides of charge state 2+ or higher with an AGC target of 3e6 and maximum Injection Time of 50 ms. The Top 12 peptides were selected and fragmented in the HCD cell using an isolation window of 1.4m/z, an AGC target of 1e5 and a maximum injection time of 100 ms. Fragments were scanned in the Orbitrap analyser at 17,500 resolution and the product ion fragment masses measured over a mass range of 50–2000 Da. The mass of the precursor peptide was then excluded for 30 s. LC/MS/MS was performed on each sample in triplicate injections.

The MS/MS data files were searched using Peaks Studio 11 against the UniProt Human reference proteome database (20230323) and a database of common contaminants with the following parameter settings. Fixed modifications: none. Variable modifications: propionamide, oxidised methionine, deamidated asparagine. Enzyme: semi-trypsin. Number of allowed missed cleavages: 3. Peptide mass tolerance: 10 ppm. MS/MS mass tolerance: 0.05 Da. The results of the search were then filtered to include peptides with a –log10P score that was determined by the false discovery rate (FDR) of <1%, the score being that where decoy database search matches were <1% of the total matches. The protein.db file was exported from peaks, followed by a low-value imputation of 5000, representing a low abundance area value for any value that had a numerical value of 0. This approach was used in favour of other methods that use random values within the distribution, or values reduced by factors of the standard deviation. This dataset had a wide distribution of area values across several orders of magnitude due to large changes in protein abundance between the different experimental groups. This meant that reduction by SD or assigning random values within the distribution was inappropriate and sometimes resulted in negative values. For this reason, a representative value of 5000 was chosen as this was similar to other very low abundance proteins. Student's t-tests were used between comparable groups. A log2-fold change of <−0.4 or >0.4 with a p-value of <0.05 was considered significant and included in downstream analyses. Significantly differentially abundant proteins were searched in Reactome.org. Due to the limitations of the Reactome database and our sample type not being very well represented in the pathway analysis, a p-value of <0.05 was used as a cutoff for significantly enriched pathways instead of a more stringent FDR of 1%. Significantly enriched pathways were then further interrogated in the literature to validate that the record in the database was correct.

Organoid data were statistically analysed using GraphPad Prism (v9.4.1). For normally distributed data, an unpaired, two-tailed t-test was used to compare the means of experimental replicates, where 2 groups were considered, and a p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Where more than one condition was assessed, an ordinary one-way ANOVA was applied with either Tukey's or Šídák's multiple comparisons post-hoc test. Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM).

Mario is returning to the big screen. Following the massive success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which made more than $1.3 billion worldwide in 2023, animation studio Illumination and Nintendo are releasing a sequel, The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, in April 2026. Nintendo dropped a teaser trailer during its Direct presentation on Friday.

The teaser doesn't offer much about the movie, which takes its name from the 2007 platformer. Mario dozes in a field before title credits appear, that's about it. But the trailer still signifies that Nintendo will continue to churn out films aimed at turning Mario into a megafranchise.

It's no coincidence that the trailer and accompanying announcement come just one day before the 40th anniversary of the original Super Mario Bros. video game. In the four decades since that game's release, Mario—and Luigi, Princess Peach, Bowser, and other assorted characters—have become cultural icons.

In 1993, Super Mario Bros. became one of the earliest videogame film adaptations. It was panned by critics and fans, but in the years since, games ranging from Mortal Kombat to Tomb Raider have been turned into movies. Now, as superhero fatigue sets in and '90s nostalgia peaks, The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, which will include nods to the entire Mario series, stands poised to continue Mario's domination.

Considered the most successful video game adaptation ever made, The Super Mario Bros. Movie was the second highest-grossing movie of 2023, second only to Barbie. The original cast, including Chris Pratt as Mario, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Charlie Day as Luigi, and Jack Black as Bowser, will return for the sequel.

Alongside the news, Nintendo also announced it will release remastered versions of Super Mario Galaxy and its sequel on October 2.

This week, OpenAI and Oracle shocked the markets with a surprise $300 billion, five-year agreement, part of a surge of new business that sent the cloud provider's stock skyrocketing. But maybe the markets shouldn't have been taken by surprise. The deal is a reminder that, despite Oracle's legacy status, the company still plays a major role in AI infrastructure.

On the OpenAI side, the agreement was more revealing than the lack of details suggest. For one, the startup's willingness to pay so much for compute provides a measurement of the startup's appetite — even if it's unclear where the electricity to power said compute is coming from or how it will pay for it. 

Chirag Dekate, a vice president at research firm Gartner, told TechCrunch it's clear why both sides were interested in this deal. It makes sense for OpenAI to work with several infrastructure providers, he noted. It also diversifies the company's infrastructure — spreading out risk among several cloud providers — and gives OpenAI a scaling advantage compared to competitors.

“OpenAI seems to be putting together one of the most comprehensive global AI supercomputing foundations for extreme scale, inference scaling where appropriate,” Dekate said. “This is quite unique. This is probably exemplary of what a model ecosystem should look like.”

Some industry watchers expressed surprise that Oracle was involved, citing the company's diminished role in the AI boom compared to cloud rivals like Google, Microsoft Azure, and AWS. But Dekate argues that observers shouldn't be so surprised: Oracle has worked with hyperscalers before, and provides the infrastructure for TikTok's sizable U.S. business.

“Over the decades, they actually built core infrastructure capabilities that enabled them to deliver extreme scale and performance as a core part of their cloud infrastructure,” Dekate said.

But even as the stock market celebrates the deal, key details are missing and questions around power and payment remain. 

OpenAI has made a string of infrastructure investment announcements over the past year, each one with an eye-popping price tag. OpenAI has committed to spend around $60 billion a year for compute from Oracle and $10 billion to develop custom AI chips with Broadcom. 

Meanwhile, OpenAI said in June it hit $10 billion in annual recurring revenue, up from around $5.5 billion last year. That figure includes revenue from the company's consumer products, ChatGPT business products, and its API. And while its CEO Sam Altman has painted a rosy picture of its future prospects in terms of subscribers, products, and revenue, the company is burning through billions of dollars in cash each year.

Power is another question, or more specifically where the companies plan to source the energy needed to run this level of compute.

Industry observers have been predicting a near-term boost for natural gas, though solar and batteries are arguably better positioned to deliver power sooner and at lower cost in many markets. Tech companies are also betting big on nuclear.

Despite market moving headlines, the energy impact of OpenAI's anticipated growth isn't entirely unexpected. Data centers are anticipated to consume 14% of all electricity in the U.S. by 2040, according to a report the Rhodium Group published yesterday.

Compute has always been a constraint for AI companies, so much so that investors have bought thousands of Nvidia chips to ensure their startups have access to the power they need. Andreessen Horowitz has reportedly purchased over 20,000 GPUs, while Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross rented access to a 4,000 GPU cluster (though maybe Meta owns that now).

But compute is worthless without power. To ensure their data centers remain juiced, large tech companies have been snapping up solar farms, buying nuclear power plants, and inking deals with geothermal startups.

So far, OpenAI has been relatively quiet on that front. CEO Sam Altman has placed several prominent bets in the energy sector, including Oklo, Helion, and Exowatt, but the company itself hasn't thrown money into the space like Google, Meta, or Amazon.

With a 4.5 gigawatt compute deal, that may soon change.

The company may play an indirect role, paying Oracle to handle the physical infrastructure — something it has extensive experience with — just as Altman invested in startups aligned with OpenAI's future power needs. That will leave the company “asset light,” something that will undoubtedly please its investors and help keep its valuation in line with other software-centric AI startups and not with legacy tech firms, which are burdened with pricy infrastructure.

High-risk medications defined by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and captured by the Geriatric Oncology Potentially Inappropriate Medication (GO-PIM) scale were prevalent in more than one third of veterans with solid and hematologic malignancies. Each additional GO-PIM was independently associated with higher risks for frailty at diagnosis, unplanned hospitalizations during follow-up, and death.

“Whether prescribed for supportive oncology care or for coexisting medical conditions, high-risk medications identified as PIMs should be reviewed and optimized in patients with cancer,” the authors of the study wrote.

“GO-PIMs offers a streamlined, oncology-specific approach to identifying high-risk prescribing, and complements existing efforts to improve supportive care, especially for older, frail patients,” remarked Mostafa R. Mohamed, MBBCH, PhD, MSc, and Erika E. Ramsdale, MD, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York in an invited commentary. “The next step lies in integrating tools such as GO-PIMs into everyday practice not only to flag high risk medications but also to support actionable changes in treatment planning and patient management, such as deprescribing,” they concluded.

This study, led by Jennifer La, PhD, Harvard Medical School, Boston, was published online in Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.

Prescription chronicity before or after follow-up was not measured and actual medication adherence could not be confirmed. Residual confounding by comorbidity could have existed, and the cross-sectional nature of linking GO-PIMs with frailty might have limited causal inference. Additionally, prescriptions were measured within Veterans Affairs pharmacy data, potentially underestimating GO-PIM prevalence, and the predominantly male population limited generalizability to gynecologic cancers.

This study was supported by grants and rewards from the Veterans Affairs Office of Research and Development, Cooperative Studies Program, National Institutes of Health, and American Heart Association. Some authors declared serving as consultants or receiving grants and having other ties with various sources. Additional disclosures are noted in the original article.

 September 12, 2025  

New guidelines from the American Thyroid Association (ATA) for managing adults with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) include several recommendations aimed at de-escalating treatment where possible, while also suggesting further work is needed to address financial toxicity of this disease.

The guidelines, published in Thyroid in August, represent the first major update for the management of DTC in a decade. The task force that compiled the new guidelines was composed of members from multiple specialties involved in thyroid cancer care, as well as a patient advocate and an expert in systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and guidelines. 

“Over the last 25-30 years, there have been remarkable advances in knowledge affecting the diagnosis and treatment of DTC, but clinical controversy continues to exist in many areas,” the task force wrote.

The new guidelines include more than 80 specific recommendations, many of which will be discussed during a number of presentations at the 2025 ATA Annual Meeting in Scottsdale, Arizona. 

Among the major changes is an effort to help clinicians better predict risk of recurrence for each of the three main types of DTC — papillary, follicular, and oncocytic — Julie Ann Sosa, MD, of the University of California, San Francisco, told Medscape Medical News. 

Sosa was a co-chair of the current task force and part of the team that published the 2015 guidelines.

Another notable change builds on a small shift made in the previous guidelines regarding treatment of papillary thyroid microcarcinomas, or cancers < 1 cm without extrathyroidal extension and cN0, she added. 

For many years, physicians uniformly performed up-front surgery to address these small, low-risk tumors. In 2015, there was a subtle, but powerful, change in the language marked by use of the word “if,” Sosa said. The 2015 recommendation began: “If surgery is chosen for patients,” and then detailed considerations for clinicians who proceeded with this option.

“We used that little word that most people didn't even notice to say, ‘Well, maybe active surveillance could be considered,'” Sosa said.

The 2025 guidelines now spell out options for a patient with a ≤ 1 cm tumor with low-risk features, including thyroid lobectomy (up-front surgery), active surveillance, or even percutaneous ablative technologies. Guidance is also provided around how best to potentially monitor these patients (with ultrasound), how to define progression of disease, and when to cross patients over to a surgical strategy.

This is an example of what Sosa calls “evidential equipoise,” referring to a careful balancing of medical evidence and a patient's needs and situation in coming to a decision in these kinds of cases. 

For example, physicians need to consider how anxiety may lead some patients to prefer lobectomy over active surveillance. Or patients may live far from medical centers, making it tougher for them to comply with the needed follow-up for active surveillance.

As part of their work in updating the guidelines, Sosa and other task force members did their own systematic review of published research on active surveillance and immediate surgery for low-risk DTC. 

The findings of this review were published in Thyroid in 2022. The task force also did a systematic review of research on serum thyroglobulin measurement following surgery without radioactive iodine (RAI) for DTC and thyroid lobectomy, which was published the same year.

In writing the new guidelines, the authors sought to make clear the varied strengths of the evidence backing each recommendation. 

For example, recommendation 32, stating that remnant ablation is not recommended routinely after total thyroidectomy for patients with ATA low-risk DTC is classified as a “strong recommendation,” made with “high certainty evidence.”

In other cases, the data were not as clear and the authors spelled this out.

For example, when addressing the question, “Can monitoring be de-escalated or discontinued in patients with low-risk DTC?”, the guidelines include a conditional recommendation, based on low certainty of evidence, for discontinuing routine ultrasound for patients with low-risk DTC treated with total thyroidectomy and RAI and a sustained excellent response 5-8 years after initial therapy (recommendation 48). These patients may be followed by checking biochemical markers every 1-2 years. 

In some cases, the evidence was supportive but not compelling enough for a graded recommendation, so the authors offered “good practice statements” as an alternative label in these cases. 

These statements served in cases where “the benefits of the recommended intervention must be obvious and actual certainty of benefits must be high despite the lack of direct evidence demonstrating benefits,” the authors wrote.

Sosa noted that there's a high bar set for good practice statements in that they require the unanimous consensus of task force members.

“If you're going to use a good practice statement, you must have 100% consensus of all task force members, short of those who have to recuse themselves if they have a perceived conflict in that particular area,” she said.

The 2015 guidelines raised the idea of active surveillance in certain cases such as papillary microcarcinoma. But at the time, more research was needed, the authors concluded. They then called for studies that would examine decision-making and acceptability of an active surveillance approach to thyroid cancer in patients, family members, and clinicians.

The new ATA DTC guidelines now highlight this option in some situations and call for use of the term “complete remission” in some carefully selected cases.

Recommendation 48 includes a good practice statement about phasing out biochemical monitoring. 

“Patients with low-risk DTC treated with total thyroidectomy and RAI and sustained excellent response for 10-15 years do not require continued routine biochemical monitoring for thyroid cancer and should be considered to have achieved a complete remission,” the authors wrote.

The changes in the 2025 guidelines mark a major shift in how physicians care for patients with thyroid cancer after initial treatment, said Mara Y. Roth, MD, an endocrinologist at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center, Seattle, Washington.

Previously, patients with small, low-risk features were followed indefinitely, said Roth, who was not part of the team that updated the guidelines. This created a lot of anxiety and financial burden for patients. 

“In the past, we followed these patients indefinitely, and so given the financial toxicity and the anxiety that that contributes for patients, I think that's really a huge change in these guidelines, identifying that we can actually stop surveillance for carefully selected low-risk patients and tell these patients that they're in complete remission and get them back to their primary care provider so they don't need to continue to be seen in a specialty clinic,” said Roth, who is also an associate professor in the division of metabolism, endocrinology, and nutrition at the University of Washington School of Medicine.

“There's a lot of clarity with that. Previously most providers were not confident or comfortable providing active surveillance for patients, and so they had to go specifically to a specialized center to have this,” Roth said.

In some cases, the guidelines help clinicians and patients weigh the benefits of additional treatment of more advanced cancer.

“Less is more for some, specifically those with very low- and low-risk disease,” Sosa said. “But for some, more is more.” 

In patients with advanced disease “we focus on small molecule therapies directed to druggable targets,” she explained. 

Although recommendation 10 of the guidelines says that genomic evaluation of confirmed DTC prior to surgery is not recommended routinely, there are exceptions. 

These tests can be helpful in determining whether a patient's tumor will respond to some of the newer cancer drugs, Sosa said. She cited situations she has seen in her practice as a surgeon with tumors that may be borderline resectable. In these cases, “we are now saying to consider molecular testing” to see if a medicine might work to shrink the tumor, thus improving the outcome of surgery, she said.

Sosa recalled a recent case in which a patient with a borderline resectable thyroid tumor underwent molecular testing, although it is “not routinely recommended for biopsies in the guidelines.”

The patient “had a druggable target. We started a drug and 6 months later, his tumor was easily resectable,” she said.

These guidelines were funded by the ATA without support from any commercial sources. The authors of the guidelines, including Sosa, reported no significant financial or competing interests to disclose. Roth reported no relevant financial disclosures.

F1 Drivers Vote For The Best Bromance | The 2025 F1 Yearbook

Getting to know... Franco Colapinto 

From Benetton's racing story to collaborations with Armani and Nike, Formula 1 has long intersected with fashion — blending style, culture and creating renowned brand partnerships.

In recent years lifestyle – and fashion in particular – has been increasingly present in Formula 1, from the paddock to on-track branding. With LVMH becoming a Global Partner in 2025 under a historic 10-year agreement, it is clear that the sport's love for fashion – and fashion's love for the sport – continues to grow.

Fashion, however, has always been part of Formula 1's identity. From luxury labels to sportswear brands, collaborations with teams and drivers have helped define the sport's DNA. The paddock and circuits became the perfect stage to project brand identities – whether through team wear sponsorships or bold liveries – turning the sport into the cultural, technological and stylistic showcase it remains today.

Before Hollywood's F1 movie reignited the spotlight, the sport had already established some of its most iconic fashion partnerships. From Italian label Benetton boldly stepping up as a full team owner in the 1980s, to Lewis Hamilton turning heads in designer looks at the Met Gala, fashion has long had a front-row seat in Formula 1.

Few collaborations were as revolutionary as Benetton's years in Formula 1. In the 1980s, the Italian clothing brand – known for its famous United Colours of Benetton line – entered the sport as a sponsor. Their first deal came with Tyrrell and the iconic green 012, where the Benetton logo was highly visible.

Hungry for more, Benetton partnered with Alfa Romeo in 1984, then took the unprecedented step of buying the struggling Toleman team in 1985. Just a year later, the Benetton family had its very own F1 constructor, already celebrating victory at the Mexican Grand Prix in its debut season.

Under Flavio Briatore's leadership and with rising star Michael Schumacher, Benetton became a frontrunner by the early 1990s and secured back-to-back Drivers' Championships in 1994 and 1995. Before selling to Renault in 2000, Benetton had already shown that a fashion house could go far beyond sponsorship – much like Red Bull would later do with an energy drink.

1996 was already monumental for Michael Schumacher. He had just joined Ferrari after winning two titles with Benetton, and Nike, fresh from revolutionising basketball with Michael Jordan, decided it was time to enter Formula 1.

The partnership lasted until 2002, with Nike supplying Schumacher's custom racing boots. They also released the Air Zoom Schu – a limited-edition trainer with a carbon-fibre sole and the driver's signature. It became a collector's item, bringing sneaker culture into Formula 1 like never before.

Long before Jannik Sinner officially became a “Friend of F1” in 2024, the Italian tennis and leisurewear brand Sergio Tacchini had already made its mark. In 1984, the year a rookie called Ayrton Senna made his debut, the brand partnered with Toleman, creating one of the earliest notable crossovers between sportswear and Formula 1.

Sergio Tacchini's branding appeared on the team kit and even on Senna's helmet. The Italian label gained unmatched exposure on the streets of Monaco that year, when Senna rose from 13th on the grid to finish second in torrential rain – a moment that marked the emergence of his immense talent.

If there is a fashion house synonymous with Italian culture and elegance, it is Giorgio Armani. Known for minimalist tailoring that redefined menswear and womenswear in the 1980s, Armani carried that same vision into Formula 1 by announcing a multi-year partnership with Ferrari in 2021.

From that moment, the luxury brand has provided formalwear for the Scuderia to wear off track. Tailored Armani suits for Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz became a fixture at gala dinners, sponsor events and official appearances – a collaboration reflecting two brands united by their obsession with quality, precision and Italian elegance.

Although known today for one of F1's most iconic partnerships – with Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes – it actually began with Lotus. From 1991 to 1994, Tommy Hilfiger put his branding on the teams' car, later partnering with the Scuderia to provide official teamwear until 2001. After a hiatus, the brand returned in 2018 as Mercedes' apparel partner and launching the hugely popular Tommy x Lewis collections.

What makes this partnership stand out is how Hamilton himself became the face – and often the designer – of the brand's Formula 1 presence, claiming his status as a true fashion insider both in and outside the sport. The British champion has consistently made headlines with daring arrival looks at the paddock in what became known to his fashion-forward fans as “Hamilton's Fashion Week.”

Hamilton's presence in the worldwide fashion conversation amplified Tommy Hilfiger's visibility far beyond branded uniforms – it turned the collaboration into a cultural conversation.

Now an Official Partner of F1 ACADEMY, Tommy Hilfiger has extended its footprint with distinctive livery designs and collaborations with driver Alba Larsen for the 2025 season.

The brand even transcended cinema by sponsoring the fictional APXGP team in F1: The Movie, and made headlines when Damson Idris arrived at the 2025 Met Gala in a full F1 race suit and helmet before revealing his tailored Tommy Hilfiger look – a moment that shone alongside Hamilton's inspiring role as co-chair of the Gala.

Having attended the Met Gala seven times since his debut in 2015, Hamilton's influence extended far beyond being a guest. In 2025, he helped shape the theme “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” which he honoured with an acclaimed look by British designer Grace Wales Bonner, rich in symbolism and storytelling.

The rise of fashion in Formula 1 has blurred the lines between sport and lifestyle. From brand launches on the grid to appearances at Fashion Weeks – such as New York Fashion Week, where Mercedes played a role not only through Tommy Hilfiger but also as a former title sponsor – the presence is clear.

An attorney for the pop superstar refutes Baldoni's claim that she consented to questioning in the It Ends With Us legal battle.

Taylor Swift‘s lawyers say the pop superstar has not agreed to sit for a deposition in Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni's bitter legal feud over the movie It Ends With Us, refuting claims from Baldoni's camp that the star had consented to the sit-down.


	Baldoni's attorneys wrote in a request for a discovery schedule extension on Thursday (Sept. 11) that Swift “has agreed to appear for deposition” but cannot do so earlier than Oct. 20 because of “preexisting professional obligations” — presumably referring to the rollout of her highly anticipated twelfth album, The Life of a Showgirl, which arrives on Oct. 3.


	But Swift's longtime attorney Douglas Baldridge says in a Friday (Sept. 12) court filing that this is false.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“My client did not agree to a deposition, but if she is forced into a deposition, we advised (after first hearing about the deposition just three days ago) that her schedule would accommodate the time required during the week of October 20 if the parties were able to work out their disputes,” wrote Baldridge.


	Baldoni has been saying for months that Swift's friendship with Lively makes her a key witness in the lawsuit, in which Lively alleges Baldoni sexually harassed her on the set of It Ends With Us and then orchestrated a retaliatory smear campaign after she complained.


	In June, the federal judge overseeing the legal battle granted Baldoni's request to access Swift and Lively's text messages as part of the document discovery process. Now, Baldoni wants to depose Swift.


	The current discovery schedule has all depositions concluding by the end of September, in anticipation of a March 2026 trial date. But lawyers for Baldoni and his production company, Wayfarer Studios, asked for an extension on Thursday for the Swift deposition.


	Swift's reps have previously slammed Baldoni for “creating tabloid clickbait” by dragging the star into the case despite her minimal involvement in It Ends With Us. Baldridge reiterated this position in his letter to the court on Friday, writing, “Since the inception of this matter we have consistently maintained that my client has no material role in this action.”


	Lively's lawyers have similarly lambasted Baldoni for involving Swift in the litigation, writing in their own Friday court response that the strategy is designed “to generate a media spectacle.”


	The Lively team is against extending the discovery cutoff to question Swift, saying it's Baldoni's own fault for waiting until this week to contact the singer's counsel about scheduling her deposition.


	“The Wayfarer defendants' lack of diligence, and disrespect for Ms. Swift's privacy and schedule, is astounding,” wrote Lively's lawyer Michael Gottlieb. “Ms. Swift is someone whose calendar should be presumed to be packed with professional obligations for months in advance. At any point over the past six months, the Wayfarer defendants could have noticed a deposition, served a subpoena and negotiated an agreeable time and place for this deposition. But they did not.”


	Judge Lewis J. Liman has not yet ruled on Baldoni's discovery extension request.


	The fiery legal battle between Lively and Baldoni has been in full force since last December, when the actress brought sexual harassment and retaliation claims against her It Ends With Us co-star and director.


	Baldoni vehemently denied the allegations and countersued Lively and her inner circle for defamation, though Judge Liman later dismissed Baldoni's counterclaims as legally invalid. Now, only Lively's original allegations are headed toward trial this coming spring.


	The Baldoni team has sought to involve Swift since the early days of the case, writing in court filings that Lively weaponized the “influential and wealthy celebrities” in her orbit to gain leverage over him while making It Ends With Us.


This story was updated on Sept. 12 at 2:27 p.m. ET to reflect that Swift has not agreed to a deposition.

The 12-track companion to his April album includes a response to the after-effects of his breakout hit.

	Josh Glicksman


Writer


	It's a crisp Tuesday afternoon in New York and Joe Keery is happy to be home. As he clears the remnants of a late lunch from Sugarfish off the breakfast nook in his apartment and begins to prepare a green tea, he laments how little time he's been able to spend here this year.


	He offers up the obligatory “Sorry that the place may look like a mess,” but in reality, his West Village apartment is charming and cozy, with shoes neatly collected by the door, several guitars sprawled about the living room, an impressive VHS collection, various memorabilia adorning the handcrafted shelves that shield just a fraction of the space's plentiful exposed brick and a drawing board with a handwritten message from his nieces that hangs near the kitchen.

	











	Keery, 33, will head back out on the road in a mere matter of days, though, as he prepares for a jam-packed fall schedule. Of course, there's the three-part final season of Stranger Things — in which he plays the beloved bully-turned babysitter Steve Harrington — premiering in late November that will require plenty of press. But first, he's focused on the role that has defined his year so far: touring as the alt-rock artist Djo.




			Trending on Billboard		







	On the heels of a year in which his dreamy, synth-pop song “End of Beginning” went viral and peaked at No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 (his first entry on the chart), Keery returned this April with The Crux, his classic rock-influenced full-length recorded at New York's famed Electric Lady Studios. The album's lead single, “Basic Being Basic,” became his first No. 1 on a Billboard chart when it topped Alternative Airplay in July. And he's been touring relentlessly in support of the project, including Down Under at the Laneway Festival, in front of tens of thousands of screaming fans at Lollapalooza in Chicago and at his own headlining dates across the globe.


	As he gears up for his next string of shows beginning later this month — billed as his Another Bite Tour — he's first treating fans to a batch of entirely new music, with the arrival of The Crux Deluxe out today (Sept. 12), a 12-track surprise release that extends the universe of his third album.


	“The songs are all from the same period — it's like a companion piece,” says Keery. “It can be like the punk little brother of The Crux, where it's just a little bit more all over the place.”


	When Keery whittled down the tracklist for the original album, there were more than two dozen contenders in the mix, thanks in large part to a concerted focus on seeing ideas through during the recording process. “We had an imperative to be like, ‘Let's not leave the song unless it's 80% done,' ” he says. “Or else the song doesn't really exist.”


	Plans for the surprise release were solidified as early as May, when Keery and his steady co-writing/co-producing partner Adam Thein had a chance to revisit Electric Lady between legs of tour for some touch-ups — fixing a vocal issue on “Who You Are,” adding a second verse to “They Don't Know What's Right,” removing a few items from “Thich Nhat Hanh,” named after the Vietnamese monk, peace activist and poet.

	











	Crucially, the aim was to avoid any sweeping changes during those sessions. “We didn't want to do too much,” says Keery. “It should be a snapshot of that time period.”


	The result is a deluxe album that sees Keery continuing to lean into his strongest influences: “Love Can't Break the Spell” unspools the five stages of grief following a break-up in the style of Fleetwood Mac; the rebellious flair of “Grime of the World” slides seamlessly into any collection of garage rock-fueled favorites; “Purgatory Silverstar” is a quintessential example of Keery turning a song on its head, sometimes more than once, at a whim — a plucking guitar intro gives way to a Red Hot Chili Peppers-esque rock bridge that then opens into an odyssey with twists and turns reminiscent of Rush or The Who.


The Crux Deluxe also showcases his growing comfortability with experimentation: album closer “Awake” boasts both rollicking guitar ready to blow your hair back and, notably, a set of lyrics solely focused on syllabic fit over substance.


	“I had read something about John Lennon for ‘I Am the Walrus,' and [how] those are nonsense lyrics,” Keery says. “[‘Awake'] was going to be on the album originally. A lot of people were like, ‘Those are my favorite lyrics you've ever written.' It's like, ‘There you f–king go. Maybe you should let your subconscious do a little bit more of the work.' You want to write something that's profound or that connects with people, but there are a million different ways to do that.”


	Then there's “Mr. Mountebank,” a late swap with “Egg” from the album's first installment. It's the deluxe's biggest dip into electro-pop, and Keery's response in part to the success of “End of Beginning,” which he jokes makes him “kind of up my own ass.” (“Climb fast, money talks/ Then they want to sell you on what you're all about,” he sings before reassuring his own standing with “Not afraid, not for sale/ Long game class acts never fail.”) In contrast to “Awake,” “Mr. Mountebank” is Keery at his most vulnerable on the deluxe, which can often flit between abstract metaphors and unfiltered lyrics about relationships, the industry and his own well-being.

	











	“I want to be open,” he implores. “It's just, sometimes you're like, ‘What the hell am I trying to say? What the hell is this song about? Am I repeating myself?' It's less of being scared as it is figuring out what you really feel and trying to get honest with yourself.”


	Keery acknowledges that in the aftermath of “End of Beginning” having its viral moment in 2024, there was a sense of added stress — potentially even subconsciously — leading into the release of The Crux this spring. For the rollout of 2019's Twenty Twenty and 2022's Decide, he had largely kept his life as a musician separate from the fame that followed his acting career, even going so far as to don a wig, sunglasses and a jumpsuit for the occasional live set. But with the runaway success of “End of Beginning,” any hopes of continuing to utilize a disguise went out the window.


	“I felt more pressure — I was putting it on myself, for sure,” Keery admits. “The album was the first thing out after ‘End of Beginning' had done well, so it's like, ‘How do you follow something like that up?' ”


	But the longer that The Crux has been out in the world, the more he has felt that tension begin to dissipate, particularly as he's been able to play it in front of fans around the world. His smile over the course of the afternoon grows the widest at the very instant he gets the opportunity to gush about being onstage this summer with his friends and tourmates — the psych-rock band Post Animal, which he departed in 2017 due to Stranger Things commitments but rejoined earlier this year, has been a special guest throughout the trek.


	“I love that you get better — you really do,” he gleams, referring to the live set. “Bit by bit, you start to chip away at the thing. The shows that we were doing at the end of this run, there's no way we could've done that at the beginning.”

	











	With his Another Bite Tour wrapping at the end of October, and the finale of Stranger Things arriving on New Year's Eve, Keery finds himself closing the book on multiple defining life phases by the end of 2025. “All good things must end,” he says, reflecting on the hit Netflix show's wrap. “It was bittersweet. Everything you think [it would be], that's pretty much exactly how it felt.”


	His calendar is devoid of acting commitments at the moment — though he did recently star in “Loser,” the new music video from Tame Impala, whose upcoming album soundtracks part of our conversation — leaving his schedule for 2026 as something of a temporary question mark outside of a handful of South American touring commitments in March. “I'm at the end of this big chapter,” he says, leaning all the way back on the long cushion in his breakfast nook until he's fully horizontal. “It'd be fun to reinvigorate myself and have a project that would do that. I would be really grateful for that.”


	At the moment, music appears to be taking center stage on that front: Keery notes that he and Thein already started to kick around ideas for new music during their most recent outings at Electric Lady. He also mentions multiple times how excited he is to start playing around with the home set-up he has established in the corner of his living room, which will soon feature the first piano that he's ever owned.


	Plus, as an independent artist that continues to release his music through AWAL, Keery has the added benefit of being able to gearshift in real time, and pursue wherever one of his many passions may lead him next.


	“It's been able to give me autonomy over things that I want to do and it's very liberating,” he says, gesturing to The Crux Deluxe as a perfect example. “I'm excited to surprise people. I think there has been a core group of audience members who have lived with [The Crux] for the summer, and a gift you're not expecting is one of the best gifts.”

Associate Editor, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Victor Rivas Rivers (The Mask of Zorro, Blood In, Blood Out) will guest star in HBO Max‘s hit medical drama The Pitt‘s sophomore season. He will play Trent Norris, PTMC's Chief Executive Officer.


	The series is currently in production and is set to premiere in January.


	From creator R. Scott Gemmill and producer John Wells, The Pitt chronicles the urgent challenges U.S. frontline healthcare professionals face through the lens of the fictional Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center's emergency department. Offering a real-time format, the series traces, hour by hour, the medical cases and personal crises physicians and nurses must navigate as they reckon with an overabundance of patients and a lack of resources.

The Pitt cast is led by Noah Wyle, who also executive produces and writes. Katherine LaNasa, Shawn Hatosy, Taylor Dearden, Patrick Ball, Isa Briones, Fiona Dourif, Supriya Ganesh, Shabana Azeez and Gerran Howell round out the ensemble cast. New Season 2 additions include Sepideh Moafi as a series regular, and Charles Baker, Irene Choi, Laëtitia Hollard, Lucas Iverson and Lawrence Robinson in recurring roles.




			Watch on Deadline		







Deadline recently revealed that new Emmy nominee Hatosy will direct the ninth episode of Season 2, which takes place over the Fourth of July weekend. Wyle will also take on directing duties. The pair will work together more closely this season, as Dr. Michael “Robby” Robinavitch (Wyle) will count on Dr. Jack Abbot (Hatosy) and newly joined Dr. Al-Hashimi (Moafi) to help with attending duties. The show will also delve deeper into Abbot's personal life, particularly his relationship with his deceased wife, whom he loved deeply. He continues to wear his wedding ring.

	











	LaNasa, who was also recently nominated for her portrayal of charge nurse Dana Evans, teased that there will be a conversation between her character and Santos (Briones) that will take place in episode 6, which they're currently shooting. In Season 1, Santos told Dana of her concerns that senior resident Dr. Frank Langdon (Ball) may be pocketing drugs that were meant for patients. Dana brushed her off, but it was later revealed that Langdon was doing what Santos accused him of. With Dana and Santos working so closely together in the ER, hopefully, they can find a way to move past their past differences. More on what The Pitt team has shared about Season 2 can be found here.


	Season 1 of the series has already won Gotham TV and TCA Awards and has 13 Emmy nominations, including for Outstanding Drama Series, Lead Actor in a Drama Series for Wyle, Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for Hatosy, and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for LaNasa.


	The medical drama's freshman season is also set to air on TNT.


	John Wells Productions produces The Pitt in association with Warner Bros. Television, where JWP is under an overall deal. EPs are Wyle, Wells, JWP's Erin Jontow, Michael Hissrich, and Simran Baidwan.


	Rivas Rivers is represented by The Green Room, which has two other clients on The Pitt for Season 2: Charles Baker and Evan Allen Gessesse.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Joe Wright wishes his Mussolini show wasn't so timely","https://www.avclub.com/joe-wright-interview-mussolini-son-of-the-century-tv-mubi","Fri, 12 Sep 2025 18:00:00 GMT","

A dangerous demagogue swept into power by an ill-informed populace. Military forces turned on civilian populations. Intimidation at the polls. A fourth estate annexed by the government. These developments could describe the United States in the 2020s, but they're pivotal events in Joe Wright's Mussolini: Son Of The Century, a stylish and riveting limited series based on the first book in Antonio Scurati's series about the founder of fascism, Benito Mussolini. The show, which premiered on September 10 in the U.S. on MUBI after debuting on Sky Atlantic, charts the Italian dictator's rise to power, starting with his ouster from the Italian Socialist Party, his embrace of Italian nationalism, and his use of secret police. 

Grim as that history may be, Wright's eight-parter, like the book it draws from, is anything but. Along with his co-writers Stefano Bises, Davide Sevino, and Scurati, the Pride & Prejudice and Darkest Hour director crafts a fascinating amalgam of fact and fancy to capture how a tyrant like Mussolini could capture the imagination of the Italian citizenry after the first World War. That was part of Wright's mission to better understand the roots of fascism, which have stretched into the present. Although there's the occasional nod to Mussolini's modern-day analogs, like a call to “make Italy great again,” Wright and his collaborators let audiences draw their own parallels—a task that is being made easier, at least for many U.S. viewers, in the Trump presidency.

Aside from just not being his style, Wright tells The A.V. Club he knew he couldn't put forth a straightforward history lesson or a bleak drama. That wouldn't deepen anyone's understanding of how someone as alternately loathsome and pathetic as Mussolini became entrenched in politics. It was equally important to the filmmaker that the dictator not be depicted as a one-dimensional monster. That would elide how he came to rule and the “shared responsibility” of those who swept him into power. Instead, Mussolini: Son Of The Century keenly—sometimes hilariously and always with great elan—observes everything that went wrong and right to create a path for fascism to find its way to the highest levels of government. 

The A.V. Club talked to Wright about the series, the “centrist” U.S. entertainment industry that made its Stateside arrival look unlikely, and the incidental topicality of his recent work.  

The A.V. Club: Antonio Scurati described his book as a documentary novel because of all the historical records and documents he incorporated. What term would you use to describe your series: historical drama or…?

Joe Wright: I guess I would call it a historical political horror, maybe. [Laughs] But I tried to find the cinematic equivalent of Scurati's form, and so the show involves lots of different media, from newspapers to drama to first person narration, to try and create that kaleidoscopic view on this subject.

AVC: As far as the narration, there's obviously a bit of that in the book. Did that inspire Luca Marinelli's talk-to-camera moments as Mussolini in the show?

JW: Yeah. There was a little piece at the beginning of the book where Mussolini talks in first person. And we felt that using this first person allowed access to a contemporary audience and thematically was interesting because it suggests him trying to take control of his own narrative. As the show progresses, he more and more loses control of that narrative.

AVC: In trying to land on the right approach for the adaptation, you said you drew from lots of sources of inspiration, citing films like Dziga Vertov's Man With A Movie Camera and Howard Hawks' Scarface as well as '90s rave culture as influences. What other references can people expect to see in your show? I thought I caught a nod to My Fair Lady in a scene from one of the early episodes.

JW: [Do you mean] the horse race?

AVC: Yes.

JW: Absolutely. I really had to dig quite deep on this. It is eight hours long, and that's a lot of screen time to keep it engaging and to keep up that collage effect. I was pulling references from all over the place. There's even sequences of puppet theater in the show. I guess one of the big influences was a movie called The Damned by [Luchino] Visconti and especially the sequence that depicts the Night Of The Long Knives. That's a film about the moral corruption of the Nazi ideology, so that was a big influence. And Italian cinema in general—I've always been a huge fan. The opportunity to go and pretend that I was an Italian director, working amongst the ghosts of all those greats at Cinecittà Studios in Rome was extraordinary to me. I feel very privileged to have had that opportunity.



AVC: Can you talk a bit about the decision to make this a very Italian production? Because I think the temptation right now would be to have a bunch of American actors or other European actors attempting an accent. But there's just something about listening to the dialogue in Italian and realizing how much of what's happening onscreen translates. 

JW: Yeah, it's interesting. I don't speak Italian, so I was working in a completely foreign language. Originally, we had discussed the idea that when Mussolini talks directly to camera, he would be speaking in English, and then the dialogue between the different characters would be in Italian. And then Giorgia Meloni's party, the Brothers Of Italy, came to power whilst we were in pre-production, and at that point, I felt I wanted every single Italian to understand every single word of what was being said.

I'm not sure if it would've worked with actors from other cultures. If you have British actors, their heritage is all very text-based, and so they all stand there and talk. American actors are quite psychoanalysis-based—it's all about the feelings—whereas the Italian actors are all very physical. They come from a heritage of commedia dell'arte. There's something incredibly physical and vocally operatic about the way they use their voices, so they convey feeling in a much more extroverted way. I guess that certainly helped me and, I think, is helpful to the audience.

But I think it's really exciting that we now see so many foreign language shows on our streaming platforms—Squid Game and My Brilliant Friend. I think audiences are more open to that experience now in a way that they probably weren't 10 or 15 years ago.

AVC: Earlier this year, in an interview with Christiane Amanpour, you said your goal in making this show was to understand fascism, its etymology. What did you learn about it while making the show? And were you particularly surprised by anything?

JW: I'm always trying to look at the kind of human impulse behind the actions, and I guess what I discovered was that, for me, fascism is the politicization of toxic masculinity that expresses itself on a personal level in terms of relationship with the self, or in a domestic level with the family, or in a local level with friends, or finally on a national political level. It's the same thing. It goes all the way through. I think at the center of fascism and, therefore, toxic masculinity, is a kind of void—a kind of emptiness and a need to fill that emptiness with something. But it's never really for anything. It's against lots of things, but it's never really for anything. That's one of the reasons why I think I've always felt it very difficult to define, to pin down what exactly it is.

AVC: You also described the entertainment industry in the U.S. specifically as becoming more apolitical and centrist. Did that make you concerned at all about finding a distributor for the show?

JW: Yeah, very much so. We'd finished the show, and it was financed out of Europe, and so we were looking for distribution. One of the major streamers told me that they liked the show very much, but that they found it too controversial, which really shocked me because I wasn't aware that anti-fascism was controversial now. So that was surprising and alarming.

AVC: I'd like to ask you about what I see as kind of the other side of that coin. A lot of people today have this view, misguided or not, that depiction equals endorsement—that unless the bad person gets their comeuppance by the end of the runtime, their behavior is effectively being endorsed by the film or the show. What are your thoughts on that kind of approach to watching any kind of media?

JW: I think that underestimates the intelligence of our audience, frankly. I don't think audiences are children who need to be fed simple solutions. And in fact, that's one of the things that fascism does, is it just disregards the complexity of our shared experience and offers simple solutions that are indeed actually lies.

Unfortunately, bad people don't always get their comeuppance. That's something we learn as we develop out of childhood. I think that it's important. I consider it important to try and understand these characters as humans and not to demonize them, because by demonizing them, we absolve ourselves of responsibility, whereas by humanizing them, we engage in the shared responsibility of these people's actions and we can talk about where it comes from. As I mentioned, the whole idea about toxic masculinity: We can talk about why, what vulnerabilities, what fears feed this kind of behavior. And then we can take responsibility to try and change that.

AVC: I appreciate your insights because, without getting too into the weeds, there does seem to be an overlap between waning media literacy and cultural criticism and the role the media plays in political movements. Son Of The Century certainly explores how the power of the press can be used for good or ill.

Now, back in 2017, you told The Guardian you had always wanted to make a topical film, and you ended up getting one with Darkest Hour almost by accident. The timing seems to keep working out for you because Darkest Hour premiered at the start of the first Trump presidency and now Son Of The Century is coming out as we are seeing the chilling effects of the second one. Are you at all concerned that timeliness will put people off? Or do you think it's an advantage for the show here, in terms of getting more eyes on it?

JW: Oh, god, I wish it wasn't as timely. I wish that it was just of intellectual interest or historical interest and had no relation to our current world situation. And I think that's really important to state. It's not just America that's facing these questions right now. So I wish it weren't so timely.

However, I certainly felt that I needed to educate myself a little bit more before I bandied that word “fascism” around. I think we do need to look at our history to understand where we are and learn from the lessons that are available to us. Yeah, I guess that's what I have to say. I think it's useful. History is there for us as a resource to try and help guide us as we move forward.

AVC: I read that you are working next on an AI thriller, which feels like a real departure for you from these lush period pieces. Can you talk about that idea at all?

JW: Yeah, I don't know, I guess I never set out to do period movies. I didn't go, “I'm going to make a career of doing period movies.” It just kind of happened. I became fascinated by this script and these ideas in the AI film, and so I've been reading and researching that world. It's also a little bit political. It feels like a story that needs telling.
