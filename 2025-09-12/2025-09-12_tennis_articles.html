All I can say is I'm pretty happy with how I played today.”Tjen was already the first woman from Indonesia to make a WTA quarterfinal since Angelique Widjaja in 2004 (Bali), and the 23-year-old went one round deeper over the streaking No. Born in Jakarta, Tjen burst onto the scene less than a month ago at the 2025 US Open, winning three rounds of qualifying and shocking No. 24 seed Veronika Kudermetova in her Grand Slam main draw debut. Playing at the WTA 250 event in Sao Paulo, she knocked out No. 7 seed Leolia Jeanjena in straight sets and backed up the win with a 6-1, 6-0 win over Slovak qualifier Martina Okalova to book her spot in the last eight.“I was focusing on every point, especially playing against Alex Eala,” Tjen said. “We all know that she can come back at any time, and I was just trying to focus and stay in it until the end.”Waiting for her there was an in-form Eala, fresh off her first WTA 125K title run at the Guadalajara 125 Open earlier this month. She made her first WTA final three months later on grass in Eastbourne and dropped just two sets en route to the title in Guadalajara, rallying from a set down to defeat Pann Udvardy in the final. “I was focusing on every point, especially playing against Alex Eala,” Tjen said. “We all know that she can come back at any time, and I was just trying to focus and stay in it until the end.”Waiting for her there was an in-form Eala, fresh off her first WTA 125K title run at the Guadalajara 125 Open earlier this month.

She made quick work of her SP Open opposition to reach the quarterfinals and took a quick 2-0 lead on Tjen when their match began on Friday. But Tjen quickly caught fire from there, winning 12 of the final 15 games to surge into the semifinal in just over an hour.Standing between Tjen and her first WTA final will be either No. 6 seed Francesca Jones, who each won their second-round matches in straight sets.

One of those rivals, Rafael Nadal, was his partner, while Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray (who would later play his last match in doubles) teammates on Team Europe.Having not played on tour since Wimbledon the previous summer due to a knee injury, the extent of Federer's participation in this London edition of Laver Cup was unclear. But even in just one Day 1 doubles match, it was a fitting Federer farewell.“I'm happy I made it through,” he said afterwards.

But even in just one Day 1 doubles match, it was a fitting Federer farewell.“I'm happy I made it through,” he said afterwards. He nearly made it through as a winner, having match point on his serve against Team World's U.S. duo of Jack Sock and Frances Tiafoe. Federer and Nadal won the first set, 6-4, and dropped the second in a tiebreaker before playing a 10-point tiebreak to decide matters.Trailing 6-7, Federer intercepted Sock's attempted pass down the line and left Tiafoe flailing at net with a winning volley. So much so that on the very next point, Tiafoe's hit Federer in the front court with a forehand.The crowd booed lustily, but always the good sport, the Swiss raised his racquet to let his legions of supportes know it was a perfectly legal play.

Djokovic raised his arms in support as everyone in the O2 Arena rose to their feet.But the next three points went back to the Americans, as Federer's career came to a close.“It's been a wonderful day,” a teary-eyed Federer said in his on-court interview after his 1,750th combined match in singles and doubles. He never retired from a match once, but it was finally time for him to retire from the game.“I told the guys I'm happy, I'm not sad.

A post shared by Real Club de Tenis Betis (@clubtenisbetis) The Albero at Real Club de Tenis Betis dated back to the club's beginnings in the 1920s and posed a distinctive challenge for players on tour.“There's less sand on the court, which makes it a bit faster overall,” said Frenchman Hugo Gaston after his first experience on the surface two years ago.“It might take a moment to adjust, but in terms of play it's quite similar to traditional clay courts,” added Sweden's Elias Ymer.“This event is part of the history of Spanish tennis with a great tradition. That makes us proud, but also gives us the drive to keep improving,” explained former tournament director Santiago Pérez Romero.That drive eventually led to the end of an era. Broadcasters had long complained that the yellow court made the yellow ball hard to follow on television. Rising maintenance costs also played a role in the decision to switch to Europe's more standard red clay in 2024. “There's less sand on the court, which makes it a bit faster overall,” said Frenchman Hugo Gaston after his first experience on the surface two years ago.“It might take a moment to adjust, but in terms of play it's quite similar to traditional clay courts,” added Sweden's Elias Ymer.“This event is part of the history of Spanish tennis with a great tradition.

A post shared by Copa Sevilla Challenger (@copasevillachallenger) How do players feel about the change?“I've played on both surfaces and reached the second round both times,” said Spain's Carlos López Montagud. “I didn't enjoy playing in Seville because of the unique Albero, but because of the people who make this tournament so special,” he said.With the three-time champion sidelined by injury this year, Peruvian youngster Ignacio Buse seized his chance and was crowned the new champion. His triumph not only marks another milestone in his promising career but also ensures that the vibrant story of the Copa Sevilla will continue to unfold - now on red clay. “I didn't enjoy playing in Seville because of the unique Albero, but because of the people who make this tournament so special,” he said.With the three-time champion sidelined by injury this year, Peruvian youngster Ignacio Buse seized his chance and was crowned the new champion.
