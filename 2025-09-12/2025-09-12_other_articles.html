                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DJ Qualls (Z Nation, The Man in the High Castle) played recurring character Garth Fitzerald IV on Supernatural. Garth eventually turned into a kindly, dentist, family man, and werewolf. In real life he's been an avid SPN convention attendee, keeping in touch with his former castmates — and even finding his life partner at a con. Below, DJ Qualls reflects on Supernatural, his convention experience, and more. Do you remember your first SPN convention? DJ Qualls: Even though we were both on Supernatural, I met my partner Ty Olsson [who played vampire Benny Lafitte] in 2012 at the Birmingham, England, convention. I was walking past the place where all the actors' headshots were up, and I'm like, “Who's that?” And it was Ty dressed up as Benny. He invited  himself on my trip to Prague, and I was there with my buddy and he was like, “Where are you guys going after this?”  I'm like, “Prague.” And he said , “Can I come?” Samantha Smith had been saying, “Hey, what's up?” at different shows over the years. The beauty of this is when you have such a large cast, these are our meeting points; this is where we forged real friendship. We celebrated Ty's birthday at our show in Indianapolis last year. It was really special because I got to bring him out a cake. And it was a nice moment that the fans were there for. My deal with Creation [the owners of many fan conventions] is that I work from 9am until midnight on Friday. On Saturday nights, I always get off at 5, and I take some staff and fans out to see the city we're in. Every single person who meets me in the whole world says how tall I am. I'm 6-feet, 2-and-a-half inches, but a lot of my characters are meek, which projects small. But aside from that, I've worked for so many years outside of Supernatural, I hear with pride, “I knew you before Supernatural.” The  good things about the early teen comedies I did is that kids who watch the series get introduced to those movies by their parents. To have your name on an episode is a pretty cool thing. But the episode was all fun  The monster was amazing, kind of looked like the monsters from The Ring, and I got to do a stunt where they pulled me out of a sugar glass window, which was really great. That's when I  realized our hunter coats' interior pockets are cut out and people hand you all that stuff because there's no way you can pull the stuff that we pull out of those coats. You're one of the few people in Supernatural who didn't die for real. I mean, if you died on Supernatural, there's a high chance you were going to be revived, go back to life. But I didn't have to even go through any of that. Garth, I think, was so beloved, it would've been a hard sell to kill him. And also I think his function in the later years of the series was to show a life beyond hunting. I was really not happy when they made me a werewolf because I thought they were trying to kill me. The lore of the show is that Dean is going to have to kill me or at least ostracize me. But they wrote a beautiful dinner party scene where he got to see that we werewolves were normal monsters or normal people living as monsters or … Did you take home anything from the set? So Supernatural is notoriously stingy about giving away props. I tried to take a silver bullet necklace, and they asked for it back, and I got it out of a bucket of like 20 of  them 'cause everybody in the scene had to have one. They gave me Mr. Fizzles, though, the little puppet that I used to talk to and scare children with. My dog was special needs — he was born with too much water on his brain and he could only walk in a circle — so the voice that I used to talk to him was the voice that I gave to Mr. Fizzles. But then they sold my hunter coat at a yard sale for $10 without asking me, and I'm still mad about it. If anybody out there has my hunter coat, I want it back! I'll give you a thousand dollars for it right now. Diyah Pera / ©The CW Network / courtesy Everett Collection If there's ever a reunion movie or some kind of limited series, what do you think Garth would be doing? In the last episodes, it was called a hero's journey. And I can't imagine as time goes on and his children grow up that he wouldn't want to go back to doing what he has done since childhood. I think as an older man, maybe when he is Bobby's age, there would be a callback to that. Also, who knows what's going to happen in the monster world. Garth would be the guy to do it. Why do you think Supernatural became one of the biggest cult shows? No matter what language you speak and what culture you're from, hot people chasing bad people or monsters is universal. On the most superficial level, I think that's a really good reason. I mean, also, the storytelling's great, but it's the whole thing of beautiful people doing good and evil, right? So many of them have told me how much they loved working on the series. To give me a chair back with my name on it — that's what they do for series regulars! It was a way of saying, “Hey, welcome back. Usually when you guest star, you have so much pressure to know every single line and every single word. But when they basically said, “Hey, this is your backyard, too,” it frees you up and it makes the work better, too. And also on Fridays, a woman brought hot sandwiches. Every actor asked about the hot sandwiches on Friday. What would you write in a letter to fans? First, I would tell them how important it is how much love we get back from them. They tell us what the show means to them, but what they don't realize is loving the [cons] and coming to see us when we appear allows the actors to be present in each other's lives, more than just texting. Tell me another cast that gets to see each other over and over again on a regular basis. When Jared had his accident, we all knew about it before anybody did.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They spark theories, arguments, and rewatches, which is part of what keeps a great show alive long after it's ended. Over a decade since the finale,Lost remains bold, emotional, and sometimes brilliant, but it also leaves behind a trail of unresolved storylines that remain frustrating to this day. What follows is the 10 most disappointing mysteries that never paid off. He could manipulate survivors, take on Locke's form, and bring death in an instant, yet the series insisted he was bound by “rules” handed down by Jacob. The problem is that those rules were never defined or explained. That made him feel less like a terrifying force and more like a villain the writers didn't know how to handle. Sometimes he was unstoppable, other times strangely powerless, depending on what the story required. By leaning on vague restrictions instead of defined constraints,Lost drained the menace from its most important antagonist. Season 5 gave us one ofLost's strangest abandoned mysteries. Sawyer, Juliet, and the group found themselves in an outrigger, only to be attacked by unknown gunmen. The moment was tense and fast-moving, clearly meant to set up a reveal later, except that it was a plot twist that never led anywhere, and the scene was never revisited. What looked like a carefully planted clue turned out to be meaningless, and instead of rewarding viewers with a clever twist, the writers simply moved on. The fertility issue was one ofLost's biggest teases. What made this especially frustrating is how many characters were tied to it. Dropping it completely made those arcs feel unfinished. Desmond's time travel powers were some of the show's most memorable moments. His mind could slip between different points in his life, and episodes like “The Constant” showed how powerful that idea could be. Fans expected a real explanation, but the show never settled on one. Was it physics, destiny, or simply another unexplained island gift? Instead of a brilliant payoff, we got ambiguity. Hints were scattered, but nothing ever added up. What could have been a groundbreaking twist in TV storytelling ended up feeling like another abandoned thread. Early on, the island felt nothing short of miraculous. These events pointed to something larger at work, a supernatural system with its own rules. The inconsistency turned a powerful idea into little more than background detail. Locke's recovery initially defined his faith in the island, yet later the show treated it casually, as if it no longer mattered. By leaving the mystery unresolved,Lost squandered what could have been one of its most meaningful storylines. What made it worse was how deeply healing shaped characters' choices. Locke believed his life's purpose was tied to the island, while Rose finally had hope after years of sickness. Without a clear explanation, those captivating moments of rebirth felt empty in hindsight. Early on, Walt displayed abilities that no other character had. Animals behaved strangely around him, and he seemed to sense things others couldn't. The Others even singled him out, treating him as someone unique, and viewers were led to believe his powers would eventually unlock a major part of the island's mystery. Behind-the-scenes issues may have shaped that choice, but within the story it came across as careless. After so much buildup, leaving his abilities hanging felt like a broken promise to the audience. He was kidnapped, studied, and framed as vital to the island's fate. To simply drop him without explanation only made fans question whether the show's other mysteries would ever lead anywhere. Throughout the series, ghosts appeared to different survivors. Jack saw his father, Hurley spoke with dead companions, and others experienced similar visions. Sometimes these figures offered guidance, and other times they only deepened the confusion. While the show suggested a connection to the island's power or Jacob, it never made clear why only specific characters were affected. Christian Shephard, Jack's father, appears in 19 episodes across six seasons, but only a handful of those appearances are as a living character. Were these encounters supernatural, psychological, or simply tricks of the Man in Black? I'd lean toward the latter, but it was all treated so inconsistently. But in flashbacks, we saw him moving freely across the world, visiting future candidates and shaping their lives. And if the island required a constant guardian, why was Jacob allowed long absences? Enormous and mysterious, it suggested a lost civilization had once thrived there. By the time most survivors encountered it, only the foot remained, sparking endless speculation about who created it and what culture had left such a mark. All fans ever learned was that it represented Taweret, the Egyptian goddess of fertility and protection. Naturally, fans expected a major reveal tying everything together. The numbers were mentioned often but never explained, leaving them as little more than a recurring motif. Considering how central they were, this omission felt like the biggest disappointment of all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An elderly shopkeeper in Turkey almost lost his left arm after his hand became seriously infected as a result of a human bite during an attempted robbery. Doctors frequently warn that another human's bite is often more dangerous than that of a dog or a cat, but a 60-year-old man in Istanbul, Turkey, found that out the hard way after nearly losing his arm. The case occurred last year, but it was only reported by Turkish media this year, after it was published in a scientific journal by the doctors who treated the patient. In early 2024, a 60-year-old shop owner was robbed while working at his store in Üsküdar, a district of Istanbul. In the physical struggle that ensued, the 60-year-old managed to immobilize one of the thieves, who bit his hand hard in a desperate attempt to escape. Both men are still at large to this day, but the 60-year-old man is less worried about that and more thankful for having an unexpected ordeal. Unfortunately, his health worsened soon after, as he began experiencing fever and tremors. He went to the Sultan Abdulhamid Han Training and Research Hospital, where doctors informed him that he was suffering from an infection caused by the robber's bite. It had changed color and swollen to double its normal size, but doctors were powerless to stop it. Faced with the risk of amputation, the hospital decided to try hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which can help wounds, especially infected ones, heal more quickly. In this case, the patient's hand size increased significantly, complicating his recovery,” Dr. Yavuz Aslan told the Demirören News Agency (DHA). This case is currently being documented in the medical literature, highlighting the severity of infections caused by human bites. As for the shop owner, he recently had to deal with another robbery, but this time there was no biting.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Daisy May And Charlie Cooper's NightWatch, a new factual entertainment series looking at paranormal activity, is to air on BBC Two and iPlayer. “It will be a miracle if we both come out alive and well.” The show will see them visit locations such as historic castles and Victorian prisons, with each episode beginning with a tour around the place they will be staying where the pair learn about its ghost stories, before they are left alone and a countdown clock to dawn begins. The series will start at the closed down HMP Gloucester, close to the Coopers' hometown, where they will spend the night shut in a small cell, before they move on to locations such as an old pub frequented by highwaymen in Cannock Chase, bat infested ruins in Herefordshire, and a cinema in York. Catherine Catton, BBC head of factual entertainment and events, said: “We are really looking forward to spending the night with Daisy May and Charlie Cooper in some of the UK's spookiest places.” Lisa Clark, executive producer, added: “Working with Daisy May and Charlie in some of the spookiest buildings in the UK was terrifying – but also a lot of fun.” Each episode will last 30 minutes, with a release date yet to be announced.</p>

On Jan. 21, at 12:22 a.m. local time, in the silence and darkness of Chile's Patagonia region, a camera trap used to monitor wildlife for a project run by the University of Magallanes (UMAG) captured, in 2 seconds, three photographs showing intense lights moving downward. "Apparently, these lights, which are initially distant, approach and remain in front of the camera, dazzling it, in a movement that appears to be descending." Since the project began in November 2023, at least 365,000 images and videos have been collected; however, only these three photographs show this phenomenon. UMAG shared the images with a variety of organizations, from Chile's General Directorate of Civil Aeronautics (SEFAA)to the La Serena UFO Museum, and to several people who analyze anomalous aerial phenomena. Potential explanations ranged from an arachnid coming very close to the camera lens to that of a "plasmoid," a short-lived form of plasma rarely observed in nature that may be behind phenomena such as ball lightning. However, all specialists agreed: for now, there is no conclusive explanation. This sighting is unique because it was recorded within the framework of a scientific project, said Rodrigo Bravo, a researcher with the Environmental Studies Group (GEA) at UMAG and a member of the Public Baseline project. That means there is no possibility of fraud or manipulation, as the camera traps operate under rigorous protocols and are equipped with an infrared system, motion sensor, and other features that would preclude people tampering with them, he argued. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Related: No aliens in NASA's debut UFO report — but big questions remain One possibility is that the lights are unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), possibly from a mysterious flying object. Some declassified Pentagon files on UAP show similar characteristics, Bravo added. Generally poor-quality data means that most UAP sightings cannot be confirmed or explained, but common explanations include foreign spy drones and "airborne clutter" such as birds and weather balloons. To address that possibility, UMAG sent photos and video to Freddy Alexis, who discusses UFOs and other unknown phenomena on his TV programs on UCVTV, the station of the Catholic University of Valparaíso. In the second report, he wrote that only a single "luminous stimulus" is visible, not two, and that the other "lights" are internal lens reflections. The most familiar atmospheric example is ball lightning, usually associated with storms. "There were no atmospheric conditions for a storm, so it is very unlikely that ball lightning could have formed." But more exotic plasmoids have been proposed under special conditions, such as transient, localized changes in Earth's magnetic field. Still, Alexis noted that there may be other, poorly understood atmospheric plasmoids, similar to the "mysterious lights" of Hessdalen, Norway. Like the Magallanes phenomenon, these lights defy conventional explanations and could involve plasma structures that are still poorly understood. Alexis suggested that the lights might not be a flying object, but some plasmoids can move at high speeds, he added. In a separate report, technicians from La Serena UFO Museum suggested that a spider or moth may have inadvertently tripped the camera's sensor. That's because in the first photo, what appears to be an insect or arachnid can be seen along one edge of the image. Riffo noted that the camera traps are designed to minimize false positives caused by insects, lasers or other stimuli. "It could be two different phenomena: one natural, which triggered the camera, and the other, a light phenomenon, which remains unexplained," Riffo told Live Science. So far, "they have not found an explanation," Riffo said. For this reason, researchers from the La Serena UFO Museum are planning to carry out their own on-site fieldwork in the area to collect additional data and analyze other local parameters, such as the terrain, lighting conditions, and environmental factors. Controversial paper questions whether interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS is 'possibly hostile' alien tech in disguise —Cosmic rays could help support alien life on worlds outside the 'Goldilocks zone' Bravo added that the monitoring project in the area is scheduled to continue for up to 10 more years, and more camera traps are planned, raising hopes that this strange phenomenon may be captured again. "The scientists involved are eager to know what this was. This is also science: it's about discovering what happens in nature," Bravo said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Samantha is a writer based in Los Angeles. Television is her one true love, and she tweets about it. Death has never stopped a Winchester, but walking around the halls of a Supernatural fan convention, you'd swear they never died to begin with. It's been nearly five years since the beloved CW series aired its final episode — and Sept. 13 marks the 20th anniversary of the series premiere — but as fans line up for photos with series stars Jensen Ackles, Misha Collins, and Jared Padalecki at a Creation convention in Austin last month, the level of excitement would make you swear the show was still on. When Supernatural premiered in 2005, it introduced viewers to Sam (Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Ackles), two brothers who were raised in the business of monster hunting after a demon killed their mother when they were young. As adults, they couldn't seem to escape that life — no matter how hard Sam tried. Across 15 seasons, fans watched as the brothers — with some some help from Collins' winged Castiel — battled just about everything you (and the writers) could imagine: Bloody Mary, vampires, demons, angels, witches, talking teddy bears, God himself, you name it. Propelled by a dedicated fandom, the series seemed to be immortal, until Ackles and Padalecki decided it was time to say goodbye. "We had that moment where he and I both realized that we didn't want it to end," Padalecki told Entertainment Weekly back in 2020. "It finally got to a point, ironically, where it was like, 'I never want to leave this. But you never want to be the last person at a party. As Ackles added at the time, "[Jared] and I were always married to the fact that we never wanted to go out with a diet version of what we had. We wanted to have enough gas left in the tank to get us racing across the finish line. We didn't want to limp across." In November of 2020, after a months-long production halt due to the COVID-19 quarantine, the show aired its final episode, which devastated fans when Dean died fighting vampires, and Sam had to live out the rest of his life without his big brother. )But nothing stays dead on Supernatural — and that includes the show itself. Sitting on stage at that same convention in August, Padalecki starts to answer a question when he casually throws in an "if, and hopefully when, we do come back..." a phrase that has the crowd cheering. It's not the first time the actors have talked about their hopes of once again lacing up Sam and Dean's boots one day, and it likely won't be the last. Regardless of its future, Supernatural's legacy is undeniable. As it celebrates its 20th anniversary, EW reunited Ackles, Padalecki, and Collins to answer 20 questions about some of the show's best (and worst) moments. QUESTION 1: What was the very first scene each of you filmed on Supernatural? [To Ackles] It was with you. PADALECKI: I think a lot of people might watch that episode and be like, "What are they doing with the little, like, you know, hard drive disk, and it magnifies it?" Because it was the old school library hard drive thing. Didn't we go over to the Dewey Decimal System at some point? And started like looking through that. ACKLES: I know we used that. MISHA COLLINS: My first scene was the very first scene that Castiel shows up for-- ACKLES: Oh, the barn scene. COLLINS: My debut performance on Supernatural was so substandard that we did a reshoot the next day, because they got the dailies back of my creepy performance and they were like-- COLLINS: Yeah, this is true. ACKLES: I don't remember doing that again. PADALECKI: They probably just did his coverage. ACKLES: Yeah, all of his stuff was great. PADALECKI: Just bring in the other guy. ACKLES: Just bring in that new guy. PADALECKI: With the weird voice. QUESTION 2: What was the most underrated episode? ACKLES: Probably the one where Misha was introduced. I thought that episode was absolutely awesome. PADALECKI: To Misha's point, I think a lot of the ones that we did that wouldn't work on literally any other television show that's ever aired, you know, where we play ourselves, where it's all from the vantage point of a vehicle, it wouldn't work. COLLINS: And in fairness, a lot of those episodes didn't work on Supernatural either. QUESTION 3: What's the series' best needle drop? That's a very damn close second. My favorite needle drop is a scene I am not in. When I heard Bowie come on, [Singing] "Ground control to Major Tom," I was like, "What?" A) How did they find the money to pay for this? PADALECKI: And then I remember the crew complaining for the week after because there was no food, because they had spent all the money-- ACKLES: Oh, that's what it was. Yeah, well, you know, sometimes filming is tough. COLLINS: Castiel had to cradle a baby and put the baby to sleep, and it was scripted that he was supposed to sing "Highway to Hell," but on the day that I got there to film, they were like, "It turns out that's too expensive for you to sing 'Highway to Hell,' so you're gonna sing the theme song to The Greatest American Hero." ACKLES: I'm gonna go back to the basics with "Back in Black." QUESTION 4: What's a script you remember reading for the first time? PADALECKI: So "French Mistake" was an episode where we all play ourselves. And it was one of the few times, maybe the only time, where the writers called us ahead of time and said, "Hey, we have this idea for an episode, but we wanted to run it by you first." COLLINS: They asked us because they had to get us to sign off on it. PADALECKI: Because it was our likenesses. COLLINS: They had to get our permission. We didn't realize it, but we had a tremendous amount of power. QUESTION 5: Is "Bugs" actually the worst episode of Supernatural? ACKLES: Yes, I think it was, because of what we went through and what it ended up being. COLLINS: Did you actually have bugs? ACKLES: We were literally being stung by bees. And then they get to post [production], and the bees didn't show up on camera so they had to VIXFX the bees. PADALECKI: We go meet the bee specialist and it's a dude with, like, mesh and a big pair of surgical tweezers holding a bee saying, "So we're going to sting you, but it can't give all of its venom. But we'll find out if you're allergic." And then, when we were shooting the episode, and they're like, "Listen, there's no queen bee here, so they're not gonna bite you. Well, how do you piss them off? Wait, the whole scene is about us trying to get rid of bees. They're like, "Don't get rid of the bees, just guide them away. It was the most absurd thing. I sat on one bee. I feel like [the worst episode] was one of the Leviathan episodes that got a little too heavy into the Dick Roman of it all. We leaned so hard into all the dick jokes. COLLINS: But what is the right number of dick jokes? PADALECKI: That's a good question. QUESTION 6: Name three essentials in any motel room set. The kind of see-through partitions was something that [production designer] Jerry Wanek had in every [motel room]. it was like a quintessential Supernatural thing. COLLINS: The round, Formica-top table. PADALECKI: Did he ever thank you? COLLINS: You don't remember Mica, the PA? Sounds like he's got a lot of tables. PADALECKI: The quarter vibrating bed machine. ACKLES: I employed it a lot. QUESTION 7: Who's a guest star you wanted to see more of? PADALECKI: For some reason, my brain is going to Titus Welliver. I'm such a fan of his work. We had such a long list of just exceptional people come through the door. COLLINS: I loved all of them equally. ACKLES: Well, we know that's not true. QUESTION 8: Which scene required the most takes? ACKLES: I don't wanna talk about it. PADALECKI: "Keeps a ruler by the bed--" ACKLES: I don't want to talk about. ACKLES: I don't want to talk about it. PADALECKI: We had to do, like, a thousand times. QUESTION 9: Which scene required the fewest takes? ACKLES: I don't know, I mean, there were a lot of one-take scenes. But I mean, in general that scene took fewer takes. QUESTION 10: What's the scene you're most proud of? COLLINS: For me, I think it's Castiel's goodbye scene. I loved the message that it sent more broadly. I loved the emotional connectedness that I ended up having with the scene. ACKLES: There's a few that stand out. But there's one that was kind of a subtle one that I was proud of, because it wasn't scripted the way that I did it. And it was a scene when Dean confronts God. In the script, I was supposed to be really angry, and I was supposed to be yelling at him, and I was supposed to be hot. And I came in completely the opposite of that. PADALECKI: Where there was, like, a mixture of vulnerability and just rage. ACKLES: I don't know, I felt like it was just a more powerful way of presenting that scene in that moment. PADALECKI: One of mine that sticks out, "Sacrifice," I remember feeling proud of it, even when I watched it, which is so rare cause you're like, "Ah I feel good." This was like, I felt proud of it then and I was proud of how it looked. QUESTION 11: What's one scene you'd like to erase? ACKLES: That's easy for me. ACKLES: Wow, you guys are awfully proud of your work. That one wig was difficult. [They] should have just put a bald cap on you and called it a day. QUESTION 12: Who was an underused villain? COLLINS: He was a guest star we should've had back. PADALECKI: I think we all agree on that. QUESTION 13: What was the most badass fight sequence? ACKLES: I can tell you which one wasn't. COLLINS: [Laughs] I know what it was. [To Padalecki] You were playing, Gadreel, Samdreel, whatever. And [director] Bob Singer had this idea for a shot that was sort of like a '70s grindhouse movie shot, where the fist comes right into the lens and that's the edit point. We did the first take, and everybody laughed. And I looked at you like, "What?" ACKLES: We were like, "Wow, that's going to make the outtake reel." PADALECKI: [To Ackles] I actually liked the one you directed. I going to say the same thing. So that would have been "Atomic Monster." It was the whole opening sequence of me going through the bunker and fighting all these guys in a kind of a dream sequence. I think it was right around the time John Wick was really popular, and I was like, "I wanna do that." I was really proud of that one. ACKLES: Anything at night was fake. Anything during the day was real. QUESTION 15: What was the worst wig? QUESTION 16: Who had the dumbest on-set injury? PADALECKI: When I broke my hand — season 2, season 3 — fighting vampires in a motel, and I tried to play it off. QUESTION 17: Which filming location was the most haunted? It was a mental asylum. COLLINS: A decommissioned mental asylum from, like, back in the 1950s. ACKLES: We finally got ahold of the liaison of the facility and we were like, "We want to tour the place, like for real." And she was like, "Well, we can't go to the fourth floor." PADALECKI: See ya on the fourth floor! ACKLES: She took us up there and she was like, "This is the staircase that I got pushed down." PADALECKI: And she was so matter-of-fact about it. ACKLES: Yeah, she's like, “Nobody else was here. I was doing the rounds by myself." She's like, "I won't go into this room." But, yeah, apparently just grossly haunted, that place. There were some other ones, too, but that one takes the cake. QUESTION 18: What was the most interesting character you got to play that wasn't your main one? PADALECKI: I'll go with Soulless Sam. PADALECKI: Again, I'll go with Soulless Sam. PADALECKI: You gotta answer it, too. COLLINS: Future Cas was the most interesting. ACKLES: He was the guru. COLLINS: He was like, “Time to go wash up for the orgy.” ACKLES: [Laughs] He's just calling himself interesting. PADALECKI: Burning Man Misha, that's what we call him. QUESTION 19: When was your first fan convention? And I realized that the show had some substance when the fan reaction was overwhelming. PADALECKI: Mine was a few months prior. But one of the actors there who had done a few, who was part of a big science-fiction franchise, was seeing me sign stuff. And he was like, "You got to simplify your signature." He goes, "You got a lot of letters. Just write your first initial and do a line. Your next initial, do a line." COLLINS: 2009, there was a Creation convention in New Jersey, I believe. And in my mind, a panel is with a lot of other people. And they're like, "You're doing panel with your microphone. QUESTION 20: Which supernatural creature would you defeat in real life? ACKLES: You just turn and walk away from it. PADALECKI: Yes, because, if you drop something, they have to count it all. You can drop 20 Entertainment Weekly questions and then they have to sit there and count it. And then you're like, "Okay, I'm out of here." ACKLES: I'm going to go with a changeling. Just a straight front [kick] to the teeth. ACKLES: Well, I think that does it for us. PADALECKI: Are you talking to me this whole time? This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A senior navy officer has spoken out on the bizarre incident where he saw multiple UFOs. Before you start fearing that alien overlords are coming to get you, it is important to note what a UFO is... But with that said, certain encounters can prove eerie. US Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins had one of those encounters and has spoken out about what he saw on February 15, 2023. “It was first seen on radar and once I saw it on radar, I wanted to confirm visually what I was seeing on radar if it was clouds and atmospherics and something else.” Wiggins noted that he then changed his position, moving to the core bridge wing of the ship he was on, the USS Jackson, and tried to decide on what he was looking at. However, he said he was convinced it was not made with standard human technology based on an odd maneuver it made. The 21-year navy veteran admitted he had seen nothing like it. He added: “It [was] rising into the air high enough to where I'm like, alright, that's definitely: A. too fast and B. not something I've seen before.” He said he saw three other objects moving in coordination away from the ship and reported the unknown objects to a tactical officer before attempting to view the UFO on a Sapphire radar. Earlier this year a video recording of the Sapphire radar tracking the UFOs went viral on social media after first being published by George Knapp and Jeremy Corbell on the WEAPONIZED podcast. On the radar the UFOs appeared as oval shaped black spots, moving up and down with ease before meeting with three other shapes. He explained: “In utilizing the Sapphire system, you're able to see silhouettes and heat signatures of different objects. So, in relation to the tic-tacs – once it went away at near instantaneous speed, we had some skeptics in ICC-1. “About 30, 45 seconds pass, and I see an incoming or a passing by commercial aircraft. “It was kind of like ‘Checkmate,' and he sat back down.

Designed and executed by JMRC's Operational Environment (OE) specialists, this scenario aimed to develop critical skills in synchronization, cross-functional planning, and multinational coordination, all under battlefield pressure. The scenario simulated a convoy of displaced civilians, tired, hungry, and separated from loved ones, seeking refuge in NATO-controlled territory after rapidly evacuating a contested combat zone. While fictional, the scenario replicates real-world challenges soldiers may face when civilian populations are caught in or near active military operations. This is a critical training point for Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations soldiers. Stabilizing the environment through civil-military engagement enables maneuver units to operate freely without escalating risks or creating humanitarian crises. “Allowing soldiers to maneuver and engage their enemies without disrupting operations ensures the safety of both civilians and soldiers by mitigating potential issues.” “They don't have much experience working with their allies in multinational settings, so this has been fantastic integration there.” “Getting to see how our counterparts do it from their side is super beneficial for us to see how we can frame different scenarios in the future,” Grams added. For exercise participants, this wasn't just a box-checking scenario; it was a demonstration of how civil and psychological operations directly support mission success by enabling freedom of movement, maintaining legitimacy, and reducing the likelihood of tactical or strategic missteps. “Our mission is always to assist the operation,” said Sgt. Joe Kuenstle, a civil affairs specialist with the 418th CAB.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NASA has witnessed many shocking discoveries, and this extraterrestrial mineral is another one. In 2020, the popular mission Hayabusa2 delivered tiny grains of rock from this carbonaceous asteroid to Earth. Thanks to these grains, scientists discovered an extraterrestrial mineral never found on our planet: So, let's learn more about this discovery. These fragments are valuable because, on Earth, the oldest geochemical registers were removed due to an intense geological activity. However, carbonaceous asteroids like Ryugu haven't suffered these extreme conditions. That's why its materials are almost intact and pollution-free. Out of this small amount, the team led by geoscientific Paul Northrup from the Stony Brook University only received 9.3 milligrams. This is important to preserve such rare and unique samples, especially when hundreds of researchers are competing for access to so little material.” In the first study, Northrup's team couldn't immediately confirm what mineral was, but the analysis after Ryugu's material in 2024 allowed scientists to identify it as hydrated ammonium magnesium phosphorus (HAMP). This is a crystal that doesn't exist on Earth and its structure seems like struvite's, a terrestrial mineral with biological processes and is even found in some kidney stones. Basically, this means that minerals like the HAMMP could have influence on chemical reactions which led to the origin of biology itself. As you can see, the samples from the Ryugu asteroid is a historic advance: a never seen on Earth extraterrestrial mineral! This discovery might make you want to think about our place in the universe since every tiny grain from Ryugu proves that answers about our origins are also in space. We never get tired of the many discoveries NASA and other space agencies make. It is so fascinating to think that we are witnessing these types of events that happen around our planet, isn't it?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I was talking to my youngest daughter on a cold evening in April, 2022. Still shrouded in the shadows of COVID lockdowns with social distancing signs on London pavements, we sat in a restaurant littered with hand sanitizers accumulating crystalline congealed blobs on the tray below their now mostly empty dispensing levers. Enforced alienation in an already hyper-individualistic culture was contributing to rising referral rates at the child and adolescent mental health service where I worked as a consultant psychiatrist. Her generally happy-go-lucky predisposition was now often punctuated by pessimism. They were getting diagnosed with ADHD, trauma, depression, anxiety, PTSD, autism, and often several such diagnoses. Their conversations were interpolated by references to gender identity, neurodiversity, emotional regulation and “having” mental health. When she explained the circumstances of these peers, which included bereavements, enforced isolation during lockdowns, financial insecurity, struggling to find an affordable place to live, and so on, I realized she was describing an accelerating – and to me, worrying – sociocultural process. My other daughter, Michelle, had been telling me about chats taking place with other parents at the school gates and nursery car park that my three gorgeous grandchildren attend. “He's probably on the spectrum,” “She's masking all day and then has meltdowns at home,” “Have you considered whether these are traits of ADHD?” Parents, teachers, support workers, and child-care assistants talking the language of psychiatric symptoms and diagnoses as they tried to make sense of three- to 10-year-old children's behaviours. The mother of a 14-year-old patient told me with confidence her son needed medication to address “some sort of chemical imbalance.” A 16-year-old girl was “pretty sure” she was bipolar (“I've looked this up”) and told me that her friends, all apparently medicated, expressed shock when they learned my patient had not been prescribed anything. The mother of another young woman was certain she had autism, ADHD, depression and anxiety. ADHD content on TikTok is misinformed, could steer youth to self-diagnose, study finds “I think he may have some neurodiversity, perhaps even autism” was becoming a common utterance I heard from therapists, social workers and psychologists. A patient information leaflet on “antidepressants” produced by a British national mental health service and passed anonymously to me, included the following advice: “It can sometimes take weeks, months or even years, to get the right medicine at the right dose for you. Some make you feel sick or sleepy; some are great to start with but wear off; others may not be much to start with but after a while grow on you. Or is it something more sinister – the monetization of distress and difference whilst psychologizing and distracting from the social drivers of psychic pain. Multiple studies have highlighted the increasing prevalence of anxiety, depression and other mental health conditions in Canada, particularly in its youth. For example, the one-year prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder among young women tripled from 3.8 per cent in 2012 to 11.9 per cent in 2022. Among the 88 per cent of youth who rated their mental health as “good,” “very good” or “excellent” in 2019, 21 per cent reported experiencing a decline to “fair” or “poor” by 2023. Some studies suggest these increases may have an element of social contagion. According to Canadian research published in 2023, kids – especially teenage girls – are presenting with self-described Tourette's, eating disorders, autism, Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) and other mental disorders in exponentially increasing numbers. The authors conclude that identifying with and glamourizing certain “disorders” has become a way for some teenagers to express negative emotions in a way that, rather than stigmatizing them, makes them feel part of a community or unique and special. With this type of concept spread what sometimes happens is young people (particularly girls) watch videos (such as those on TikTok) by content creators who self-identify as having these various “illnesses” (like ADHD). Videos show and describe how the symptoms manifest during everyday activities and how it is an important part of the creator's identity. Then, these youngsters present with the outward symptoms, just as described by the content creator, thus producing sudden outbreaks of a particular condition, or increases of those considered more common (such as ADHD). Hence, on the one hand treatment access has improved and become more available, but on the other hand the omnipresence of mental health conditions has not decreased, but instead has increased across all age groups, and particularly in young people. This is known as the Treatment Prevalence Paradox (TPP). There has been a cascade of recently written books by psychiatrists, sociologists, psychologists and historians coming to the same conclusion: Our beliefs and practices around mental health have failed to improve either our scientific knowledge or clinical outcomes. Despite increasing consumption of therapy and psychiatric medication, mental health in Western countries (which have the most globally developed mental-health services) is getting worse by multiple metrics. Suicide rates have risen, more people are worried and/or depressed, the mortality gap between those being treated for severe mental conditions and the rest of the population is wide and increasing, and there are rising rates of people receiving disability benefits for mental-health difficulties. How public therapy programs are quietly re-shaping individuals and communities International studies show this decline in mental health across all age and gender groups, with English-speaking countries having the lowest levels of mental well-being, and those between the ages of 18 and 24 having the worst mental health of all. No one has discovered mythical “chemical imbalances,” characteristic brain differences, or robust genetic associations with any psychiatric condition (the two exceptions being with the dementias and intellectual disability). Brain scan images showing Alzheimer's dementia, top in dark blue, compared to another scan with early developing spots, in light blue, that researchers said were likely showing the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. This is why what are called “tests” in psychiatry do not tell you anything about the brains or bodies of those diagnosed. But this may further worsen outcomes if the fundamental concepts that build our beliefs and practices rest on inappropriate foundations. For a start, it assumes we know what we mean by “mental health” and therefore what a mental illness or disorder is. You'd be forgiven for thinking that there are specific targeted treatments out there and that people get better with interventions delivered by professionals with special expertise. You'd likely think that our problem with mental health is stigma and lack of services; that the issue is woeful underfunding and long waiting lists, and that more needs to be done to educate the population. In fact, the above assumptions are likely a major cause of growing mental-health problems, rather than its solution. We are unable to escape something that all the definitions of mental health or illness have in common. They are not phenomena that lend themselves to sitting in the world of objective facts in the same way that a broken bone does. The World Health Organization defines mental health as “a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community.” What does “realize their abilities” mean? What does it mean to “work well,” and how does a person know that they are contributing to a community? There must be many people who, for lack of education, money, or opportunity, are in practice unable to do so. It means definitions can expand horizontally (by taking in new behaviours or lesser extreme versions) or vertically (by incorporating new populations). ADHD starts its clinical life as hyperkinetic disorder, rare and thought of as “developmental” – meaning most children were expected to grow out of it. It is then thought of as affecting more children, including lesser disruptive behaviours and incorporating attention difficulties rather than just the “hyperactive” element. Next, it becomes seen as potentially lifelong, but still a mainly male “disorder.” Introducing the concept of “masking” then means that you don't have to display the behaviours, but rather “feel” you have them, thus enabling a whole new cohort (mainly women) to be brought into the ADHD diagnostic realm. In medicine, diagnosis is the process of determining which disease explains, i.e., has caused, a person's symptoms and/or signs. Making an accurate diagnosis is a technical skill that enables effective matching of treatment to address specific disease processes occurring in the body. But a diagnostic system enables progress on the technical aspects of care. Dr. Seth Gale points out evidence of Alzheimer's disease on PET scans at the Center for Alzheimer Research and Treatment at Brigham And Women's Hospital in Boston in 2023.BRIAN SNYDER/Reuters The availability of empirical measures enables advances in scientific knowledge and clinical outcomes as we classify a case using measurements that map into the world of objective facts, such as measuring a person's blood sugar levels to ascertain whether they may have diabetes. But in mental health we are reliant on subjectivity. Psychiatric diagnoses therefore cannot point toward any causal agent (apart from a few such as those related to forms of dementia). I cannot say that depression is a disease that occurs due to having abnormally low levels of serotonin in the brain, because no one has found this despite extensive research and so there are no medical tests done to confirm or refute this. Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a class of widely prescribed drugs, including fluoxetine, branded by Eli Lilly as Prozac.MATT DETRICH/The Associated Press Instead, to answer the question I will have to provide a description such as, “Depression is the presence of persistent low mood and negative thinking.” Saying that feeling low is caused by depression is a bit like saying the pain in my head is caused by a headache. If we try to use a classification that can only describe, in order to explain, we end up with a circular thinking trap. The mental-illness health epidemic is growing alongside a crisis of economy and political legitimacy in Western societies. The distress and insecurity produced becomes another source of profiteering in the marketized economy where personhood is socially produced through individualized consumption. This individualization has helped create a profitable MHIC where psychiatric diagnoses function more like commercial brands. At the same time, this enables distraction from social causes of distress such as poverty, inadequate housing, social injustice, discrimination, exclusion, and chronic financial insecurity; alongside militarism, and appalling levels of violence inflicted by governments on global citizens they control (or try to control). The postwar dream of looking forward to a better life than your parents has faded. Job insecurity, high rents, homelessness, crumbling infrastructure, crippling debts, food banks, extortionate bills alongside mental health epidemics are the zeitgeists of our age. The world may be in crisis, but I remain optimistic. I'm all too aware that there will be thousands of parents reading this who may have been told by teachers that their child has ADHD or is on the autistic spectrum, or has “anxiety” and therefore needs an assessment. I can understand why a parent may wish to pursue that given that we have publicized the existence of such conditions and encouraged early diagnosis. My advice – don't agree to such a referral. Love your kids, be patient, and most of you will find a way through. I try to help the young people I see understand that being able to tolerate, live through and find meaning in low mood or anxiety (for example) is a sign of resilience, not a marker of disorder. This puts pressure on us and our children to perform. We then see our children or ourselves as primarily vulnerable and get drawn into noticing all sorts of ways their mental and behavioural health could go “wrong.” As we are launched into a seemingly never-ending search for the right diagnosis and treatment, we start collecting labels and accompanying interventions. Each step in this journey has the potential to make it harder to accept your child (or yourself) just the way they are with all their uniqueness and the mysterious wonderful variety of ways they might thrive in this maddening world.

When we put emotions in the class of problems that can only be solved with special expertise such as a specific therapy or worse psychiatric medication, we risk losing agency and alienating ourselves from parts of ourselves that are to be experienced rather than feared. Emotions are part of dynamic and multifaceted systems and like any dynamic system (such as the weather) the one constant is change. Our duty as parents (and to each other as adults) is not to prevent our children from experiencing distress (which is impossible), but to be there and take the time and have the patience to be with them and support them when they do. See nurturing relationships as a greater priority than controlling behaviour. When we are distressed by the behaviour of our children (or other adults in our life) we often hope we can get through to them so that they change in a way that would stop their frustrating/irritating/worrying behaviour. The only bit in a relational dynamic that you can reliably influence is your own contribution. Think about those aspects of your relationship that you want to nurture. As what I call the Mental Health Industrial Complex has burrowed its way into day-to-day language and “common sense,” concepts have been popularized that encourage us to view behaviours and experiences in pathological ways. There are profound consequences for each of us and our society as a whole of us literally not knowing what we're talking about when it comes to mental health and/or neurodiversity. Arming yourself with some knowledge to help you avoid the prolific spread of scientism (faith masquerading as science) could save you or your child becoming another number in the growing crowds of those who are deemed to have lifelong and incapacitating mental disorder/illness. These conditions were never meant to be a life sentence. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>October 30th, 2024: MQ-9 Reaper allegedly tracking orb off coast of Yemen. The footage, recorded on October 30, 2024, and provided by a whistleblower, shows a Reaper tracking an object described as an “orb.” A second drone, which is not seen in the video, fires a missile that strikes the object, causing it to break apart. “I'm not going to speculate what it is, but the question is why are we being blocked from this information consistently?” “We do not have anything to provide on this,” a U.S. defense official told The War Zone. The House hearing, titled “Restoring Public Trust Through UAP Transparency and Whistleblower Protection,” was the third UAP-focused congressional hearing in three years. In 2024, the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office reported that most recorded UAP cases involved balloons, birds, or drones, and stated it found “no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity or technology.” Together, they form the backbone of our reporting and content creation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Footage of a Hellfire missile from an MQ-9 Reaper drone hitting a mysterious orb near Yemen has once again triggered chatter about UFOs. One scientist thinks it was not an alien object, but a Samad drone launched by Yemen. A Congressional hearing on September 9 saw a video showing an Unidentified Anomalous Object (UAP) being hit by the Hellfire missile shot from an MQ-9 Reaper drone. This footage was shared by Rep. Eric Burlison, who got it from an anonymous whistleblower. Or could it be a man-made weapon? Harvard scientist Avi Loeb, who is known for his views on extraterrestrial life, thinks that this UAP was a drone fired by Yemen towards Israel. The MQ-9 Reaper remotely piloted aircraft is armed with a variety of weapons, including AGM-114 Hellfire missiles. He cited news reports to state that on October 29, the Yemeni Houthis announced that they had attacked Southern Israel with multiple drones.

He says that given the size and dimension of the Hellfire missile, which has a mass of about 45 kilograms, the UAP appears to be "a few meters in size." Earth has been sharing its orbit with a cosmic body for 60 years. The known speed of the Samad drones goes up to about 70 meters per second, which is about a sixth of the speed of a Hellfire missile."
