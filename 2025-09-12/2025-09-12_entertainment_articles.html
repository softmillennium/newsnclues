                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An attorney for the pop superstar refutes Baldoni's claim that she consented to questioning in the It Ends With Us legal battle. Baldoni's attorneys wrote in a request for a discovery schedule extension on Thursday (Sept. 11) that Swift “has agreed to appear for deposition” but cannot do so earlier than Oct. 20 because of “preexisting professional obligations” — presumably referring to the rollout of her highly anticipated twelfth album, The Life of a Showgirl, which arrives on Oct. 3. But Swift's longtime attorney Douglas Baldridge says in a Friday (Sept. 12) court filing that this is false. “My client did not agree to a deposition, but if she is forced into a deposition, we advised (after first hearing about the deposition just three days ago) that her schedule would accommodate the time required during the week of October 20 if the parties were able to work out their disputes,” wrote Baldridge. Baldoni has been saying for months that Swift's friendship with Lively makes her a key witness in the lawsuit, in which Lively alleges Baldoni sexually harassed her on the set of It Ends With Us and then orchestrated a retaliatory smear campaign after she complained. The current discovery schedule has all depositions concluding by the end of September, in anticipation of a March 2026 trial date. Swift's reps have previously slammed Baldoni for “creating tabloid clickbait” by dragging the star into the case despite her minimal involvement in It Ends With Us. Baldridge reiterated this position in his letter to the court on Friday, writing, “Since the inception of this matter we have consistently maintained that my client has no material role in this action.” Lively's lawyers have similarly lambasted Baldoni for involving Swift in the litigation, writing in their own Friday court response that the strategy is designed “to generate a media spectacle.” “The Wayfarer defendants' lack of diligence, and disrespect for Ms. Swift's privacy and schedule, is astounding,” wrote Lively's lawyer Michael Gottlieb. At any point over the past six months, the Wayfarer defendants could have noticed a deposition, served a subpoena and negotiated an agreeable time and place for this deposition. Judge Lewis J. Liman has not yet ruled on Baldoni's discovery extension request. The fiery legal battle between Lively and Baldoni has been in full force since last December, when the actress brought sexual harassment and retaliation claims against her It Ends With Us co-star and director. Baldoni vehemently denied the allegations and countersued Lively and her inner circle for defamation, though Judge Liman later dismissed Baldoni's counterclaims as legally invalid. Now, only Lively's original allegations are headed toward trial this coming spring. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

Lou “Easy” Evans isn't a particularly gifted singer, but he's got swagger and pizzaz and panache, and a real gift for choosing the songs he croons on various little stages around the slightly scuzzier side of Las Vegas. It's “another magical day here in Las Vegas, Nevada” when Nic Pizzolatto's surprisingly low-key feature directorial debut “Easy's Waltz” opens, though you wouldn't know it from the Evans brothers. Easy (Vince Vaughn) is gearing up for another throwaway show with his band, The Grifters, in a “budget-friendly” downtown Vegas joint. Sam (Simon Rex) has slinked off to a dim bar, rather than doing his actual job (managing Easy and other local acts), and his eyes light up when he spots a pretty gal (Kate Mara as Lucy) across the way. And while, as Sam tells it, “the number one rule is to know when to leave the fucking casino,” that doesn't seem to be happening for either of the Evans men. In a city of people always hoping for the next big score, they're no different than anyone else, but time is running out, patience is wearing thin, and something has to change. Despite the dire-sounding set-up of Pizzolatto's film (he also wrote the film's script), “Easy's Waltz” isn't nearly as downbeat as most might expect from the guy behind “True Detective,” but grinding it out in Vegas is never a walk in the park. Not nearly as dark — or deep-feeling — as last year's “beloved star takes on a vibe shift in a Vegas-set drama,” what “Easy's Waltz” has in common with that Pamela Anderson vehicle is obvious enough: a solid turn from its star. Vaughn pours himself into the role, but he also seems to understand that going big and broad for this one is a misstep. Easy isn't a caricature, even if the people and events around him increasingly feel that way. When Easy catches the eye of local manager (and much, much more) Mickey Albano (a well-cast Al Pacino), his star is suddenly on the rise. Mickey books him into a residency at the swanky Wynn Casino, passing the whole thing off as part of his newfound interest in giving back to the little people, not his bone-deep interest in looking out for himself. Entanglements abound: Mickey is also friendly with Lucy, whom Sam pretends not to know, if only because he's got the good sense not to show Mickey all his cards. And when Sam cooks up a truly stupid scheme to make some quick cash, there's little doubt a heavy like Mickey isn't going to like it. What Easy lacks up for in obvious vocal ability — though everyone around him, especially Sam, is always quick to remind him he's the best singer in town — he more than makes up for with flash. But that sort of flash is not the most natural fit for Pizzolatto, whose own sensibility seems to be at odds with the story at hand. Tonal disparities are often on offer, with Pizzolatto going for darker stuff (someone is gonna break your legs, sucka!) and Vaughn infusing the whole thing with non-stop, hangdog charm. Despite the various dramas that swirl around this group of Vegas locals and wannabes, “Easy's Waltz” meanders toward the bulk of its real punch, with its plot only kicking in long past its halfway mark. By then, Easy has become a viral hit, Sam has dug himself in way too deep, and Mickey is itching to show his true colors. Audiences might almost be eager to hear a classic limb-breaking threat by then, because far too much of this has been, well, a bit too easy going down. “Easy's Waltz” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UPDATE: Taylor Swift is calling BS on Justin Baldoni. As a flurry of letters land in the federal docket from lawyers for the It Ends With Us co-star/director and Blake Lively about will the Lover singer end up giving a deposition or not in the sexual harassment and retaliation lawsuit, Swift and her own attorney have weighed in. And she's backing her old friend Blake's side of the story. “As counsel for the parties know, since the inception of this matter we have consistently maintained that my client has no material role in this action,” wrote lawyer Douglas Baldridge to Judge Lewis Liman this afternoon. “Further, my client did not agree to a deposition, but if she is forced into a deposition, we advised (after first hearing about the deposition just three days ago) that her schedule would accommodate the time required during the week of October 20 if the parties were able to work out their disputes.” Not yet approved by a judge in the case that goes to trial next spring, Baldoni and his Wayfarer Studies inner circle want to see Swift deposed “during the week of October 20-25 due to Ms. However, the recently engaged singer has not been “agreed” to the sit-down next month, which comes weeks after discovery in the matter was supposed to be over, and Baldoni's side has presented no “evidence” to justify it, says a sharply worded filing by Lively's lawyers today. “Even if one were to take the Wayfarer Defendants' representation at face value, they have not come close to establishing good cause for their requested relief,” the Willkie Farr & Gallagher partner insists. Swift is not available for a deposition until October 20, 2025, yet are silent about their efforts (if any) to schedule this deposition during the existing discovery period,” Gottlieb adds. Swift's counsel regarding a date or location about the deposition until earlier this week,” Lively co-lead lawyer states. “In this respect, the Wayfarer Defendants' lack of diligence, and disrespect for Ms. Discovery has been ongoing for more than six months, and Ms. Swift is someone whose calendar should be presumed to be packed with professional obligations for months in advance,” Gottlieb continued. “At any point over the past six months, the Wayfarer Defendants could have noticed a deposition, served a subpoena, and negotiated an agreeable time and place for this deposition. As the overall matter heads towards its March 9, 2026 trial date start, Judge Liman will have the final word – for now – on bringing Swift on board and giving Baldoni and his Wayfarer co-founders more time for their own depositions. Baldoni and Wayfarer's PR team also did not answer a request to respond to today's damning letter from Livley's side. Swift was name checked in the self titled Scenario Planning document that Baldoni crisis PR chief Melissa Nathan, who is also a defendant in the case, put together in the summer of 2024 as IEWU‘s premiere loomed. “As part of this, our team can also explore planting stories about the weaponization of feminism and how people in BL's circle like Taylor Swift, have been accused of utilizing these tactics to ‘bully' into getting what they want,” the five-pager said in a section called “Scenario 3: Ryan comes forward in defense of his wife.” On the docket, Swift talking to Baldoni's Bryan Freedman-led lawyers was a media storm back in  May and June. Even before that, Swift, who contributed her ‘My Tears Ricochet' tune to the Lively cut of IEWU, made a cameo or two in various filings with IEWU director Baldoni feeling ganged up on when Swift's name was brought up as one of Lively's “dragons” who backed her suggestions for changes to the movie. While it does seem that Swift and Lively may not be hangin out that much of late, at least publicly, but the former is still the godmother to one of the latter and Ryan Reynolds' children. No word, if Lively and Reynolds are going to Swift's wedding with repeat Super Bowl champ and Kansas City Chief player Travis Kelce – but then again there is no word when that American royalty nuptial day is happening and who is going besides Swift and Kelce. What we do know is that Swift's new Life of a Showgirl album is se to drop on October 3 — a few weeks before the deposition Team Baldoni want her to give.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The author posted several messages addressing a disparaging tweet he wrote about Kirk after his murder. King originally posted on X about Kirk in the wake of his assassination: “He advocated stoning gays to death. On Friday morning, King reversed course, writing: “I apologize for saying Charlie Kirk advocated stoning gays. What he actually demonstrated was how some people cherry-pick Biblical passages.” And then, in reply to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz calling the author “a horrible, evil, twisted liar,” King wrote, “The horrible, evil, twisted liar apologizes. Comcast Execs Tell Staff "We Need To Do Better"  After "Unacceptable" Comments From Ex-MSNBC Contributor About Charlie Kirk The film is earning rave reviews, generating a 93 percent positive critic average on Rotten Tomatoes. King is the latest media figure with left-wing political views to come under fire for their response to Kirk's assassination following the 31-year-old conservative activist and Turning Point USA co-founder being gunned down during an event at Utah Valley University. Previously, MSNBC political analyst Matthew Dowd was fired for his comments about Kirk where he seemingly blamed the activist for his own murder, saying “hateful words” lead “hateful actions.” On Friday, the three top executives of NBC and MSNBC's parent companies collectively urged employees to embrace different perspectives, writing in a memo: “You may have seen that MSNBC recently ended its association with a contributor who made an unacceptable and insensitive comment about this horrific event.

When “The Brutalist” stormed the festival circuit around this time last year, it seemed like something of a unicorn — as well as an almost impossible sell. Twelve months, 10 Oscar nominations, and one rapturous quasi-musical later, it feels like a new kind of recipe for success. How do you follow an epic historical drama about a traumatized European who sails to America and builds their own church? At a time when Hollywood is both deathly allergic to risk and physically incapable of making anything that costs less than $100 million, the fact that Fastvold and Corbet have now both directed gorgeous, sweeping, and creatively unbound movies for a fraction of that cost in Hungary feels like a new way forward. Most good movies take a hot minute to get made, but this fall saw the premieres of several films — surely more than I've made room to mention here — that were marinating for decades. I mean, Guillermo del Toro was probably pitching his “Frankenstein” to the other kids in the middle of class during first grade, where his teacher forced him to write “I will not be sympathetic toward monsters” on the blackboard 100 times as punishment. But timing is everything, and it often only appears as if all of the pieces are falling into place. On the one hand, Park Chan-wook was duly rewarded for waiting 20 years to direct “No Other Choice,” as his Donald Westlake adaptation — about a man so desperate for another job in his field that he murders the other candidates — is perfectly suited for the worldwide pivot to AI. Ditto Laura Poitras, who'd been trying to make a Seymour Hersh documentary since at least 2005, but didn't manage to wear him down until world events — specifically the genocide in Gaza — had provided her the material she needed to paint her subject's career as an investigative journalist into a broader and more damning portrait of American malfeasance. On the other hand, del Toro has not been done any favors by dreaming of “Frankenstein” for so long; his love for the material is sacred and unimpeachable, but it comes through more palpably in how he talks about Mary Shelley's novel than it does in any part of the movie he's made from it. Soapy, broad, and so chintzy-looking despite its budget that it was difficult for me to appreciate the tragic beauty of Frankenstein's monster (I weep for how tactile this film might have been had del Toro made it before teaming up with cinematographer Dan Laustsen for “Crimson Peak” and committing himself to a series of increasingly garish digital veneers), this most passionate of passion projects would be so easy to mistake for any of the other gothic CGIsores from the last 25 years that it might as well be stitched together from the leftover parts of “Van Helsing.” I think there was a time when del Toro would have recognized as much, but the money and technology at this disposal has caused him to lose sight of the human element that drew him to this story in the first place. Earlier this summer, I wrote about the fate of Nadav Lapid's “Yes,” and how its post-Cannes disappearance appeared to suggest that festivals and distributors were afraid of films that dared to confront the most transparent moral atrocity of our times: the genocide in Gaza (Kino Lorber has since acquired U.S. rights for “Yes,” and will release it here in early 2026). Did Telluride, Venice, or TIFF do anything to improve the situation? Telluride, a wonderful festival whose need to appease its patrons has seen it become subtly but worryingly less adventurous in its programming, neglected to screen many of the recent films that feature the genocide as their primary subject (“Cover-Up” touches on Gaza with great purpose, but only in passing). Amid a lineup that was absolutely bursting with documentaries about everything from the American Revolution to the making of “Megalopolis,” and everyone from E. Jean Carroll to Elie Wiesel, I was disappointed not to see “Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk,” and only took an uncertain measure of consolation in the fact that Telluride chose to screen Netalie Braun's “Shooting,” a self-reflexive Israeli film about how the country's unchecked militarism has poisoned its cinema (I wasn't able to see it myself, but the movie's Letterboxd reviews make it sound appropriately damning). And yet, of all these films, only “Put Your Soul” and “Palestine 36” have distribution, but Kino Lorber and Watermelon Pictures — the latter of which almost exclusively releases movies from or about Palestine — can't be expected to be American cinema's sole lifeline to the country. (“The Road Between Us” is being released on more than 1,000 screens in October.) Fingers crossed that “The Voice of Hind Rajab,” “With Hasan in Gaza,” and “Cover-Up” will all find proper homes soon, even if only under the auspices of awards season. As an introverted cynic whose love of movies can probably be explained on some level by the fact that sitting in the dark allows me to be present but not perceived, I naturally struggled with Chloé Zhao's insistence on leading every “Hamnet” premiere audience in the same mindfulness routine that she conducted for the cast and crew on set every morning. I'm not proud to say that it had the opposite of the intended effect on me, making me more guarded and self-conscious rather less (though as someone who's been prescribed stimulants to make myself less hyper for the last 20 years, I'm used to that sort of counter-intuitiveness). Maybe it was the mountain air, or that I missed my kids, or that “Hamnet” resonated with me as the story of a writer who goes on a work trip that leaves him unable to stop or bear witness to a tragedy back at home (Tweeting about movies in Telluride is basically the same thing as scripting “Macbeth” in 17th century London and don't you dare suggest otherwise), but I forgot myself for the rest of the film. I forgot that I was in public, and that leaving yourself completely open to the pain of others can be a paralyzing experience these days. I even forgot that Gracie Abrams was sitting right behind me. “Hamnet” will never be accused of having a light touch (my review accused the tear-jerker of “farming viewers for moisture”), but I found myself unexpectedly grateful for Zhao's refusal to hold back, and  for how the almost pornographic sentimentality of her film invited its audience to participate in the same kind of emotional transference that Will Shakespeare and his poor wife Agnes experience towards the end of the story. There's a reason why the last five minutes of “Jay Kelly” is one of the only memorable parts of that movie, just as there's a reason why “Rental Family” loses points for not better weaponizing its treacle, and why the most interesting thing about “The Smashing Machine” is how gingerly it navigates between pain and stability. On a related — if somewhat perpendicular — note, it was also telling to see that several of the season's early standouts are movies that engage with our current moment head-on. That's most obviously true of Paul Thomas Anderson's “One Battle After Another,” which towered over the festivals despite skipping all three of them, and, along with “Eddington,” offered the most overt rebuke to/apology for the prevailing wisdom that many of today's greatest filmmakers are more comfortable engaging with the past (more on that next week). But it was also thrilling to see Yorgos Lanthimos confront red pill conspiracy brain and corporate technocracy with “Bugonia,” whose relevance to the present day was made all the more pronounced by the fact that it's a remake; “Bugonia” might like the sweep and inventiveness of Lanthimos' best work, but sometimes a brilliant Chappell Roan needle-drop is all it takes to bridge the gap between any number of different worlds. No such luck in Park Chan-wook's “No Other Choice” (which favors classic Korean pop ballads over the modern American kind), but none of the maestro's work has stung quite as hard as this one does in the pyrrhic victory of its final moments, when the film's “Looney Tunes” violence mournfully surrenders to a situation all too real.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Netflix is heading back to Texas for another round of The Hunting Wives. The original cast led by Brittany Snow and Malin Akerman will reprise their roles. “I'm so excited to write these amazing characters again, and I can't wait to take the audience on another sexy, twisted, batshit crazy ride through Maple Brook,” said creator/writer/showrunner Rebecca Cutter. Created by Cutter and based on the bestselling novel by May Cobb, The Hunting Wives became a streaming success for Netflix after acquiring the twisty murder drama that was originally produced for Starz, where Cutter had her three-season series Hightown. Producers Lionsgate Television and 3 Arts Entertainment pivoted the series to Netflix in the lead up to Starz's split from Lionsgate in May (which became official this summer). Miranda Cosgrove Wants to Show a New Side of Herself in 'The Wrong Paris' Netflix Boosts Japanese Slate with Koji Yakusho Comedy-Drama 'Did Someone Happen to Mention Me?' While the first season was a Netflix U.S. offering, season two will release exclusively as a Netflix branded series in nearly all countries the streamer is available. The returning cast includes Jaime Ray Newman, Dermot Mulroney, Evan Jonigkeit and George Ferrier. Publisher Berkley has gone back to press twice on the trade paperback since premiere week, and saw a 5,000 percent increase across all formats in year-over-year weekly sales following the show's release, according to Christine Ball, evp & publisher. Cutter also weighed in on The Hunting Wives effect, which included bringing both sex and culture wars back to television by centering the erotic main plot around a conservative clique in East Texas and having a Democrat (Sophie) roll into town. “I've heard some people say that the show is part of this new mandate to make red-state content, and that wasn't what it was. I mean, it was for horny middle-aged women,” she said. But soon enough, old secrets and new foes force them back together. Erwin Stoff is an executive producer for 3 Arts Entertainment, along with Cobb and Cutter. Cutter's crime drama Hightown is also now streaming on Netflix. She is currently in development on another project for Netflix with Jerry Bruckheimer Television and is repped by CAA, Artists Collective and Jackoway Austen Tyerman Wertheimer Mandelbaum Morris Bernstein Trattner Auerbach Hynick Jaime LeVine Sample & Klein.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Netflix has renewed breakout hit series The Hunting Wives starring Malin Åkerman and Brittany Snow for a second season. As expected, the racy Texas drama, from Lionsgate Television and 3 Arts Entertainment, will become a Netflix-branded series that will stream exclusively on the platform in all but four countries Netflix is available, Deadline has learned. Like Season 1, the second season will consist of 8 episodes, sources said, with the main cast set to return. Created by Rebecca Cutter, The Hunting Wives' first season was based on the bestselling novel by May Cobb. Season 2 will be an original concept-based continuation of the story, using the Season 1 finale as a jumping-off point. But soon enough, old secrets and new foes force them back together. As they play their dangerous games the question arises. Snow and Åkerman channel the Sophie-Margo dynamic from Season 1 in a video announcing the renewal, which you can watch below. A Netflix pickup requires global rights, leading to Lionsgate reworking their existing international distribution deals. In the end, The Hunting Wives Season 2 will be available in all Netflix markets except four, Canada, Australia and two European territories, sources said. Conversations are underway for Season 1, which also is expected to become available on Netflix exclusively in most countries. The Hunting Wives‘ renewal follows an impressive ratings performance for Season 1. After launching with little fanfare and no formal promotional campaign on a Monday, the steamy drama became a staple on Netflix's U.S. Top 10 for six weeks running, including a stint at No.1, and also spent its first five weeks in the global English Top 10, amassing over 20M views, despite only being available in the U.S. Lionsgate TV had options on the cast, which have been exercised, with all Season 1 series regulars whose characters' fate allows them coming back, including Snow, Akerman, Jaime Ray Newman, Dermot Mulroney, Evan Jonigkeit and George Ferrier. “I'm so excited to write these amazing characters again, and I can't wait to take the audience on another sexy, twisted, batshit crazy ride through Maple Brook,” Cutter said. She executive produces the series alongside Erwin Stoff for 3 Arts Entertainment and Cobb. The success of The Hunting Wives on Netflix also buoyed sales of Cobb's book, originally published in 2021. Cutter, who also was the creator, showrunner and executive producer of Starz's Hightown, is repped by CAA, Artists Collective, and Jackoway Austen Tyerman.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's a crisp Tuesday afternoon in New York and Joe Keery is happy to be home. As he clears the remnants of a late lunch from Sugarfish off the breakfast nook in his apartment and begins to prepare a green tea, he laments how little time he's been able to spend here this year. Keery, 33, will head back out on the road in a mere matter of days, though, as he prepares for a jam-packed fall schedule. Of course, there's the three-part final season of Stranger Things — in which he plays the beloved bully-turned babysitter Steve Harrington — premiering in late November that will require plenty of press. But first, he's focused on the role that has defined his year so far: touring as the alt-rock artist Djo. On the heels of a year in which his dreamy, synth-pop song “End of Beginning” went viral and peaked at No. 1 on a Billboard chart when it topped Alternative Airplay in July. As he gears up for his next string of shows beginning later this month — billed as his Another Bite Tour — he's first treating fans to a batch of entirely new music, with the arrival of The Crux Deluxe out today (Sept. 12), a 12-track surprise release that extends the universe of his third album. “We had an imperative to be like, ‘Let's not leave the song unless it's 80% done,' ” he says. “Or else the song doesn't really exist.” Plans for the surprise release were solidified as early as May, when Keery and his steady co-writing/co-producing partner Adam Thein had a chance to revisit Electric Lady between legs of tour for some touch-ups — fixing a vocal issue on “Who You Are,” adding a second verse to “They Don't Know What's Right,” removing a few items from “Thich Nhat Hanh,” named after the Vietnamese monk, peace activist and poet. Crucially, the aim was to avoid any sweeping changes during those sessions. “We didn't want to do too much,” says Keery. “It should be a snapshot of that time period.” The result is a deluxe album that sees Keery continuing to lean into his strongest influences: “Love Can't Break the Spell” unspools the five stages of grief following a break-up in the style of Fleetwood Mac; the rebellious flair of “Grime of the World” slides seamlessly into any collection of garage rock-fueled favorites; “Purgatory Silverstar” is a quintessential example of Keery turning a song on its head, sometimes more than once, at a whim — a plucking guitar intro gives way to a Red Hot Chili Peppers-esque rock bridge that then opens into an odyssey with twists and turns reminiscent of Rush or The Who. The Crux Deluxe also showcases his growing comfortability with experimentation: album closer “Awake” boasts both rollicking guitar ready to blow your hair back and, notably, a set of lyrics solely focused on syllabic fit over substance. “I had read something about John Lennon for ‘I Am the Walrus,' and [how] those are nonsense lyrics,” Keery says. “[‘Awake'] was going to be on the album originally. A lot of people were like, ‘Those are my favorite lyrics you've ever written.' Maybe you should let your subconscious do a little bit more of the work.' Mountebank,” a late swap with “Egg” from the album's first installment. It's the deluxe's biggest dip into electro-pop, and Keery's response in part to the success of “End of Beginning,” which he jokes makes him “kind of up my own ass.” (“Climb fast, money talks/ Then they want to sell you on what you're all about,” he sings before reassuring his own standing with “Not afraid, not for sale/ Long game class acts never fail.”) In contrast to “Awake,” “Mr. Mountebank” is Keery at his most vulnerable on the deluxe, which can often flit between abstract metaphors and unfiltered lyrics about relationships, the industry and his own well-being. “It's just, sometimes you're like, ‘What the hell am I trying to say? It's less of being scared as it is figuring out what you really feel and trying to get honest with yourself.” For the rollout of 2019's Twenty Twenty and 2022's Decide, he had largely kept his life as a musician separate from the fame that followed his acting career, even going so far as to don a wig, sunglasses and a jumpsuit for the occasional live set. “The album was the first thing out after ‘End of Beginning' had done well, so it's like, ‘How do you follow something like that up?' “All good things must end,” he says, reflecting on the hit Netflix show's wrap. At the moment, music appears to be taking center stage on that front: Keery notes that he and Thein already started to kick around ideas for new music during their most recent outings at Electric Lady. Plus, as an independent artist that continues to release his music through AWAL, Keery has the added benefit of being able to gearshift in real time, and pursue wherever one of his many passions may lead him next. I think there has been a core group of audience members who have lived with [The Crux] for the summer, and a gift you're not expecting is one of the best gifts.” Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paramount is putting together a “majority cash bid” to buy Warner Bros. Though the Ellisons haven't formally made a bid, WSJ suggests they're trying to get in the door before WBD splits into two companies, making a play for the movie studio, cable networks, and traditional television assets. While Paramount moved on with Skydance, the debt-riddled WBD ultimately decided to split into two companies. Per WSJ, by making a huge offer for the whole company Paramount angles to preempt competitors like Amazon and Apple from buying up WBD's used parts after the split. Discovery stock jumped 36 percent following the news of Paramount's interest. A deal of this magnitude that consolidates two of the last remaining major Hollywood studios would almost certainly face regulatory scrutiny… at least, it would in previous years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Time is weird,” Mitch Rowland says, speaking for a lot of dads. These days, he lives out in the English countryside, where he made his superb new indie-folk gem Whistling Pie. But Rowland is right at home moving between musical worlds. Whistling Pie is a homemade album of acoustic ballads, inspired by his hero, the late British folk guitarist Bert Jansch. As on his 2023 debut, Come June, you can hear traces of Nick Drake and Elliott Smith in Rowland's gentle vocals and delicate guitar. The songs are meditations on time and memory. As he says, with his soft-spoken laugh, “The big difference between the two albums is having kids, and not having time.” The album is a family affair: Rowland made Whistling Pie with his drummer and collaborator Sarah Jones, the rock goddess from Harry's band. The couple met in rehearsals when they hooked up with Harry for his 2017 solo debut, after the end of One Direction. They fell in love, got married, and moved to the tiny English village where she grew up, with their two little sons. The music is full of that rustic atmosphere. “It's a luxury for me to be a songwriter out in that part of the green world, rather than kind of grinding away in L.A.,” Rowland says. “It's way out in the Cotswolds region,” he says. Rowland wrote these tunes surrounded by that pastoral beauty. “I made these demos with Sarah's dad, because we're right down the lane from her parents,” he says. “He and I would go into the studio he built in the chicken shed — the same shed where Sarah learned to play drums when she was a little girl. '” In fact, as he learned, the area has a proud music heritage. When he met Styles, Mitch was a small-town guy from Ohio, an indie rocker who knew nothing about the pop world. Harry was already a megastar, but with zero interest in following any kind of conventional career formula. In quintessential Midwest fashion, Mitch didn't even quit his day job at the pizzeria until two weeks into the sessions. Fans delight in these two as an odd couple, yet they share a unique musical chemistry. “There's a magic to Mitch, past him being so good,” Styles once told Rolling Stone. “I feel like he represents a kind of magic to me.” They recorded at Rockfield Studios, on a Welsh farm. At their studio, it's like, ‘Where are we ordering from tonight? And out here it was like, ‘Someone's going to cook, and then we're going back to work.'

And one morning I wrote ‘Be Your Man' behind the steering wheel.” The song came back to him years later, despite its traumatic origin. “But I guess it's something do with that song. It's weird how songs can say more than I'm able to.” Then I went out and bought every CD of his. That only happens a few times in life. “Really Ready” sums up the album's domestic spirit. Its origin story is a classic parable of modern parenthood: Mitch found an old demo on his phone, while frantically trying to free up space for photos. “I'm trying to take a picture of my kids,” he recalls. “So I gotta get rid of a hundred things first, so my camera will turn on.” He came across a riff he'd captured on video years earlier. Every time I'd go to delete and make more room, I'd come across it and think, ‘That's kinda cool. That thought also evokes the way technology interferes with our emotional lives. “Oh, man — I hate my new phone,” he says. How many songs am I gonna lose having to get this app?” They're a modern rock & roll family on the road. For Rowland's great 2024 solo tour, their toddler son came along, as he'd done on the Harry's House tour, watching his folks onstage. (Their younger son was still a few months away from being born.) “Harry made it possible for us to tour as a family,” he says. “We had all those moments like, ‘What the fuck are we doing taking a five-month-old on a bus? But for so many people, it's a way of life. I take advice from Ben Harper, who's raised his kids on the road. Our son is so socialized — always jumping into the mix, immediately talking to other kids — and I think that has to be down to taking him on the road, or else he'd be a bit more on the shy side. This is the family that plays together — the little boys have one-string toy guitars shaped like tigers, so they can join in. But having grown up at Harry shows, their child kept screaming. “He thought that's just what you do at a concert,” Mitch says. “We had to say, ‘This is folk music, son. As you might expect, both kids are pop fans. “He's really into Chappell Roan at the moment, which made me as a parent realize, ‘Shit, am I more of a Chappell Roan fan than a Sabrina Carpenter fan?' It's been three and a half years since Harry's House — enough time for Mitch and Sarah to come up with two albums and two kids — and Rowland praises Chappell for not banging out a quickie follow-up to her big album. It can really work for people not doing anything.” “All this just to say, ‘Take your time, Chappell Roan. “When we were finishing Fine Line, we were working in the same studio as Liam Gallagher,” Rowland recalls. “He was like, ‘I gotta fucking hand it to Harry. And then after that he made another straightaway.” People Are Losing Their Jobs for Criticizing Slain ‘Free Speech' Advocate Charlie Kirk Protest Singer Jesse Welles Laments the Death of Charlie Kirk in New Song 'Charlie' The Artwork That Spawned 9/11 Conspiracy Theories and Mystery Jimmy Kimmel Criticizes Trump's Response to Charlie Kirk's ‘Senseless' Death “No, it was kind of the opposite,” Rowland says, citing Styles' famously obsessive full-immersion studio process. “Making those albums, it felt like he was going inward — or maybe we were all going inward, and we couldn't imagine doing anything else. That's the same process that Rowland brings to his own music, whether he's playing in a chicken shed or Wembley. “The thing that makes me want to make music is Bert Jansch,” Rowland says. “The first time I saw him, it was just him sitting in a chair, with his acoustic guitar.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fifty years ago to the day, Pink Floyd released Wish You Were Here. To celebrate the anniversary of the landmark album, Sony has announced plans for a new box set entitled Wish You Were Here 50 that will be available as three vinyl records, two compact discs, or a Deluxe Box Set. Many of those bands recorded their own concerts using more sophisticated equipment than anything Millard could sneak into arenas, but Pink Floyd made no such efforts. “The problem was we just hit a period where everyone was paranoid about bootleggers and we didn't tape shows,” Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason told Rolling Stone in 2018. “It's great we did the Pink Floyd at Pompeii thing, but I'm sorry we never filmed and recorded a Dark Side, Animals, or Wish You Were Here show, really … [From the Animals period], there's certainly nothing really good, just sort of monitor mixes and so on. We really should have done the whole thing, filmed and recorded it properly.” Earlier this month, David Gilmour elaborated on the issue in an interview with Rolling Stone. But we did record most shows just sound-wise, and God knows where all those tapes are. (May the record state that back in 2021, we encouraged Pink Floyd to release this exact L.A.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thank you @gerardsulter for putting a smile on my mom's face too!” In the video, Kelly could be heard saying, “Mom, put your hand out.” The bird flew to Sharon and landed on her arm. Sharon, who was spotted in the video wearing baggy black pants, a black blazer, and a white T-shirt, candidly replied, “I don't have anything to give you.” Kelly later added that the trip “put a smile back on mum's face.” Fans immediately took to the comment section to share their love and support. We've all missed seeing Sharon ❤️ Thank you Kelly!” Another added, “Makes my heart happy to see your mom out and happy.” Another sweet comment read, “I've been watching The Osbornes on Prime. Sharon was always so supportive and such a great mom. A fan praised Kelly's efforts and shared: “Oh Sharon! Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne passed away on July 22 at the age of 76. Ozzy performed weeks before his passing during his final concert, “Back to the Beginning,” in Birmingham, attended by more than 40,000 fans. Reflecting on the show, Sharon told Pollstar, “I never wanted Ozzy to just disappear without some big event. Sharon's last public appearance was at Ozzy's funeral on July 30, which included a procession through his hometown of Birmingham. She was seen in tears, surrounded by her children, Jack, Aimee, and Kelly, as well as Ozzy's son from his first marriage, Louis. Today, fans continue to rally around Sharon and the Osbourne family as they navigate life without Ozzy. Small, joyful moments, like her falconry outing in Cornwall, show her strength and resilience, offering a hopeful glimpse of healing and the courage to embrace life again.</p>
