                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET Shares of Gemini Space Station soared as much as 40% on Friday after the exchange operator raised $425 million in an initial public offering. The stock was trading up about 21% at 2:50 p.m. The New York-based company priced its IPO late Thursday above this week's expected range of $24 to $26, and an initial range of between $17 and $19. That valued the company at some $3.3 billion before trading began. Gemini, which primarily operates as a cryptocurrency exchange, was founded by the Winklevoss brothers in 2014 and held more than $21 billion of assets on its platform as of the end of July. Per its registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gemini posted a net loss of $159 million in 2024, and in the first half of this year, it lost $283 million. They have long held that bitcoin is a superior store of value than gold. On Friday morning, they told CNBC's "Squawk Box" they see its price reaching $1 million a decade from now. In 2013, they were the first to apply to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded fund, more than 10 years before the first bitcoin ETFs would eventually be approved. Even in the early days, when bitcoin was notorious for its extreme volatility and anti-establishment roots and shunned by Wall Street, the Winklevoss brothers were outspoken about the need for smart regulation that would establish rules for the crypto-led financial revolution. Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the day it began trading. (Learn the best 2026 strategies from inside the NYSE with Josh Brown and others at CNBC PRO Live.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Polymarket, a popular betting platform for real-world events, is raising new funding that would sharply increase the startup's valuation, according to two people with knowledge of the matter not authorized to speak publicly. Investor demand has intensified as Polymarket appears to be readying for a US launch. The valuation has been fluctuating, though it will likely at least triple the $1 billion it reached in a round that closed only this summer, the people said. At least one investor offered a term sheet valuing the company at as much as $10 billion, one of the people said. A spokesperson for Polymarket declined to comment. Polymarket was founded in 2020 by Shayne Coplan and gained prominence during the 2024 US presidential election, when it accurately predicted a win for Donald Trump while most traditional polls showed him losing. It also allows traders to bet on sports outcomes and pop culture events, like the engagement of Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift. But for all its popularity, Polymarket has not been allowed to operate in the US. The announcement came after Donald Trump Jr. joined Polymarket's advisory board in August, and the firm where he is a partner, 1789 Capital, made a strategic investment in the company. Peter Thiel's Founder's Fund led the company's last round of financing at a $1 billion valuation, bringing total funding to $255 million, according to Pitchbook.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This may not be an era in which Americans are awash in physical currency fattening their wallets, but we are awash in cash parked inside accounts that have been generating attractive yields thanks to Federal Reserve interest rate hikes to combat inflation. There is a record amount of cash in money market funds, roughly $7.6 trillion, according to Crane Data. But as the Federal Reserve prepares to cut rates for the first time in a year, maybe by as much as 50 basis points — a policy shift that will, over time, reduce the yields on risk-free cash-equivalent investments — market attention has shifted to whether that cash will be on the move. At the most extreme, Wall Street's so-called "wall of cash" theory — which claims that all that cash on the move can create its own stock market rally — has been debunked about as many times as it has been offered. At the very least, it is a significant moment of change in Federal Reserve rate policy. The payrolls data "cinches the case for a rate cut," said Investment Company Institute Chief Economist and lead ETF researcher Shelly Antoniewicz earlier this week on CNBC's "ETF Edge." But she added on the podcast portion of ETF Edge that as the Fed starts to lower rates, the roughly $7 trillion "sitting in money market funds" will gradually flow into more risk-on assets, including stocks and bonds, as savings rates become less attractive. To be sure, more mutual fund companies are going to be chasing those assets on the precipice of a huge decision from the Securities and Exchange Commission which could allow every asset management company to offer an ETF share class of their funds. While all that may be true, Peter Crane, president and publisher of money fund research firm Crane Data, has heard it all before, at least when it comes to the Fed and money market funds, and he has a simple response: money fund assets just keep growing, and the only times in recent history when they've gone down as opposed to up is when rates are literally at zero during periods of economic calamity. "The rates matter but much less than most people believe," Crane said. In fact, in the 52-year history of money market funds, assets have only gone down after the dotcom bust and financial crisis, periods where intense economic stress led to rock-bottom rates, a "bottom of the rate cycle nailed to zero," he said. If things get bad enough in the economy that the Fed has to cut more aggressively sooner rather than later, that's not exactly a sign of a market where investors are likely to be overly aggressive with their own risk profile, either. There has also been a shift over time in the usage of money market funds, with what was once mostly a retail investor phenomenon now majority institutional and corporate cash — roughly 60% of the market, according to Crane's data. "They are not moving, no matter what," he said. It's not that money fund researchers like Crane deny that lower rates matter, or that some of the money fund assets may indeed move to higher-risk, higher return areas of the market — he thinks that is maybe 10% of the $7 trillion-plus, though he adds there is no precise data to rely on for such an estimate. But when you consider the roughly $20 trillion that Americans leave in bank deposits, basically giving their money to Wall Street to go off and make more money on while earning no money themselves, a 25 basis point cut in the current interest rate environment does not exactly make money funds a dead option. "It's more about how big is the rate differentially," he said. While investors may get "re-sensitized" to yield, at what level will that occur? Currently, money fund investors are earning on average 4.3% annually. Crane says even if rates move down to 3%, by no means assured since 100 basis points of Fed rate cuts is seen by many as aggressive barring a major downturn in the economy, much of the money will stay put, especially when you consider what banks are paying to hold cash, maybe at best 0.5%. "Likely, if you go to zero there will be erosion in the base," he said. The Fed did cut rates a year ago, before it paused due to fears about inflation, and money funds assets have only gone higher since. If an investor has $5,000 in a money market fund and it is earning 1% or 2% more or less, Crane says there are better things to think about as far as making money. Nothing is worth doing for less than 1% or one hundred bucks," he added. And, at a time when the bond market has been volatile, there is more danger in fixed-income and in the treasuries market than investors had come to expect, making duration a more dicey proposition for investors. One thing is certain: the money fund market won't move next week in the immediate aftermath of a Fed decision to cut rates. Unlike treasury bills, money funds have a weighted maturity of 30 days, therefore assuming the Fed cuts next Wednesday at its FOMC meeting, treasuries start to go lower but money funds take a month to move fully lower because they are still owners of higher-yielding. "But over the long term, it is a negative," he said. "Eventually, less interest is being generated compared to other investments." If you are among the investor set that has built up a more sizable balance than you necessarily need in cash-equivalent accounts, there are options, according to Todd Sohn, a technical strategist and ETF strategist for Strategas Asset Management. "Once money market fund rates start flirting with the lower 3% area, your after-tax yield isn't great," Sohn said. But while that may not be ideal for the returns that can be generated, "perhaps you are risk averse and just want to keep it there," he added. For investors that do determine that a move out of money funds is warranted, the first step to consider is moving out on the treasury curve, for example, a treasury ETF with a duration of two to five years. Sohn concedes that at a time of greater fixed-income market volatility, it means investors are taking on more duration risk and more volatility, but no credit risk. "At least you'll gain yield plus price appreciation," he said. To manage any surprises in the fixed-income market, investors can use what is called a "bond ladder" ETF. "The balance of a ladder can keep volatility lower as opposed to adding too much duration," he added, a factor that burned many investors in recent years. Investors could also consider adding to stock holdings, but Sohn warned that any investor who already has a diversified portfolio is unlikely to need more exposure to large-cap growth or tech, with the record market being propelled by those stocks, and the eight biggest tech stocks now representing close to 40% of the U.S. stock market. "But perhaps you see holes in your equity sleeve," Sohn said. "Assess your portfolio to see if you need small-, mid-cap or international exposures. There are a ton of low cost options for this," he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The UK is planning to mass-produce thousands of interceptor drones for Ukraine to help the embattled country fend off worsening Russian bombardments. The first-of-its-kind deal to build Ukrainian-designed weapons in a European country further underscores the UK's leading role in supporting Kyiv's various drone programs; Britain's government also announced several other ongoing initiatives this week. UK officials on Wednesday said the joint project — dubbed "Octopus" — is an advanced, low-cost interceptor drone that's designed to chase down incoming threats like drones and missiles and knock them out of the sky. The drones to be built in the UK were designed by Ukraine with support from UK scientists and technicians, and have already been tested in combat against Russia's Shahed-style one-way attack drones. The Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank estimated that each Shahed drone costs roughly $35,000. Russia has threatened countries that provide weapons to Ukraine and has reportedly plotted to kill the CEO of a leading German arms manufacturer. "We will scale up production, attract investment, and improve technologies to better protect our cities and civilians from air attacks," he said on Thursday. Interceptor drones have emerged as a key air defense tool for Ukraine in recent months as Russia expands its nightly drone attacks. In July, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy set a goal for companies to produce 1,000 of these drones a day, pushing manufacturers to scale up production to keep pace with Moscow, which has invested heavily in the production of one-way attack drones. Moscow is already capable of sending hundreds of them into Ukraine in a single night; some Western assessments suggest this figure could soar to 2,000. Project Octopus comes just months after UK and Ukrainian leaders announced a new industrial partnership between the two countries, and after European countries were forced to scramble to respond to an unprecedented Russian drone incursion into Poland. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Wednesday that Britain and its allies would "step up" support to Kyiv amid Moscow's unrelenting bombardments. He called the new partnership "a landmark moment, bringing together British and Ukrainian ingenuity to deliver cutting-edge defense drone technology to fight back against Russian aggression." On Tuesday, Britain's defense ministry said it will fund the delivery of thousands of UK-made long-range attack drones — essentially cruise missiles that can be remotely piloted to their targets — which are considered "vital" for Ukraine's defense, over the next year. The Trump administration, by contrast, has signaled it won't provide Ukraine with longer-range missiles like the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS. This initiative is part of the UK-led International Fund for Ukraine, which turns contributions from partner nations into high-priority military equipment for Kyiv. Ukraine has used long-range drones to carry out deep strikes into Russia, targeting high-value military and energy targets sometimes hundreds of miles behind the front lines. These include key air bases, ammunition depots, weapons production facilities, and oil terminals. This campaign initially emerged as a way for Ukraine to work around restrictions set in place by Western countries, which barred Kyiv from using the powerful cruise and ballistic missiles that they had donated to strike inside Russia. Meanwhile, Ukraine's largest drone manufacturer, Ukrspecsystems, announced plans last week to invest £200 million ($271 million) in two new UK facilities, a plan that will create hundreds of local jobs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET Tether, the issuer of the largest stablecoin, has named a CEO for its U.S. business and is launching a new token for U.S. institutions. The company, once accused of being a criminal's "go-to cryptocurrency" has been rebranding itself as a partner to American lawmakers and law enforcement since pro-crypto President Donald Trump's return to the White House. Bo Hines, who headed the Presidential Council of Advisors for Digital Assets, has been appointed CEO of Tether U.S., whose headquarters will be based in Charlotte, N.C. While USD Tether (USDT) serves global markets, the new token is designed for businesses and institutions operating under a U.S. regulatory framework. "For over a decade, Tether – as the creator of the stablecoin industry – has issued USDT, the backbone of the digital economy, and today the U.S dollar stablecoin for hundreds of millions of underserved people living in emerging markets, proving that digital assets can deliver trust, resilience, and freedom on a global scale," said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, who teased the new token to CNBC in May. USAT will employ Tether's proprietary tokenization platform, Hadron. Crypto bank Anchorage Digital will be the issuer of USAT, and Cantor Fitzgerald will act as the reserve custodian and preferred primary dealer. It has remained the most popular and dominant stablecoin despite controversy and regulatory scrutiny over the years – largely because of the widespread adoption and liquidity its first mover advantage has afforded it. It also invests a significant portion of its reserves in U.S. Treasury bonds. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent echoed that earlier this year, when he said at the White House Crypto Summit that "we are going to keep the U.S. the dominant reserve currency in the world and we're going to use stablecoins to do that." "USAT is our commitment to ensuring that the dollar not only remains dominant in the digital age, but thrives." The market cap for stablecoins has grown about 34% this year, according to CryptoQuant. —CNBC's Dan Murphy and Natasha Turak contributed reporting.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Watchmaker Swatch has launched a special edition model in a dig at U.S. President Donald Trump's punitive 39% tariffs against Switzerland. Retailing for 139 Swiss francs ($174) and launched on Wednesday, the watch is intended as a limited edition product, a company spokesperson told CNBC. The model, which is only available in Switzerland, was showing as out of stock on the Swiss watchmaker's website Friday. The spokesperson added that the model was intended as a "positive provocation" to authorities and a firm nudge to the Swiss government to secure a better deal. "It's in the DNA of Swatch to provoke in a positive way," they said via email. We hope that this activation will not last long, but that it will be as short as possible." "As soon as the United States changes its customs duties towards Switzerland, we will immediately stop selling this watch," they added. Trump announced shock 39% levies on Switzerland on Aug. 1, among the highest set by the president globally. The measures provoked dismay from Swiss authorities and domestic businesses who had expected a rate in line with the 10% to 15% applied to other major trading partners like the European Union and the U.K. Swiss negotiators have since been trying to secure a better deal, with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick telling CNBC Thursday that the two countries were likely to "get a deal done." Swiss watchmakers and the wider luxury industry have been hit especially hard by the duties, given their heavy reliance on U.S. consumers. The limited edition marks an addition to the company's "WHAT IF..." collection, which typically features colourful models that retail for around 100 Swiss francs. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Do not mention the Project Maverick name," reads a NDA agreement seen by Business Insider. But despite its secrecy, "Project Maverick," as it is codenamed, isn't a revolutionary piece of hardware or groundbreaking new technology. Dell sees this transformation as "critical" for its AI strategy and future success, and the company has brought on a team of Deloitte consultants to help guide the project, internal documents about the project obtained by Business Insider show. "The 'game' is changing — we must be far more nimble, decisive, and quick," one internal document says. Business Insider has also seen an NDA agreement sent to a Dell employee. "While we're not going to discuss the specifics of our internal processes, we prioritize innovation and service to support our team members, customers, and partners," a Dell spokesperson told Business Insider. Project Maverick's mission is to modernize the 41-year-old company's vast IT sprawl, part of which Dell inherited during its acquisition of EMC in 2015, the second-largest technology merger ever. According to the onboarding presentation, Dell's operations run on roughly 4,700 applications, 70,000 servers, and more than 10,000 databases. The tangle of systems forces staff into "manual processes and excessive reporting," diverting energy away from pursuing innovation, Dell said. One slide breaking down specific functions described Dell's subscription capabilities as "severely outdated," its customer resource management as a source of "confusion and inefficiency," and its stock keeping units, or SKUs, as a driver of "go-to-market delays." They asked to remain anonymous as they are not permitted to speak publicly, but Business Insider has verified their employment. They're very old," said one employee, who has been with the company for more than 10 years. "It is very hard for us to do our jobs in the Dell ecosystem as it is today," said a second Dell employee. A third employee told Business Insider that while some tools "aren't very intuitive," they had few complaints about the ones they use daily. Dell has been working on Project Maverick since November 2024 and is set to launch for the client solutions group (CSG) — the part of Dell that sells personal computers, monitors, and other hardware — in February 2026, in line with the start of Dell's financial year, according to a project timeline seen by Business Insider. "Friday, it's going to work one way, Monday, it's going to work a different way," explained the Dell employee who has been at the company for more than 10 years and who works on Project Maverick. The company's other key business line, the infrastructure solutions group (ISG) — which provides servers, storage solutions, and other IT infrastructure — is scheduled to be updated in May 2026. Project Maverick will mean "less time on manual tasks, better data and insights for decision-making, faster response to customer needs, a more agile, competitive Dell," according to the internal documents. Changes will include creating a single global catalog, consistent lead times, and automated order management capabilities. "This is a bold opportunity to deliver the benefits our teams have been asking for and a key enabler of Modern Dell," the project documents say. Alongside Project Maverick, major changes have been hitting other parts of Dell's business. Dell announced another major leadership shift this week — Yvonne McGill, the chief financial officer, has stepped down after nearly 30 years at the company. Michael Dell founded his eponymous brand in 1984, under the name PC's Limited, and it quickly established itself as a trusted maker of office PCs. Since 1992, Dell has been a Fortune 500 company — barring four years from 2014 when it was taken private — and Dell himself is the world's 11th-richest man, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. But Project Maverick demonstrates how successful legacy brands must reorient all their operations for an AI-driven future. Joe Depa, the global chief innovation officer at the Big Four professional services firm EY, told Business Insider that major transformations are "inevitable" as companies implement AI. "Implementing AI isn't about dropping a tool into old workflows — it requires rethinking processes, systems, and even business models through an 'AI-first' lens," he said. Minimizing your operational complexity is crucial because "siloed, manual systems can't handle the scale, speed, or intelligence AI enables." Companies that re-architect their operating models around AI "will set the competitive standard," Depa added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said Friday that he will send the National Guard to Memphis, Tennessee one month after he federalized law enforcement in Washington, D.C. and deployed soldiers across the city in an effort to address crime. "We're going to Memphis," Trump said on Fox News, calling the city "deeply troubled." Trump said both the state's Republican Gov. Bill Lee and the Democratic mayor of Memphis, Paul Young, were "happy" with his plan. Local affiliate ABC24 on Wednesday reported that members of the Memphis city council had been briefed on the prospect of a National Guard presence in the city. Trump said he was inspired to prioritize Memphis by Jim Vena, the CEO of Union Pacific railroad. Vena stepped down from the board in 2023, when he was named to lead Union Pacific. Trump claimed Vena said he needed to use "an armored vehicle with bulletproof glass" to go one block in Memphis. The Memphis Police Department said this week that overall crime in the first eight months of 2025 is at a 25-year low. Murder hit a six-year low, the department said. Trump said Vena also suggested St. Louis, Mo. and Chicago as potential cities that Trump should look at. Trump did not explain what legal framework the White House would use to justify a deployment of soldiers to another U.S. city. That suit came days after a federal judge blocked the administration from deploying the National Guard in Los Angeles. During his interview Friday, Trump criticized California Gov. Gavin Newsom and said he expects to win all the court cases related to the National Guard's deployment. "And we have been winning all of them."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Officials on Friday identified the suspected shooter of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk as Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old Utah man, following his arrest overnight. Robinson has been booked at Utah County Jail, Gov. Spencer Cox announced at a news conference. The announcement of Robinson's arrest came after President Donald Trump revealed earlier Friday morning on Fox News that Kirk's suspected killer was in custody. Kirk was fatally shot on Wednesday during an outdoor event at Utah Valley University. Cox said at the press event that a friend of Robinson's family told the sheriff's office in Utah's Washington County on Thursday evening that Robinson had either confessed or "implied that he had committed this incident." When investigators encountered Robinson in person early Friday morning, he was wearing clothing consistent with what UVU surveillance footage showed when it captured him driving onto campus before the shooting, the governor said. A family member told investigators in an interview that Robinson had "become more political in recent years," Cox said. The Republican governor also identified the gun police found in a wooded area where the gunman fled after shooting Kirk as a Mauser model 98 .30-06 caliber bolt-action rifle with a mounted scope. Several casings found with the rifle had been engraved with messages, some of which appear to reference online memes and video games, Cox said. While the governor said he would leave it to others to interpret what the engravings mean, he said that one "speaks for itself." That casing also showed a series of directional arrows, which could be a reference to the button input pattern that triggers a large bomb strike in the video game "Helldivers 2." Another casing's inscription referenced a meme that parodies online subcultures. "This is a very sad day" for the country, "but I'm grateful that at this moment, we have an opportunity to bring closure to this very dark chapter in our nation's history," Cox said. Kirk, 31, was the founder of conservative group Turning Point USA, which focuses its political activism on high schools and colleges. He was at UVU in Orem for the first stop on Turning Point's "American Comeback Tour," according to the group's website. Kirk was in the middle of answering an audience member's question, which was about mass shootings, when a gunman shot him once in the neck, sending thousands of people running and screaming for safety. While the manhunt was ongoing, the FBI on Thursday released two grainy photos of a "person of interest" and video footage showing someone jumping off the rooftop from where Kirk was shot.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AT&T is reducing its reliance on an employee-attendance tracking system, admitting to workers that it hasn't been fully accurate and is "driving people to the brink of frustration." The telecom giant is one of several companies, including Amazon, JP Morgan, and Microsoft, tightening return-to-office mandates and using new tech to track employee compliance. Executives at these companies say the moves boost collaboration and productivity. In a meeting last month, chief marketing and growth officer Kellyn Kenny said her division is reducing its reliance on presence tracking in response to employee concerns about the system and its accuracy. "It is not something that I expect anybody to be looking at on a daily, weekly, or even monthly basis." CEO John Stankey indicated in a memo to staffers last month (reported exclusively by Business Insider) that AT&T was shifting its use of behavioral data, such as presence reports. "We analyze patterns of behaviors from broad cohorts," he wrote, "to determine if the behavior being evaluated is consistent with our stated priorities and employment expectations." "Some may view this approach as a matter of trust, and that perspective is understandable. In several forums, I've expressed concerns that past data indicated more outliers than we'd like," he said. She said the survey included critiques from workers who said they were struggling to make it to doctors' appointments without running afoul of the system, for example. While the survey does not appear to have included a direct question about presence reporting, it did ask whether employees agreed that AT&T's "policies and systems support me in delivering my best work." "I now understand the level of anxiety that this report has created," Kenny said. "I also now understand how the fact that it is inaccurate is driving people to the brink of frustration, and it's creating distrust." Business Insider has spoken with roughly a dozen employees from multiple divisions of the company this year about the system and its impact on their workplace experience. Other companies, like Amazon and JP Morgan in particular, have also closely monitored employee behavior at work. The company ended up nixing the labels in favor of providing raw badging data to managers to use at their discretion. A recent survey by commercial real-estate company CBRE found that more than two-thirds of employers track employee compliance with attendance policies, and more than a third have taken some level of enforcement action. Enforcement that is too strict or error-prone can cause other headaches within an organization — pushing out experienced employees, making it harder to hire new talent, or undermining motivation and trust within the organization. Amazon's internal documents from last year indicated that its RTO policy was hampering its ability to recruit top AI talent, and a Harvard leadership expert said Meta's abruptly shifting RTO effort in 2023 was likely to cause a "huge amount of distrust" in the company. At the AT&T marketing and growth team meeting, Kenny said that the system helped leadership identify "freeloaders" who showed up for 30 minutes or two hours per day. "There were people who badged in for 10 minutes, got themselves a cup of coffee, and then left," she said. We do not need this report for that purpose anymore, because we took action on the people who were the free riders." AT&T did not specify how many workers have been disciplined or dismissed in connection with their presence report information. AT&T workers told Business Insider that apparent glitches in the system could also be a hassle for employees who were pulling their weight. They said that in the first few months of this year, while the five-day RTO mandate was phasing in, their reports could be wrong by as many as several hours. In addition, briefly badging into an AT&T facility on a day off could trigger a person's daily average hours to drop below the mandatory eight hours for the week. "Sometimes you'd step out for lunch, and then it would stop counting." Though there were no immediate consequences from an incorrect report, employees were concerned the erroneous data could make them targets for layoffs. Some other business leaders have said RTO mandates have "encouraged" workers to quit voluntarily, allowing companies to avoid more expensive layoffs. AT&T previously told Business Insider the goal of its in-office rules is to foster better collaboration. It has also undertaken a multiyear effort to shrink its workforce. Stankey has said that the company is looking to cut some $6 billion in costs as it decommissions its legacy copper-based network in favor of new fiber and 5G technologies. One worker in Georgia said that the presence reports changed the workplace reality for many salaried managerial workers, who aren't used to such detailed tracking of their workday. "We're supposed to be able to work a more flexible thing as long as we get our work done," he said. Another effect of the crackdown on underperformers has been the erosion of motivation for some higher performers to put in extra time. One shared their report with annotations that showed such an improvement. The question of employees' trust could take more than a few months to resolve.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The topic was which AI models and chatbots are best to use. For some partygoers, an important filter was how "ethical" the providers were. This company has done impressive work in the area of AI safety. I mentioned that Anthropic has bot crawlers that seem to regularly scrape data from websites while sending very little traffic back. Since then, I've been looking for reliable data that shows this important and under-discussed part of the AI revolution. While tech companies spend lavishly on data centers, GPUs, and talent, they avoid talking about the other key ingredient of AI success: data. That's because they don't want to pay for the high-quality human data that's needed for AI model training, inference, and AI outputs. Instead, they send out bots to crawl websites and scoop up this information, mostly for free. Sites would let their data be taken for free on the understanding that they would get referrals in return, and could pay for their efforts through advertising, subscriptions, and other techniques. In the new generative AI world, this deal is breaking down. Cloudflare, which helps run about 20% of the world's websites, has begun tracking this behavior. It measures Big Tech company bots' requests to crawl websites, and the number of referrals the platforms send to sites. This crawl-to-refer ratio is a useful guide to how much tech companies are taking from the web and how much they're giving back. For example, a ratio of 100 to 1 would mean a company's bots crawled sites 100 times for every 1 referral they send. Is this one way to measure how ethical companies are in the AI era? As you can see, Anthropic stands out like a sore thumb. This aligns with Business Insider reporting from about a year ago. Back then, we told you that bots from Anthropic and OpenAI, especially, were crawling some websites so much that it was causing their traffic costs to spike dramatically. One web developer saw a client's cloud-computing costs double within a few months due to this AI bot swarm, according to BI reporting last year. So, not only are AI companies taking from the web and giving less back — they are also leaving some site owners with bigger bills to pay. Anthropic also noted that it launched a web search feature for its popular Claude AI chatbot earlier this year. OpenAI did not respond to requests for comment. Perplexity responded with a detailed and thoughtful response that partly focused on the emerging ability of bots to represent human users' intentions, such as a desire to access knowledge on the web freely. "In the case of public content, publishers can choose not to make their content public," Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer told Business Insider. "In the case of facts, copyright law, as you know, has always drawn a line between facts and expression. If app activity were included, the ratios might be lower. Google's relatively low ratio is likely due to its traditional search engine, which still shows website links in many results. Business Insider will track this Cloudflare data in the coming months and quarters to see how this behavior evolves. Sign up for BI's Tech Memo newsletter here.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI is about to clear a major hurdle, freeing the startup to pursue an ambitious and expensive "full stack" strategy that could catapult it into the Big Tech big leagues or spiral the AI pioneer into a financial ball of flames. This will create a new corporate structure that helps OpenAI issue traditional equity, making it easier to raise the mountain of cash needed to pursue its dreams. By full stack, Friar means a tech company that owns and operates every part of its business. That includes designing its own chips and building its own data centers, all the way up the stack to a suite of AI-powered software applications beyond ChatGPT. "The company, as you look forward, will become very much a full stack company, with a lot of places that we can build both moats and really interesting business models," Friar explained. She didn't say it, but the target is most likely Google. That includes energy assets, specialized in-house chips, massive data centers, leading AI models, talent, developer platforms, wide distribution, and billions of consumer and enterprise touchpoints. OpenAI is a long way from Google's dominance, but the startup has several strategy beachheads from which to expand — both up and down the stack. GPUs, AI servers, and data centers consume unprecedented amounts of power. OpenAI doesn't have a clear answer here yet; however, CEO Sam Altman has personally backed several energy startups, including Helion, which is trying to use nuclear fusion to generate electricity. OpenAI hired Richard Ho in late 2023 to lead its efforts here. He worked at Google for almost a decade, helping to develop the tech giant's TPUs, which power its AI models, including Gemini. Those AI chips go in servers that are stacked inside giant data centers. OpenAI is currently working with all the major cloud providers, renting the computing power needed to train and run its models and chatbot service. "I've rarely seen scaled technology companies that don't own and operate their own infrastructure," Goldman Sachs internet analyst Eric Sheridan told Business Insider this week. "This helps them control more of their own destinies over time." About 4 million developers have built on this OpenAI platform already. Without broad distribution, no one will use your AI products. The startup bought Jony Ive's AI gadget startup for more than $6 billion a few months ago, and executives have hinted at form factors that could mean OpenAI's chatbot follows people wherever they go. It also launched a web browser, another powerful distribution tool. The startup is also trying to reach corporate customers, not just consumers. It already has roughly 5 million paid seats from ChatGPT business products. On Tuesday, Friar suggested that OpenAI might challenge established software companies at some point, or at least the startup's AI technology could support such disruption. ChatGPT has 700 million weekly average users, but the startup is looking beyond that. In May, OpenAI hired Fidji Simo as CEO of Applications. The former Instacart CEO and Meta executive reports directly to Altman. It looked eerily like LinkedIn, the professional network owned by its partner Microsoft. Goldman's Sheridan said the ultimate goal would probably look something like Google's suite of apps, which include not just Search, but also Maps, YouTube, Gmail, Calendar, Chrome, Classroom, Translate, Earth, Drive, Meet, Photos, Sheets, Docs, and Slides. Sorting out its tortured corporate structure should help on the fundraising side. Indeed, without an agreement with Microsoft, OpenAI could miss out on at least $10 billion in funding from SoftBank. That cash infusion is looking a little more likely now.</p>
