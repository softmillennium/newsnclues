                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The experimentation for the United States men's national team is over after a September international window that saw them defeat a rotated Japan side while falling to South Korea. The USMNT did break out a new formation with a back three against Japan, but while that was a positive, it does also lead to more questions about how the USMNT roster will look for the World Cup. A back three could provide defensive cover, but it also means that fewer midfielders are needed as well. Playing time concerns are still an issue in the squad with members of the side such as Weston McKennie, Yunus Musah, and Gio Reyna not playing consistently for their clubs, but with some key players getting moves to new teams during the summer transfer window, that could change. Even if it doesn't, Pochettino will need to weigh a player's talent and fit in the USMNT with their current form and playing time, which are some of the tough differences between club management and the international game. But as time dwindles before the USMNT kicks off another international break where they'll face Ecuador and Australia in October, let's take a look at predicting the roster as we're less than a year out from the World Cup in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. A section that has been dwindling as regression has hit the USMNT pool, this is a group of players who, if healthy, are still expected to be in the squad and likely start matches. The locks are beginning to shift as more players are staking claims to their spots after the September international window. Matt Freese is doing everything that he can in order to make sure that he's the number one keeper for the USMNT when the World Cup kicks off, but, at a minimum, he has done enough to be on the roster, even if it is only as a penalty shootout specialist. Missing out on the September international window, Weston McKennie may be the most likely name to fall out of this group of players, but alarm bells won't start to ring unless he's not present in the October international window either. Sergino Dest also got his first appearance under Pochettino, and despite having mixed results during camp, he's still someone who will be in the mix during the World Cup due to what he brings to the USMNT going forward. There are other players like Malik Tillman who are likely locks, but considering that not only did he just move into a new environment at Bayer Leverkusen, but Tillman also now has a new head coach in Kasper Hjulmand after Erik ten Hag was fired after only two matches in charge of the German side, and with Champions League soccer on the horizon, it's a time when anything could happen, putting his World Cup spot at risk. Looking at somewhere like midfield, it seemed like the trio was set for this upcoming World Cup as Yunus Musah, Adams, and McKennie wowed at the 2022 World Cup, but as things have changed, Musah has now moved to Atalanta and will need to earn playing time or he'll find himself missing out on the World Cup entirely in 2026. Here's a look at those who have missed the cut in this projection: Defenders (8): Sergino Dest (PSV), Antonee Robinson (Fulham), Miles Robinson (FC Cincinnati), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace), Tim Ream (Fulham), Alex Freeman (Orlando City SC), Max Arfsten (Columbus Crew), Tristan Blackmon (Vancouver Whitecaps). Midfielders (7): Weston McKennie (Juventus), Tyler Adams (Bournemouth), Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake), Luca De La Torre (San Diego FC), Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver Whitecaps), Malik Tillman (Bayer Leverkusen), Johnny Cardoso (Atletico Madrid). Forwards (6): Christian Pulisic (Milan), Folarin Balogun (Monaco), Ricardo Pepi (PSV), Tim Weah (Marseille), Patrick Agyemang (Derby County), Haji Wright (Coventry City), Gio Reyna (Borussia Monchengladbach).</p>

Myles Lewis-Skelly is reportedly "working hard with Arsenal coach" to improve two key weaknesses after losing his starting spot to Riccardo Calafiori. The teenage academy graduate had been thrown into the deep end during an injury crisis, cementing himself as Mikel Arteta's surprise first-choice left-back. He racked up 15 league starts in the second half of last season, dazzled in the Champions League quarter-finals by keeping Vinícius Júnior and Rodrygo quiet, and even scored on his England debut under Thomas Tuchel.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>), which had been previously used in brief spells, was deployed from the start against Japan and provided a potential path forward. Pochettino's blueprint for success has been questioned by many — but this was a good reminder that these things take time, and this appears to have been the last window for experimentation in terms of personnel and tactics. It might have taken longer than people had hoped, but while the Gold Cup was a hugely successful step forward in creating the culture that Pochettino wanted, the friendlies served as an important step in zoning in on the formation. The USMNT's recent struggles against top-ranked teams were well-documented, marked by a seven-game winless streak. The win against Japan was not only a break from this trend, but it also resulted in the team's first shutout against a Top-25 opponent since the 2022 World Cup match against Iran. If you watched our "State of the Union" episode after the loss to South Korea, you'd have seen how animated and passionate I was about this team stopping conceding chances and switching to this formation — something I've been calling for dating back to the 2022 World Cup. Heading into Qatar, there was a lot of concern about the center-back position, with both Miles Robinson and Chris Richards ruled out of the tournament with injuries. Then it was Tim Ream who emerged as this standout player and became a huge force in the back, and a big reason the U.S. had success in the back was the partnership he developed with Walker Zimmerman. Since then, nobody has really developed in that position, and the trend of conceding goals and being unable to keep clean sheets against top opposition persisted, which is why I've continued to push hard that the U.S. should start to look at a 3-4-2-1 formation with an extra center back, as opposed to a 4-3-3. The shift to a back three gave the defense a sense of security and a noticeable increase in confidence from the center-backs, who were more aggressive in their pressure and challenges without the fear of a costly breakdown. While this was evident with Max Arfsten and Alex Freeman, the potential of this system with the likes of Antonee Robinson and Sergino Dest is immense. The tactical change allowed Arfsten and Freeman to operate as true wing-backs, playing to their strengths as attacking players. Arfsten, who had previously been a defensive liability in a four-back system, thrived in this role, delivering one of his better performances for the national team. For a player like Freeman, the formation highlighted his offensive potential while also exposing his need for improvement in the final third — a crucial area for development if he is to become a high-potential fullback. Analyzing the team's passing graphs and average player positions reveals a much more balanced and consistent shape. This tactical stability provided a "comforting predictability" for the players and allowed key game-changers like Christian Pulisic and Folarin Balogun to be more impactful in dangerous spaces. The system solves a long-standing tactical dilemma of where to play Pulisic, giving him a more central role where he can influence the game while lessening his defensive responsibility. It's important to note that as of now — Folarin Balogun is in pole position at the striker position, once again — and it will be up to Ricardo Pepi to work his way back in as he continues to work back from injury. It's a good sign for USMNT fans in the way in which he moved off the ball, held up the ball back to goal, and ultimately finished off a chance in front of goal. Being in Sync on Pressuring the Ball While the formation showed great promise, there are still areas to refine. Some of these issues are to be expected as this group had limited time to train it and develop partnerships/relationships across the field, which is what I would imagine the focus of the October window will be. If you are one of the wide defenders — in this game, Tim Ream and Tristan Blackmon — you have to pick the right moments to step into the midfield and be aggressive in your pressure. As you do that, there needs to be cover and balance from the other two defenders. Think about it like good rhythm and dancing — if someone is stepping to a different beat, it's not going to work! The other interesting role to watch is Chris Richards. Richards has played in this system consistently for Crystal Palace, but as a right-sided center-back. The midfield pressing will also take some work and I saw moments where Pulisic and Alex Zendejas were unsure of which players to press from the Japanese midfield. That will come after the team has watched the tape and is a relatively easy fix that will absolutely improve with repetition (you could see some of the improvement after Pochettino made changes at half-time). When you achieve that harmony in defense, it can be liberating and give the team confidence. On the night, I felt that Roldan and Adams were generally solid as a partnership, especially considering this was Roldan's first start for the USMNT in over two years. When it was a three-man midfield of Yunus Musah, Weston McKennie and Tyler Adams, it was a midfield that relied mostly on the strength of the group: it's athleticism. That could really favor a player like Johnny Cardoso, who we have yet to see the best for the USMNT, and who has a good sense for rhythm, tempo, and forward passes. Looking ahead to the next international window, the following lineup would be an intriguing test for this new system, combining established players with emerging talents: Stu Holden, a former midfielder for the United States men's national team, is FOX Sports' lead match analyst for its marquee soccer coverage.</p>

More than 1.5 million ticket applications from fans in 210 countries have been received by FIFA within 24 hours of the presale draw for the 2026 World Cup being launched, according to REUTERS. The demand for the tournament “came primarily” from the U.S., Mexico and Canada, followed by Argentina, Colombia, Brazil, England, Spain, Portugal and Germany. Tickets will start at $60, yet dynamic pricing will be in operation during the first phase of ticket sales with fans “paying different prices according to market demand.” Additional ticket sales phases are scheduled to begin in October (REUTERS, 9/11). The CP's Neil Davidson noted the presale, which runs until Sept. 19, is a lottery open to Visa cardholders -- Visa is a FIFA partner -- and the first of several ticket windows ahead of the tournament. The initial bumper numbers come “despite some technical glitches” on the first day of the draw Wednesday, with some applicants facing lengthy waits after getting error messages or being kicked back to where they started from. The pre-sale draw will “involve approximately one million tickets” (CP, 9/11).

FREE ACCESS: REUTERS noted box and suite holders at Mexico City's Azteca stadium, also known as Estadio Banorte, will have “free access to 2026 World Cup matches” after they reached an agreement with FIFA. Under the terms of the long-standing contractual rights, box seat holders -- whose 99-year clause was originally established to help fund the stadium's construction in 1966 -- will be “granted free access to all five matches, including the tournament opener.” The stadium, which will have 90,000 seats after renovations, includes 12,500 individual box spaces. Box and suite holders will “need to register via a dedicated website,” with further details to be announced (REUTERS, 9/11).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Liam Delap is yet to announce himself properly at Stamford Bridge and, for now, that is how things will stay. The 22-year-old cannot be accused of dragging his heels: he made his Chelsea debut at the Club World Cup less than two weeks after joining from Ipswich Town, going on to play in six games at the tournament, score once and assist once, and collect his winner's medal. He had little chance to do so in a cameo as a substitute against Crystal Palace on the opening weekend, and his next home appearance, against Fulham, lasted less than 15 minutes before he limped off with a hamstring injury. The Athletic reported on Tuesday that the England international does not need surgery, but Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca told reporters on Friday that the centre-forward is expected to be out for 10-12 weeks, so has “a long way to go” in his rehabilitation. Delap has waited for his opportunity with a top club: he watched his former Manchester City academy team-mate Cole Palmer competing for European qualification while he was shouldering the goalscoring burden in an Ipswich team bound for relegation. After standing out with 12 Premier League goals last term, his first season in the top flight, he was courted by numerous Premier League teams and took on the mantle of starting centre-forward at one of the country's biggest clubs. Instead, the most valuable lesson his new club can teach him is patience. “He will be desperate, no doubt, to push that process and get back as soon as possible,” says former Watford, Reading, and Norwich City physiotherapist Luke Anthony. “But with a hamstring, if you get that wrong and (the player) re-injures, then you're looking at missing another two or three months.” There are particular risks around Delap's potential for re-injury. As Anthony explains, young players who have not previously experienced a certain type of injury — such as a hamstring tear — might be lulled into a false sense of security that draws them back to action too soon. Delap has no recorded history of hamstring or soft-tissue problems, making this new territory. Players increasingly understand that it is in their interest to prevent re-injury, Anthony says, with an increased focus on injury history in recruitment processes. “He has signed for a huge Premier League club, he's going to have a bunch of objectives,” says sports psychologist Dan Abrahams. “Suddenly, because of his injury, all these dreams and goals have been hampered. “What you're trying to do is help him think rationally about his situation. Former Liverpool physiotherapist Andy Renshaw says winning a player's trust in the rehabilitation process is key. “You can do that by explaining it and giving them a little bit of education: 'There's our table of these injuries in the past, that's how long they've been'," he says. Just give them the benefit of experience from other people they might trust.” To that end, the Chelsea forward could speak to his father, Rory, whose 19-year professional career took in spells at seven clubs. Delap Snr has plenty of experience with injuries striking at inopportune moments. An ankle problem ruled him out of Southampton's appearance at the 2003 FA Cup final. On his home debut for Stoke City on loan in October 2006 — against parent club Sunderland — he broke his leg in two places, ruling him out for the rest of the season. The Chelsea forward has had his own setbacks to draw upon. He dealt with ankle ligament problems at Manchester City in the 2021-22 season and a knee injury while on loan at Hull in 2023-24. He then remained fit throughout his Premier League campaign with Ipswich. “I've managed to focus and work hard and, importantly, not rush things,” he told The National in 2022 after suffering that ankle ligament issue at City. “I am still so young and had to make sure the injuries healed properly so there are no issues later in my career. “Talent development pathways are becoming quite sophisticated,” adds Abrahams. “They know that roadblocks and speed bumps — challenging times put in the way of young players — are important. No doubt he's had tough moments where he's had to weave a narrative when it's been challenging to do so.” Delap's situation is far from ideal, but he has the chance to use this setback to create a potent narrative of resilience.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GUADALAJARA, Mexico – World Cup 2026 co-hosts Mexico, Canada and the United States are less than a year away from organizing what is expected to be a transformational tournament. Foreign investment has already become a factor and is poised to increase in stature, while commercial opportunities could turn Mexico's first division into one of the world's most profitable leagues and leave MLS, a valued partner, behind. Barcelona is hoping to play an official La Liga fixture against Villarreal in Miami this December. In Europe, moving matches to the U.S. is not only highly controversial, it borders on blasphemy. That hurdle doesn't exist for North America's foremost league and footballing nation. Liga MX is already the domestic league king in its neighboring country. Now, Mexican football wants to take the next step. The novel Leagues Cup, a tournament that pits Mexico's 18 first-division clubs against 18 of the top MLS teams, is merely an appetizer to what could be a gluttonous proposal for Liga MX's top brands. “We don't understand why a game from a European league is being prioritized when we're the neighbors, and you could call us MLS' partners, through various tournaments including Leagues Cup,” Club América president Santiago Baños told reporters recently. If the game between Barcelona and Villarreal is allowed to be played, we will do anything possible to play an official Liga MX match in the United States.” The most influential voices in Mexican football are not tip-toeing around this. If Liga MX is able to strengthen an already massive footprint in the U.S., that could be viewed as a threat to the development of MLS. “The opportunity is so big that there are many ways to actually go for it,” Grupo Orlegi chairman Alejandro Irarragorri told The Athletic. Grupo Orlegi owns Club Santos Laguna and Atlas FC, in addition to second-division Spanish side Sporting Gijón. Atlas is up for sale as Orlegi seeks to distance itself from the Mexican tradition of multi-club ownership. “I've been discussing this integration, at some point it was called a merger,” Irarragorri said. “I don't think a merger is necessary, but I've discussed it with many owners and particularly with some of my closest MLS owners. I remember saying that in the short term, (Leagues Cup) was maybe better for MLS. In the medium term, maybe it was better for Liga MX. But I truly believe that in the long term this is better for both leagues.” Club officials in Mexico, along with the Mexican Football Federation, view tournaments against MLS teams as commercially viable brand-building exercises. Leagues Cup, though, has not gained much traction since its launch in 2023. The tournament is only played in U.S. stadiums, running from late July to late August, when Liga MX sides are at the start of their Apertura tournament. Leagues Cup in its current state doesn't benefit Liga MX – it clearly favors MLS teams. Official matches in sold-out U.S. stadiums would put three points on the line in a league where narrow title races are common. Now it's happening,” said Atlas FC president Aníbal Fájer. “Having this closeness to the States and having all of these fans there, it's something that we have to do.” Fájer listed Major League Baseball, the NBA, NFL and Formula 1 as Liga MX's primary competitors, though; not MLS. “They're all coming to play official matches in Mexico. Meanwhile, Liga MX president Mikel Arriola told The Athletic in August that a decision to play official Liga MX fixtures in the U.S. “would be made together with MLS.” There's a championship spirit that runs through the $24 million Academia AGA in Guadalajara. Atlas is still buzzing from the team's back-to-back Liga MX championships in 2021 and 2022. Those triumphs ended a 70-year title drought that had threatened the club's existence. Sipping coffee in the open-air complex, Fájer, 35, raises his voice in order to cut through the noise of a heated U-21 match between Atlas and Club América on one of the facility's six pitches. Later on this day, Fájer would speak in front of a group of the club's most important sponsors at Guadalajara's five-star Grand Fiesta Americana Country Club. He has risen through the ranks, having served as its head of business intelligence and working within the organization's mergers and acquisitions division. He was heavily involved in the purchase and culture transformation of Atlas. But now, while he remains busy running Atlas, Irarragori is entertaining offers for the club. “When I spoke with (Irarragorri) and was informed of Grupo Orlegi's decision to sell Atlas, I understood the situation,” Governor Pablo Lemus told The Athletic. “However, I raised only one condition: that the team does not leave Guadalajara, because it is truly very important for the people of our city. They will not find the advantages that our city offers, nor a sports center like the one Atlas built, which is world-class.” Clearlake Capital is the majority owner of Premier League side Chelsea, while private equity group Arctos Partners acquired a minority common equity stake in current European champion PSG in 2023. Those are just a few examples of how global football has become more lucrative than ever. This year was supposed to mark the beginning of a league-wide investment deal between Liga MX, NFL owners and asset management leader Apollo. At the time, it was a blow to Liga MX and a reminder that traditional boardroom diplomacy is not always the norm in Mexico. Chivas and Club América, for example, have benefited tremendously from having their own rights packages. “I think one great generator of information and indicators was the process that we had with Apollo,” Arriola said. “Apollo is now on hold, it didn't fall apart. This coincides with the growing interest of foreign ownership in Liga MX. Necaxa is partially owned by NX Football USA, led by American businessman Sam Porter and celebrity investor Eva Longoria; Wrexham AFC co-owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney are involved, as well. “I think that the future is becoming a reality today, because Necaxa was sold at two-times (revenue),” Arriola said. History was made earlier this year when Querétaro was acquired by Innovatio Capital, becoming the first Liga MX club with majority U.S. ownership. Innovatio Capital founder Marc Spiegel, who is based in Atlanta, first considered acquiring English Championship side Charlton Athletic and a handful of other European clubs. “That experience really started to crystallize what our investment thesis is, because for us, buying a club that really had no chance to break even from a cash flow perspective wasn't interesting,” Spiegel told The Athletic. “(Querétaro) is booming and blossoming into a hub for international business,” Spiegel said. There are opportunities to even make this a borderless transaction between (Mexico and the U.S.). We felt like there wasn't anything that came close to this from a growth and upside perspective.” The club nearly ceased to exist following a horrendous incident of stadium violence at Estadio La Corregidora in 2022. The Mexican Football Federation's (FMF) Disciplinary Commission fined Querétaro and issued a one-year stadium ban at La Corregidora. Spiegel and Innovatio Capital bought it in July for more than $120 million. Elsewhere, Grupo Pachuca is reportedly considering selling Club León. That could potentially lead to another foreign-owned Liga MX club, something Spiegel described as “inevitable.” “The process going on with Atlas, I'd say it's highly likely that it sells to an American or to an American group,” he said. “I think if we're sitting here having a conversation three years from now, I think you'll see two or three more (American-owned clubs). “When you talk to people outside of Mexico about Liga MX,” Spiegel added, “You talk to people in Europe, they're like, ‘This is a sleeping giant.' And I think understanding there is quality from a sporting perspective, but also being so tied naturally to the United States from a commercial standpoint.” Spiegel sees a future where Liga MX and MLS move past their current state, which he called “dating” to a relationship that could change the sport forever. “Do the two leagues merge one day?” Spiegel asked. “I think that could be a game-changer globally in the football space. As both MLS and Liga MX consider their own growth strategies, the 2026 World Cup will provide the ideal sales and marketing pitch for both leagues. MLS has made significant strides over the past decade, and the most recent transfer window was a clear indicator of progress. Per MLS, clubs spent nearly $336 million in player acquisitions, a league record. Despite that milestone, MLS continues to be held back by its distinct financial rules and restrictions. With foreign capital now actively flowing through the league and a new media rights deal on the horizon, Liga MX is primed for its own foundational transformation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thanks to Guns N'Roses, the men's national team will now have its fun and (very crucial) games at the country's main stadium. El Salvador will now play its two World Cup qualifying matches in October at Estadio Cuscatlán after the band agreed to move its forthcoming concert to another venue. Concert organizers confirmed that the band's October 4 concert will now be at Estadio Nacional Jorge "El Mágico" González to accommodate the games. The Cuscatlán, El Salvador's largest stadium, is set to host La Selecta's qualifiers against Panama on October 10 and Guatemala on October 14. Officials had cautioned that holding a major concert days before those games would damage the pitch. El Salvador is vying to reach its first World Cup since 1982 and is in the middle of a qualifying campaign through CONCACAF. Yamil Bukele, president of El Salvador's Instituto Nacional de los Deportes (INDES), thanked the band and promoters for their cooperation. "We appreciate the willingness of Guns N' Roses and the organizing team to make this change so that fans of both soccer and music can enjoy world-class events," Bukele said in a statement.
