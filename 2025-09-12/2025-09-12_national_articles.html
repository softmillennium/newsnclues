                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON (AP) — Family members of the young Utah man accused of shooting Charlie Kirk told authorities he had recently become “more political” and saw the ally of President Donald Trump as a person spreading hate, according to authorities. A judge ordered that he be held without bail. He was also listed as inactive, meaning he had not voted in at least the last two general elections. This photo released by the Utah Governor's Office on Friday, Sept. 12, 2025 shows Tyler Robinson. State and federal court records do not show any prior criminal cases involving him. His listed address in the probable cause statement is the six-bedroom home of his parents, who own a granite countertop business and are registered to vote as Republicans. It wasn't immediately clear Friday whether Robinson had a defense lawyer who could comment on his behalf. Messages seeking comment left Friday with family members including his parents received no response. Robinson has two younger brothers and his parents have been married for about 25 years, according to social media posts. A photo Charlie Kirk, the CEO and co-founder of Turning Point USA who was shot and killed, sits at a vigil in his memory, Thursday, Sept. 11, 2025, in Orem, Utah. An honor roll student in high school who scored in the 99th percentile nationally on standardized tests, he was admitted to Utah State in 2021 on a prestigious academic scholarship, according to a video of him reading his acceptance letter posted to a family member's social media account. He attended for only one semester, according to a university spokesperson. Robinson is currently enrolled as a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College in St. George. Social media posts by Robinson's mother reflect an active family with vacations to Disneyland, Hawaii, the Caribbean and Alaska. They frequently spent time outdoors — boating, fishing, riding ATVs, zip-lining and target shooting. After graduating from high school in 2021, Robinson's mother praised her eldest son for his smarts and academic success on her social media page, and both his parents helped him move into his dorm at Utah State that fall. She didn't have any public Facebook posts after 2022. The break in the case came after a family member of Robinson reached out to a family friend with information that Robinson had “confessed” or implied involvement in the shooting, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox told reporters Friday, shortly after Robinson was taken into custody. Cox said it is believed that Robinson acted alone. Family members said Robinson “had become more political in recent years,” Cox said, describing a recent family dinner in which Robinson mentioned that Kirk planned to speak at UVU. “They talked about why they didn't like him and the viewpoints that he had,” Cox said, referring to Robinson and an unnamed family member. Meagan Bradley kneels at a memorial is set up for Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, Friday, Sept. 12, 2025. When authorities took him into custody, court records show, Robinson also was wearing clothing “consistent” with surveillance photographs of the person of interest. Cox said ammunition found at the scene had engravings that reference meme culture and referred to fascism.</p>

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt condemned members of the media for being slow to report a shocking murder. The White House unleashed on The Washington Post for its reporting on the stabbing murder of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska by a career criminal on a train in North Carolina in August. "White House: The career criminal who murdered Iryna Zarutska should've been locked up. Murderer's mother: My son should've been locked up. Washington Post citing 'experts': Actually, locking up violent criminals is draconian!" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted to X on Wednesday. Leavitt was reacting to a Washington Post article titled, "Trump blames Democrats for Charlotte stabbing. Records complicate the story," which detailed the White House's position that left-wing cities have created violent trends via soft-on-crime policies such as no-cash bail. Brown had a lengthy arrest record ahead of Zarutska's death, racking up 14 arrests over the last decade, as well as convictions including larceny and breaking and entering in 2013, and a 2015 conviction for robbery with a dangerous weapon, which landed him behind bars for six years, Fox Digital previously reported. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt speaks about the stabbing death of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a North Carolina train during a briefing at the White House in Washington, D.C., Sept. 9, 2025. More recent charges included communicating threats and misuse of the 911 system earlier this year. Brown, however, was not under state supervision at the time of Zarutska's killing. Brown's own mother, whom the Washington Post noted in its Wednesday report, told local media that her son should have been detained at the time of the killing, and lamented the court system released him despite previous arrests and mental health concerns. "This is not a ‘complicated issue,' like many Democrats and left-wing media outlets have tried to claim; it is very simple: violent criminals belong behind bars, not sitting behind innocent bystanders on public transportation," White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told the Washington Post for the story in question. The White House took issue with the outlet, noting the mother's concern over her son's release, and Jackson's statement, before citing experts who reported to the outlet that "permanently confining people who are mentally ill for minor offenses is a ‘draconian' and inhumane response." "The Trump Administration will not let it go unnoticed that the failing left-wing media and out-of-touch, privileged reporters continue to bend over backwards to defend career criminals instead of the innocent victims that are murdered by these monsters," White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Fox Digital of the media report. "Enough is enough: the American people deserve better and that begins by acknowledging the truth about how soft-on-crime policies fuel this unacceptable violence." Brown's mom, who did not identify herself, told local outlet WSOC-TV in August that her son had long struggled with mental illness, noting that he "started saying weird things" after his release from prison for the 2015 robbery conviction. "My heart goes out to the victim's family. Ahead of the murder, Brown was charged by police for misusing the 911 system in January, when he claimed to operators that he was being controlled by a microchip, the New York Post reported. He was released from jail on cashless bail and provided a "written promise" to appear in court at a later date. There were concerns over his mental health, however, with a prosecutor questioning if Brown could proceed in the court case before a judge ordered a forensic evaluation, according to WSOC-TV. The Department of Justice announced on Tuesday that it federally charged Brown with one count of committing an act causing death on a mass transportation system. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt speaks during a press briefing in the Brady Briefing Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on Sept. 9, 2025. Leavitt, during a White House press briefing on Tuesday, railed against media outlets for their slow response in covering the fatal stabbing after it unfolded on Aug. 22. This monster should have been locked up, and Iryna should still be alive, but Democrat politicians, liberal judges, and weak prosecutors would rather virtue signal than lock up criminals and protect their communities," Leavitt said on Tuesday. "Perhaps most shamefully of all, the majority of the media, many outlets in this room, decided that her murder was not worth reporting on originally because it does not fit a preferred narrative."

(AP Photo/Laura Bargfeld) The Department of Homeland Security said in a news release that the officer was trying to arrest a man who had a history of reckless driving, but he refused officers' orders and instead drove his car at them. An ICE officer who was hit and dragged by the car felt his life was threatened and opened fire, the department said. “We are praying for the speedy recovery of our law enforcement officer. He followed his training, used appropriate force, and properly enforced the law to protect the public and law enforcement,” Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. JB Pritzker said he is aware of the shooting and demanded “a full, factual accounting of what's happened today to ensure transparency and accountability.” Video from the scene shows police tape and traffic cones blocking off parts of the street where a large food distribution truck and gray car can be seen from a distance. “These are outcomes that serve no public safety purpose and leave entire communities traumatized. When federal agents conduct unaccountable operations in our communities, everyone becomes less safe.” Chicagoans, meanwhile, have been preparing for weekend Mexican Independence Day celebrations that include parades, festivals, street parties and car caravans, despite the potential immigration crackdown. McLaughlin said that “viral social media videos and activists encouraging illegal aliens to resist law enforcement” have made the work of ICE officers more dangerous.</p>

Fox News' CB Cotton provides details on the identification of the suspect accused of killing Charlie Kirk in Utah Wednesday. A Secret Service employee was placed on immediate leave after celebrating Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk's assassination in a social media post, Fox News Digital confirmed. "The U.S. Secret Service will not tolerate behavior that violates our code of conduct. This employee was immediately put on administrative leave, and an investigation has begun," a U.S. Secret Service spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Friday afternoon when asked about the employment status of Anthony Pough. Pough had celebrated Kirk's shocking assassination in a Facebook post, which included accusing the slain conservative firebrand of spewing "racism." "If you are Mourning [sic] this guy .. delete me. Memorials honoring Charlie Kirk have been held across the country and overseas, including in Berlin. "Especially when we should be mourning the innocent children killed in Colorado," he continued, referring to the Evergreen High School shooting that left two students injured Wednesday. Real Clear Politics reported Pough was in "Phase 2" of his career with the agency but had not yet been assigned a detail regularly protecting President Donald Trump. The Secret Service has three phases for special agents, with Phase 2 focused on protective assignments and Phase 3 focused on "post-protective field, protection, or headquarters assignment," according to the Secret Service's website. Pough blamed "karma" for Kirk's assassination in the inflammatory Facebook post.

Marsha Blackburn called for the Secret Service employee's immediate termination in a letter to Secret Service Director Sean Curran on Thursday. "As our nation mourns the devastating loss of Charlie Kirk, a rogue @SecretService agent posted on Facebook suggesting that he deserved to be murdered. I am calling for this agent's immediate termination. Kirk was attending a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday afternoon when a single shot rang out and struck Kirk in the neck. Vice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance accompanied Kirk's casket back to Arizona, where he resided with his family, on Thursday via Air Force Two. Trump announced on Friday morning during an appearance on "Fox & Friends" that police had apprehended a suspect in the case. "We got him on the evening of Sept. 11," Utah Gov. "A family member of Tyler Robinson reached out to a family friend who contacted the Washington County Sheriff's Office with information that Robinson had confessed to them or implied that he had committed the incident."

Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., over a Substack appearance where she criticized conservative commentator Charlie Kirk following his assassination, with some calling for her to be removed from Congress. "Rep. Ilhan Omar (D) is now ATTACKING and SMEARING Charlie Kirk after he was assassinated," conservative influencer account LibsofTikTok posted on X Thursday. Red State writer Bonchie wrote on X, "Ilhan Omar going on with Mehdi Hasan so they can both mock Charlie Kirk and lie about his ‘actions' to justify his assassination is exactly what you'd expect." "Look at their grins," conservative influencer account End Wokeness posted on X. "Yeah I've had it with tolerance for evil," conservative influencer Robby Starbuck posted on X. "Expel Ilhan Omar from Congress and deport her to Somalia. She reportedly committed immigration fraud with her sham marriage to her brother so this shouldn't be hard to do. I have no tolerance left for this evil." Boebert added, "I understand that in Somalia, where you come from and would do well to go back to, this isn't a thing. In our county, having political disagreements with someone isn't a reason to justify their execution." Turning Point Executive Director Charlie Kirk speaks on stage ahead of a conversation during Turning Point Action's Chase the Vote campaign event (Rebecca Noble/AFP via Getty Images) Fox News Digital reached out to Omar's office for comment and was directed to a social media post from Omar saying she "disagreed with Charlie Kirk vehemently about his rhetoric" but does not "wish violence on anyone." "Right-wing accounts trying to spin a false story when I condemned his murder multiple times is fitting for their agenda to villainize the left to hide from the fact that Donald Trump gins up hate on a daily basis." Omar added that her heart "breaks" for those babies before getting into a conversation about Republicans criticizing violence from the left, calling it "disgusting" and then criticizing Kirk and making the comments that infuriated conservatives online. "But what I do know for sure is that Charlie Kirk was someone who once said, ‘Guns save lives' after a school shooting," Omar said. "Charlie was someone who was willing to debate and downplay the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police … downplay slavery and what Black people have gone through in this country by saying Juneteenth should never exist." Omar went on to lament that there are a "lot of people who are out there talking" about Kirk "just wanting to have a civil debate," prompting Hasan to interject and call it a "complete rewriting of history." Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., speaks during a news conference (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) "There is nothing more effed up than to completely pretend that his words and actions have not been recorded and in existence for the last decade or so." "And so, you know, these people are full of s---, and it's important for us to call them out, while we feel anger and sadness and have, you know, empathy, which Charlie said it shouldn't exist because that's a newly created word or something," Omar said. "Like, I have empathy for his kids and his wife and what they're going through because I do not want that. Hasan then claimed that the "politicizing is being done by the right" and referred to it as a "problem" that you can't say "anything negative" about someone when they die." "I'm happy to not say anything negative and let the family mourn, but it's when everyone else tries to kind of do a whitewashing of who that person was," Hasan continued as Omar nodded along. The X account for Zeteo News, founded by Hasan, wrote "this is a lie" in response to criticism over Omar's comments, noting that Omar reacted with "sadness" for Kirk's family. On Friday, authorities announced that they had arrested a suspect, 22-year-old Utah resident Tyler Robinson. President Trump called Kirk's murder a "dark moment" for the United States and ordered flags to be flown at half-staff until Sunday evening. Andrew Mark Miller is a reporter at Fox News.

CHICAGO (AP) — The Department of Homeland Security said an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer opened fire and killed a suspect in a Chicago suburb Friday after the suspect tried to evade arrest by driving his car at the officers and dragged one of them. The department said in a news release that the officer was trying to arrest a man, who had a history of reckless driving. One of the ICE officers was hit and dragged by the car. The department said the officer felt a threat to his life and opened fire. ICE said the officer and the subject were both taken to a local hospital where the suspect was pronounced dead. “We are praying for the speedy recovery of our law enforcement officer. He followed his training, used appropriate force, and properly enforced the law to protect the public and law enforcement,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement. ICE says the shooting happened in the Franklin Park suburb, about 18 miles west of Chicago. The shooting comes as ICE is a little less than a week into an immigration enforcement operation in Chicago that it has dubbed “Midway Blitz.” McLaughlin said, “viral social media videos and activists encouraging illegal aliens to resist law enforcement” have made the work of their officers more dangerous.</p>

Nate Amendola said the evidence against Brian Walshe is circumstantial, and he believes it will be tough for prosecutors to win the case without Ana Walshe's body. Brian Walshe, the Massachusetts man accused of dismembering his wife, was attacked in jail on Thursday, weeks ahead of his murder trial. The Norfolk County Sheriff's Office didn't identify Walshe as the victim, but his lawyer, Larry Tipton, confirmed to Masslive.com that Walshe was stabbed. Walshe was taken to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston for treatment and returned to the jail overnight, the sheriff's office said in a statement to Fox News Digital. Brian Walshe, accused of killing wife, Ana, who disappeared on New Year's Day 2023, enters the courtroom for his arraignment. He was attacked inside a Massachusetts jail this week. "The other individual involved was subdued by officers, and a makeshift blunt instrument was recovered," the statement said. Walshe is accused of killing and dismembering his wife, Ana, in January 2023. Ana Walshe, a mother of three young children and a real estate professional who worked in Washington, D.C., disappeared on New Year's Day 2023 and was reported missing a few days later.

Walker/The Boston Globe via AP, Pool; Obtained by Fox News Digital) Brian Walshe was captured on Home Depot surveillance video buying various items, including three mops and brushes, two splash-resistant goggles and a utility knife. Investigators believe he used the items to dispose of his wife's body. In the days after his wife's disappearance, Walshe allegedly used his son's iPad to make over a dozen Google searches about how to discard a body, prosecutors said. Before the disappearance, Walshe hired a private investigator because he suspected his wife was cheating on him. Brian Walshe sent a text message to a friend Jan. 2 saying he'd lost his phone one day after his wife, Ana Walshe, vanished. He had been under house arrest as part of his pre-sentencing probation for selling fake Andy Warhol paintings, according to prosecutors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Attorneys for Justin Baldoni said in a court filing that Taylor Swift agreed to be deposed in the ongoing civil litigation between “It Ends With Us” co-stars Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, but Swift's attorneys dispute that she ever agreed to sit for a deposition. (Swift's 12th studio album, “The Life of a Showgirl,” is set to be released on October 3.) But in a letter to the court in response, dated Friday and obtained by CNN, an attorney for Swift said she had not agreed to be deposed and would only do so if required by the court. “Since the inception of this matter we have consistently maintained that my client has no material role in this action,” an attorney for Swift wrote. “Further, my client did not agree to a deposition, but if she is forced into a deposition, we advised (after first hearing about the deposition just three days ago) that her schedule would accommodate the time required during the week of October 20 if the parties were able to work out their disputes,” Swift's filing states. In a separate court document, also dated Friday and obtained by CNN, Lively's attorneys suggested Baldoni's legal team was seeking media attention for the case by referencing Swift. “The Wayfarer Defendants have repeatedly sought to bring Ms. Swift into this litigation to fuel their relentless media strategy. In this latest effort, the Wayfarer Defendants assert—though, notably, without evidence—that Ms. Swift has supposedly ‘agreed' to sit for a deposition sometime between October 20-25,” the filing from Lively's legal team states. “The Wayfarer Defendants do not appear to have contacted Ms. Swift's counsel regarding a date or location about the deposition until earlier this week. In this respect, the Wayfarer Defendants' lack of diligence, and disrespect for Ms. CNN has reached out to Lively and Baldoni's representatives for additional comment, beyond their court filings. While Baldoni's suit against Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds was dismissed, Lively is still pursuing her claims of sexual harassment and retaliation against Baldoni. Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively's legal fight isn't over Swift – a longtime friend of Lively's – was first mentioned in connection to the dispute when text exchanges were revealed to include the name “Taylor” as part of Baldoni's since-dismissed countersuit. One of the text messages appeared to show an exchange between Baldoni and Lively about the script for a scene in “It Ends With Us”: “I really love what you did. “Taylor Swift never set foot on the set of this movie, she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions, she did not score the film, she never saw an edit or made any notes on the film, she did not even see ‘It Ends With Us' until weeks after its public release, and was traveling around the globe during 2023 and 2024,” a spokesperson for Swift said at the time. Given that her involvement was licensing a song for the film, which 19 other artists also did, this document subpoena is designed to use Taylor Swift's name to draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case,” the spokesperson added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump arrives at Yankee Stadium before a baseball game between the New York Yankees and the Detroit Tigers Thursday, Sept. 11, 2025, in New York. President Trump said he decided to send troops into Memphis after Union Pacific's CEO Jim Vena, who used to regularly visit the city when he served on the board of FedEx, urged him earlier this week to address crime in the city. Vena was in the Oval Office to pitch the benefits of Union Pacific's proposed $85 billion acquisition of Norfolk Southern, but Trump said he asked Vena's advice about where the administration should go next to “straighten out crime in the cities.” He said Vena told him Memphis would be good because FedEx wouldn't even let him walk one block in the city to his hotel and insisted he take an armored vehicle. President Donald Trump's administration must update its immigration website to reflect that 600,000 Venezuelans with temporary protected status are allowed to live and work in the U.S. after last week's court win, a judge ordered. Citizenship and Immigration Services website after plaintiffs' lawyers said temporary protected status holders were still in detention centers or unable to return to work even after his Sept. 5 judgment in favor of plaintiffs. Chen said on Thursday his Sept. 5 order in favor of TPS holders went into effect immediately. The government is appealing Chen's order that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had unlawfully canceled temporary protected status, or TPS, extensions granted by President Joe Biden's Democratic administration for 1.1 million Venezuelans and Haitians. Bessent will travel to Madrid this weekend for negotiations with his Chinese counterparts over tariffs and national security issues related to the ownership of social media platform TikTok. Bessent is slated to meet Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Madrid to discuss national security and economic issues, a Treasury news release states. The two governments have agreed to several 90-day pauses on a series of increasing reciprocal tariffs, staving off an all-out trade war. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent speaks in the Oval Office of the White House, Friday, Sept. 5, 2025, in Washington, during an event with President Donald Trump. “We just need to de-risk with certain, strategic industries, whether it's the rare earths, semiconductors, medicines, and we talked about what we could do together to get into balance within the relationship,” Bessent said at the time. The disaster declarations, announced Thursday, will provide federal funding to Kansas, North Carolina, North Dakota, and Wisconsin, as well as tribes in Montana and South Dakota. In most cases, it took Trump more than a month to approve the aid requests, continuing a trend of longer waits for disaster relief. An Associated Press analysis shows delays in approving federal disaster aid have grown over time. The White House says Trump is providing a more thorough review of requests. Karine Jean-Pierre took no questions as she entered the House complex for a closed door interview. Jean-Pierre served as former President Joe Biden's top spokesperson in the latter half of his term. House Republicans are investigating whether there was a “coverup” of Biden's mental state while in office. Vance is thanking Utah officials and the FBI for their efforts to track down a suspect in Charlie Kirk's killing. “This is a big breakthrough, and everyone who helped — from the law enforcement professionals to the people giving tips — deserves our credit and gratitude,” he wrote on X. President Trump's push to revitalize American manufacturing by luring foreign investment into the U.S. has run smack into one of his other priorities: cracking down on illegal immigration. Hardly a week after immigration authorities raided a sprawling Hyundai battery plant in Georgia, detained more than 300 South Korean workers and showed video of some of them shackled in chains, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung warned the country's other companies may be reluctant to take up Trump's invitation to pour money into the United States. If the U.S. can't promptly issue visas to the technicians and other skilled workers needed to launch plants, then “establishing a local factory in the United States will either come with severe disadvantages or become very difficult for our companies,” Lee said Thursday. “They should have a trial the following day,” Trump said on Fox News Channel. He said China, which is not a democracy, and some other countries have “quick trials.” Despite tensions between President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, notably over Israel's attack on Hamas leaders in Qatar, Rubio will arrive in Israel on Sunday for a two-day visit and is expected to travel to a controversial archeological site in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians claim for the capital of an eventual state. Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaks to reporters before boarding his plane at Homestead Air Reserve Base in Homestead, Fla., en route to Mexico City, Tuesday, Sept. 2, 2025. RICO, which refers to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, is usually used for organized crime. Soros' group, Open Society Foundations, has rejected these allegations before. Near the end of his Fox interview, Trump said he'd been holding a meeting about building a new White House ballroom when his aides interrupted. “I just told these people, “Get out, you gotta go.” The president once again treaded into the New York City mayoral race, saying he wanted to see a one-on-one race against Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani. “I call him my little communist,” Trump said in the interview on “Fox and Friends.” He acknowledged Mamdani's strong chances of victory but mused that “maybe one-on-one, somebody could beat him.” Zohran Mamdani speaks during a Democratic mayoral primary debate, Wednesday, June 4, 2025, in New York. “He wants cats to be in Gracie Mansion,” Trump said. He said that if former Presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln “came back from the dead and they wanted to go into the administration,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer wouldn't approve them. On the heels of a Thursday inflation report showing inflation increased to 2.9%, Trump is saying high prices aren't a problem and that the biggest risk to the economy would be a Supreme Court ruling that his emergency tariffs are illegal. “I've already solved inflation,” Trump said on “Fox & Friends” as he continued to verbally attack Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting the central bank's benchmark interest rates. Trump declared an emergency under a 1977 law to impose tariffs and courts have said he exceeded his legal authority by doing so, putting before the Supreme Court what Trump called “one of the most important cases in the history of our country.” He said Republicans will likely put together a continuing resolution to keep funding the federal government. Instead, he said, “we will get it through because the Republicans are sticking together.” However, Trump said, “it does take two to tango,” suggesting that it's been hard to get Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the same page for ending the war in Ukraine. When Fox hosts indicated Putin was to blame for prolonging the conflict, Trump attributed the problem to “tremendous hatred between him and Zelenskyy.” A campaign rally site for Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump is empty and littered with debris Saturday, July 13, 2024, in Butler, Pa. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) He named Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy and other presidents who were assassinated and said he went into politics aware of the danger. Trump was the target of two assassination attempts last year. “You have to go forward,” the president said when asked about appearances getting canceled after Kirk's assassination. Graphic video of the shooting in Utah has circulated widely online. The suspect in the Charlie Kirk assassination has been captured, President Trump said Friday in an announcement that appeared to represent a significant breakthrough in an investigation that captivated public attention and spanned nearly two days. Armed National Guard soldiers walk along Constitution Avenue in Washington during rush hour as part of President Donald Trump's order to impose federal law enforcement in the nation's capital, Tuesday, Aug. 26, 2025. Speculation had centered on Chicago as Trump's next city to send in the National Guard and other federal authorities. But the administration has faced fierce resistance from Illinois J.B. Pritzker and other local authorities.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Authorities revealed on Friday antifascist slogans and video game references were etched onto bullet casings from the gun the suspect used to kill Charlie Kirk. Spencer Cox (R-UT) named Utah resident Tyler Robinson, 22, as the suspect in the murder case during a press conference Friday morning. Officials said bullet casings with inscriptions reading “Hey fascist! Catch!” were found in a wooded area near the abandoned bolt-action rifle Robinson is accused of using to kill Kirk. Bella Ciao means “hello beautiful” in Italian. It was adopted as an anthem of the Italian antifascist resistance during World War II. Some have speculated it is a reference to the Iron Front logo used by antifa organizers. However, it is more likely connected to the controller code for a bomb air strike in the video game Helldivers, the subject of popular memes, according to other reports. The governor said investigators found other inscriptions on a fire casing that read “notices, bulges, OWO, what's this?” which appears to be a crude, sexually provocative reference. The investigators interviewed a family member of Robinson who said the suspect had “become more political in recent years” and talked about how they believed Kirk was “full of hate and spreading hate” during a recent conversation over a family dinner, according to the governor. “The family member referenced a recent incident in which Robinson came to dinner prior to Sept. 10, and in the conversation with another family member, Robinson mentioned Charlie Kirk was coming to UVU,” Cox added, referencing Utah Valley University, where Kirk, 31, was gunned down on Wednesday, leaving behind a wife and two young children. Robinson has registered as a nonpartisan voter in Utah, and his parents are registered Republicans, according to the Wall Street Journal. Despite previous speculation, there was no mention of him identifying as transgender. FBI Director Kash Patel on Friday said the investigation remains “ongoing” and praised Robinson's arrest as a “testament to the dedication of good law enforcement being great, and partnerships in law enforcement.” Cox made a rousing call for citizens to reject political violence and embrace good-faith debate, on which he said Kirk built his life and career as the co-founder of Turning Point USA, which conducted political outreach to youth on college campuses across the country. “Young people love Charlie, and young people hated Charlie, and Charlie went into those places anyway, and these are the words that have helped me,” the governor said. He said, ‘The weak can never forgive. There were vigils and prayers and people coming together to share the humanity,” he said. We can return violence with fire and violence, we can return hate with hate.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Authorities identified Tyler Robinson as Charlie Kirk‘s alleged assassin and charged him with murder, which carries the possibility of the death penalty. Spencer Cox (R-UT) said Friday morning following a 33-hour manhunt. The charges, announced Friday afternoon, include aggravated murder, felony discharge of a weapon causing serious bodily injury, and obstruction of justice, according to the Associated Press. Official release of the charges is expected next week. Authorities said Robinson had become increasingly political in recent months. At one point, he argued with family members about Kirk at the dinner table, saying he was “full of hate and spreading hate.” Robinson also mentioned Kirk was coming to Utah Valley University and objected to his presence on campus. Cox confirmed that Robinson engraved the bullet casings with antifascist messages, including “Hey fascist! Cox also described what appeared to be the three-arrow symbol, an antifascist sign made famous during street fights in Weimar Germany. The fired casings also referenced a nearly decade-old sexual meme, saying, “Notices bulge, OWO, what's this?” The last case was an example of similar trolling: “If you read this, you are gay LMAO.” Authorities confirmed that Robinson's roommate also assisted law enforcement by showing investigators Discord messages that included him and Robinson. These messages outlined what he did with the rifle used to murder Kirk. Cox said authorities don't have “any information that would lead to any additional arrests,” but the investigation is ongoing. Cox also said he gave no indication of having a mental illness. Robinson was booked at the Utah County Jail. He was a longtime resident of Washington County, Utah, roughly 250 miles away from the UVU campus. There were 7,000 leads sent to law enforcement Thursday evening. After they released additional footage of the suspect, 4,000 more leads were sent in. Is this the end of a dark chapter in our history or the beginning of a darker chapter in our history?” he asked. Kirk, the founder and CEO of Turning Point USA, was shot in the neck and killed while speaking at an event at UVU. Authorities said Robinson allegedly sniped Kirk from a position on top of the Sorensen Student Center, several hundred feet away from him, and then made a hasty retreat into a nearby neighborhood. On Thursday, police recovered the murder weapon: a high-powered, bolt-action rifle. The weapon was left in a wooded area, which has since been swept and secured. President Donald Trump broke the news of the shooter's arrest in an appearance on Fox News on Friday morning. “I think, with a high degree of certainty, we have him in custody. The incident has also sparked comments from nearly all Democratic and Republican lawmakers, though some Democrats focused on openly bashing Kirk or Trump's rhetoric in the aftermath.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amid the uncertainty surrounding eligibility for and access to the latest Covid-19 vaccine, a new study has found that a common nasal spray could help prevent infection. US death rate dropped back to pre-Covid levels in 2024, CDC report says What is azelastine, and do these study results mean we should start stocking up on this nasal spray? And, as coronavirus cases are once again rising, what precautions should people take to reduce their chances of infection? To help with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. Dr. Leana Wen: Azelastine nasal spray, also referred to as the brand names Astelin and Astepro, is an antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergies, including stuffy or runny nose, itching, and sneezing. Seasonal allergic rhinitis is what most people think of as hay fever — allergy symptoms that flare up at certain times of the year, usually in the spring, summer or fall, when pollen from trees, grasses or weeds is in the air. Perennial allergic rhinitis, on the other hand, causes symptoms year-round. A physician's prescription is required, though one brand name called Astepro Allergy can now be purchased over the counter at pharmacies. CNN: Why did researchers test this nasal spray to prevent respiratory illnesses? Another report suggested that this antihistamine reduced virus levels in nasal tissue. Because this nasal spray is widely available, researchers wanted to test it on human participants in a rigorous setting to see whether azelastine could, in fact, reduce coronavirus infection. If so, this medication could be an inexpensive way to boost protection. Newly approved antibody could offer another option for protecting infants from RSV, a common infection that can be deadly CNN: How was this new study performed, and what did it show? Wen: This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial involving 450 healthy adult volunteers in Germany, nearly all of whom (99.1%) had been vaccinated at least once with the Covid-19 vaccine. In one group, azelastine nasal spray was applied to each nostril three times a day for an average of 56 days. Participants were tested for Covid-19 infection twice a week by rapid antigen test. Researchers confirmed positive tests with laboratory polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, testing. Patients who tested positive for Covid-19 continued rapid antigen testing each day until the result was negative, so researchers could see how long the infection lasted. What's interesting is that the azelastine group was also less likely to contract other respiratory viruses. Participants in the azelastine group also reported an average of only 1.73 illness days compared with 2.75 days for those in the placebo group. In break with current CDC recommendations, leading pediatrics group recommends Covid-19 shots for young children Wen: I think this was a well-designed study that points to a protective effect of azelastine nasal spray against SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. The findings suggest that azelastine could be used as a preventive treatment against infection. As the authors noted, the percentage reduction in Covid-19 infection is on par with what has been seen for other preventive measures, such as being up-to-date on Covid vaccines. These results are especially encouraging since azelastine nasal spray is inexpensive and widely available — not to mention that it already has decades of safety data. These findings are an important first step and set the stage for other clinical trials to see whether azelastine can reliably reduce the risk of respiratory virus infections. CNN: Should people start using azelastine to prevent infections now? The FDA has not approved azelastine to prevent Covid-19 or any other infection. I certainly would not encourage people to use the spray instead of other preventive measures, such as vaccination and masking. These are the conditions that make you eligible for an updated Covid-19 vaccine CNN: Speaking of those other measures, what precautions should people consider as coronavirus cases are rising once again? If you must be in these settings though, consider wearing a well-fitting N95 mask or an equivalent. Finally, anyone experiencing respiratory symptoms should stay home to reduce the chance of spreading not only the coronavirus but also other respiratory viruses.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Army Secretary Dan Driscoll had only been in the job for a matter of days before he angered his new boss, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. Driscoll, an Army veteran and longtime personal friend of Vice President JD Vance, had been floating ideas to get Vance and President Donald Trump to visit the Pentagon — an event he believed would boost morale given the pomp and circumstance that accompanies any presidential visit. Trump was his boss, and Driscoll shouldn't have gone around him and made him look bad, Hegseth told the Army secretary upon learning of the plans. Hegseth's wariness of Driscoll is emblematic of his larger fixation with undermining or removing anyone he perceives as a threat to his public image and standing with Trump, regardless of their expertise or experience, a dozen current and former officials told CNN. “If Driscoll starts getting too prominent, or too favored, it makes it a lot easier politically to just let Hegseth go somehow or find an off-ramp,” one of the sources said. And Driscoll's name was increasingly brought up, including inside the White House, as a possible replacement for Hegseth after a series of high-profile missteps by the defense secretary in the spring — to Hegseth's great irritation, sources said. In April, following a series of leaks he believed made him look bad, Hegseth fired three senior Pentagon officials, two of whom were close friends that had worked with him for years, and publicly accused them of being leakers. Hegseth also threatened senior Pentagon officials, including then-acting Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Chris Grady, with polygraph tests and leak investigations. Hegseth refused to sign off on a promotion for 34-year Army veteran, Lt. Gen. Doug Sims, who had been serving as the director of the Joint Staff, because he believed he was leaking to undermine him and had been too close to retired Gen. Mark Milley, a fierce Trump critic, sources said. Grady and Sims both denied the accusations, which weren't proven, sources said. Then, in June, right-wing activist Laura Loomer, who sources told CNN has known Hegseth for more than a decade and speaks to him regularly, began attacking Driscoll on X, accusing him of cozying up to “Trump haters” because he had posted a photo on X with retired US Army officer and current Democratic member of Congress Eugene Vindman. “We got our assess handed to us” because of Loomer, a person familiar with the conversation recalled. Loomer launched a similar attack against Driscoll last month, and it took days for Hegseth's spokesperson, Kingsley Wilson, to publicly defend the Army secretary. Even when she did, Wilson made a point to note that Hegseth appreciates Loomer's “important work.” In a statement to CNN, Hegseth denied having any tension with Driscoll. “It's no surprise that people who know nothing about the strong dynamic between Army Secretary Driscoll and I are shoveling lies to CNN without putting their names to their statements,” Hegseth said. “As said before, I have complete & total confidence in Secretary Driscoll, and we will continue to work together to make our military lethal again. He is doing a fantastic job leading the U.S. Army, and we are fortunate to have his America First leadership.” Driscoll similarly told CNN in a statement that he is “honored” to serve under Hegseth and any suggestion to the contrary is “fake news.” “His support has been vital as we transform the Army. No amount of media spin will distract us from working together to defend the American people.” And Hegseth is still on edge about the forthcoming results of a DoD Inspector General investigation into his use of Signal to discuss classified information — the findings of which could be made public in the coming days. His priorities also strike some officials as especially misplaced given the various crises unfolding globally right now — from Israeli strikes on Qatar and Russian drone incursions into Poland to a possible US military confrontation with Venezuela. Trump signs executive order rebranding Pentagon as the Department of War “Being a good leader is about way more than just politics.” Privately, some Trump allies say Hegseth is aware of his own short-comings when it comes to navigating Pentagon bureaucracy and overseeing effective policy-making — which is why he has intentionally focused most his energy toward social media and more surface-level issues, leaving more substantive tasks to his top deputies. “He's not dumb,” one source familiar with Hegseth's management style said, adding that Trump's Defense Secretary prioritizes things he knows he can do, while largely deferring to more experienced officials when it comes to executing policy and combat decisions. For example, multiple officials and servicemembers praised a policy he unveiled over the summer aimed at cutting red tape and accelerating timelines for the military to produce thousands of low-cost drones. He also launched an interagency task force last month dedicated to developing and acquiring counter-drone technology — an initiative he put Driscoll in charge of. Other policies, however, appear to stem solely from Hegseth's own fear of leaks and have actually made people's jobs harder, the sources said. For example, as a way to prevent leaks, Hegseth's office implemented a new policy earlier this year requiring Pentagon officials across the services to sign non-disclosure agreements before being read in on projects, initiatives and other work products, according to a defense official and a copy of the agreement reviewed by CNN. It's a highly unusual requirement that the official said was never requested under previous administrations for day-to-day department operations, particularly for things that aren't classified. In addition to classified information, the NDA covers any material deemed “confidential, sensitive, for official use only, and controlled unclassified information,” and states that violating it could result in criminal prosecution. Congress, meanwhile, has virtually no engagement with Hegseth, Democratic and Republican congressional staffers told CNN, which has limited their ability to conduct oversight of the Pentagon. “When you fire enough people, purge enough expertise from the military, and just bully enough people into silence, you can get by with that for a while but eventually there may come a moment where the right people are gone, and there's nobody there to make the best decision to protect American lives or keep service members out of a dangerous situation that they didn't need to be in,” said one Senate aide. “It's exciting to break all these things and push the agenda, but there are consequences.” A recent, unprecedented US military strike on a boat the administration accused of carrying Venezuelan cartel members, for example, was not notified to lawmakers beforehand. Hegseth's focus on his own image is apparent in the ballooning number of public relations staff he has hired in recent months, officials said. He now has more than double the number of spokespeople his predecessor had, and their primary tasks appear to be posting on X in support of Hegseth, producing videos for him, and scanning social media for any signs of servicemembers being disloyal or out of step with the secretary's image for the department, officials said. Military and civilian officials across the services say they constantly feel like they are walking on eggshells because of a small army of “watchers” both inside Hegseth's office and on X, many of whom say openly they are looking for “wins” in getting people fired. The podcaster thanked Hegseth for taking action; the Army declined to answer questions on if she had been relieved, saying only that she is currently on active duty. Last week, the same podcaster posted about a Navy physician who had listed pronouns on her official LinkedIn page and described herself as a deputy medical director for transgender healthcare. Spears said in a lengthy post on X on Tuesday that his efforts are primarily about rooting out “transgender ideology” in the military, though posts shared by him and others have also focused on the military's former Covid-19 vaccine mandate, and broader diversity, equity and inclusion issues. “Privately, it's like, ‘Let's find every opportunity we can to pressure the Army. Hegseth, instead, wanted the Army to focus its public messaging on the troops' lethality and strength — and, ultimately, he decided they should be armed, too, because he thought they looked weak without weapons, the sources said. Many Guardsmen have since been tasked with DC “beautification” projects, like gardening and trash cleanup. Trump, for his part, has continued to stand behind Hegseth, who he believes has the right look to lead the “war department.” Trump likes Driscoll, sources said, but he isn't a full-throated culture warrior like Hegseth — a possible vulnerability in this administration.</p>

This week, the California State Assembly is set to vote on SB 53, a bill that would require transparency reports from the developers of highly powerful, “frontier” AI models. The models targeted represent the cutting-edge of AI — extremely adept generative systems that require massive amounts of data and computing power, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, xAI's Grok, and Anthropic's Claude. AI can offer tremendous benefits, but as the bill is meant to address, it's not without risks. And while there is no shortage of existing risks from issues like job displacement and bias, SB 53 focuses on possible “catastrophic risks” from AI. Such risks include AI-enabled biological weapons attacks and rogue systems carrying out cyberattacks or other criminal activity that could conceivably bring down critical infrastructure. Such catastrophic risks represent widespread disasters that could plausibly threaten human civilization at local, national, and global levels. They represent risks of the kind of AI-driven disasters that have not yet occurred, rather than already-realized, more personal harms like AI deepfakes. It's hard to define catastrophic risk in law when the definition is far from settled, but doing so can help us protect against both near- and long-term consequences. By itself, a single state bill focused on increased transparency will probably not be enough to prevent devastating cyberattacks and AI-enabled chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons. But the bill represents an effort to regulate this fast-moving technology before it outpaces our efforts at oversight. SB 32 is the third state-level bill to try to specifically focus on regulating AI's catastrophic risks, after California's SB 1047, which passed the legislature only to be vetoed by the governor — and New York's Responsible AI Safety and Education (RAISE) Act, which recently passed the New York legislature and is now awaiting Gov. SB 53, which was introduced by state Sen. Scott Wiener in February, requires frontier AI companies to develop safety frameworks that specifically detail how they approach catastrophic risk reduction. Before deploying their models, companies would have to publish safety and security reports. The bill also gives them 15 days to report “critical safety incidents” to the California Office of Emergency Services, and establishes whistleblower protections for employees who come forward about unsafe model deployment that contributes to catastrophic risk. Both cover large models that are trained at 10^26 FLOPS, a measurement of very significant computing power used in a variety of AI legislation as a threshold for significant risk, and both bills strengthen whistleblower protections. While SB 1047 aimed to hold companies liable for catastrophic harms caused by their AI systems, SB 53 formalizes sharing safety frameworks, which many frontier AI companies, including Anthropic, already do voluntarily. It focuses squarely on the heavy-hitters, with its rules applying only to companies that generate $500 million or more in gross revenue. “The science of how to make AI safe is rapidly evolving, and it's currently difficult for policymakers to write prescriptive technical rules for how companies should manage safety,” said Thomas Woodside, the co-founder of Secure AI Project, an advocacy group that aims to reduce extreme risks from AI and is a sponsor of the bill, over email. “This light touch policy prevents backsliding on commitments and encourages a race to the top rather than a race to the bottom.” Gavin Newsom vetoed SB 1047, he commissioned a working group focusing solely on frontier models. “I would guess, with roughly 75 percent confidence, that SB 53 will be signed into law by the end of September,” said Dean Ball — former White House AI policy adviser, vocal SB 1047 critic, and SB 53 supporter — to Transformer. But several industry organizations have rallied in opposition, arguing that additional compliance regulation would be expensive, given that AI companies should already be incentivized to avoid catastrophic harms. OpenAI has lobbied against it and technology trade group Chamber of Progress argues that the bill would require companies to file unnecessary paperwork and unnecessarily stifle innovation. “The bill, if passed, would feed California regulators truckloads of company information that they will use to design a compliance industrial complex.” By contrast, Anthropic enthusiastically endorsed the bill in its current state on Monday. “The question isn't whether we need AI governance – it's whether we develop it thoughtfully today or reactively tomorrow,” the company explained in a blog post. “SB 53 offers a solid path toward the former.” (Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that have signed partnership agreements with OpenAI, while Future Perfect is funded in part by the BEMC Foundation, whose major funder was also an early investor in Anthropic. “A federally led transparency approach is far, far, far preferable to the multi-state alternative,” where a patchwork of state regulations can conflict with each other, said Cato Institute technology policy fellow Matthew Mittelsteadt in an email. But “I love that the bill has a provision that would allow companies to defer to a future alternative federal standard.” “The natural question is whether a federal approach can even happen,” Mittelsteadt continued. It's been less than 3 years since ChatGPT was released. But in a time of federal gridlock, frontier AI advancements won't wait for Washington. The bill's focus on, and framing of, catastrophic risks is not without controversy. The hope is that if these doomsday scenarios are identified and prepared for, they can be prevented or at least mitigated. There are longtermists, people focused primarily on humanity's far future, who place a premium on things like multiplanetary expansion for human survival. They're often chiefly concerned by risks from rogue AI or extremely lethal pandemics. Neartermists are more preoccupied with existing risks, like climate change, mosquito vector-borne disease, or algorithmic bias. These camps can blend into one another — neartermists would also like to avoid getting hit by asteroids that could wipe out a city, and longtermists don't dismiss risks like climate change — and the best way to think of them is like two ends of a spectrum rather than a strict binary. AI safety focuses on catastrophic risks and potential existential threats. But, as Vox's Julia Longoria reported in the Good Robot series for Unexplainable, there are inter-personal conflicts leading these two factions to work against each other, much of which has to do with emphasis. (AI ethics people argue that catastrophic risk concerns over-hype AI capabilities and ignores its impact on vulnerable people right now, while AI safety people worry that if we focus too much on the present, we won't have ways to mitigate larger-scale problems down the line.) But behind the question of near versus long-term risks lies another one: what, exactly, constitutes a catastrophic risk? While the average person might consider, say, many people driven to suicide after interacting with AI chatbots to be catastrophic, such a risk is outside of the bill's scope. (The California State Assembly just passed a separate bill to regulate AI companion chatbots by preventing them from participating in discussions about suicidal ideation or sexually explicit material.) SB 53 focuses squarely on harms from “expert-level” frontier AI model assistance in developing or deploying chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons; committing crimes like cyberattacks or fraud; and “loss of control” scenarios where AIs go rogue, behaving deceptively to avoid being shut down and replicating themselves without human oversight. For example, an AI model could be used to guide the creation of a new deadly virus that infects millions and kneecaps the global economy. I think that's like a very serious set of issues that demands policymaker attention, but I don't think it's the core of what this bill is trying to address.” Transparency is helpful in preventing such catastrophes because it can help raise the alarm before things get out of hand, allowing AI developers to correct course. And in the event that such efforts fail to prevent a mass casualty incident, enhanced safety transparency can help law enforcement and the courts figure out what went wrong. The challenge there is that it can be difficult to determine how much a model is accountable for a specific outcome, Irene Solaiman, the chief policy officer at Hugging Face, a collaboration platform for AI developers, told me over email. “These risks are coming and we should be ready for them and have transparency into what the companies are doing,” said Adam Billen, the vice president of public policy at Encode, an organization that advocates for responsible AI leadership and safety. But right now, when those things aren't happening at a large scale, it makes sense to be sort of focused on transparency.” However, a transparency-focused bill like SB 53 is insufficient for addressing already-existing harms. When we already know something is a problem, the focus should be on mitigating it. “Maybe four years ago, if we had passed some sort of transparency legislation like SB 53 but focused on those harms, we might have had some warning signs and been able to intervene before the widespread harms to kids started happening,” Billen said. “We're trying to kind of correct that mistake on these problems and get some sort of forward-facing information about what's happening before things get crazy, basically.” SB 53 risks being both overly narrow and unclearly scoped. We have not yet faced these catastrophic harms from frontier AI models, and the most devastating risks might take us entirely by surprise. It's also certainly possible that models trained below 10^26 FLOPS, which aren't covered by SB 53, have the potential to cause catastrophic harm under the bill's definition. As it stands right now, SB 53 occupies a different niche from bills focused on regulating AI use in mental healthcare or data privacy, reflecting its authors' desire not to step on the toes of other legislation or bite off more than it can reasonably chew. But Chilson, the Abundance Institute's head of AI policy, is part of a camp that sees SB 53's focus on catastrophic harm as a “distraction” from the real near-term benefits and concerns, like AI's potential to accelerate the pace of scientific research or create nonconsensual deepfake imagery, respectively. “I do think some of the lines between these things in practice can be a bit blurry, and I think in some ways…that is not necessarily a bad thing,” he told me. It could be that the ideological debate around what qualifies as catastrophic risks, and whether that's worthy of our legislative attention, is just noise. If they're effective, forward-facing safety provisions designed to prevent mass casualty events will also make AI safer for individuals. If SB 53 passes the legislature and gets signed by Gov. Newsom into law, it could inspire other state attempts at AI regulation through a similar framework, and eventually encourage federal AI safety legislation to move forward.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? BROOKLYN, New York — When people imagine what nature looks like, this probably wouldn't be it. On an overcast afternoon in August, I stood next to a strip of plants between the sidewalk and the street in Central Brooklyn, no more than a block from a six-lane highway. Furry bumblebees hovered around clusters of shaggy white flowers. Iridescent flies appeared and then disappeared, like flecks of glitter briefly catching the light. And on the underside of a few leaves were the unmistakable pinhead-sized eggs of a monarch butterfly, which look like tiny lemon candies. Cities like New York are obviously not known for their wildlife. But if you know what to look for and take a moment to observe your surroundings, you can find interesting and even rare animal species everywhere. I recently learned, for example, that NYC has more than 200 species of native bees, including the Gotham sweat bee — a species that scientists first discovered in the city. In the summer and early fall, NYC is also home to a large number of monarch butterflies, America's most iconic bug. Their population has declined so much in recent decades that the Biden administration proposed listing them late last year under the Endangered Species Act, a powerful environmental law that's considered a last resort for species facing extinction. Yet in NYC, you can still find them all over — even in tiny patches of plants near a highway. This is a pretty strange situation: A species that may be federally protected in the same category as animals like sea turtles and manatees is fluttering around the largest and most densely populated city in the country. How are monarchs holding on in New York when they seem to be in such steep declines nationwide? And along the way, I learned something valuable — that helping wildlife is a lot easier than you might think. Monarchs aren't just nice to look at. Like many birds, whales, and caribou, monarchs migrate. They ride out winter clumped together on the trees, often in such great numbers that they cause the branches to droop. Their springtime behavior is even more remarkable: The butterflies migrate back north for the summer, but it takes them two to three generations to get there. Their offspring will complete the next leg, flying a bit further north. That happens again and again until the butterflies reach the northern US and parts of southern Canada, where they breed and their offspring start the process all over. All kinds of mysteries surround this process — including how tiny-brained insects coordinate an intergenerational relay race — but what's clear is that fewer butterflies are making it to Mexico. Each winter, scientists measure the number of acres occupied by monarchs in those fir trees. That's an area roughly equal to 16 American football fields. During this past winter, however, monarchs occupied just 4.4 acres. Milkweed once grew abundantly throughout the Midwest in places like Iowa and Kansas, the core breeding range for monarchs. Yet in recent decades, herbicides sprayed by farmers on corn and soybean fields, which blanket the region, destroyed an enormous number of milkweed plants. These chemicals — which farmers still use — also kill native wildflowers that provide food for adult monarchs, fueling their long migrations. While monarchs live complicated lives, their needs are fairly simple: milkweed plants for their larvae, or caterpillars, and pesticide-free wildflowers for the adults. “The average insect spends three-quarters of its life as a larva or an egg,” said David Lohman, an insect ecologist at the City University of New York. “The whole habitat for that part of the life for most insects, including monarchs, is a single plant.” If seeded with the right plants — specifically, with native plants, those that evolved here — even small spaces in cities can meet those needs. For example, the patch of plants I visited in Central Brooklyn, part of a community garden called Prospect Farm, was only four feet wide, but it had more than a dozen stems of common milkweed. It's hard to overstate the value of native plants, like milkweed or bee balm. “It's amazing that if I plant these plants, I'm automatically supporting pollinators or beneficial insects,” said Matthew Morrow, the head of horticulture at NYC's Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks), who says he's known within the agency as the native plant proselytizer. “Run that up the chain, and I'm supporting bird life and other things that feed on all of these creatures.” Native plants, meanwhile, tend to have a different look, appearing messier and sporting subtler flowers. As important as common milkweed is for monarchs and other insects, for example, it looks, as its name might suggest, a bit like a weed, especially when it's not flowering. For many years, scientists and environmental advocacy organizations have been trying to raise awareness about insect declines and the value of locally adapted plants. Those efforts are paying off: Gardeners in parks, suburbs, and city homes are now planting far more native plants. They're also becoming slightly more comfortable with a wild aesthetic, in some cases even leaving sticks and dead leaves around because they know insects nest in them. “My goal is to remove the invasives and to replant with native plants,” said Emily Stringer, a professional gardener at De Matti Park, a small green space in Staten Island. Native plants like mountain mint, a perennial with pale lavender flowers and mint-scented leaves, offer much more ecological value than some ornamentals, said Stringer, who works for NYC Parks. She's been transforming De Matti into a native plant refuge since the start of the pandemic, she told me, when I met her in the park on a hot August afternoon. During a brief walk through the park, I saw a dozen or so monarchs bouncing around the native flowers. Its wings moved so fast they were a blur, allowing it to hover. I later learned this was a hummingbird moth. This shift to native plants is happening in all kinds of spaces across the city, including big parks, small parks, community gardens, and backyards. I even met a guy who does what he calls “guerilla gardening” in northern Manhattan. He plants milkweed and other native plants in parks and tree wells, typically without explicit permission from city officials. It's these efforts that are helping sustain monarchs and other native bugs in New York. “Every little bit counts,” said Keith De Cesare, a guerrilla gardener who also describes himself as an educator, artist, and naturalist. A spokesperson told me that “guerrilla gardeners are often well-intentioned and deserve recognition,” but some of the species they plant might not be appropriate for the location. “Certain plants can grow too tall and obstruct sight lines, while others may fall over, creating potential slip and trip hazards,” the spokesperson told me.) On a sunny morning in late August, I visited Brooklyn Bridge Park, an 85-acre public landscape along the East River, which separates Manhattan from Brooklyn. It's one of my favorite spots in the city — a park near the Brooklyn Bridge built atop old shipping docks that looks onto downtown Manhattan. My first stop was a small field of wildflowers on Pier 6, not far from the water. I watched the animal — an accordion of black, white, and yellow — chew its way through a milkweed leaf, and then another. Brooklyn Bridge Park is entirely human-made and built over what was essentially an industrial wasteland. That ecosystem is rooted, unsurprisingly, in native plants: They've been a part of the park since it opened in 2010, and even more so now. During my visit, Evelyn Manlove, a horticulturist at the park, told me she chooses plants based in part on the insects they may attract, like milkweed for monarchs and curly everlasting, a perennial wildflower, for lady butterflies. On another afternoon, I traveled further north in Brooklyn to a small patch of prairie near the Williamsburg neighborhood. This space was once a cemetery for the US Navy. But long after it was decommissioned — the cemetery ran out of space and the Navy decided to close it and moved most but not all of the bodies to another cemetery — a nonprofit called Brooklyn Greenway Initiative turned it into a meadow. It's an oasis of sorts, filled with more than 100 native plant species including common milkweed, coneflowers, and asters. From within the prairie, now known as the Naval Cemetery Landscape, you can hear cars honking and engines revving, but also the trill of a common yellowthroat — a yellow and green warbler — or the high-pitched cheep of a cedar waxwing. “When the world overwhelms, we can find comfort in nature's resilience. It's essentially a guestbook for visitors, and part of a project led by another organization, called Nature Sacred, to study the effect of green spaces on human well-being. “Grateful for the softness and pause that nature provides us,” one person wrote. “When the world overwhelms, we can find comfort in nature's resilience. “I feel less alone surrounded by nature,” wrote another. “I can feel the trees whispering to each other. I don't understand them, but they make me feel included. It's not like New York is some kind of insect sanctuary. Some moths, meanwhile, have been shown, rather incredibly, to navigate with the stars. Research also makes it clear that cities alone can't save monarchs — rural areas, including agricultural lands, also need to play a role. Yet urban pockets of native plants clearly help. That's what I find so special about monarchs and other native bugs: It doesn't take much to support them. Bringing back California condors or coral reefs is not something that normal people can easily do, or know how to do. But we can all help conserve monarchs and myriad other animals by simply planting some native flowers. Kreussling's home is perhaps the best example of what one person can do for native insects in New York City. A garden of native plants envelops his home in bright yellows, purples, and pinks, turning it into a hotspot for native insects. “You can just see how much biodiversity there is.” As we walked around the garden, Kreussling, who helps run a local organization to conserve pollinators, pointed out what I would normally miss. Leaves with perfectly round holes made by leaf-cutter bees (the bees build nest cavities with the pieces). I was struck by the simple realization that this whole tangled world of life is invisible until you pay attention. Kreussling told me that sometimes people ask him what he does about insect damage on his plants. As we searched for critters, a monarch flew by and landed on a plant called ironweed, which has small purple flowers shaped like pom-poms. I hustled over to watch it feed as Kreussling continued looking for less obvious critters. Some scientists call monarchs the pandas of the insect world: They draw a lot of attention, and often overshadow less charismatic species. That attention, however, is valuable, said Emily Erickson, an urban ecologist and monarch expert. It can inspire people to care about the natural world, she said, and the lesser-known and less charming creatures that inhabit it. While reporting this story, I learned about an organization called Monarch Watch that runs a butterfly tagging program to help monitor the monarch migration. The group sells tiny, lightweight stickers — the tags, each printed with a unique ID — designed to adhere to monarch wings. And each fall, volunteers around the country apply those stickers to monarchs as they're traveling south. On an August evening, I went to Central Park and found a monarch egg on a common milkweed leaf. By morning, the egg had hatched into a caterpillar. When the caterpillar got too big for its exoskeleton, it'd wiggle out of it, eat the remains, and form a new one — a zero-waste bug! The caterpillar chewed through milkweed leaves so quickly that it became hard to keep its crucial food supply stocked. (Let's just say there might be a few leaves and branches missing from milkweed plants in my neighborhood.) It was like a theatrical costume change: Within minutes, the caterpillar had unzipped its old skin, revealing the emerald green chrysalis underneath. We — even my bug-unfriendly partner — were surprisingly excited. Her wings were missing two dots normally found on males, suggesting she was a female. I delicately picked her up and carefully placed the sticker, which has a strong, pressure-sensitive adhesive, on her wings. We then carried her to a nearby park, hiked to a field of native wildflowers, and let her go. She's just one butterfly, and her chance of making it to Mexico is slim. A large portion of monarchs die along the way from car strikes, storms, and a lack of pesticide-free flowers from here to Central Mexico, underscoring the point that conserving migratory species can't just happen in one place. Still, it's pretty remarkable that her journey begins here, in the nation's largest city.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What is the greatest threat to American democracy? At the time of writing, it is not clear who pulled the trigger or why, so let me start somewhere else, with the removal of Britain's slippery and sybaritic ambassador to Washington, Peter Mandelson. No one disputes the authenticity of the Mandelson messages, yet we're supposed to believe that similar messages from President Donald Trump were forged. “Look, sir, I've got a great compilation of birthday greetings for you.” “Great, make sure I write to thank them all.” “Yeah, but not Trump, his is a fake.” Still, it is strikingly hard to find anyone who has complained about both Mandelson and Trump, despite the allegations against the two men being pretty much identical. Sure, Trump might argue that he ended the relationship earlier than Mandelson. Equally, Mandelson, who is gay, might argue that he at least is above suspicion when it comes to Epstein's worst crimes. Yet the rule of law and representative government depend on our being able to resist that programming. In our very online age, resisting it is hard. Which brings us to the horrible murder of a young man who held no public office and was simply touring the country, inviting people to disagree with him. On the Left, there was some hideous victim-blaming. Perhaps now, the activists declared, these conservatives would understand why their violent rhetoric was so dangerous. Others pointed, in a tone that stopped just short of sneering, to Kirk's own statement that homicides were a price worth paying for the Second Amendment. On the Right, people actively sought out a handful of TikTok accounts in which young people celebrated, or at least were presented as celebrating, Kirk's murder. Those children were then presented as “the Left” and held up as what “we” have to “fight.” The fact that former Presidents Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and other public figures put out sober condolence statements was glossed over. Or, rather, it was missed altogether, because all American citizens with access to the internet were being fed by algorithms designed to make them mad. Political assassinations are not new in the United States — Kirk had a point about the price to be paid for loose gun laws — but, until recently, it was taken for granted that everyone was uncomplicatedly against violence. The Spanish Civil War was sparked by two assassinations. By the time their funerals were held — clenched fists for Castillo, straight arms for Calvo Sotelo — the slide into armed conflict was inevitable. Spain in the early 1930s had been marked by increasingly authoritarian attitudes. Each began to see the other as a menace. Rightists dismissed their opponents as godless, un-Spanish, in the pay of foreign communists. Leftists dismissed theirs as an oligarchic clique that stood against the people. In the face of such monstrous threats, who cared about election results?</p>
