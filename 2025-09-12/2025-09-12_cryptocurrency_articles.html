                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Today Tether unveiled its planned USAT stablecoin, an onshore digital currency that aims to be compliant with the GENIUS Act. Tether's main stablecoin has a market capitalization of $169 billion, but the current makeup of its reserves would not comply with the new legislation. For example, some of Tether's reserves are in Bitcoin, gold and commercial loans. It was previously announced that Hines was joining Tether following his White House departure, but not that his role would be CEO of the US subsidiary. This shuffling of positions could add fuel to the ongoing ethical objections by Democrats, which risk is a distraction that risks delaying legislation for crypto market infrastructure. Beyond the political implications, Tether faces practical challenges in establishing credibility for USAT. The onshore Tether ideally needs to have a different team to the current one,  given Tether's previous infractions. Tether notoriously made mis-statements about the backing of its stablecoin when it lent a substantial proportion of its reserves to a sister company with a hole in its balance sheet. Since that period, Tether has become enormously profitable, earning $13 billion in 2024. To help with shortcutting the legal process, USAT will not issue the coin itself, but will partner with Anchorage, the first, and currently only, national digital asset trust bank, although several other applications for a trust charters are now in progress.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Think of them as a bridge – they let traditional investors dip their toes into crypto through regular brokerage accounts, with no wallet required. That helped push BTC from around $40,000 all the way past $70,000 by March. Spot ETH ETFs came next, and they're still seeing capital flowing in. Now everyone's trying to figure out which cryptos will be next. Traders are betting big on Solana and Dogecoin, pushing both tokens higher as ETF rumors heat up. We've seen double-digit gains in just the past week for both coins. Bitcoin Hyper has become the talk of crypto Twitter lately, with investors calling it a potential Layer-2 breakthrough that could outrun both SOL and DOGE. Is this the best altcoin to buy in September? SOL is up 6% in the past 24 hours and 15% this week, pushing its market cap over $128 billion. The token's rally makes sense when you look at what's happening with ETF approvals. Major players like VanEck, Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, and Grayscale have recently updated their S-1 filings. If that happens, Solana could be staring down its biggest wave of capital inflows to date. The SEC extended Franklin Templeton's filing to November 14 – that's the maximum delay they're allowed, which suggests we're getting close to final decisions. Dogecoin finally broke through the stubborn $0.25 resistance level, and it's now trading around $0.259. The coin's up 4% in 24 hours and nearly 19% this week, with over $4 billion worth of DOGE changing hands in the past day alone. Optimism around the REX-Osprey DOGE ETF is what's driving this rally. Smart money has been positioning for this ETF to go live – whale wallets have expanded by 22%, with 2 billion DOGE added in August alone. With infrastructure like this in place, Dogecoin looks ready to attract serious institutional flows for the first time. Some traders believe we could see DOGE's price react like BTC and ETH's did when their ETFs went live. That suggests Dogecoin may be on the verge of another breakout. Its presale is adding around $150,000 every day, with total funding standing at $15.2 million. That kind of momentum tells you how excited investors are. Its Layer-2 network is anchored to Bitcoin for security and final settlement, but runs applications at Solana-like speeds using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Developers can basically copy-and-paste their Solana-based apps with minimal tweaks while tapping into Bitcoin's huge liquidity pool. Investors are excited about the potential of this new Layer-2. Right now, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012895 in presale. With millions raised, institutional-style interest building, and a design that could completely change how people use Bitcoin, Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself as potentially the next altcoin to explode this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Solana's SOL rallied above $239 on Friday, extending its sharp September gains, as Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz described the blockchain as “tailor-made” for global financial markets and analyst Ali Martinez charted a potential path to $1,314. In his chart, Martinez marked $1,314.41 as the main technical target, using Fibonacci retracement levels to project Solana's upside. Novogratz, speaking on CNBC's "Squawk Box" Thursday, laid out a sweeping bull case for Solana and crypto more broadly. He began by pointing to treasury companies tied to both ETH and SOL, which he said are raising billions of dollars and bringing “lots of energy and money” into the digital asset ecosystem. But his most detailed remarks focused on Solana and the changing regulatory landscape. Novogratz said U.S. SEC Chair Paul Atkins has made clear that he wants all markets to move on-chain, citing a speech earlier in the week where Atkins declared, “On-chain capital markets and agentic finance are on the horizon, and the world is watching.” On the technology side, Novogratz emphasized Solana's raw capacity, saying the blockchain can handle 14 billion transactions per day — enough, in his words, “to process all the transactions in equities, fixed income, commodities and foreign exchange combined.” He went on to call Solana a blockchain that is "tailor-made" for financial markets. Adding it up — scalable infrastructure, a pro-blockchain regulatory stance and billions in new institutional inflows — Novogratz concluded that “this is the season of SOL,” a moment when Solana is positioned to take a leading role as capital markets shift on-chain.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Esports Firm's Stock Price Doubles After Bitcoin, Ethereum Treasury Investment Allied Gaming & Entertainment, a Nasdaq-listed esports and gaming company, announced that it has invested in Bitcoin and Ethereum as part of a new “corporate treasury management strategy.” Decrypt reached out to confirm the details, but did not immediately receive a response. “Integrating blockchain and digital assets into our ecosystem is a natural progression of our vision to connect people through gaming, entertainment, and innovative financial technologies.” It owns and operates the HyperX Esports Arena, a 650-person capacity venue in Las Vegas that has hosted events like the 2019 League of Legends All-Stars match, as well as an event for Ethereum-based card battler Parallel just last year. Since then, the stock has been on a gradual downward grind. Future initiatives for the esports company will include allowing for crypto payments, creating tokenization models for IP monetization, as well as integrating stablecoins and utility tokens within the “company's digital ecosystem,” the release said. It first started with Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy, now just Strategy, which pivoted from being a business intelligence software company to focus on acquiring Bitcoin. It now holds 638,460 BTC, or $73.6 billion worth of Bitcoin, and Saylor says it could acquire as much as 7% of the total supply. Strategy's raging success in the markets since its crypto pivot has led many others to follow suit. Notably, SharpLink Gaming and BitMine Immersion Technologies have emerged as the leading Ethereum treasury companies, with BMNR holding $9.4 billion worth of ETH and SBET amassing $3.8 billion of ETH, per data from Strategic ETH Reserve—totalling 2.4% of the Ethereum supply between them. Crypto treasury companies also exist for Elon Musk's favorite meme coin Dogecoin, Solana meme coin BONK, and altcoins Solana, XRP, and Sui. However, SharpLink Gaming's co-CEO, Joseph Chalom, told Decrypt last week “absolutely not.” Rather, he said, the Ethereum treasury push will be a positive “white swan” event by educating institutional investors about the cryptocurrency.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Thursday, Figure Technology (FIGR, Financials) rose 44% in its first day on Nasdaq, giving the blockchain lender a market value of $7.62 billion. Figure and its backers made $787.5 million by selling 31.5 million shares, which opened at $44, far higher than the IPO price of $25. The offering price was higher than the company's new range of $20 to $22, showing that investors were interested during what has become the biggest week for U.S. IPOs since 2021. Mike Cagney, who co-founded SoFi Technologies before starting Figure in 2018, has put the company at the crossroads of housing finance and blockchain. Cagney says that 10 of the top 20 U.S. mortgage companies now use its Provenance blockchain to process and verify loans. David Chao, an early investor in DCM Ventures, noted that more than 20 big banks are already using Provenance. The strong start comes after a number of successful IPOs from companies tied to cryptocurrencies, even as corporations that own a lot of digital assets have had their stock prices drop sharply. Cagney claimed that Figure's business model is based on lending and infrastructure, not treasury speculation. He also said that the long-term potential for blockchain lies in financial applications. As the IPO market opens up again, investors will be keeping an eye on Figure's first earnings report as a public business to see how loan growth and Provenance adoption are doing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For years, crypto traders have waited for the elusive altcoin season – a period when coins other than Bitcoin deliver the market's strongest returns. Recent data suggest the next cycle may already be underway; but with shifting market structures, regulatory uncertainty, and volatile liquidity dynamics, traders will need to tread carefully. If fewer than 25% outperform, the market is in Bitcoin season. The Altcoin Season Index offers a quantitative way to cut through hype. It smooths returns across a rolling 90-day window, avoiding the noise of day-to-day volatility. In practice, though, it tends to lag behind sentiment shifts; altcoin rallies often begin before the index confirms them. The past two months have seen notable movement. In August, the Altcoin Season Index jumped from 39 to 58. Ethereum ($ETH) has closed the gap with Bitcoin, holding strong above $4K; it currently trades at $4.5K with a $500B market cap. Meme coins also haven't been left behind; the total meme coin market cap is up 8% over the month. Institutional flows, political shifts, and macroeconomic conditions all play a role. But, as always with crypto, sentiment plays a huge role. It's a strangely uncertain-but-confident market, worried about inflation and macroeconomic pressures but still eagerly looking for the next big thing. That's where these three projects come in. The presale flew past $15M earlier in the week as investors realized just how much potential $HYPER has. Check out our price prediction, which shows that the token could go from its current $0.012905 to $0.32, a 2000%+ increase. Visit the Bitcoin Hyper presale page to learn more. The latest boost came from Forward Industries' massive $1.65B private placement to further its $SOL acquisitions. Solana treasuries have a key advantage over their Bitcoin counterparts: yield generation. The Snorter Bot gives traders a critical advantage when it comes to the wild-and-woolly world of Solana meme coins. No more guessing at which tokens could make big moves – and no more wondering how to find the next big thing. Deploy Snorter to sniff out the low-cap meme coin gems before they make it to major exchanges. With the $SNORT token, traders get even lower rates on Snorter Bot trades and cheaper swaps. It's a meme coin trader's best friend. Will it evolve into a full-blown altcoin season – and how high will $HYPER, $SOL, and $SNORT go if it does? For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Christie's has ended their romance with NFTs and Digital Art by closing their dedicated digital art department, a unit set up in 2022 with great fanfare at the height of the NFT boom. Sales will continue, but folded into the broader twentieth- and twenty-first-century categories. Vice president and head of digital art sales, Nicole Sale Giles, departed the New York–based team in August, while sales manager Sebastian Sanchez will remain as a specialist within the restructured framework. The position of digital art coordinator Anna Roszak has yet to be clarified. The decision leaves questions about Christie's annual Art+Tech Summit, a flagship event launched in 2018. Christie's has played a high-profile role in legitimising digital practice within the art market. In 2018, it startled the industry by selling Obvious's AI-generated portrait Le Comte de Belamy for $432,500—forty times its estimate. Then, in 2021, Beeple's Everydays: The First 5000 Days* sold for $69.3 million, propelling NFTs into headlines and drawing a new cohort of collectors. Christie's 3.0 subsequently hosted auctions with artists including Tyler Hobbs, Sasha Stiles, and the Ethiopian collective Yatreda, while museums such as MoMA acquired key NFT (Digital Editions) works. British artist Robert Alice, whose Portraits of a Mind became the first blockchain-based work to be auctioned by a major house, described Christie's role as “pioneering.” He credits the company with having taken an early leap of faith at a moment when digital art was far from accepted. Yet despite these milestones, the commercial returns of Christie's digital arm have been modest. Since its launch, the platform has held eleven auctions, averaging just seventeen lots apiece, none surpassing $400,000 in total sales. Even this year's Augmented Intelligence sale, which featured high-profile names such as Refik Anadol and Holly Herndon, fell short of expectations and provoked debate about the value of AI-driven art. The NFT sector has endured a steep contraction since its 2021 peak, with speculative buyers retreating and Ethereum prices failing to buoy sales figures. In this context, Christie's retreat is unsurprising: what once appeared to be the future of the art market now demands rethinking. Reaction from the digital art community has been mixed. Some artists expressed disappointment, seeing the closure as a step back after years of hard-won validation. Others view it more positively—as a sign that digital art no longer requires its own silo, and that collectors increasingly expect to encounter it alongside painting, sculpture, and photography. Dealer and curator Sofia Garcia suggests Christie's withdrawal might encourage a subtler, more integrated approach from auction houses. The resulting body of work, more than five thousand separate digital drawings and compositions, eventually coalesced into Everydays: The First 5000 Days. Minted as an NFT and sold in a single-lot auction, the work fetched $69.3 million, a figure that stunned even seasoned observers of the market.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Students are behind a whopping 57% of personal data breaches in schools. Kids in the UK aren't just sneaking extra snacks into their backpacks. According to the country's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), students are behind a whopping 57% of personal data breaches in schools. About a third came down to kids either guessing super obvious passwords or stumbling across login details teachers had left lying around. Turns out Post-it notes are the real enemy of cybersecurity. That's not to say the students didn't occasionally flex some actual hacker cred. In one example, three Year 11 students managed to crack into a school's information system by brute-forcing passwords and bypassing security protocols. Two of them even admitted to hanging out on a hacking forum, because nothing says “future cybercriminal” like swapping tips online between homework assignments. The ICO's report reads less like a dry government memo and more like a cautionary tale: today it's dares, rivalries, and revenge. About a quarter stemmed from teachers letting students borrow their devices, 20% came from staff mixing personal and professional devices, and another 17% happened because of sloppy access controls on platforms like SharePoint. Basically, weak security gave students an open invitation to snoop around. Because while students might think hacking into the system is just a bit of fun, regulators are quick to point out it's also a bit illegal. Is the real problem student curiosity, or are schools simply not taking basic security measures seriously enough to protect sensitive data?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fraudsters are already using multiple schemes to exploit Russia's new digital ruble, well in advance of its full-scale implementation, scheduled to begin next September. Fraudsters are usually very quick to take advantage of new financial systems and technologies, and Russia's central bank digital currency (CBDC) is no exception. As soon as its wider adoption begins, crooks will adapt, employing social engineering, interface forgery and user manipulation, according to Vladimir Chernov, analyst at the Freedom Finance Global brokerage. Speaking to the Russian daily Izvestia, he elaborated: “The main focus will not be on hacking the technology, but on psychological pressure, for example, calls allegedly made by bank employees, fake applications or links, suggested transfers to a ‘safe account'.” Fraudsters are now offering potential victims to convert their regular money into digital currency at a favorable exchange rate, for example, while the digital ruble hasn't yet entered mass circulation. They are also trying to convince citizens that transferring their savings from their bank account to a digital ruble wallet is mandatory. Another scheme involves a phone call from a criminal who presents themselves as an employee of the Federal Tax Service (FNS), informing the victim of a tax evasion fine that needs to be paid only with digital rubles, added Andrey Barkhota, an independent expert. The design of the digital ruble, as a platform fully controlled by the state, allows all transactions to be permanently recorded and makes it easier to identify fraud-related flows, explained Vladimir Chernov. Russian banks will have to compensate their clients for damages caused by fraudsters, Aksakov also emphasized. While tracking a digital ruble transfer should not be hard, getting the money back from the recipient will still be a difficult task, according to Alexey Lukatsky, an information security consultant at the Moscow-based cybersecurity firm Positive Technologies. At the same time, a mechanism allowing banks to recover digital rubles they have already sent to fraudsters will most likely be in place in 2027 – 2028 at the earliest, Chernov expects. Fraudsters stole 6.3 billion rubles (nearly $75 million) from Russians in the second quarter of this year, according to the CBR. New legislation introduced to combat such crime has been criticized for undercutting crypto use and trading in the country. Risk Warning: Trading may result in the loss of your entire capital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Newswise — With the rapid development of digital technology, the application of blockchain in construction engineering and management (CEM) is gradually expanding. To address this issue, Liupengfei WU, Weisheng LU, Louis CHU, and Chen CHEN have jointly conducted a research entitled "Visualizing blockchain in construction projects: Status quo, challenges, and a guideline for implementation". This study aims to provide a set of guidelines for visualizing blockchain-based DMP in CEM. First, a conceptual model was proposed to guide the research design. Then, 49 cases published in scholarly papers were reviewed, revealing that dashboards are increasingly used to visualize blockchain-based DMP. The research also demonstrated and assessed the guidelines in a real case of a high-rise residential building project in Hong Kong that adopts modular integrated construction, verifying the effectiveness of the guidelines in enhancing users' trust in blockchain systems and promoting the application of blockchain in CEM. The paper "Visualizing blockchain in construction projects: Status quo, challenges, and a guideline for implementation" is authored by Liupengfei WU, Weisheng LU, Louis CHU, and Chen CHEN.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have recorded their highest weekly inflows since July after conceding ground to Ethereum funds, which have finally cooled off from a period of record-level activity. As per SoSoValue data, Bitcoin ETFs tallied $552.78 million  in daily total net inflows on Sept. 11, bringing the weekly total to a square $1.7 billion. It marks day four of an inflow streak that began with modest figures. On Sept. 10, Bitcoin funds charted $757.14 million in daily net inflows, a two-month high. From mid-July up until the end of August, Ethereum ETF dominance and mixed macroeconomic signals in the U.S. saw investors move away from BTC. However, with anticipation of positive news from the U.S. Federal Reserve this month, as well as news that leading BTC ETF fund issuer, BlackRock, is considering tokenizing its many ETF offerings, institutional attention has returned to the premier crypto, for now. Bitcoin's price has responded well to this upward momentum and is trading up 2.22% for the past 7 days at $115,001. As per SoSoValue, Ethereum ETFs recorded $113.12 million  in daily total net inflows on Sept. 11, marking day four of a modest inflow streak that now totals $328.82 million. After a historical 5-month inflow streak that garnered over $11 billion, funds have finally cooled off. September's figures are currently running red, with $555.6 million in monthly total net outflows so far.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some of the biggest gainers today as HASH, IP, and PUMP. Bitcoin's price took a sharp turn for the worse yesterday when it was rejected at $113,000 and pushed south by over two grand. However, the bulls are making a return as of press time. Most of the larger-cap alts are quite sluggish on a daily scale, but many of the mid and lower caps are exploding. However, it was rejected immediately and driven south by over three grand in less than an hour. They initiated another leg up on Wednesday morning, which drove BTC to almost $113,000 as of press time. This is all you need not to miss any price action in the raging crypto markets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The meme coin project that lets you mine actual meme coins, PepeNode (PEPENODE), has hit the $1 million mark in its ICO. PepeNode gives users the ability to mine tokens like Pepe (PEPE), Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), and more with its mine-to-earn concept, which is a first for a meme coin. And unlike most presales, PepeNode gives buyers a way to participate early by staking their allocations and earning an enhanced rewards multiplier that will boost their mining power once the full system launches. That means early buyers don't just hold tokens and wait; they can actually use the project before the native token PEPENODE officially goes live. Right now, entry is at $0.0010533 per token – though in 30 hours, that window closes and the price climbs. The most well-known example of meme coin mining is Dogecoin (DOGE), which runs on proof-of-work. That means buying expensive rigs and paying high electricity costs, only to be outpaced by massive firms with far greater hashpower. Other meme coins built on chains like Ethereum or Solana aren't mineable at all since both rely on proof-of-stake. In those cases, “earning” usually just means staking tokens for yield – no rigs involved, but also no interaction beyond locking tokens away. Instead, it blends both worlds with the first virtual mine-to-earn system in crypto. Investors can design their own mining setup inside a gamified dashboard, and the way they configure it directly impacts their rewards. Here's how it works: users buy Miner Nodes with PEPENODE tokens, each node carrying its own properties. Nodes can be combined and upgraded to increase hashpower, and every upgrade triggers a 70% burn of the tokens used, which reduces the token's total supply. In a typical presale, investors secure allocations but then sit idle for weeks or even months before tokens and associated utility arrive – a lull that kills momentum and often drags prices down after exchange listings. By staking presale tokens now, buyers earn a dynamic 1,349% APY while also activating a rewards multiplier that carries over into the mine-to-earn system when it launches. Tiered node rewards further amplify early participation, giving those who join earliest the highest mining rates. Presale buyers may also gain access to bonuses post-TGE, including rewards in meme coins like PEPE and FARTCOIN, adding another incentive layer on top of staking yields. As mentioned, every time tokens are spent to upgrade a virtual mining setup, the burning mechanism is triggered, which permanently removes them from circulation. The difference here, however, is scale because while ETH burns a fraction of each transaction, PepeNode wipes out 70% of tokens used in upgrades, creating much more impactful deflationary pressure. With only 210 billion PEPENODE minted, each node purchase or facility upgrade compounds the scarcity. No surprise then that Jacob Crypto Bury, one of crypto's better-known influencers, is already calling for a 10x run on PEPENODE. Buyers can connect with the wallet of their choice, such as Best Wallet – a WalletConnect-certified platform widely recognized as one of the best crypto and Bitcoin wallets in the space. PepeNode is already listed on Best Wallet's Upcoming Tokens screening tool, making it easy to buy, track, and claim directly in-app once the project goes live. On top of that, the project's smart contract has been fully audited by Coinsult, giving early adopters added confidence in the code's security.

Maxi Doge was built to reclaim what DOGE has lost over the years – the wild fun of watching value surge, communities pile in, and even billionaire Elon Musk preaching about DOGE like a wild meme coin prophet. PUMP, the native token of Pump.fun meme coin generator, has been on a meteoric rise, soaring over 7% in the past 24 hours with a 38% increase in trading volume. In the last 24 hours alone, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) has raised more than $200,000 in its presale, pushing total funding past $15 million.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It found that more than half of all insider cyberattacks are caused by students and almost a third of these are caused by students guessing weak passwords or finding them written down on paper. Students were responsible for 97 percent of all attacks caused by stolen log in details. The ICO says that of the 215 incidents it analyzed, 23 percent were caused by poor data protection practices such as devices being left unattended, or students being given access to staff devices. Only five percent of incidents were caused by insiders using sophisticated techniques to bypass security and network controls. The ICO highlighted the example of a school in which three Year 11 students were caught unlawfully accessing its information management system. Another student was caught unlawfully accessing a school's information management system by using a staff member's login in an incident that was reported to the police, the ICO and Action Fraud. “Whilst education settings are experiencing large numbers of cyber attacks, there is still growing evidence that ‘insider threat' is poorly understood, largely unremedied, and can lead to future risk of harm and criminality,” warns Heather Toomey, Principal Cyber Specialist at the ICO.
