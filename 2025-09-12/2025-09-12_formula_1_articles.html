                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From Benetton's racing story to collaborations with Armani and Nike, Formula 1 has long intersected with fashion — blending style, culture and creating renowned brand partnerships. With LVMH becoming a Global Partner in 2025 under a historic 10-year agreement, it is clear that the sport's love for fashion – and fashion's love for the sport – continues to grow. Fashion, however, has always been part of Formula 1's identity. From luxury labels to sportswear brands, collaborations with teams and drivers have helped define the sport's DNA. From Italian label Benetton boldly stepping up as a full team owner in the 1980s, to Lewis Hamilton turning heads in designer looks at the Met Gala, fashion has long had a front-row seat in Formula 1. Hungry for more, Benetton partnered with Alfa Romeo in 1984, then took the unprecedented step of buying the struggling Toleman team in 1985. Just a year later, the Benetton family had its very own F1 constructor, already celebrating victory at the Mexican Grand Prix in its debut season. Before selling to Renault in 2000, Benetton had already shown that a fashion house could go far beyond sponsorship – much like Red Bull would later do with an energy drink. He had just joined Ferrari after winning two titles with Benetton, and Nike, fresh from revolutionising basketball with Michael Jordan, decided it was time to enter Formula 1. The partnership lasted until 2002, with Nike supplying Schumacher's custom racing boots. It became a collector's item, bringing sneaker culture into Formula 1 like never before. Michael Schumacher presents the Nike Air Zoom Schu Long before Jannik Sinner officially became a “Friend of F1” in 2024, the Italian tennis and leisurewear brand Sergio Tacchini had already made its mark. Known for minimalist tailoring that redefined menswear and womenswear in the 1980s, Armani carried that same vision into Formula 1 by announcing a multi-year partnership with Ferrari in 2021. Tailored Armani suits for Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz became a fixture at gala dinners, sponsor events and official appearances – a collaboration reflecting two brands united by their obsession with quality, precision and Italian elegance. Although known today for one of F1's most iconic partnerships – with Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes – it actually began with Lotus. From 1991 to 1994, Tommy Hilfiger put his branding on the teams' car, later partnering with the Scuderia to provide official teamwear until 2001. After a hiatus, the brand returned in 2018 as Mercedes' apparel partner and launching the hugely popular Tommy x Lewis collections. The British champion has consistently made headlines with daring arrival looks at the paddock in what became known to his fashion-forward fans as “Hamilton's Fashion Week.” Hamilton's presence in the worldwide fashion conversation amplified Tommy Hilfiger's visibility far beyond branded uniforms – it turned the collaboration into a cultural conversation. Now an Official Partner of F1 ACADEMY, Tommy Hilfiger has extended its footprint with distinctive livery designs and collaborations with driver Alba Larsen for the 2025 season. Having attended the Met Gala seven times since his debut in 2015, Hamilton's influence extended far beyond being a guest. In 2025, he helped shape the theme “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” which he honoured with an acclaimed look by British designer Grace Wales Bonner, rich in symbolism and storytelling. From brand launches on the grid to appearances at Fashion Weeks – such as New York Fashion Week, where Mercedes played a role not only through Tommy Hilfiger but also as a former title sponsor – the presence is clear.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first ever F1 ACADEMY rookie test is set to take place on September 17-18. F1 ACADEMY has today announced that, following substantial global interest, 18 female drivers – all eligible to compete in 2026 – have been carefully selected to take part in the series' first ever rookie test on September 17-18 at Circuito de Navarra. Taking place alongside official testing, the rookie test has been designed to ensure that the best talent, from an ever-increasing global talent pool of female drivers, is selected to compete in F1 ACADEMY. On the first day, participants will be immersed within an F1 ACADEMY team during an official test day, where they will observe briefing and engineering sessions. They will also participate in research-led physical and cognitive assessments delivered by the series' Official Driver Performance & Research Partner, More than Equal, to support their individual development and progression. The assessments, delivered by More Than Equal, will provide drivers with detailed insights into their performance, including strength, cognition, and endurance, and identify individual areas for growth while contributing to a wider evidence base on female driver performance. “With this test, we are providing 18 of the most promising talents with an equitable platform for them to demonstrate that they deserve a seat on an F1 ACADEMY grid.” “Change demands meaningful action, and our mission is to create a clearer, more accessible pipeline that breaks down barriers, and creates a pathway for the most talented to succeed.” Tom Stanton, CEO, More than Equal, added: “Supporting F1 ACADEMY in delivering important physical and cognitive assessments at this rookie test reflects our shared mission to ensure that the most talented female drivers are given the tools, data, and opportunities they need to succeed. “By combining research-led insights with real track experience, we are not only helping individual drivers unlock their potential but also building the knowledge base required to strengthen the entire pipeline of female talent in motorsport.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fernando Alonso has shared the untold story behind what he believes to be his best drive in Formula 1 up to this point, picking out an “anonymous” performance at the Malaysian Grand Prix a decade-and-a-half ago. Alonso is the most experienced driver on the F1 grid, having made his debut back in 2001 and racked up 417 starts so far – scoring more than 2,300 points, 106 podium finishes, 32 wins, 22 pole positions and two world titles as of the 2025 Italian Grand Prix. However, rather than any of those successes topping his list of greatest races across that period, the 44-year-old Spaniard would go back to the early-2010s and a particularly challenging Sunday afternoon with Ferrari. Speaking in an interview with Maaden, a partner of his current team Aston Martin, Alonso instead made reference to the 2010 Malaysian Grand Prix, where race-long gearbox and clutch issues blighted his efforts to recover from 19th on the grid (following a shock Q1 exit amid changeable weather conditions). “There are many races that people were not maybe aware of,” said Alonso, reasoning why he did not choose one of his legendary wins, such as the 2012 European Grand Prix in Valencia, which saw him charge from 11th to the top step of the podium. “It was Malaysia, Sepang [in 2010], where I had a problem on the gearshift. “Out of desperation, I tried to blip the throttle on a downshift, because if not I would retire the car in that lap. An engine failure a couple of laps from the chequered flag left Alonso 13th in the overall classification, without a point to his name, but even today he takes great pride from the performance he was able to deliver while managing so many issues. “The engineers said [after the race], ‘I don't know [how] you came [up] with that solution that fast, because that could be a solution, but you did it like in 13 or 14 seconds, the second corner after you had a problem',” added Alonso. “[It was] completely anonymous, no one will remember that race, but the level of energy that I had to put [into] that race, the level of concentration, focus, and [to] instinctively come out with a solution [to] a problem that was never tested or experienced… I think it was quite a race to remember.”</p>
