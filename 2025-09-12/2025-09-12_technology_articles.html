                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In recent years there's been a mini tech boom over in Bellevue, Wash., the city just east of Seattle that has attracted companies and talent — including a massive Amazon expansion that will bring 25,000 employees to the Eastside. Harrell touted Seattle's diversity, arts, music, restaurants, and innovative history — while throwing a friendly jab at his rival across Lake Washington. Answering a question from Bloomberg reporter Anna Edgerton, Harrell said Seattle has its “own unique history that we play to for employees.” Speaking to GeekWire last year, Bellevue Mayor Lynne Robinson said the city didn't have an interest in policies like Seattle's payroll tax. Harrell didn't mention tax policy in his remarks on Thursday. The mayor has supported a proposal to increase Seattle's business & occupation tax, which is already higher than Bellevue's rate. Both cities have taken a hit to their commercial real estate markets since the pandemic. Seattle's downtown vacancy rate topped 30% in the second quarter, according to Kidder Mathews. The two cities will become more connected, literally, via public transit — with a new light rail line expected to open early next year. Harrell's comments came as he unveiled the Seattle's new AI policy and plan, part of a broader push to establish the city as a national leader in artificial intelligence. “We are trying to be very intentional about positioning Seattle as a national leader in responsible artificial intelligence implementation,” Harrell said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The round was led by O1 Advisors, a venture capital firm co-founded by Dick Costolo and Adam Bain, the former CEO and COO of Twitter. After Meta invested $14 billion in Scale AI and hired its CEO, AI labs including OpenAI and Google said they planned to cut ties with the startup, presumably over concerns that their research could end up in Meta's hands. (Scale AI denies that it shares confidential information with Meta as part of its partnership). However, AI labs still need these data services, and startups like Micro1 aim to pick up the slack. Micro1 CEO Ali Ansari — who is just 24 years old — tells TechCrunch that his company has been working with leading AI labs, including Microsoft, as well as several Fortune 100 companies. However, Micro1's growth and adoption among AI labs seems to be growing at a healthy rate. “Really the only way models are now learning is through net new human data. Micro1 is at the core of providing that data to all frontier labs, while moving at speeds I've never seen before,” Bain said in a statement to TechCrunch. It's become a crucial service that companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Google need to build cutting edge AI models. Scale AI was first to dominate this space, with the initial insight that it could pay relatively little for low-skilled contractors around the world to help label data for AI model training. However, Ansari says that the demands of AI labs have shifted in recent years, and that companies now need high-quality data labeling from domain experts — such as senior software engineers, doctors, and professional writers — to improve their AI models. This led Micro1 to build its AI recruiter, Zara, which interviews and vets candidates who apply to work as one of company's contractors, or as Ansari calls them, experts. The market for AI training data appears to be changing yet again. Now, many AI labs are interested in working with startups to develop “environments” — virtual workspaces that can be used to train AI agents on simulated tasks. Ansari says Micro1 is building new offerings in the environments space to meet this demand. Luckily for startups like Micro1, AI labs seem to be working with multiple training data providers. The nature of the business is such that it's difficult for any one company to handle all of one AI lab's data needs. That means there's plenty of business to go around, at least, for now.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anthropic's recent $1.5 billion settlement could open the floodgates for more publishers to sue AI companies over how they use copyrighted content. Filed on Wednesday in a New York federal court, the complaint accuses the buzzy AI startup of infringing Britannica's copyright and trademark rights and claims its answer engine is cutting into the publisher's revenue. Perplexity, founded in 2022, dubs itself as an “AI-powered Swiss Army knife for information discovery and curiosity.” The company recently made headlines in August when it made a $34.5 billion bid to buy Google's Chrome browser. Perplexity is known for its answer engine, which pulls data from across the web and delivers quick, easy-to-read summaries to users' questions. Britannica says those summaries often lift its content verbatim without permission, diverting readers who might otherwise visit its sites, traffic the company relies on for subscriptions and ad dollars. “Perplexity claims to be the ‘world's first answer engine,' but the answers they provide to consumers are often Britannica's answers,” Britannica Group CEO Jorge Cauz said in a press release. However, this new lawsuit lands just weeks after Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle claims it used millions of pirated books to train its Claude chatbot, signaling that lawsuits from publishers could result in a big payout. Since the rise of AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude, publishers have pushed to make tech firms pay for the use of their content. OpenAI, for example, is still battling a 2023 lawsuit from The New York Times, even as it and Google have struck licensing deals with outlets such as News Corp and Reddit, respectively, to avoid more clashes. Perplexity itself announced in August that it would soon start sharing some of its revenue with publishers whose news articles are used to answer user questions. Britannica's complaint says Perplexity scraped its sites, copied and republished articles without permission, and even attributed AI-generated hallucinated answers that could damage the brand's reputation. Britannica argues these actions violate both copyright and trademark law. Additionally, Britannica says that it can create content thanks to the money it makes through subscriptions and advertising revenue. It accuses Perplexity's answer engine of free riding on these investments by “cannibalizing traffic” to its sites. The company is seeking unspecified monetary damages and a court order barring further use of its content. Perplexity did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Gizmodo.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We're thrilled to announce that Ankit Gupta is joining YC as our newest General Partner. Ankit has already worked with dozens of YC founders as a visiting partner in recent batches. He has a rare blend of deep machine learning expertise and firsthand startup experience that make him an ideal mentor for founders building at the bleeding edge of AI. Though he'll frequently commute to SF, Ankit will primarily be based out of Cambridge, Massachusetts — re-establishing a YC foothold at the site of our original office! Ankit's YC journey began in the Winter 2018 batch, when he co-founded Reverie Labs, a biotech company applying machine learning to drug discovery. The team at Reverie developed machine learning models for small-molecule design, partnered with pharmaceutical companies, and advanced their own medicines before eventually being acquired by Ginkgo Bioworks in 2024. It's that blend of research and founder experience that makes Ankit uniquely equipped to help the next generation of AI startups succeed. We are super excited to have him and are certain his expertise will continue to support YC founders at every stage. Previously, he was the co-founder & Managing Partner of Initialized Capital. Before that, he co-founded Posterous (YC S08) which was acquired by Twitter.</p>

An air combat sim enthusiast just built a “realistic” fighter jet cockpit that goes way beyond simulating motion. However, the video shows a different username, so we're unsure if this is accurate. Nevertheless, the sim rig is quite impressive, even though it doesn't look anywhere near a real fighter jet. While it can't fully mimic the 360-degree motion you'd get while doing aerobatics in an aircraft, it's still way ahead of just sitting stationary on the floor. They also added an “Energy Management System” that accepts a container that seemingly serves as the fuel tank for the chair's afterburner. When you push the throttle to its limits, two nozzles on the lower left and right of the seat spew flames, like how a real jet would do so when going to max power. Naturally, there's also what looks to be a pneumatic cannon that flashes whenever the pilot fires the in-game gun, and a rocket pod that shoots fireworks when launching missiles. This is quite an effort for one session, especially as you can imagine that all of these must be reloaded after every use. There were also a few people saying that there's only one display, and that it isn't mounted directly on the chair, so the player cannot see the display when they're pulling up. Nevertheless, this could just be an initial concept, just like how the tank sim rig was first built with separate physical controls spread around in a room. It would've also been nice to use realistic aircraft control panels instead of the custom-made ones we see in the video.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Day job: Co-founder and CEO of DevHub, a Seattle startup whose platform is used by big brands and/or their agencies to build websites and landing pages. Out-of-office passion: Michael isn't a big sports guy who fills time by watching football all weekend. And right before the pandemic he started taking piano lessons. So about three years ago he had his first recital in her back yard. The event featured 43-year-old Michael and a bunch of little kids. He took singing lessons with the same teacher and recently hosted a performance for about 80 people in Seattle. On Sept. 26 he's going to do it again, on the other side of the country in Kennebunkport, Maine, a vacation destination he grew to love with his wife. He calls the upcoming concert — to which he has seriously invited former President George W. Bush — a mix of Dean Martin and '80s synth sounds. Most rewarding aspect of this pursuit: Michael admits to feeling full of anxiety and being “insanely uncomfortable” during a performance, but pushing through feels like finishing a race or something else you've been working hard on. The lessons he brings back to work: Michael said playing the piano creates a level of focus that serves him well at DevHub. Getting ahead of himself can be an issue in his music. Work brings everything back to reality, and helps him focus on “the thing.” “What am I going to do, work by myself through the weekend? Am I going to stalk people on LinkedIn?” he laughed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mastodon, an open source, decentralized alternative to X, is rolling out a somewhat controversial feature by adding quote posts, which will launch next week. The feature, which allows a user to quote someone else's post and reshare it with their own response or commentary, has contributed to a culture of “dunking” on X, where users often deride other people by responding with snark or insulting humor. To address this concern, Mastodon says it's implementing quote posts with safety controls. Mastodon gives users several ways to control how their posts can be quoted. Here, you can set the permissions for who can quote you by choosing between “Anyone,” “Followers only,” or “Just me.” Additionally, you can control the visibility of quote posts by setting them to be visible to the public, to followers only, or a setting called “quiet public,” which makes the quotes public but removes them from Mastodon's search, trends, and public timeline. Users will also be able to override their default settings on a post-by-post basis, if need be, by navigating to the “Visibility and interaction settings” within the composer screen. This would be useful if you know you're about to say something controversial or anything that could attract unwanted attention from those with opposing views, for instance. From this location, users can change the quote settings to address any future quoting of their post going forward. They can also block users to prevent them from seeing and quoting their posts in the future. It will then become available in Mastodon's 4.5 software update. Because the fediverse, or open social web, is a network of servers running different software, quote posts may not immediately appear everywhere, and some platforms may not update to use the technical specification enabling quote post support right away.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following the massive success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which made more than $1.3 billion worldwide in 2023, animation studio Illumination and Nintendo are releasing a sequel, The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, in April 2026. Nintendo dropped a teaser trailer during its Direct presentation on Friday. Mario dozes in a field before title credits appear, that's about it. But the trailer still signifies that Nintendo will continue to churn out films aimed at turning Mario into a megafranchise. In the four decades since that game's release, Mario—and Luigi, Princess Peach, Bowser, and other assorted characters—have become cultural icons. In 1993, Super Mario Bros. became one of the earliest videogame film adaptations. It was panned by critics and fans, but in the years since, games ranging from Mortal Kombat to Tomb Raider have been turned into movies. Alongside the news, Nintendo also announced it will release remastered versions of Super Mario Galaxy and its sequel on October 2.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When the social norm hardens around "don't charge what it's worth, charge what you can get" this is the result. I once asked a hospital billing agent how they could justify a $10k ER bill for 4 hours of waiting and 1 hour treatment, and they responded, "How much is your life worth? Germany has a major doctor shortage and it can't just attract foreign doctors like Anglo countries due to language requirements. This issue will continue to get worse as the population ages. Just seeing my GP takes weeks, and he's overwhelmed. I kind of panicked, thinking it was potentially skin cancer. I live in one of the largest metro areas in the US, tons of doctors, should be a breeze to get it checked out.I load up the find a doctor website on my insurance company's website. There's like 30 dermatologists within an hour or so drive from me, awesome. Next year, when I might have quickly growing skin cancer?Luckily when I finally talked to my wife about it, she reminded me she had poked my arm with a permanent marker. I still make sure to keep my dermatologist appointments, just so I don't have to deal with the new patient issues and the "we're not taking anyone new these days".I had a different issue with extreme nystagmus come upon me. Bedridden for days, I couldn't even open my eyes without having extreme vertigo. Luckily a friend who works with ENTs managed to get a doctor to see me but if it wasn't for that I probably would have just had to suffer at home with no answers as to what was happening.I now know that unless I'm practically about to die, seeing a doctor that will do more than run extremely basic labs and very basic healthcare is weeks away in the US even if you have decent insurance.

I remember getting a total cost estimate from the hospital when my second child was born, anywhere from $20k to $160k before insurance, please sign here.

We can't even scale out broadband to the entire US. Now that I'm in BC, Canada, it is very similar. If I need some sort of treatment that hospital doesn't offer, they can immediately refer me to the correct hospital. For emergency cases the provincial ambulance service will transport you to another hospital by road or air at no cost.There are still independent specialists and doctors outside of the hospital system, but they have access to the same records systems and the billing is so seamless that I suspect that most people don't realize it is happening since it never involves the patient outside of providing your ID.

German public health insurances are concerned right now about their unusually  high deficits. Because many millions refugees are not working they only get paid a reduced amount towards the mandatory health insurance but have the same full service. German has a well-deserved reputation for being difficult to learn. I'm pretty good at learning languages but German is extremely difficult to speak properly unless you are raised in it. Even with an active infection, that could have cost her her jaw or her life if it had been left unchecked, it took months to get anyone to even make an appointment for an initial consultation. We were very fortunate that the oral surgeon we were finally able to talk to was able to fit her in for surgery within a short time after that, due to a cancellation.People talk dismissively about the "long wait times" you get with some public healthcare systems, but always oh-so-conveniently ignore the fact that there are long wait times here too. Sometimes catastrophically so.Almost universally, when you dig into it, the "long wait times" that exist in those systems fall into one of two categories: either they are wait times for elective procedures, where your long-term health is not at risk, or they are caused by shortages that are symptoms of unrelated problems.

I have never heard of an insurance policy in the US that allows you to consume as much, and whatever type of healthcare that you want. You have to justify any visit to a specialist before going, you don't get to choose the specialist, many times the insurer will simply deny a payment request for care already received. On many plans, you have to spend 5 figures per year before they will even cover anything.I would love to have had healthcare in America where I was insulated fully from the costs of care. My experience was that it was rare to see a doctor where I wouldn't end p paying at least three figures despite having fantastic insurance.Meanwhile in Canada, I can recklessly visit three doctors per day for the same issue at no out of pocket cost if I want, and it will still cost my insurer (the province of BC, in my case) less than a single doctor visit 60 miles south of here.From where I sit, the US, which has an unusually high exposure to the real costs of healthcare among peer states, also has the highest cost of healthcare. That sort of goes directly against what you are saying My experience was that it was rare to see a doctor where I wouldn't end p paying at least three figures despite having fantastic insurance.Meanwhile in Canada, I can recklessly visit three doctors per day for the same issue at no out of pocket cost if I want, and it will still cost my insurer (the province of BC, in my case) less than a single doctor visit 60 miles south of here.From where I sit, the US, which has an unusually high exposure to the real costs of healthcare among peer states, also has the highest cost of healthcare.

I work for a FAANG, and have a low 2k/year max out of pocket for in-network, which is almost everything I encounter. The only thing I've been denied for is Botox for TMJ which they say is not medically proven (seems to be the opposite, but I understand why they're wary).I've never had a medication, procedure, or doctor visit denied.

Will they cover the full cost of all name brand drugs after your deductible is spent? Mind you, your extreme outlier reality is one that is essentially never experienced by >95% of people, and it still has constraints. When I was a kid, everyone no matter economic level had pretty much the same pediatric doctor group. Now the working class people around me don't really have a pediatrician, but an overworked 'nurse practitioner'. Even your doctor has no idea -- try asking sometime! I routinely point out to my primary care doctor that the medicine/test/whatever they're recommending is expensive and low-quality, and he looks at me like I'm an alien. Statistically, I am.You're not wrong that you can get caught in a circle of hell after you get the bill, and that insurers are an opaque barrier to purchase decisions, but that's just saying the same thing a different way -- you have no ability to shop for what should be a commodity service.> I have never heard of an insurance policy in the US that allows you to consume as much, and whatever type of healthcare that you want....and that's one of the few good things about our system, though I agree that the US implementation is maximally stupid. While I agree that insurance companies suck, it's telling that the debate around this issue has devolved to indignation that someone should be acting to control costs by limiting the freedom to choose expensive things.

"I'm honestly not sure what you're trying to argue. I'm honestly not sure what you're trying to argue. Thus, the "knowing costs drops spending" theory doesn't hold up. Well, as long as you're just making stuff up, I don't see how I can possibly argue with you.Actually, I do: "Paying the bill you get, after the fact" is not at all the same thing as "comparison shopping". So if you want to call that system price transparency, then all I can do is shrug and walk away. So if you want to call that system price transparency, then all I can do is shrug and walk away. I mean, go visit any Reddit thread discussing an American healthcare explanation of benefits bill.

Again, people on high-deductible plans know very intimately how much everything is costing them. You have no idea, because there is no price transparency.You obviously know this is true, or you wouldn't have used the words "likely to cost". Americans know intimately that doctors visits are going to hit them in the pocketbook. Knowing "this is gonna cost me, ooof" does not seem to have any impact on the costliness of the system. There's no way the cost difference (often literally 10x+) in private healthcare with the US can be explained by anything other than "US prices are actually total bullshit". It's also weird to think that someone with a rare, degenerative illness should have to evaluate whether their quality or length of life is "worth" the money that a specific specialist will cost.This isn't cosmetic surgery comparison shopping. But all countries do that cost-benefit analysis all the time.Not every procedure or medication will be administered to the patient, even when those procedures and medications have been approved for use in a particular country.

Except...you absolutely should, and it isn't weird at all. [1] You can make it more complex and human, of course: most medical interventions not only cost money, but also carry serious risks.

But, whoever decided to start marketing things like low deductibles and out-of-pocket costs as a premium service, that person bears a lot of blame. They are the one that decided customers shouldn't see most of their healthcare costs.The ideal that actually lets customers see pricing info is: a health savings account, a high-deductible insurance with no cap, and then as a cost savings measure the insurance company can incentivize yearly check-ups.Mixing in employer insurance also caused a skew, because it makes people see their employer insurance as a perk. Employers should dump money into your HSA, and subsidize a gym/healthy snacks for their campus instead (some do, of course). Employers should dump money into your HSA, and subsidize a gym/healthy snacks for their campus instead (some do, of course). Employers should dump money into your HSA, and subsidize a gym/healthy snacks for their campus instead (some do, of course). The whole point of insurance is to cover tail cases: Catastrophic costs with low probability. If there is no cap, why have insurance at all? At what point in your story were you able to comparison shop for a cheaper option? Take away the insurance, I doubt my total cost would've been lower, even accounting for my insurance premiums and whatever my employer pays as part of that.There's a market here, I would prefer it were more regulated, not less. A less regulated market would make it easier for prices to change at random. There's a market here, I would prefer it were more regulated, not less. A less regulated market would make it easier for prices to change at random. There are certainly acute situations that are unpredictable -- go to the ER with a gunshot wound, and nobody can tell you what it's going to cost. They just don't tell you.There's no fundamental reason you couldn't have been quoted an accurate price in the scenario you described. They just don't tell you.There's no fundamental reason you couldn't have been quoted an accurate price in the scenario you described. I received an itemized bill with the exact cost and what would be covered listed, then it changed after the fact. Even absent insurance this would be true, complications happen. Most people in the US never see a doctor outside of emergency care because it's too expensive to do so. Price shopping doesn't do shit for the majority because the people that do get healthcare get it from their job and don't have a choice anyways which doctors they can see or not. The alternative is, if you don't incentivize someone financially to spend a decade studying medicine, they won't or they will immigrate to somewhere where they can.This is what my SO did when leaving Vietnam - her med school tuition was around $6k/yr in a country where median household incomes are $2-3k per year (and more like $1.5k for her parents, being tenant farmers) and she'd end up working for $700-800/mo working 70 hour weeks and best case $2k/mo in 5-7 years. Unsurprisingly, she chose to leave just like the rest of her peers, because you can't even buy a house in a tier 4 city in Vietnam without spending $100k anymore, let alone a HCMC or Hanoi where the jobs are actually located.Similar story for my cousin in India as well - he's attending a T5 AIIMS and is looking at 10 years of medical education (an MBBS doesn't cut it in 2025 anymore - you need an MD as well now) in order to get a $15k starting salary, but he is also lucky that his parents are both doctors. If he was not from that background he would have probably attempted the USMLE as well and leave.Both India and Vietnam are seeing a significant medical exodus, as is the UK, South Korea, and other countries where this kind of penny pinching sentiment is rife.HNers harp about layoffs and offshoring, but seem to only care about stagnating wages for themselves in high wage industries with no barriers to entry, relatively chill work cultures, and no risk of legal liablity.What do you guys want?

People already have plenty of incentive to become doctors. Medical schools collude to limit the number of medical students each year (under the guise of preventing having "too many" doctors). Medical schools have ridiculous selection criteria, like picking the candidates who earned an "A" in physics instead of a "B", or who came from a rich enough family that they could perform many hours of volunteer community work (mostly because the low quotas make it otherwise impossible to select candidates without literally rolling dice).You know what? There isn't enough incentive to become a tech worker. We should limit how many people can study CS each year with strict quotas. There isn't enough incentive to become a tech worker. We should limit how many people can study CS each year with strict quotas. I mean, people in the US pay $250k+ tuition, median income $65k/year, work $35k/year for a while, and eventually make something like that $250k/year. A house in many US markets is $300-500k.It's pretty much the same balance between each item, just more zeroes on the end of each number. You cannot compare the poverty or material condition between the two.Personal access to tap water, personal bathrooms, not having to pay a bribe to get ID, public services, school meals, public schools the actually have some sort of services, and other stuff Americans take for granted are not available to the vast majority of Vietnamese, Indians, and others in the developing world.My SO literally had to pay a $5k bribe/speed money to get her diploma from her university otherwise she'd have to work as an unlicensed doctor for 2 years.The rent for an illegal 1 bedroom hovel in D3 in Saigon with a tap water connection and personal bathroom goes for $250-550/mo - that's literally the monthly wage for most residents in SaigonYou really cannot compare even the worst life in the US with the life the silent majority faces in developing countries Personal access to tap water, personal bathrooms, not having to pay a bribe to get ID, public services, school meals, public schools the actually have some sort of services, and other stuff Americans take for granted are not available to the vast majority of Vietnamese, Indians, and others in the developing world.My SO literally had to pay a $5k bribe/speed money to get her diploma from her university otherwise she'd have to work as an unlicensed doctor for 2 years.The rent for an illegal 1 bedroom hovel in D3 in Saigon with a tap water connection and personal bathroom goes for $250-550/mo - that's literally the monthly wage for most residents in SaigonYou really cannot compare even the worst life in the US with the life the silent majority faces in developing countries My SO literally had to pay a $5k bribe/speed money to get her diploma from her university otherwise she'd have to work as an unlicensed doctor for 2 years.The rent for an illegal 1 bedroom hovel in D3 in Saigon with a tap water connection and personal bathroom goes for $250-550/mo - that's literally the monthly wage for most residents in SaigonYou really cannot compare even the worst life in the US with the life the silent majority faces in developing countries Sure, but your example cites someone who expects to be making the median annual salary every month within a few years, right? No.This is someone who spent $50k in debt just to end up earning the same salary ($700-800/mo) if she worked in a factory sowing clothes (which give free dormitory housing vs paying $200-400/mo in rent like non factory workers do), working in the unregulated vice industry in Singapore, UAE, of Korea, or doing nails under the table while overstaying their B2 visa in East San Jose - like a number of my SO's peers who didn't make it into a degree program that leads to you becoming a doctor, dentist, bureaucrat, or engineer.Spending 8-10 years of education just to end up earning a similar amount as a factory worker makes people who devoted so much time and effort angry, and why you see a significant exodus of medical professionals in developing countries to developed countries, becuase they are not remunerated enough.Remunerating people less only exacerbates brain drains.And note how this is specifically medical professionals - other white collar roles pay less and are much more competitive or difficult to land a job in VN This is someone who spent $50k in debt just to end up earning the same salary ($700-800/mo) if she worked in a factory sowing clothes (which give free dormitory housing vs paying $200-400/mo in rent like non factory workers do), working in the unregulated vice industry in Singapore, UAE, of Korea, or doing nails under the table while overstaying their B2 visa in East San Jose - like a number of my SO's peers who didn't make it into a degree program that leads to you becoming a doctor, dentist, bureaucrat, or engineer.Spending 8-10 years of education just to end up earning a similar amount as a factory worker makes people who devoted so much time and effort angry, and why you see a significant exodus of medical professionals in developing countries to developed countries, becuase they are not remunerated enough.Remunerating people less only exacerbates brain drains.And note how this is specifically medical professionals - other white collar roles pay less and are much more competitive or difficult to land a job in VN Spending 8-10 years of education just to end up earning a similar amount as a factory worker makes people who devoted so much time and effort angry, and why you see a significant exodus of medical professionals in developing countries to developed countries, becuase they are not remunerated enough.Remunerating people less only exacerbates brain drains.And note how this is specifically medical professionals - other white collar roles pay less and are much more competitive or difficult to land a job in VN Remunerating people less only exacerbates brain drains.And note how this is specifically medical professionals - other white collar roles pay less and are much more competitive or difficult to land a job in VN And note how this is specifically medical professionals - other white collar roles pay less and are much more competitive or difficult to land a job in VN I will spare you the ethical and moral reasons, and give you a practical one.Private healthcare, being a business, cannot afford the investments of public one. Instead it operates following the Pareto principle where 20% of services and treatments cover 90%+ of patient needs.Now this works with much joy over most of your life, but there are just too many edge cases over a life time where this will screw you.E.g. The most luxurious one with almost a dozen people following her.All of this: pointless. Her child had complications minutes after birth, and no single private hospital in our country has a pediatric intensive care unit, or, to label it more correctly a pediatric _reanimation_ unit.The only private hospitals that do? University ones, as they operate on slightly different financial basis and incentives.This goes beyond this example I have. It doesn't matter if you're in a country with good private healthcare (e.g. Switzerland) or a crap one, public healthcare is accepted to be a money loser for the greater good and will cover more services. Always.Mind you, I'm not saying that a single public hospital will offer everything and private is bad, just stating that there's many situations where it's easier to find the service offered in public rather than private health care. Private healthcare, being a business, cannot afford the investments of public one. Instead it operates following the Pareto principle where 20% of services and treatments cover 90%+ of patient needs.Now this works with much joy over most of your life, but there are just too many edge cases over a life time where this will screw you.E.g. The most luxurious one with almost a dozen people following her.All of this: pointless. Her child had complications minutes after birth, and no single private hospital in our country has a pediatric intensive care unit, or, to label it more correctly a pediatric _reanimation_ unit.The only private hospitals that do? University ones, as they operate on slightly different financial basis and incentives.This goes beyond this example I have.

The only ones that do are all university hospitals and they only do so because they operate on a very different financial non-profit model.And I'm talking about Switzerland.PICU isn't just an example of service and treatments where even very very rich countries with quality healthcare are relatively uncovered compared to much poorer countries with public health care.It's not even the happiest one, because PICU is still "relatively" common, so I don't want to focus on it.Other examples of treatments that are relatively common in public health care are organ transplants, ICU for infective diseases, post trauma (stroke-like) rehabilitation are just some of the examples of treatments you're gonna find in many public hospitals in a country but extremely rarely in neighboring countries with excellent private healthcare.

I understand medicine is slightly different but my hunch is that any sufficiently smart person can do well enough as a doctor after 1-2 years of theory.This might anger a lot of people because there's a trend where we elevate medicine and doctors to a godly level.Thankfully with the internet and AI, knowledge is not gatekept as much now.I wish we allow more people to become doctors and intelligent people to become doctors. The type of people who choose to become doctors are not problem solvers, at least from my experience.Of course my argument doesn't work exactly for surgeons but I think we should not artificially reduce their numbers.

For insurance companies, the salaries of all the people they employ, and the rent/mortgage/upkeep on their buildings & grounds, would all be classified as expenses that would not generally be included in their margins.But in a single-payer system, none of that cost would even exist.

There are things about the body that any first year medical student could tell you, that nurses never learn even after decades of experience (because they don't need to). They self-fund health benefits under ERISA, paying claims directly and hiring insurers only as administrators (ASOs). Self-funded ERISA plans are regulated by the US Department of Labor, not state insurance commissioners. To top it off, I just got a bill for $300 after paying $1300.The system is completely broken. A poor, uninterested, or other valued[1] person would only sacrifice $N to improve their health beyond "still alive". A rich person, or highly interested, or other valued[2] person would sacrifice potentially many multiples of $N.Take Bryan Johnson[3] for example is willing to spend on many improvements to his life.

Repeal the ACA mandates and enact interstate laws which permits low-deductible, low mandate policies along with reintroducing catastrophic insurance. What we have now is prepaid medical care, not insureance. We have the worst of all possible systems at present. They (easily) found someone who will see them out of pocket. The first is, hospitals are owned by investors, and have to increase profits. Build shiny new hospitals and prioritize private rooms (HIPAA provided a great excuse here). To woo investors turn administrator into a CEO position with commensurate pay.None of this incentivizes providing quality health care to non-wealthy people at a fair price. It incentivizes trying to get rid of lower income patients as quickly as possible to make room for high income or well insured patients who can be billed more.Same as housing, this issue is everywhere in the western world. We can try to tackle it by itself (transparent pricing would probably help a great deal), but the root issue is bigger: the rich are getting what they want on both sides of the equation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The generative AI industry has promised to “disrupt” society, and on that front, it can be said to have succeeded. AI has certainly disrupted many parts of society, including education, social media, and politics. Most of all, it seems to have disrupted the tech industry itself, where what was once a profitable career (software development) increasingly seems to be more of a precarious one, thanks to the rise of so-called “vibe coding”—a form of AI-assisted software development that requires less experience and more automation. This whole vibe coding thing doesn't seem to be working out for companies, however, as generating code via an LLM prompt at breakneck speed can, predictably, lead to less-than-stellar work. Now, in an ironic twist, it seems that, having dispensed with more skilled coders for the cheap effectiveness of a chatbot-aided code monkey, companies are having to hire additional contractors to fix the AI's screw-ups. The outlet cites one description shared with them by a specialist, who said his particular expertise was to “polish” up codebases that might be a little rough around the edges: “I've been offering vibe coding fixer services for about two years now, starting in late 2023. Currently, I work with around 15-20 clients regularly, with additional one-off projects throughout the year,” Hamid Siddiqi, who offers to “review, fix your vibe code” on Fiverr, told me in an email. “I started fixing vibe-coded projects because I noticed a growing number of developers and small teams struggling to refine AI-generated code that was functional but lacked the polish or ‘vibe' needed to align with their vision. I saw an opportunity to bridge that gap, combining my coding expertise with an eye for aesthetic and user experience.” Siddiqi told 404 that he commonly assists companies with “inconsistent UI/UX design in AI-generated frontends, poorly optimized code that impacts performance, misaligned branding elements, and features that function but feel clunky or unintuitive.” Yet another cleanup specialist, Swatantra Sohni, told the outlet that they think AI is being leveraged by people who don't otherwise have the digital skills to build products. Vibe coding is, at the moment, kind of like infancy. It's very handy to convey the prototype they want, but I don't think they are really intended to make it like a production grade app.” As with many other AI-led industries, humans are still necessary after all.

SK hynix has completed development of its HBM4 memory and prepared it for high-volume manufacturing of memory stacks, the company said on Friday. HBM4 stacks from SK hynix go beyond specifications set by JEDEC by 25% in terms of performance, though it remains to be seen whether producers of next-generation AI accelerators — such as AMD, Broadcom, or Nvidia — will use that potential on their 2026 products. The company's HBM4 memory stacks use specially designed DRAM dies built using proven 1b-nm (5th Generation 10nm-class) process technology that combines decent performance efficiency with node maturity (i.e., low defect density and variability). In this process, multiple memory chips are placed on a base substrate and bonded together in a single reflow step. Right after that, spaces between the stacked DRAM layers, base die, and substrate are filled with a mold material to secure and protect the structure. Advanced MR-MUF enables the company to keep the height of its 12-Hi HBM stacks within specification and improve heat dissipation of power-hungry memory modules. "By supplying the product that meets customer needs in performance, power efficiency and reliability in timely manner, the company will fulfill time to market and maintain competitive position." Unfortunately, SK hynix does not disclose either how many DRAM layers its HBM4 devices use, or their capacity, though we are likely talking about 12-Hi 36 GB devices that will be used for Nvidia's Rubin data center GPUs, but we are speculating. The company also does not disclose whether its initial HBM4 stacks use 12FFC+ (12nm-class) or N5 (5nm-class) base logic dies produced by TSMC. The company is not alone in going beyond JEDEC spec with HBM4: Micron is currently sampling HBM4 devices with a 9.2 GT/s data transfer rate, whereas Rambus has an HBM4 memory controller capable of 10 GT/s speed. While extra performance may be used by actual chip developers at some point, most developers apparently want to have some reserve for added piece of mind, according to an insight shared by Rambus a few years ago.

Age-verification laws are popping up around the world, and although websites like Pornhub originally caught the limelight, other online platforms are struggling to keep up with compliance. Bluesky shut down service in Mississippi, and Mastodon will likely follow. You probably know about it as a way to bypass region-locked content on streaming platforms like Netflix. You can't access Bluesky if your internet traffic is coming from Mississippi, but with a VPN, your traffic could be coming from a different state or country. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) says VPNs aren't a solution. Although VPNs provide a fix for circumventing age-verification laws, they aren't foolproof. It's hard to argue with age-verification laws on the surface. Pornhub itself has been very forward with its stance that age-verification laws are a good thing—if done correctly. In the UK, for example, Reddit verifies with Persona, and Bluesky uses Kids Web Services (owned by Epic Games). Persona's privacy policy states that it collects not only biometric information and personal details, like your ID, but also ties that to information gathered from third-party sources. “Age verification laws threaten individual privacy by requiring individuals to submit highly sensitive personal data, such as government-issued IDs or biometric scans, to access material online,” Rindala Alajaji, a legislative activist at EFF, tells WIRED. “This opens the door for potential breaches and misuse.” Service providers also argue that the laws don't protect minors. Pornhub, for example, says it saw an 80 percent drop in traffic from Louisiana in 2023 when the state passed an age verification law. “These laws don't actually 'protect minors' or stop people from accessing adult content; they push users to unregulated, unsafe corners of the internet where privacy and safety protections are minimal, making the internet more dangerous for everyone,” Alajaji says. At a basic level, VPNs work by sending your traffic to a server within the provider's network before going out to the open internet. By routing your traffic this way, it'll appear as if you're connecting from the server's location. Combined with proper privacy measures on the VPN side, that should mean you and your online browsing are completely anonymous. No system is perfect, though, and VPNs aren't an exception. When you connect to a VPN, your traffic looks as if it's coming from the VPN server, which itself poses a hurdle. If enough questionable traffic comes from a particular server, it'll be blocked. Streaming platforms like Netflix might notice that an odd amount of traffic comes from one particular server in a certain location, and it may block that server from connecting. You can easily find massive lists of known VPN servers online. Some VPNs, like Proton VPN, are good at keeping up with this game of whack-a-mole. VPNs can hide where your internet activity is coming from, but it doesn't totally hide who is engaging in that activity. They don't touch other potentially personally identifiable information. In the context of age verification laws, however, VPNs are effective. Prominent services like Bluesky and Pornhub have, publicly and reluctantly, withdrawn access in locations with these laws, so it's hard to imagine that they'll block access from known VPN servers. However, some organizations, such as the Age Verification Providers Association (AVPA), have pushed for more robust enforcement mechanisms beyond IP geolocation. If services are forced to comply with more restrictive tracking, the effectiveness of a VPN goes down. “The approach outlined is that, for example, a social media platform would analyze the content or behaviour of its own users reaching it via a VPN to flag any that were likely to be underage in a jurisdiction that requires age checks,” Iain Corby, executive director at the AVPA, told me via email. “States must consider the impact of giving VPN users a pass, which is that they are effectively giving up on any attempt to apply the rule of law online.” The EFF says it wants to see a different approach, one that's less focused on restricting access to VPNs and more focused on protecting individual privacy. “VPNs shouldn't be necessary to access legally protected content in the first place," Alajaji says. Using a VPN to spoof your location and access the internet isn't illegal in most parts of the world, and any change in legislation on that front would bring forth serious questions about online censorship. Countries like Russia and North Korea infamously have VPN bans in place. Any similar policy from Western states like the US and UK would certainly be met with fierce opposition. These services all have decent pricing, solid speeds, and stable apps, but privacy takes center stage. It's fast, easy to use, and comes with a ton of server locations. I'm recommending it here because Proton has an unconventional approach to the online privacy debacle. The company is a Swiss corporation, but its primary shareholder is The Proton Foundation—a non-profit set up and led by Proton's founder Andy Yen. That already sets Proton apart from most VPNs, and it's backed up by open source apps. For the privacy-conscious, I gravitate toward Proton due to its Secure Core servers. Basically, Proton owns a small internet network across Sweden, Switzerland, and Iceland, which Proton says it chose due to their robust privacy legislation. You'll take a drop in speed, and other services offer these kinds of multi-hop connections, but Proton is the only provider I'm aware of that fully owns its multi-hop network. You can get started for free, but with reduced speeds, and the paid plan clocks in at just $10 a month, even less if you subscribe for a year or more. Like any VPN worth its salt, Mullvad says it doesn't keep logs about what you do online. Unlike other VPNs, though, you don't have to take Mullvad's word for it. That's €5 per month flat; Mullvad doesn't do regional pricing or long-term discounts. For starters, all of its apps are open source and externally audited. It also provides multi-hop connections—basically connecting to two VPN servers consecutively—and WireGuard key rotation. Key rotation is a big security feature: It ensures perfect forward secrecy, as a single compromised session won't compromise past or future sessions. When it comes to fingerprinting, Mullvad takes the cake because of DAITA, or Defence Against AI-Guided Traffic Analysis. Although things like GPS play a role in fingerprinting, so do encrypted traffic patterns. To get around this kind of traffic analysis, DAITA uses consistent packet sizes and interjects dummy packets into the stream. Windscribe is one of the few VPN providers that has a demonstrable no-logging policy. Every VPN says your history isn't logged, but precious few actually back up that claim. The case was dismissed, but even in the face of criminal prosecution, Windscribe couldn't turn over data it didn't have. I'm recommending it here due to Windscribe's excellent browser extension. There are a lot of ways to track you outside a VPN tunnel, and Windscribe's extension is set up to tackle those exact issues. It can delete cookies when you close a tab, and it can spoof time and GPS signals to make you more difficult to track. Like Proton, Windscribe offers a restrictive free version with 10 GB of data per month. Unlike most VPN providers, however, you can build a plan from that piecemeal. Unlimited data will run you $3 per month, and each additional location is an extra $1. Or, you can unlock everything for $9 per month or $69 per year, which is lower than the going rate of most VPN services. It's just as serious about online privacy and security as a service like Mullvad, and it comes with an extensive roster of features that even top-rated VPN services struggle to keep up with. Alajaji and Paige Collings, a senior speech and privacy activist at the EFF, put it best: “While VPNs may be able to disguise the source of your internet activity, they are not foolproof—nor should they be necessary to access legally protected speech.” VPNs put a bandage on the age-verification problem, but they have benefits outside of this particular issue. Even without being foolproof, VPNs are a huge boon to privacy online, especially when combined with browser-based blocking mechanisms. And spoofing your location can still let you stream movies and TV shows in other countries, as well as access domestic services when traveling abroad.
