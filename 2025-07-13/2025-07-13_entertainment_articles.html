It's been 11 years since Oscar-winning filmmaker Peter Jackson completed his “Hobbit” trilogy. He did, however, direct the Beatles' docuseries “Get Back” and the 3D WWI doc “They Shall Not Grow Old,” which colorized and restored wartime footage. Jackson, though, insists that he is not out of the game. Related Stories ‘Superman' Stars David Corenswet and Rachel Brosnahan Met Moments Before Chemistry Read Cherien Dabis Hopes Her New Film ‘All That's Left of You' Makes the ‘Palestine Origin Story' Mainstream Onscreen I'm certainly not retired,” Jackson told ScreenRant in an interview. “We are currently working on three different screenplays. The “District 9” director teased that more will be coming from both his “Lord of the Rings” universe and Beatles retrospectives. “We are producing and have been writing ‘The Hunt for Gollum,' which Andy Serkis is going to direct next year,” he said. “I've enjoyed working on documentaries, whether they show I've grown old or not, and obviously the ‘Get Back: The Beatles' project. I've enjoyed doing various things with The Beatles, which is great, and that'll probably carry on.” But what Jackson is most excited about, he revealed, involves pulling a real-life “Jurassic Park” with a large prehistoric bird. “But to me, de-extincting the Moa would be just as exciting, if not more exciting, than any film I could possibly make. I've made a lot of movies, but to see the Giant Moa brought back would be a level of excitement that I think would supersede anything at this point in time,” he explained. To truly illustrate our success, we must not only redefine de-extinction, but establish standards for the science behind it, as well.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A memo reveals the federal government is planning to deport immigrants to countries where they hold no citizenship, with as little as six hours' notice and without any guarantees that they'll be protected from torture or persecution when they get there. In the memo, obtained by The Washington Post, Todd M. Lyons, the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detailed plans for deportations following a Supreme Court decision that cleared a path for rapidly deporting immigrants to places to which they have no prior ties. If the plans are implemented, many more immigrants may soon find themselves sent to countries where they know no one and do not speak the language — and they will have little to no opportunity to legally challenge their removal before it takes place. This policy will apply to immigrants who have final removal orders but whom a judge has ruled cannot be sent back to their home country because it would put them in danger. It will also apply to immigrants from countries with whom the U.S. does not have strong relations, like Cuba or China. How much notice an immigrant gets, the memo said, depends on where they are being sent. If the immigrant is being sent to a place where the government has not secured such assurances, they could be deported there with hours' notice. According to the memo, “in exigent circumstances” immigration officers could give immigrants as little as six hours' notice that they were being deported somewhere they have no protections against prosecution or torture. Immigration officers will not ask each immigrant if they have concerns about being sent to another country, but immigrants who do express a fear of being sent to a third country will be screened within approximately 24 hours to see if they are eligible for humanitarian protection according to federal law and the Convention Against Torture, a United Nations convention that Congress ratified in 1994 that protects immigrants from being sent to a country where they could be subject to torture.

Already, the Trump administration has been deporting immigrants to third countries, and it seems those numbers will only increase after the Supreme Court's ruling. Hundreds of Venezuelans are being detained at CECOT, a notorious prison in El Salvador known for inhumane and torturous conditions. The administration also illegally deported Salvadoran immigrant, Kilmar Abrego García, to his home country in violation of a judge's order.</p>

Corenswet told People that he met “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” Emmy winner “in sort of a flurry of handshakes and hellos.” It was summer 2023, Brosnahan had flown into Los Angeles from New York City, and she was due back for a performance of “The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window” on Broadway.

Alright, Rachel, I think you're getting on a plane. “The whole thing is kind of a blur,” Brosnahan said. “Honestly, I don't remember anything about it. We didn't know each other at all,” Corenswet said. Since they'd be following in the footsteps of previous portrayers like Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Henry Cavill, and Amy Adams, the stars knew that they had to meet and get to know one another. “We'd had this brief but obviously impactful moment together during our chemistry read… but I think we both left feeling like we didn't remember anything about it, and wanted to spend some time together. We had a really lovely breakfast [in New York] after we found out we were going to be playing the roles together… and got to know each other that way,” Brosnahan recalled. Through the long production shoot, the two got to know one another very well, and discovered that they were such good scene partners, they'd often get totally lost in their characters. “She made me curse at her,” Corenswet laughed. “The way she delivered one particular line made me sort of involuntarily say, ‘Oh, f*** you,' which I think was a great shock to all of us… She caught me off guard and made me feel really hurt in that moment, and so I, in character, shot back at her.” Brosnahan recalled a lighthearted take where Corenswet made an “expression of how injured he was,” and she found it “so funny.” “I think about that face he made in that moment all of the time,” she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An epic, early Christmas present dropped into Hallmark Channel fans' laps late on July 12, 2025, as the network pulled off a major surprise, announcing that Hallmark's 16th annual Countdown to Christmas programming lineup will include a third movie in the beloved “Three Wise Men” franchise. Hallmark hunks Tyler Hynes, Andrew Walker, and Paul Campbell appeared in a late-night promo that aired on the network and dropped on its social media accounts, where fans were told to “get ready for #ThreeWisestMen.” And all three subtly added their own Instagram teases, sending fans into a frenzy, crying happy tears and screaming with glee. A post shared by Tyler Hynes (@tyler_hynes) Hynes, Walker, and Campbell scored a smash hit in 2022 with “Three Wise Men and a Baby,” written by Campbell and fellow Hallmark star Kimberley Sustad, who also appears in the movies along. Campbell and Sustad wrote that screenplay, too, with help from star screenwriter Russell Hainline. Hynes tagged them and Sustad, as well as actress Margaret Colin, who plays the Brenners' mom, and wrote, “Take me home. Without revealing what he was about to film, Walker had told fans in an Instagram post on July 12 that after a short summer break with his family, he was heading “back to work now — feeling grateful for the time off, the people I spent it with, and the chance to keep doing what I love. Once the news broke that night, Campbell shared a screenshot on Instagram of People's article about the movie and wrote, “Whelp… here we go again. Then, on the morning of July 13, Hynes shared a brief video in his Instagram Stories of all three guys, dressed in their candy cane elf costumes from the second movie, as they each walked purposefully to their trailers on set as Phil Collins' “Take Me Home” played in the background. A post shared by Hallmark Channel (@hallmarkchannel) Hallmark fans flooded social media as soon as the news dropped, flipping out over the unexpected third movie, with some admitting they were literally crying happy tears. One fan wrote on Hynes' post, “Permission to sob?? Another wrote on Hallmark's post, “I LITERALLY JUST SCREAMED seeing this pop up on my TV!!! !😲😁🥳🎉[Cue me – Jumping up and down]” Another thrilled fan commented, “My hallmark dream coming true! Multiple Hallmarkies also made sure to note that they're game for as many movies as possible in the franchise, including one who wrote, “WM3 and 4 and 5 and 6 and… we are here for as many as you want to give us @tyler_hynes @awalkk35 @paulcampbellofficial 😍 we love the bromance!!</p>

The majority of business came from domestic as the Gunn-directed Warner Bros tentpole experienced some (not unexpected) softness in parts of Asia, while in such European majors as Germany, France and Italy, Supes landed a 2nd place start as Jurassic World Rebirth tugged on his cape to retain No. The international box office debut for Superman is estimated at $95M. We will have more on Superman in just a bit. Also, Disney's Lilo & Stitch is now thisclose to becoming the first $1B movie of 2025 with $994.3M through today. PREVIOUS, SATURDAY: On Friday, Warner Bros/DC's Superman added another $21.5M from 78 international box office markets. That brings the offshore flying cume to $40M through Friday. Globally, with Friday's domestic count, the worldwide running total is $96.5M. While we still have Saturday and Sunday to come overseas, what's clear here is that domestic is leaning harder into this latest iteration of the Man of Steel. All told, the James Gunn-directed Superman is expected to reach $210M+ in its worldwide bow. This is slightly above where we had it before the weekend, and of course could shift given Sat/Sun play. While we can't exactly call it kryptonite, there are some areas where Superman is facing a challenge: Asia is soft, for example. Though this should not come as a surprise. We've previously noted that Korea is a depressed market and that Clark Kent was not expected to make an impact in China. China, as noted, grossed $2.4M through Friday including sneaks. Superman is an unsurprising non-starter in the market. The ultimate full-run prediction there is just above $11M. In happier news, Spain opened on Friday to $1M at No. 1 as the biggest debut for Gunn and 7% higher than Justice League, 29% over Aquaman, 77% ahead of Wonder Woman and 106% above Thunderbolts. Japan, which is anxiously awaiting the arrival of the next Demon Slayer movie next week, had a fantastic start with $781K, super-passing comps. The Top 5 through Friday are: Mexico ($3.8M), UK ($3.6M), Brazil ($3M), Australia ($2.5M) and France ($2.5M). PREVIOUS, FRIDAY: DC/Warner Bros' Superman has begun zipping around the world, ringing up $40.3 million through Wednesday and Thursday in North America and 57 overseas markets. The split there is a record-making $22.5M in domestic previews Thursday night, while $17.8M has come from the international box office so far in the movie's first two days of offshore release. The global total to date does not include Friday's estimates for North America. The James Gunn-directed latest installment about the Man of Steel debuted in nine offshore markets on Wednesday, with another 48 markets joining Thursday. Today adds another 21, which takes the total number of international territories in release to 78. In terms of openings on Wednesday, France was a No. 1 start at $1.3M including previews and ahead of a long weekend for Bastille Day; the debut is 3% above Thunderbolts and also over the most recent Venom and Aquaman movies (+8%). Korea, which we continue to stress is a depressed market, started at $700,000 on Wednesday. Imax repped a strong 18% of the box office from 26 locations. Italy's Wednesday opening of $519K was a No. 1 start and roughly on par with Justice League as well as 2% bigger than Man of Steel, 51% ahead of Guardians the first, 97% bigger than Wonder Woman and 159% higher than Aquaman & The Lost Kingdom. 1 with results on par with Thunderbolts and ahead of GOTG1 & 2, Man of Steel, The Batman and Top Gun: Maverick. The Philippines on Wednesday saw Supes dominate at No. This is the 2nd biggest opening day for a DC movie ever and is roughly on par with The Batman. 1 and claimed the best opening day of 2025 to date. Super DC market Brazil came in with a strong No. The launch day was bigger than all Guardians movies as well as Joker and The Batman, notably. Opening day results are roughly on par with The Batman and higher than Aquaman and the Mission movies The Top 5 through Thursday are: Mexico ($2.2M), Brazil ($2M), France ($1.8M), Australia ($1.3M) and Korea ($1.1M).

They made an entertaining movie that really focused on the goodness of our hero and the struggles he faces daily as an honest caring meta human. Lex was fantastic as were Jimmy and Lois. All that promotion and discourse for a 210-220 million worldwide opening weekend? Man of steel made 670 back in 2013 without the current inflation. It looks like Superman will make less than that especially with F4 releasing in two weeks. Non-Americans apparently don't like this characters very much, they probably think he's bland, boring and overpowered. 650 million final gross seems possible but it's not a great number for the most famous superhero character. No matter how many times they reboot the franchise, the results will always be lukewarm as it seems. Superman is not the most famous super hero character its Spidey. This is going to make less than MoS, alarming. I am so glad they got rid of the Snyderverse. It's barely going to eke out a (domestic) opening that's around what Man of Steel did THIRTEEN years ago with fewer premium screens and lower ticket prices. (translation : Man of Steel sold more tickets. And it will be lucky to do what Man of Steel did internationally, as well as have an overall gross that it did. Worldwide movies are not watched as they were before covid for example it took me 20 minutes to get to the nearest cinema and the ticket price especially for half price allowed me to at least watch 2 movies per visit bbecause of that never missed any movie I was curious b In today boxoffice world… with all factors such as post-pandemicnormals, as was previously mentioned, and the superhero burn-out that many people claim… This movie is hitting it so far out of the park that it borders on unbelievable. Even an excellent movie like Thunderbolts struggled to make money this summer.Unlike Man of Steel, the new Superman movie is a hit with critics and audience. If it makes over 500 million, the studio would be happy. It would be a solid start for the DC universe. Superman Returns was pretty much DOA in overseas markets. Man of Steel faired better but wasn't exactly a home run either. Superman seems to be a tough sell in foreign markets. Will be seeing this week so can't comment on the quality but it looks Like it was made with passion for the source material.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Travis Scott and the Cactus Jack crew have been teasing the JACKBOYS sequel all year, and the day has finally arrived — and it's fittingly 713 Day in La Flame's hometown — with JACKBOYS 2 hitting streaming services first thing Sunday (July 13). JB2 has 17 tracks in total, including two previously released singles: “2000 Excursion,” which saw a music video released earlier this week on YouTube, as well as “ILMB,” with Sheck Wes and Scott going bar-for-bar. It's a star-studded cast joining the collective, as NBA YoungBoy, Future, Playboi Carti, GloRilla, Tyla, Vybz Kartel, 21 Savage, Kodak Black, SahBabii and Waka Flocka Flame are here for the JACKBOYS 2 party. Houston rap legend Bun B also serves as the album's de facto host, OG and professor, guiding listeners throughout the U.S. while serving up hip-hop history lessons. After Pusha T dissed La Flame on “So Be It,” Bun B was one to nearly promise a Trav response, and there appears to be an answer on JACKBOYS 2. JACKBOYS 2 is a loaded expedition from Houston to Florida, pulling on different flows and sounds that have graced hip-hop across the country, while Scott is the top chemist cooking up the ultimate rap cocktail. After sifting through all 17 tracks, Billboard attempts to rank every song from JACKBOYS 2 below. Crack open a Cacti (if you're of age) and lock in. A radio station promo introduction welcomes fans into the JACKBOYS world. Bun B directs the project's transitions and he's highlighting Houston, of course, but also showing love to other cities that played an integral role in rap over the years. Here, he tips his cap nearly 600 miles north to Memphis, which is a fitting introduction for GloRilla, who isn't shy about making it known her “only regret is being too young to f—k Matthew McConaughey.” She even pronounces the actor's name twice to get her point across. I'd guess he sent this in a pack to Drake that was passed over and landed in Toliver's gift basket, and he makes the most of his solo opportunity with a robotic flow. Sheck Wes and Don Toliver have proven to be a potent pick-and-roll duo in the past, and they pick up where they left off with a Cactus Jack alley-oop while hyping up their women on “Velour.” Don handles chorus duties while Sheck picks up the tab for his girl. Sheck Wes in love and he doesn't care who knows it. “ILMB” dropped in April and gave fans an early peek into the mojo of JB2. It feels like a true Harlem love story as told by Sheck. Is that Molly Santana ad-libs on the intro? Don Toliver and Future join forces for a codeine-splashed chorus while passing the baton to Cactus Jack newcomer Wallie the Sensei, who left his mark on the masses with his guest appearance on Kendrick Lamar's 2024 GNX album. La Flame is trying to have the dancefloors two-stepping with this one. As one of the artists ahead of his time when he burst onto the scene circa 2017, SahBabii has a well-deserved moment nearly a decade later with his mystical assist. As King Squid himself, Sah takes listeners on an underwater voyage in the depths of the ocean, and he's still good for a hilarious jab at the haters: “Ain't gon' shower for days, now how my d—k taste.” La Flame and Cardo on the beat is never going to be a miss, and who doesn't love a Ye “Power” flip with Mike Dean's tonic synths. Fans of the Cactus Jack artist had been clamoring for music from the Michigan native, and he gets his chance to shine throughout JB2. “MM3” is SoFayGo's ode to his designer wardrobe and you can't keep up with him. Raging tracks like this should get more eyes on him and amp up the noise heading into the 23-year-old's next project. Scott gets into his dancehall bag while joining forces with Vybz Kartel and Tyla for the groovy “PBT.” The transitions on the album have been smooth and Scott's versatility is back on full display. But hold on, how does Gen-Z's South African singer know about Yellow Pages? Fans who watched or attended Scott's electric Coachella set in April got a first listen to the hasty “Kick Out,” which teased what was to come with the JB era. But Scott is always good for a surprise, and he enlists 21 Savage, who comes through with his signature menacing ad-libs, which are some of the best in rap today. The first “outside” from Travis Scott is a longtime fan-favorite, which found him linking up with 21 Savage on a Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight standout. Scott goes back-and-forth with himself, but the second voice is a much deeper version, and it would be interesting to hear him utilize this strategy more down the line. Seriously, this was like the Hardy Boyz coming out at WrestleMania 33. And he handles business with ease, turning the unlikely collab into a potent track. “Dumbo” finds Scott hitting on another lucid chorus that's also catchy — he's had a penchant for that over the course of his decorated career. But his punchy bars seemingly play hopscotch across the spacy production. For me, I would've preferred a different plan of attack with his verses to go with a plush hook, but there's definitely potential for “Dumbo” to grow on fans. Tay Keith lights up Vice City and Scott blankets the starry production with a raspy flow as if he smoked a pack of cigarettes before hitting the booth. La Flame turns into a Florida GPS on the second verse, which is some of his strongest rapping on the project as he found his pocket. Hailing from Broward County, Kodak Black is right at home driving in the Miami Vice fast lane. The true project intro finds a peaceful wave, which is shredded by rambunctious Waka Flocka Flame Bricksquad ad-libs. He ruminates on times stepping into Louis Vuitton while draped in 10 chains, dodging TMZ landmines in his blue Lamborghini and keeping his phone on DND. Many wondered if he would respond, and this appears to be Scott's reply to Pusha T dissing him on “So Be It.” La Flame calls out “old heads” pissing him off and wastes no time giving a jab on track No. “Man I sware these old n—s kill me/ Made a 100 off pushin tees/ Now my phone on DND,” he raps while seemingly taking a swipe at Push. LaFlame connects with SoFayGo as the duo invades the rage rap scene with a blaring beat that could've landed on Playboi Carti's WHOLE LOTTA RED. “I've been winnin' my whole life, it ain't no contest/ Judgin' by your first impression, b—h, I'm not impressed,” Scott spews on the chorus. This feels like it could be another response sniping back at Pusha T. Regardless, the chaos of “Contest” shines as a project standout and SoFaygo keeps up with La Flame, making him one of the clear early winners of JACKBOYS 2. Plenty of eyeballs jumped to “Where Was You” when word got out that the “Type Shit” collaborators were reuniting. Well, the Cactus Jack x OO combination did it again. Scott seemingly takes a page out of Future's “Where Ya At?” flow while giving a rare look into personal life and surroundings while climbing the rap food chain. Let's show F1LTHY some love, who has been on a run this year. Future invades the scene like a superhero and his syrupy rhymes recalling his lavish Monaco escapades never get old, no matter how many times we hear about them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Danny DeVito has starred in several classic movies. Recently, Danny provided an update on his friend, as Jack Nicholson rarely makes appearances. Regarding Jack, Danny DeVito told PEOPLE, “I just saw Jack a couple weeks ago — it was his birthday a month ago, and he's great.” The “It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia” actor also recalled working with Jack Nicholson on set on the classic film.” He revealed, “We're in the presence of this guy who's really at his moment, where he was breaking out into the big time.” Danny went on, “There was no need for an icebreaker. He was immediately just so embracing…He started out exactly the way everybody else did, where he couldn't get a job.” Danny told PEOPLE that his sisters worked in the same hair salon as Jack's older sister. He said, “When I was a kid, I always heard about this really handsome guy from Neptune who went out to California and became a movie star.” Danny then said, “I didn't want to ruffle the waters; I didn't want to add anything to the experience at that time.” Despite this, Michael Douglas spilled the beans to Jack about their New Jersey ties. Danny DeVito recalled, “Jack came running around the corner: ‘Ahhhh! He said of the re-release, “I feel the film is more relevant than ever, and I am heartened that new and returning moviegoers want to seek it out on the big screen. I feel its messages need to be shared widely today.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The project has assists from GloRilla, Kodak Black, 21 Savage, Tyla and Vybz Kartel. With Sunday (July 13) serving as 713 day, it's only right that Travis Scott and Cactus Jack dropped off the JACKBOYS 2 compilation album in an homage to La Flame's hometown of Houston. The anticipated sequel hit streaming services on Sunday and JB2 finds fellow H-Town rap dignitary Bun B onboard as host, while the project boasts 17 tracks in total. Alongside Scott and Cactus Jack high-flyers like Sheck Wes, Don Toliver, Sofaygo and Wallie the Sensei, La Flame invites a star-studded cast of collaborators into the mix that includes GloRilla, Tyla, Vybz Kartel, 21 Savage, Kodak Black, SahBabii and Waka Flocka Flame. There's plenty of merchandise for Ragers to cop on La Flame‘s website, as Cactus Jack released various merchandise collections and CD/vinyl bundles featuring alternate cover arts to accompany JACKBOYS 2. The first JACKBOYS project arrived in December 2019 with appearances from the late Pop Smoke, Young Thug, Quavo, Offset, Rosalia and Lil Baby. It's been a busy year for Scott, who headlined night two of Coachella in April and notched another No. He even completed another side quest when making WWE appearances at Elimination Chamber and WrestleMania.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After 55 years, numerous albums, and that weird period where society was forced to reckon with the memory of both ELO and ELO Part II, the band originally known as the Electric Light Orchestra—and billed in more recent years as “Jeff Lynne's ELO”—has apparently played its final show. And not the final show that was previously expected: Lynne revealed today that, due to his suffering from a “systemic infection,” the concert that was supposed to be the band's farewell show, scheduled for Saturday in London's Hyde Park, has been canceled, and will not be rescheduled. Which means, per Consequence, that ELO actually had its final show back on Wednesday, at a Manchester show that the 77-year-old Lynne apparently “struggled to get through.” A statement provided to press said that Lynne “is currently in the care of a team of doctors who have advised him that performing is simply not possible at this time nor will he be able to reschedule. Lynne and Tandy reformed “Jeff Lynne's ELO” in 2014; they would eventually release two albums, Alone In The Universe and From Out Of Nowhere.
