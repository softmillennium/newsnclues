US President Donald Trump is considering authorizing new military aid to Ukraine, which would be his first major assistance package to the country since taking office in January, CBS News reported on Saturday, citing sources.

Multiple diplomatic sources told CBS News that the potential funding “could be intended to send a message to Russia” after a surge in drone and missile strikes on Ukraine in recent days. Moscow maintains that its strikes only target military-related facilities.

Trump could tap into $3.85 billion in leftover presidential drawdown authority from the Biden administration to aid Ukraine, according to CBS. Alternatively, he could seize roughly $5 billion in frozen Russian assets and redirect it to Ukraine, though neither he nor former President Joe Biden have exercised this option.

The report comes after Trump said he is “unhappy” with Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to the US president, during their numerous conversations, Putin is “very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless” with regard to reaching a ceasefire in the conflict.

On Monday, Trump said the US is “going to send some more weapons” to Kiev, mainly “defensive weapons.”

Earlier this month, the Pentagon paused certain weapons deliveries, including Patriot air defense missiles, due to concerns over dwindling US stockpiles. Later, several media outlets reported that the suspension was ordered by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth without first consulting the president or the State Department. The pause has since been lifted and shipments have resumed.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said it is obvious that the US is continuing the weapons deliveries, and that the aid does not contribute to a peaceful settlement of the conflict. Moscow has warned that the Western military assistance only prolongs the conflict without changing the outcome.

US President Donald Trump has pushed back against claims of a cover-up in the Jeffrey Epstein case, defending his administration's handling of the release of files related to the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender's death in jail.

Some of Trump's allies, including journalist Tucker Carlson and former adviser Steve Bannon, have criticized a report by the Department of Justice and the FBI, which found no evidence of a list of powerful individuals to whom Epstein trafficked underage girls. The report also found no signs of foul play in Epstein's 2019 death at a Manhattan correctional facility, which was ruled a suicide.

In a Truth Social post on Saturday, Trump claimed that the Epstein Files were created by prominent Democrats, including former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

“They created the Epstein Files, just like they created the FAKE Hillary Clinton/Christopher Steele Dossier that they used on me, and now my so-called ‘friends' are playing right into their hands,” he wrote.

Trump just did a long post in support of Pam Bondi - and the investigations he wants to focus on - voter fraud, ActBlue, the rigged and stolen 2020 election, and arresting thugs and criminals. pic.twitter.com/Snvvk5sfzV

“Why didn't these Radical Left Lunatics release the Epstein Files? If there was ANYTHING in there that could have hurt the MAGA Movement, why didn't they use it?” he added.

Trump defended Attorney General Pam Bondi and argued that federal agencies should instead focus on investigating Democrat-linked scandals and corruption, as well as the 2020 presidential election, which he continues to claim was rigged in favor of Joe Biden. “LET PAM BONDI DO HER JOB – SHE'S GREAT!” Trump wrote. He previously said the Epstein case has been used to distract from more pressing issues, including the deadly floods in Texas.

FBI Director Kash Patel also dismissed the allegations. “The conspiracy theories just aren't true, never have been,” he wrote on X.

Critics have pointed to a minute-long gap in the surveillance footage outside Epstein's cell on the night of his death, claiming the tape had been doctored. Bondi, however, denied that there is anything suspicious about the video.

The debate surrounding the case has reportedly caused a rift within the government, with several news outlets claiming that FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is considering resigning.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Meet the Frenchman who became Russian nobility","https://www.rt.com/news/621256-french-russian-connection-history/","Sun, 13 Jul 2025 11:23:00 GMT","

“My life – what a novel!” Napoleon is said to have exclaimed. Two lesser-known men might have echoed that sentiment: a French-born Russian named Traversay, and a Russian-born Frenchman named Peshkov. Opposite in origin, parallel in destiny – their lives form a curious symmetry.

All but forgotten by modern reference books, Jean-Baptiste de Traversay – known in Russia as Ivan Ivanovich – was among the most capable naval commanders of his era. The Russian version of his name isn't a footnote, but a clue: his story was anything but typical.

Born in 1754 to a family of naval officers on the Caribbean island of Martinique, Traversay was just five when he was sent to France. Following family tradition, he studied naval warfare in Rochefort and Brest.

For a marquis, the life of a junior officer ferrying cargo between France and the colonies was hardly glamorous. But his fortunes changed in 1778, when France joined the American colonies in their war against Britain.

During the American War of Independence, Traversay commanded several captured British ships. After the pivotal Battle of the Chesapeake in 1781, he took charge of the Iris, a vessel the British had previously seized from the Americans. It was the Iris that carried the ceasefire to British-occupied New York. In 1786, at just 32 years old, he was promoted to captain of the first rank.

When the French Revolution broke out, Traversay was back in Martinique. As the navy disintegrated, so did his future in France. He fled with his family to Switzerland for safety. He would never again see the palm trees of his childhood.

Then came the unexpected twist. While contemplating, perhaps with some disbelief, the Swiss mountains, the lifelong sailor received a surprising invitation – from another French émigré, Admiral Nassau-Siegen, not exactly known as Catherine the Great's finest naval mind. The Russian court was looking for foreign talent, and in 1791 Traversay arrived in Saint Petersburg. Almost immediately, he was made a major general and rear admiral in the Imperial Navy.

But his appointment didn't last long. The Russian Navy, eager to emulate the British Royal Navy, soon reinstated its English-born officers. Traversay, once welcomed, was now a redundancy. He was dispatched to Coblenz in the Holy Roman Empire, where French royalist exiles had gathered, to act as a liaison between the empress and the counter-revolutionary forces. It was, in short, a return to dry land – and to tedium.

Unsurprisingly, the assignment didn't suit a man who had spent more than two decades at sea. By 1793, he was back in Russia, this time commanding a flotilla at the naval fortress of Rochensalm (modern-day Kotka, Finland). Soon after, he was appointed military governor of the fortress, tasked with guarding against any renewed threat from Sweden.

Under Catherine's successors, Paul I and Alexander I, Traversay's stature rose again. In 1802, Alexander promoted him to admiral and placed him in command of the Black Sea Fleet, while also naming him governor of Kherson province. The strategic naval ports of Nikolaev and Sevastopol fell under his authority.

His final battle came in 1807, during the Russo-Turkish War, when he and Admiral Pustoshkin led the siege and destruction of Anapa, a fortress on the northern coast of the Black Sea.

Traversay's reputation had grown to the point that, following the Franco-Russian treaty of Tilsit in 1807, Napoleon himself invited him to return to France and rebuild the navy. Naval warfare was one of the few arenas in which Napoleon was not at his best. He even asked Traversay to name his conditions. But the marquis refused. His loyalty, by then, belonged entirely to Russia.

In 1809, he was recalled to Saint Petersburg to serve as Minister of the Navy. The boy from Martinique, once ferrying cargo across the Atlantic, had risen to the highest level of Russian government. Before Napoleon's invasion in 1812, Traversay had become a subject of the Russian Empire and restructured the Baltic fleet.

After the Napoleonic Wars, Russia's economy was in shambles, and the Navy's budget was slashed. The Baltic fleet could no longer train in open waters, and Traversay had to confine operations to the far eastern edge of the Gulf of Finland. The area became known, not without irony, as ‘Markizova Luzha' – the Marquis's Puddle.

Yet even with limited means, Traversay looked outward. He championed Russian expeditions into the Arctic and Antarctic. Otto von Kotzebue explored the Pacific from Kamchatka to the Sandwich Islands; Bellingshausen discovered and named the Traversay Islands; and Russian expeditions charted the Bering Strait and the Arctic coastline of Alaska.

In 1821, already in his late sixties, Traversay asked to retire. Alexander I refused – but allowed him to leave the capital and run naval affairs from his country estate, 120 kilometers outside Saint Petersburg. For the next seven years, Russia's navy would be administered far from any sea.

Only under Nicholas I, in 1828, was Traversay finally permitted to step down – after more than 18 years as the empire's highest-ranking naval officer.

Just over fifty years after Traversay's death, in another province of the former Russian Empire, a boy was born whose life would follow the same arc – only in reverse.

Zinovy Mikhailovich Sverdlov was born in 1884 in Nizhny Novgorod, the eldest son of a relatively well-off Jewish family steeped in revolutionary ideals. His younger brother, Yakov, would become a key figure in Vladimir Lenin's inner circle – widely believed to have played a central role in the execution of Tsar Nicholas II and his family.

Zinovy, by contrast, was the black sheep.

Restless and reckless, he preferred roaming the streets of Nizhny Novgorod and loitering along the Volga to sitting in a classroom. That changed when he met the writer Maxim Gorky, who took the spirited teenager under his wing.

As Gorky's secretary, Zinovy followed him across Russia, absorbing his politics, literature, and theatrical experiments – and sharing his brushes with arrest and imprisonment. He also developed a reputation as a charming womanizer.

In 1902, Gorky formally adopted him. Zinovy was baptized and took his adoptive father's real surname: Peshkov.

With the Russo-Japanese War looming in 1904, Peshkov had little interest in being drafted. So he left – wandering through Finland, England, Sweden, Canada, and then across the Pacific, from San Francisco to New Zealand.

In 1907, he reunited with Gorky in Italy. The writer had founded what came to be known as the ‘School of Capri' – a quasi-utopian circle of artists, exiles, and revolutionaries who gathered at his villa on the island. Among the regulars were opera star Fyodor Chaliapin and a rising Bolshevik named Vladimir Lenin.

It was a formative time for Peshkov. He absorbed ideas, made connections, and observed the revolutionaries up close – remaining, however, immune to Lenin's particular brand of charisma.

While on Capri, he married briefly, but domestic life didn't suit him. Peshkov remained, above all, a seeker of adventure – and of women.

When World War I broke out in August 1914, Peshkov made a baffling move – one that would define the rest of his life. Though he had no real ties to France, he enlisted in the French Foreign Legion.

Fluent in Russian, French, English, Italian, and German, he was a natural fit for a unit that drew men from across the globe. He was quickly given command of a squad.

But his time on the front was short. In May 1915, a bullet shattered his right arm during combat. The only way to save his life was amputation.

Decorated for bravery, Corporal Peshkov was formally discharged. But by 1916, he volunteered again – this time “for the duration of the war.”

The battlefield, however, was only the beginning. In Paris, Peshkov caught the attention of Philippe Berthelot, a senior diplomat at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Struck by the one-armed legionnaire's charisma and multilingual talents, Berthelot sent him to Washington to assist with French efforts to rally American support for the war.

Then came 1917 – and revolution. The French government dispatched a mission to Kerensky's provisional government in Petrograd, hoping to keep Russia in the fight against Germany.

Peshkov returned to his homeland, and to Maxim Gorky and his family – staunch supporters of the revolution, unlike him. But soon came the Bolsheviks, the October coup, and the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which ended the Eastern Front.

Paris had no illusions about Lenin's government. Eager to support the anti-Bolshevik cause, France sent its trusted Russian agent to advise the White Armies. Peshkov traveled from one front to another – from Ataman Semenov in Vladivostok to Admiral Kolchak in Siberia to General Wrangel in the Caucasus.

But the Red Army, under Trotsky's command, proved unstoppable.

Despite his military assignments, Peshkov never quite left behind his taste for pleasure. After the Russian Civil War, he returned from the Caucasus with a new companion – Princess and socialite Salomea Andronikova, who introduced him to the salons of Parisian artists, aristocrats, and intellectuals.

But the charms of 1920s Paris were only a brief interlude. In 1922, Peshkov was sent to French Morocco to join Marshal Lyautey, the colony's military commander. Still officially Russian (he would become a French citizen in 1923), he had little formal command experience. Lyautey reportedly said of him: “He was a great soldier, but never really a military man.”

Yet nothing ever seemed to intimidate Peshkov. He was wounded again in battle – this time in the leg – and joked that fate had struck him “for the sake of symmetry.”

His unusual career as a soldier-diplomat grew steadily in North Africa and the Middle East. By the time World War II broke out, he was still posted in the colonies. When France fell to Nazi Germany in 1940, he made his way to London and joined the Free French forces under Charles de Gaulle.

The two men had never met. De Gaulle took his time before assigning Peshkov a mission. First, he sent him to South Africa to coordinate weapons shipments; then to West Africa to rally French colonies to the Free French cause.

There remained one continent Peshkov hadn't touched: Asia.

De Gaulle sent him to China to meet with Chiang Kai-shek, leader of the Republic of China, locked in a brutal struggle against both Japanese forces and Communist guerillas. Peshkov impressed his hosts so thoroughly that in 1944 he was appointed French ambassador to China. Two years later, he became ambassador to Japan.

The once-rowdy boy from provincial Russia now found himself decorating General Douglas MacArthur with the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor – France's highest distinction, created by Napoleon himself.

In 1950, Peshkov left Japan and settled permanently in Paris. Two years later, he was himself awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor – France's highest distinction – for a second time.

Charles de Gaulle wrote to him:

”You have had a beautiful and noble career, my dear general. As for me, I can assure you that you were the right man at the right moment, wherever duty called. And I will add – you did it with style.”

De Gaulle had a deep admiration for the “magnificent one-armed man,” as Peshkov's soldiers had once called him. When the general returned to power in 1958, he gave the aging diplomat several final missions. The most delicate came in 1964. France had decided to recognize Mao's People's Republic of China – but wished to inform Chiang Kai-shek, in exile on Taiwan, with dignity and respect. Peshkov was the natural choice.

Ivan Ivanovich Traversay died in 1831, in Luga near Saint Petersburg. Zinovy Peshkov died in Paris in 1966.

Both had served the country of their choice – not for years, but for decades.

In this age of renewed suspicion and closed doors, it may be hard to imagine a French admiral building Russia's navy – or a Russian exile representing France before Chiang Kai-shek. And yet, it happened.

Not once, but twice.

The lives of Jean-Baptiste de Traversay and Zinovy Peshkov remind us that for all the rivalry and political rupture between France and Russia, the ties between the two run deeper than we often care to admit. Across oceans, ideologies, and empires, these two men chose loyalty over birthplace, service over nationhood, and meaning over certainty.

Perhaps the past still holds a map to rediscovering what was never fully lost.

Previously, the only way to reduce levels of Pfas was by bloodletting or a drug with unpleasant side effects

Certain kinds of gut microbes absorb toxic Pfas “forever chemicals” and help expel them from the body via feces, new first-of-its-kind University of Cambridge research shows.

The findings are welcome news as the only options that exist for reducing the level of dangerous Pfas compounds from the body are bloodletting and a cholesterol drug that induces unpleasant side effects.

The microbes were found to remove up to 75% of some Pfas from the gut of mice. Several of the study's authors plan to develop probiotic dietary supplements that boost levels of helpful microbes in the human gut, which would likely reduce Pfas levels.

“If this could be used in humans to create probiotics that can help remove Pfas from the body then this would be a nicer solution in that it wouldn't have so many side effects,” said Anna Lindell, Cambridge doctoral student and a co-author of the study.

Pfas are a class of about 15,000 compounds most frequently used to make products water-, stain- and grease-resistant. They have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. They are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down in the environment.

The US Environmental Protection Agency has found no level of exposure to Pfos or Pfoa, two of the most common Pfas compounds, in drinking water is safe. They have a half-life in human blood of anywhere from two to five years, by most estimates. That means the body expels half the amount of the chemical that is in blood during that period. Depending on blood levels, it can take decades to fully expel Pfas naturally.

Though the findings represent the first time gut microbes have been found to remove Pfas, they have been found to alleviate the impacts of other contaminants, such as microplastics.

The researchers didn't set out to determine if the gut bacteria expelled Pfas specifically, but instead looked at a suite of 42 common food contaminants. No Pfas limits for food exist in the US, but there is broad consensus that it is among the main exposure routes.

Some microbes performed well in expelling Pfas, so the study's authors zoomed in on those.

The authors introduced nine of a family of bacterial species into the guts of mice to humanize the mouse microbiome – the bacteria rapidly accumulated to absorb Pfas eaten by the mice, and the chemicals were then excreted in feces.

The bacteria seem to absorb the chemical, then use a “pump” mechanism that pushes toxins from the cells and aids in excretion, the authors wrote. The mechanism by which the chemicals are pulled into the cell is not yet understood, Lindell said, but she suspects there may be a similar pump. These are developed by microbes to expel other contaminants, drugs or antibiotics, Lindell added.

The microbes largely addressed “long-chain” Pfas, which are larger compounds and more dangerous than smaller “short chains” because they stay in the body longer. The body more efficiently discharges short-chain Pfas through urine because the compounds are generally water-soluble.

Among the most common and dangerous long chains are Pfoa and Pfna, which the microbes expelled at rates of up to 58% and 74%, respectively.

Lindell and other study leaders have started a company, Cambiotics, that will develop a probiotic based on their findings. They are planning to follow up the research with a human study.

However, Lindell stressed that the probiotic would not solve the broader Pfas crisis: “This should not be used as an excuse to downplay other sustainable solutions or to not address the bigger Pfas problem.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Fresh plea for funds to repair €26m copy of frigate that carried Louis XVI's promise of aid in war of independence

French maritime enthusiasts are battling to save a replica of an 18th-century warship that became a symbol of the country's historic relationship with America.

The copy of L'Hermione, a three-mast, 32-gun frigate that carried the Marquis de Lafayette across the Atlantic to announce France's support for American independence from Great Britain in the revolutionary war, has been in dry dock at Anglet, near Bayonne, since its oak hull was found to be riddled with fungus four years ago.

Campaigners have raised €5m (£4.3m) to replace part of the rotted structure but say they need another €5m to make the vessel seaworthy again. Despite launching an appeal two years ago, the funds have not been found.

A fresh plea for the remaining funds comes as relations between France and the US enter a stormy period after Donald Trump's threat to impose a 30% tariff on goods from the European Union.

Emilie Beau, the executive director of the Hermione-La Fayette Association, told the Guardian: “We need a generous patron and we now have very little time to find one. It has been three years in dry dock and its 1,200 tonnes of wood needs to be in sea water and not dry.

“We have been dampening the hull, but this could lead to the development of even more fungus. We're hoping that if someone comes forward with the funds, we could restart work to repair the hull in September, with a view to sailing again in 2027.”

The replica of L'Hermione, which took 17 years to build and cost €26m, was launched in 2015 and sailed to New York where it was greeted by an enthusiastic crowd.

In 1780, the original ship made the voyage to America to help the revolutionaries led by George Washington in the war of independence. Onboard was Lafayette, Louis XVI's personal envoy to the man who would later become the first US president. Lafayette disembarked in Boston and rode to Washington's headquarters to deliver his message of French aid to the rebels.

L'Hermione – nicknamed the “Ship of Liberty” – spent two years battling the British naval blockade before returning to France. In 1793, she ran aground off western France and sank. The wreck was discovered in 1984.

In 1992 a group of maritime history enthusiasts set up the Hermione-La Fayette Association to oversee the construction of a replica of the 66-metre-long ship at the former royal shipyard at Rochefort, using historic techniques but to modern standards to enable the ship to be certified to sail.

The plans for L'Hermione had been lost, but her sister ship the Concorde had been captured by the British navy in the 1790s, and detailed drawings and measurements of the vessel, a jigsaw of more than 400,000 pieces of wood and iron, were found at the Admiralty in London.

Unlike the original, the replica has modern navigation equipment and electric motors for manoeuvring in and out of ports. It was also fitted with showers and toilets, as opposed to a plank of wood with holes in it near the prow that the original crew would have used. The replica cannon are fake; otherwise, it would be classed as a warship and come under the control of the French navy.

In 2021, L'Hermione was due to visit the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and the UK, including sailing up the Thames, but after going into dry dock for maintenance before setting sail, workers discovered that the wood at the bow and stern was infested with lenzites and cellar polypore, both wood-decaying fungi.

“What we know about these fungi is that they existed in the 18th century, but back then it took six months to build a ship, and if one didn't come back or rotted, they just built another. Obviously, we cannot do that,” Beau said. “We want to build a ship that lasts longer than they did at the time.”

The association has issued a new international appeal for funds, saying it is “now or never” to save the ship.

“About 10% of the hull wood was damaged; we have replaced the wood in the rear part but now we urgently need €5m to complete the work,” Beau said. “L'Hermione is a symbolic, historical ship. It is not only a chef-d'oeuvre of technical achievement but it was called the frigate of liberty and carried the values of freedom and solidarity between peoples.

“Today it is a symbol of peace and humanity, and in the current difficult period our countries are going through, it represents diplomatic relations and common values. We don't want to lose that.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Absence of French president makes it less likely there will be announcement of recognition of a Palestinian state

A UN summit on a two-state solution for Palestine and Israel – postponed by the Israel-Iran war – has been rescheduled for 28 and 29 July, but it is not expected that the French president, Emmanuel Macron, will attend, making it less likely that it will trigger a series of high-profile announcements on recognition of a Palestinian state.

Macron, who last week told UK parliamentarians a two-state solution was “the only way to build peace and stability for all in the whole region”, has been trying to build momentum for recognition of a state of Palestine by a wide group of countries, but the lack of movement in ceasefire negotiations between Hamas and Israel is making such decisions more complex.

Israel and the US both oppose recognition of a Palestinian state, and have been advising UN delegations not to attend the UN conference in New York. Israel has said that recognition would be seen as a reward for Hamas terrorism.

The conference originally slated for June was postponed when the Israeli attack on Iran created a security crisis across the Middle East. The conference has a set of working parties that are designed to ease the path to a two-state solution, including plans for future Palestinian governance, economic renewal and challenging the narratives of hate.

French sources insisted decisions on recognition had not been made, and a subsequent event in Paris would provide the platform.

Recognition was discussed last week at the Anglo-French summit, where Macron made two public appeals without setting a timetable. Macron called for recognition in his speech to UK parliamentarians and in his closing press conference. “With Gaza in ruin and the West Bank being attacked on a daily basis, the perspective of a Palestinian state has never been put at risk as it is,” he told MPs.

“And this is why this solution of the two states and the recognition of the state of Palestine is … the only way to build peace and stability for all in the whole region.”

The joint declaration issued by Macron and the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, simply reaffirmed their commitment to “recognising a Palestinian state, as a contribution to a peace process”. And they pledged to “work together to support its development and the realisation of a two-state solution”.

Le Monde reported at the weekend that neither Macron nor the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, would attend the UN conference, and that the summit would instead be led by foreign ministers.

That does not preclude Macron making his long-trailed announcement at a different point. The French preference has been to make the historic recognition announcement jointly with the UK, and possibly Canada.

Speaking about the issue at length to parliament's foreign affairs select committee, the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, referred to the country's role in shaping the Middle East through the Balfour declaration, saying: “I would prefer that the United Kingdom is part of a process, particularly if you look at the history, including our relationship with Balfour and the two communities that were effectively brought together at the birth of the Israeli state.”

He added: “A ceasefire might be the beginning of a process, and I suspect that our French colleagues are also waiting to see whether there is a ceasefire in the next few days. That would be the beginning of something, particularly if it is a permanent ceasefire and not a pause.”

Lammy said the decisions of some European countries to recently recognise a Palestinian state had not led to changes on the ground in the West Bank and Gaza, but he admitted it was a judgment call and said he had some sympathy with those who argued that the pace of building Israeli settlements on the West Bank was putting the existence of a Palestinian state in question.

He stressed he did not see a wider normalisation between Saudi Arabia and Israel taking place unless Israel made some concession on the recognition of Palestine.

“From my conversations with the Saudis and the Saudi foreign minister, normalisation will be impossible to achieve until there is a ceasefire and unless there is tangible progress on two states. Frankly, I commend my Saudi counterparts for holding true to that,” he told MPs.

Separately, foreign ministers from Israel and Palestine are expected to attend a dinner in Brussels on Monday.

The Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Saar, and his Palestinian counterpart, Varsen Aghabekian, have both confirmed their attendance at an EU-Southern Neighbourhood ministerial meeting, but it is not clear if they will meet or talk to one another. The aim of the Brussels meeting is to strengthen relations between the EU and its 10 partner countries in the Mediterranean region.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Russia is actively increasing its influence across African countries, using propaganda networks such as the Russian state information agency TASS and state-owned news outlet RT, Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) said on July 13. 

As of July 13, the channel, widely acknowledged as a Kremlin propaganda machine, is broadcast in more than 40 African countries in six languages, according to HUR's statement on social media.

In June 2025, RT began to produce content in Portuguese for the markets of Mozambique and Angola. By the end of the year, the channel plans to launch broadcasting in Amharic for the audience in Ethiopia, HUR says.

“Russian propaganda is a global threat that works for one purpose — the aggressor's territorial, resource and cultural expansion,” said HUR spokesperson Andrii Yusov in a statement.

Over the past 2 years RT has increased the number of its African partner TV channels twofold, — from 30 to 60. 

RT had also implemented educational programs for local journalists, training over a thousand media professionals according to Russian standards in 2024, according to HUR. In June 2025, full-time training began in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, and plans are underway to scale up similar programs to other countries. 

TASS also plans to develop its networks by opening correspondent bureaus in Ethiopia, Senegal, Algeria, Congo, and other African countries. According to the statement, the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) controls the recruitment of personnel for the bureaus.

Last year, the U.S. claimed that RT was collaborating with Russian intelligence to target countries globally amid a heavy-handed crackdown on the Kremlin's disinformation campaigns. 

Tech giant Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, banned Russian state-run media outlets like RT and Rossiya Segodnya from its sites last year over “foreign interference activity,” which didn't significantly impact its influence, according to experts. 

According to Bloomberg, Interpol in Botswana launched an investigation for possible involvement with human trafficking in 2025 into a work-study program 'Alabuga start,' which sent African women to work in Russia, most likely on the military production.

Russian companies had also recruited hundreds of young African women from over 40 countries to work in factories producing military drones in Russia, and plan to recruit thousands more in 2025.

High above the green slopes of Kyiv and the broad, flowing Dnipro River, two of Ukraine's most iconic symbols stand tall: a huge blue-and-yellow flag, visible across the city, and a trident newly engraved on the steel shield of the 100-meter-tall Motherland Monument.

The trident, known in Ukrainian as tryzub, is instantly recognizable as the central element of Ukraine's modern coat of arms. But beyond its official role, the tryzub has taken on profound symbolic meaning in recent years amid Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine — one for which some Ukrainians have been killed or tortured simply for displaying. 

Reports from occupied territories describe Russian forces strip-searching and targeting civilians for patriotic tattoos, particularly those featuring the Ukrainian flag or the tryzub. Ukrainian soldiers returning from Russian captivity have recounted beatings and torture specifically targeting those who had tryzub tattoos. 

In contested towns near the front, where many locals have fled or been forced into hiding, graffiti of the tryzub signals the presence — and continued fight — of Ukrainian troops defending their homeland. 

The trident has been a symbol of power in numerous ancient cultures. It is famously associated with the Greek god Poseidon and the Hindu god Shiva, and it appears in the insignias of various modern military organizations, including the Hellenic Navy, the U.S. Navy SEALs, and the Nepalese Army. 

In Ukraine, the symbol's history stretches back millennia. Archaeological evidence shows that the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture, which thrived in the 4th-3rd millennia BC in parts of modern-day western Ukraine, Moldova, and northeastern Romania, often used trident-like imagery on their pottery, which for them symbolized air, water, and earth. 

More than a thousand years ago, the trident gained prominence as the ancestral sign of the ancient rulers of Kyivan Rus, particularly the Rurik dynasty. In the 10th century, seals bearing tridents were used by envoys of Prince Ihor in treaties with the Byzantine Empire. The coins of Prince Volodymyr the Great featured his portrait and a trident — his symbol of power.

Over time, various princes of the Rurik dynasty modified the trident to reflect their own identities, resulting in over 200 known variations. Archaeologists have discovered these versions on coins, seals, jewelry, bricks, and murals dating from the 10th to 12th centuries.

As Ukraine's medieval landscape changed, the trident fell out of official use. By the time it was rediscovered in the late 19th century through the excavation of Kyivan Rus coins, historians began calling it the modern-day word ""tryzub.""

The tryzub experienced a revival in 1917, following the collapse of the Russian Empire and the emergence of the Ukrainian People's Republic (UNR). The new republic adopted the tryzub as a national symbol and printed it on its currency — ""karbovanets"" — in a design by Ukrainian artist Heorhii Narbut. In 1918, the UNR official declared it the state emblem, honoring it as ""the sign of the Kyiv State of the times of Volodymyr the Holy.”

But Ukraine's fledgling independence was short-lived. Within two years, the Soviet Red Army occupied Ukraine, ushering in decades of repression. Under Soviet rule, Ukrainian national symbols were banned, patriotism was criminalized, cultural leaders were persecuted or executed, and millions perished during man-made famines in the 1920s–1930s — events collectively known as the Holodomor. 

Throughout this era, the tryzub was forbidden and labeled a nationalist threat. Yet, in exile, the Ukrainian diaspora kept the symbol alive. It appeared on the insignias of the exiled UNR government, the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), and various cultural and community groups. 

During World War II, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UIA) — a military force formed by the OUN to fight for the establishment of an independent Ukrainian state — also adopted the tryzub in its fight for national independence.

After Ukraine declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, the tryzub entered a new era of significance. On Feb. 19, 1992, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's parliament, approved it as the Small State Emblem of Ukraine, making it one of the three official state symbols.  

The tryzub's status is enshrined in Article 20 of the Ukrainian Constitution, which states that the Small State Emblem of Ukraine — a gold trident — is “the Sign of the Princely State of Volodymyr the Great,"" affirming the continuity of Ukrainian statehood.

Despite its long history, the exact origin and meaning of the tryzub remain open to interpretation. Many theories have emerged, though none are officially confirmed. 

Some theories suggest it is a mystical sign of protection or a symbol of dominion over the three realms: heaven, earth, and the underworld. Others interpret it as resembling a Scythian scepter, a bow with arrows, an anchor, a crown, or a stalk of rye. 

A Christian interpretation sees it as a stylized dove — a symbol of the Holy Spirit — while a popular culture theory links it to a falcon diving downwards. This imagery may stem from ancient Slavic pagan mythology, where the falcon represented a deity named Raroh. Falcons have remained a recurring motif in Ukrainian heraldry and folklore. 

The official color scheme — a golden trident on a blue field — aligns with Ukraine's national colors, which date back to the Kyivan Rus era. The modern design of the tryzub is based on a 1918 version by artist Vasyl Krychevskyi, created for the Ukrainian People's Republic.

In recent years, amid Russia's ongoing war, one interpretation has especially resonated: that the shape of the tryzub contains the letters of the Ukrainian word ""ВОЛЯ"" as it is written with the Ukrainian Cyrillic alphabet (""volia"" in English transliteration), meaning both ""will"" and ""freedom.""

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his nation would ""unconditionally"" support Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine in a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on July 12. 

Lavrov met with Kim in the eastern city of Wonsan during a three-day visit to North Korea . 

Kim told Lavrov that his country stands ""ready to unconditionally support and encourage all the measures taken by the Russian leadership as regards the tackling of the root cause of the Ukrainian crisis,"" North Korea's state news agency reported. 

The meeting took place in ""an atmosphere full of warm comradely trust,"" the agency said. 

Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Kremlin officials have frequently referred to the so-called ""root causes"" of the war as a justification for their maximalist territorial ambitions in Ukraine and for continuing to reject international calls for a ceasefire. 

Russia and North Korea have intensified their military alliance over the course of the war. Pyongyang has supplied troops and weapons to Moscow, reportedly in exchange for economic, military, and technological assistance. The two countries signed a defense treaty in June 2024. 

North Korea, which sent around 11,000 soldiers to Russia's Kursk Oblast last year to help fend off a Ukrainian incursion, is now preparing to set an additional 25,000-30,000 soldiers to join Russian forces, CNN reported on July 2.

During a meeting with his North Korean counterpart Choe Son Hui on July 12, Lavrov expressed gratitude for North Korean troops and support for the country's nuclear program. He also said he would work to facilitate expanded Russian tourism in North Korea. 

Lavrov warned the U.S., South Korea, and Japan against forming a security partnership targeting North Korea. The three countries have been expanding and restoring trilateral military exercises in response to growing alarm over North Korea's nuclear program.

Firefighters in the northeastern region were searching for two people who were reportedly swept away by floodwaters. The torrential rainfall has also disrupted transport services in and around Barcelona.

Two people were missing Saturday after torrential rains and floods in Catalonia in northeastern Spain.

Firefighters said they were searching along the banks and mouth of the Foix river for two people who went missing near the town of Cubelles, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Barcelona. 

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez called for ""great caution"" and urged people to avoid unnecessary travel in 10 northern and eastern regions that were on high alert on Saturday.

""We are closely monitoring the situation in several communities with warnings for heavy rains and storms,"" Sanchez wrote on X.

The prime minister said troops from the Military Emergency Unit (UME) had already been deployed to municipalities in Aragon.

The national weather service, Aemet, said 10 centimeters (four inches) had fallen near Barcelona in a matter of hours.

Catalonia and the neighboring region of Aragon were under a red ""extreme risk"" alert due to rains that could see up to 60 liters per square meter fall in one hour, according to Aemet.

As a precautionary measure, Renfe, Spain's rail company, briefly suspended services throughout Catalonia on Saturday.

In Barcelona, roads were blocked, while a hospital had to refuse patients after it flooded.

A plane that took off from the city for the United States was forced to turn back after sustaining damage to its nose in a hail storm.

In October 2024, heavy rains and devastating floods in the eastern region of Valencia killed 225 people in the worst meteorological disaster in Spain in decades.

That rain storm, like the one currently affecting the country, was caused by a weather phenomenon known in Spain as a ""cold drop"" or DANA (Isolated Depression at High Levels), in which a mass of cold air drops over the warmer waters of the Mediterranean Sea.

Kyiv has recently suffered the most intense bombing it has seen since Russia began its full-scale invasion three years ago. What does Vladimir Putin hope to achieve — and how can the destruction be stopped?

On Friday morning, Russia carried out another drone attack on Odessa. The Ukrainian army's territorial recruitment center and residential buildings were hit, local media reported.

A day earlier, at least two people were killed in a massive overnight attack that targeted several districts in the capital Kyiv. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said an ambulance station was destroyed.

The damage is part of a series of sweeping combined attacks that included what Ukrainian media called a ""night from hell"" in Kyiv on July 4, when the Russian army deployed more than 500 drones, in addition to Kinzhal and Iskander missiles.

As a result, even US President Donald Trump, who had previously seen himself as a mediator in the conflict, declared that he was disappointed with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""We get a lot of bullshit thrown at us by Putin,"" Trump said. ""He's very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless.""

Shortly after these remarks, the US resumed deliveries of artillery shells and mobile rocket artillery missiles to Ukraine, news agency Reuters reported.

Thanks to the expansion of its drone production, Russia is now in a position to carry out this level of attacks. It is no longer dependent on Iran as it was back in 2022.

""They're currently producing thousands a month,"" military technology expert David Hambling told DW. ""That might make it up to tens of thousands, and that's simply enough to swamp most forms of defense that would take out missiles.""

Still, Colonel Markus Reisner from the Austrian Armed Forces told DW that Russia would not have the capacity carry out such attacks without the help of other countries. China supplies drone parts and North Korea delivers ballistic missiles, he added. ""You can see that Russia is relying on supporters here,"" he said.

Following the recent attack on Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told news portal NV that the intensified shelling was a result of Putin's wish for ""people to suffer and flee Ukraine, to see houses, schools — life itself — destroyed everywhere, not just on the front line.""

The New York Times, citing sources close to the Kremlin, reported that this is how Russia intends to break Ukraine's defenses in the coming months.

Colonel Reisner said that Putin has two strategic aims with his latest combined attacks: to destroy Ukraine's military-industrial complex and to influence the Ukrainian public.

""Targeted attacks on the population, which is intended to be further weakened by terror, are thus an indirect attempt to exert pressure on the Ukrainian government,"" Reisner said.

Many military experts like German political scientist Andreas Heinemann-Grüder expect Russia to launch a new offensive this summer. He sees the increasing number of combined attacks as part of this campaign.

Russia's goal is to incapacitate Ukrainian air defenses to such an extent that the losses cannot be offset by supplies from Western countries, he said. The attacks could also signal that Russia is preparing for a ""decisive battle,"" he added, saying that he could not rule out the possibility that Russia could corner Ukraine into subordinating to the Kremlin's demands by around year's end.

The experts who spoke to DW all said that more decisive action from the West would be necessary to reclaim control on the battlefield. At the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome this week Zelenskyy also said that while Ukraine had found a solution to fend off Russian attacks in interceptor drones, his country's defense sector remains in urgent need of investment.

Ukraine is now achieving good results in the production of its own drones, but still cannot do without support, Colonel Reisner said. ""It needs support from the West, especially for special weapons systems, such as the Patriot anti-aircraft missiles,"" he said.

This week, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that Germany was prepared to buy Patriot systems from the US for Ukraine.

To provide truly effective aid, the West must overcome fears that the weapons supplied to Ukraine could fall into Russian hands, political scientist Heinemann-Grüder said. Were that to happen, Western arms companies would worry about losing their technological edge, he explained. Another concern is that establishing joint ventures with Ukraine could drive down prices for their products.

""These kinds of thoughts need to be overcome,"" Heinemann-Grüder said.

A shambolic 4-1 defeat to Sweden did not stop Germany from qualifying for the Euro 2025 knockouts. But it further revealed a number of significant issues that coach Christian Wück must address quickly.

It all started so well for Germany. Lea Schüller had twice gone close before she dropped deep and found Carlotta Wamser, replacing injured captain Giulia Gwinn at right back, who weighted a perfect through ball for Jule Brand to score the seventh minute opener. With Klara Bühl a constant threat, Germany's attack was fluid and menacing.

Less than half an hour later, nobody was thinking about their attack. First, a heavy touch from Wamser and a total dereliction of duty from the rest of the German defense allowed Stina Blackstenius to run unchallenged in to the box and score. Next, a sharp run from Smilla Holmberg ended with a fortunate deflection to give Sweden the lead.

Though their tournament progression was all but assured before the game, Germany panicked. Goalkeeper Ann-Kathrin Berger, the most experienced of Germany's defense, gave a simple pass to opponent Johanna Rytting Kaneryd and got away with it. Moments later, Rytting Kaneryd was in again, this time finding Fridolina Rolfö whose shot was stopped by the hands of Wamser. The makeshift fullback was sent off, and Rolfö scored the resulting penalty.

""There was a sequence of behavior that wasn't good, we have to work on that,"" said Germany coach Christian Wück: ""The goal wasn't to concede four goals. That should be clear to everyone. We have to draw our conclusions from that.""

Though the speed of the implosion was a surprise, Germany's defensive frailties were clear from their wins against Poland and Denmark earlier in the group stage. Partly this is an issue of personnel. Berger, at 34, was a backup to Merle Frohms before her retirement, Wamser has spent most of her nascent career playing further forward and center back Rebecca Knaak, substituted at halftime, has just 7 caps at the age of 29.

Wück has put his faith in Knaak, who had not played for her country until his appointment last year, but now must decide whether to replace her with Kathrin Hendrich, a 33-year-old who has been a regular in the German squad for some time and has plenty of tournament experience.

His decision to omit another former Germany regular, leftback Felicitas Rauch, from the tournament squad will also now come under further scrutiny. ""Not picking me is one thing. Not informing me and not even giving me a reason is something I simply don't understand. I would like to see much more transparent communication here,"" the 29-year-old wrote on Instagram after she was left out.

The absence of star defensive midfielder Lena Oberdorf is also starting to be felt, with Sjoeke Nüskens and Elisa Senss struggling to control matches for 90 minutes.

Wück cut his teeth with Germany's male youth teams and the scrutiny of a major tournament is a new challenge for him.

In his time as senior women's coach so far, he has tried to introduce a progressive style of play building up from the back, often most evident in how much Berger plays out with the ball. His tactics also often oblige his defenders to deal with opponents in one on one situations when faced with counterattacks.

While debutants Poland and a limited Danish side weren't able to take advantage of that, World Cup semifinalists Sweden were, adding a fourth when Lina Hurtig was allowed to tap in unchallenged on 80 minutes.

It is only the second time Germany, who have won the tournament a record eight times, have lost a group game and the first time they have conceded four in a Euros macth. But Wück was defiant. ""We are down but we will get up again. It will take a few hours and then we will look forward to the quarterfinal,"" he said.

With Wamser now suspended from the round of 16 match against the winners of group D (England, France or the Netherlands, who all play on Sunday), Berger looking shaky and Knaak struggling with the Swedes, Wück has some big decisions to make, even if they do only take a few hours.

			Conflicts over Epstein, Iran airstrikes and immigration have engulfed the president's supporters but he still keeps his movement in check

When it matters, only Donald Trump can pull the Maga movement back from the brink.

Since Mr Trump returned to the White House in January, his support base has been engulfed by rows on everything from Jeffrey Epstein to launching airstrikes on Iran. But each time the US president has been there to paper over the cracks appearing in his coalition.

Last month, Nato chief Mark Rutte described Mr Trump as a “daddy” who “has to sometimes use strong language” to keep his team in check.

Mr Rutte was talking about the Middle East, but it could easily describe the Republican's role as the patriarch of the Maga movement. And while that family might squabble like any other, it's rare for any of them to become permanently estranged.

Or maybe Mr Trump's instincts stem from his time as a real estate developer in New York City. “Know your market” is one of the key lessons from his 1987 memoir, The Art of the Deal.

Either way, Maga is woven together by a strange mix of personality and ideology, and many GOP strategists doubt it can survive when Mr Trump finally exits the political stage.

Asked what held the movement together, Dave Carney, a veteran Republican operative who worked on George H W Bush and Bob Dole's presidential campaigns, said simply: “president Trump.”

There were early signs of trouble when Mr Trump decided to accept a $400 million luxury jet gifted from Qatar to serve as Air Force One, something which united moderates and the Maga faithful in condemnation.

Taking a plane from a country accused of sponsoring extremist groups that include Hamas and Hezbollah, and which Mr Trump had labelled “funders of terrorism” a few years ago, proved too much for some to swallow.

Laura Loomer, the Right-wing activist at the centre of many of the Maga rows, was bitterly disappointed in the decision.

Once she declared she would take a bullet for the president. But in May she called the jet a “stain” on the Trump administration, declaring: “We cannot accept a $400 million ‘gift' from jihadists in suits.”

Recommended

Conservative radio host Mark Levin agreed, while Ben Shapiro, the co-founder of the Daily Wire and a prominent Maga voice, accused Mr Trump of abandoning his “America First” movement.

But the president rode out the turbulence and still got his plane. He held off on direct criticisms of allies and even seems to have launched a charm offensive, calling Ms Loomer shortly afterwards, who apologised for “jumping to conclusions”.

Mr Trump knows how to pick his battles, and unite his restless base against a common enemy rather than letting them turn against themselves.

Many prominent Maga voices, scarred by military quagmires in Iraq and Afghanistan, were sceptical when he launched air strikes on Iran's nuclear sites last month using “bunker-busting bombs”.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, the firebrand Republican congresswoman, declared she was “sick” of foreign wars and urged Mr Trump to focus on domestic issues like the “invasion” of the US's borders by illegal immigrants.

And Steve Bannon, Mr Trump's former White House chief strategist, warned the strikes would not have been what “a lot of Maga wanted to hear”.

“If they hit back at American troops, do we go back in and hit again? Next thing you know, brother, you're in a forever war,” he said on his “War Room” podcast.

Opinion

Mr Trump held off and instead picked a fight with someone outside Maga – Thomas Massie, a Republican congressman who hails more from the party's libertarian tradition.

In a 300-word diatribe on his Truth Social account, the president labelled the Kentucky congressman “not Maga” and a “simple-minded grandstander”, declaring he planned to campaign against him in next year's primaries.

“Maga doesn't want him, doesn't know him, and doesn't respect him,” he said.

Brian Darling, a Republican strategist who is a “big fan” of Mr Massie and worked for fellow Kentuckian Rand Paul, believes focusing Maga supporters against a common enemy proved an effective strategy.

“Donald Trump picks fights with members of his own party and he intimidates them,” he added. “Many times he will threaten primaries and he'll just browbeat Republican members of Congress to get in line.”

Mr Trump was also helped by effective surrogates who could sell the Iran strikes, like the vice-president, JD Vance, who insisted the president had been “consistent” on Iran his whole career.

And the Right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, when Mr Trump suggested Iran should undergo regime change, insisted he was talking about a “bottom-up revolution” rather than decapitating its leadership.

Surrogates can also be important human shields, as the president's top law enforcement lieutenants have found out to their cost over the botched handling of the Epstein files.

Kash Patel and Dan Bongino, the director and deputy director of the FBI, had spent years playing into conspiracies about a “black book” owned by Jeffrey Epstein, the paedophile and disgraced financier.

Attorney general Pam Bondi, meanwhile, claimed in February that his “client list” was on her desk, “ready to review”.

But this month the FBI and justice department concluded, in a memo seen by Axios, there was no client list and Epstein – rather than being silenced by the “deep state” of shadowy figures controlling the government – killed himself in a Manhattan jail cell.

“Pam Bondi fed a monster,” said Matthew Bartlett, a Republican operative who worked for the first Trump administration in the State Department. “And now there's a chance that the monster eats her.”

He still believes the issue is damaging for Mr Trump because it goes beyond a policy debate to the “much more compelling” issue of: “I don't believe my government is telling me the truth.”

But for now most of the heat seems to be taken by Ms Bondi and the FBI duo, who don't have the same Teflon quality as the president or the same regard of the Maga base. Dan Bongino, the FBI deputy director, has been so affected by the fallout, he is considering resigning.

On immigration, the administration has been dragged in opposite directions by the demands of hawkish Maga voices while Big Tech and farmers worry about their workforce.

It burst to the fore in December in a row between Mr Bannon and Elon Musk, then a chief ally of Mr Trump's, over H1-B visas for highly-skilled immigrants. There was so much bad blood between the two men that Mr Bannon threatened to “rip his f—ing face off”.

Mr Trump sided with Mr Musk at the time but has also embarked on a mass deportation drive while aggressively stamping out illegal immigration.

And on the issue of migrant workers on farms, the administration is creating a temporary visa programme to fill jobs. Both the president and the White House has aggressively pushed back on suggestions the move is “amnesty” or “amnesty lite”.

Another factor in Mr Trump's favour is that the Democrats, having lost the White House, Senate, and House of Representatives in November, are in such disarray they aren't threatening to erode his base of support.

The president “is one lucky motherf----r”, said Mr Carney. “His opponents are so bad, it makes his successes look even better.”

Mr Bannon claims there are three pillars of Maga: restricting free trade, limiting immigration and ending the “forever wars”.

But there is something that underpins all of that: Mr Trump.

Danielle Vinson, a professor of politics at Furman University in South Carolina, said the movement was not “ideologically consistent” or “monolithic” on issues.

“Maga is largely a cult of personality, so as long as Trump is president, he will have their support,” she said.

“Not everyone in Maga cares about all these issues equally. Maga is more about style than substance, and Maga is really primarily about Trump.”

Trump is pushing for cuts that could require 350 of the 433 sites run by the National Park Service to shut down. 

Did you know that Truthout is a nonprofit and independently funded by readers like you? If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation.

If there is one thing Americans love, it's our national parks. A record-setting 331 million people visited the 63 national parks in 2024 — a number roughly equivalent to the entire U.S. population. Park visitors spend tens of billions each year on lodging, restaurants, and travel expenses, significantly boosting local economies. The National Park Service is the most popular government agency, with just 7 percent of polled Americans rating it as unfavorable. And the people want it funded: Just 17 percent of polled U.S. residents support reducing funding for the National Park Service and other agencies that manage federal lands.

Yet none of this has deterred Donald Trump and congressional Republicans from seeking to devastate the National Park Service.

Trump's proposed FY 2026 budget would slash $1.2 billion from the National Park Service budget — the largest proposed cut in the agency's 109-year history, according to the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA), a nonprofit advocacy organization. Trump's budget proposes cuts to National Park Service recreation and preservation programs, natural resource programs, and cultural programs, as well as cutting both seasonal positions and more than 5,500 full-time roles.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

NPCA estimates that cuts of this magnitude would require the elimination of 350 of the 433 sites run by the National Park Service, which in addition to the 63 national parks, include historic sites, monuments, battlefields, preserves, seashores, and more. The Center for American Progress calculated the cuts would amount to an inflation-adjusted 55 percent reduction in spending per visitor from 2011.

Even some congressional Republicans expressed concerns over the austerity of Trump's National Park Service budget — although they proposed cuts of their own. The reconciliation bill, which passed the Senate on July 1, rescinds $267 million in funding from the Inflation Reduction Act earmarked for the National Park Service.

The budget cuts are just the latest in a string of attacks on the agency. From inauguration through May 21, NPCA tracked 56 actions from the Trump administration that damage national parks and public lands, noting that “the list of attacks feels endless.”

Many of these attacks involve staff reductions. The National Park Service has lost an estimated 13 percent of its staff since January, through a combination of layoffs, pressured buyouts, and hiring freezes. This has battered an agency that already lost 20 percent of its staff between 2010 and 2023, thanks to underfunding.

To top it off, the Department of the Interior, which oversees the National Park Service and 10 other agencies, is being run by DOGE.

In April, Trump's Secretary of the Interior, Doug Burgum, the ultra-wealthy former governor of North Dakota, handed over significant control of the Department to Tyler Hassen, who initially came to the Department of the Interior as a DOGE operative. In a secretarial order, Burgum authorized Hassen to make policy decisions, transfer funds, and make staffing changes.

Cuts of this magnitude would require the elimination of 350 of the 433 sites run by the National Park Service.

Hassen has no government experience. He spent two decades as an executive at an oil rig company, where he made nearly $4 million annually. According to the AP, Burgum changed Hassen's title from “assistant secretary” to “principal deputy assistant secretary,” a loophole that allows him to skirt rules banning conflicts of interest and requiring Senate confirmation. Kathleen Clark, a government ethics expert at Washington University in St. Louis, told the AP this amounts to fraud.

“Delegating sweeping authorities and responsibilities to a non-Senate confirmed person in violation of the Vacancies Reform Act is baffling and extremely troubling,” Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico wrote in a May letter to Burgum.

“If Doug Burgum doesn't want this job, he should quit now,” said Jennifer Rokala, executive director of the Center for Western Priorities, in a statement. “Instead, it looks like Burgum plans to sit by the fire eating warm cookies while Elon Musk's lackeys dismantle our national parks and public lands.” (Burgum has allegedly requested Department of the Interior employees to bake cookies for him and his guests.)

Rokala continued: “DOGE's unelected bureaucrats in Washington have no idea how to staff a park, a wildlife refuge, or a campground. They have no idea how to manage a forest or prepare for fires in the wildland-urban interface. But Doug Burgum just gave DOGE free rein over all of that.”

In April, Hassen attempted to fire Anthony Irish, an attorney who had been with the Interior for two decades, after Irish expressed concerns about giving DOGE access to a personnel payroll system. Irish was placed on investigative leave.

In a January survey of voters from eight Western states, conducted by the State of the Rockies Project, 87 percent (including the vast majority of Republicans) said that decisions about public lands should be made by career professionals such as rangers, scientists, and fire fighters, not appointed outsiders from other industries.

Yet, under Trump, the appointed outsiders are in charge, while the National Park Service sheds career professionals in droves.

National Park Service staffing levels were first hit by the administration's 90-day hiring freeze in January, which has been extended. The Department of the Interior also offered multiple rounds of pressured buyouts. And in February, the administration fired 1,000 probationary employees who had been in their roles for less than a year. Although they were later reinstated by a federal judge, the Department of the Interior appealed the decision and delayed rehiring, and ultimately not all returned to work.

Burgum testified before the Senate Appropriations subcommittee in May that the park service had “about 26,500 people.” Yet a Washington Post review of internal Interior data found there were actually 18,066 full-time and seasonal employees. And while there were just 448 people working in IT and HR positions across the entire Park Service, Burgum further claimed: “We got several thousand people working in IT, and I don't know what they do.”

Since the various National Park Service cuts and staff reductions went into place this year, visitors have encountered closed ranger stations, campgrounds, lakefronts, and bathrooms. Some parks have warned that search and rescue efforts will be delayed.

The cuts would amount to an inflation-adjusted 55 percent reduction in spending per visitor from 2011.

Staff reductions only amplify the many dangers caused by the climate crisis. Temperatures are rising twice as fast in national parks, which tend to be in climate sensitive regions, than in the country as a whole. This means a bare-bones National Park Service staff is dealing with more wildfires, as well as more guests suffering from dehydration, heat stroke, and heat-induced heart attacks. Yet, the Trump administration is doing everything in its power to deny and accelerate climate change.

Starting in June, the National Park Service added signage with QR codes to national parks around the country, asking visitors to report language in the parks that is “negative about either past or living Americans or that fails to emphasize the beauty, grandeur, and abundance of landscapes.” This followed a Trump executive order calling for federal lands to remove information that could “inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures.”

It isn't the first attempt to erase history at National Park Service sites. In February, the agency removed references to queer and transgender people from the Stonewall National Monument website.

But if the National Park Service assumed park visitors would be eager to help with the censorship project, they were wrong. In fact, the first nearly 200 visitor submissions contained not one sincere suggestion, according to an analysis by the publication, Government Executive. Instead, most submitters criticized the project, writing comments like: “The entire purpose of parks like this one is to learn from the mistakes of the past so we can avoid repeating them. Please do not water down the reality of the experience for future visitors.”

Destroying the National Park Service is just the first step toward privatization of the parks, warned former National Park Service Director Jonathan B. Jarvis and Gary Machlis, a former science adviser to the director, in a May op-ed in The Guardian. After slashing the budget and workforce, they predicted, “the administration will claim the private sector can better run (read ‘exploit') the parks that the administration purposely set up to fail.” Their op-ed paints a grim picture of national parks marred with resorts, “ticketed bison petting zoos,” zip lines, and golf courses.

While these fears have not yet come to fruition, Trump and his allies do appear determined to sell off and privatize public land. In March, Trump issued executive orders calling for increased timber production and increased mining on federal land. In April, his USDA rolled back Biden protections, opening thousands of acres of land in Nevada and New Mexico for drilling and mining.

The AP reviewed a draft copy of the Department of the Interior's new strategic plan, which includes increasing “clean coal, oil, and gas production through faster permitting,” and reducing regulations to “generate more revenue from lands and resources for the U.S. Treasury.”

In one high-profile attempt at privatizing public land, Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah attempted to use the budget reconciliation bill to force the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service to sell between 2.2 and 3.3 million acres of public land within five years, while making more than 250 million additional acres available for sale. When his proposal was stripped from the bill by the Senate's parliamentarian, Lee inserted a scaled-back version, which he ultimately withdrew in the face of opposition from several western Republican senators.

While advocates celebrated the removal of Lee's proposals, other public land remains under threat. The Idaho Capital Sun noted in July that public land advocates are “fighting a multifront battle” as the Trump administration seeks to revoke environmental protections; roll back protected statuses; and expand logging, mining and drilling operations. Referring to Lee's proposal, the paper cautioned: “Given the vocal backlash to the initial sell-off plan, advocates expect future attempts to be shaped behind closed doors and advanced with little time for opponents to mount a defense.”

In the State of the Rockies Project survey, respondents overwhelmingly want Congress to prioritize conservation over energy development on national public lands, and oppose selling public land for housing development. Yet public opinion on the parks and federal land seems to matter little to Trump and his conservative allies.

This marks a shift even from Trump's first term, when he signed the bipartisan Great American Outdoors Act, which provided billions in funding for the national parks system. At the bill's signing, Trump called himself “the same or almost as good” a conservationist as Theodore Roosevelt. In fact, Interior Secretary Burgum also venerates the 26th president; Politico called him a “Teddy Roosevelt stan” whose pet legislative project as North Dakota Governor was the creation of a Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library.

Yet, Trump and Burgum's ongoing decimation of the National Parks Service prioritizes short-sighted spending cuts over Roosevelt's vision of the parks as a treasure to protect for future generations.

“Leave it as it is. You can not improve on it,” Roosevelt said of the Grand Canyon in 1903, which he designated as a national monument. “What you can do is to keep it for your children, your children's children, and for all who come after you, as one of the great sights which every American if he can travel at all should see.”

Trump has announced he will open millions of acres of National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska up to oil and gas companies.

The largest tract of public land in the United States is a wild expanse of tundra and wetlands stretching across nearly 23 million acres of northern Alaska. It's called the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, but despite its industrial-sounding name, the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, or NPR-A, is much more than a fuel depot.

Tens of thousands of caribou feed and breed in this area, which is the size of Maine. Migratory birds flock to its lakes in summer, and fish rely on the many rivers that crisscross the region.

The area is also vital for the health of the planet. However, its future is at risk.

The Trump administration announced a plan on June 17, 2025, to open nearly 82 percent of this fragile landscape to oil and gas development, including some of its most ecologically sensitive areas. 



 Some of the extraordinary wildlife in the wetlands around Teshekpuk Lake, a fragile “special area” in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska that the Trump administration would open to further drilling.

I am an ecologist, and I have been studying sensitive ecosystems and the species that depend on them for over 20 years. Disturbing this landscape and its wildlife could lead to consequences that are difficult – if not impossible – to reverse.

The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska was originally designated in 1923 by President Warren Harding as an emergency oil supply for the U.S. Navy.

In the 1970s, its management was transferred to the Department of Interior under the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act. This congressional act requires that, in addition to managing the area for energy development, the secretary of the interior must ensure the “maximum protection” of “any significant subsistence, recreational, fish and wildlife, or historical or scenic value.”

The Bureau of Land Management is responsible for overseeing the reserve and identifying and protecting areas with important ecological or cultural values – aptly named “special areas.”

The Trump administration now plans to expand the amount of land available for drilling in the NPR-A from about 11.7 million acres to more than 18.5 million acres – including parts of those “special areas” – as part of its effort to increase U.S. oil drilling and reduce regulations on the industry.

I recently worked with scientists and scholars at The Wilderness Society to write a detailed report outlining many of the ecological and cultural values found across the reserve.

The reserve is a sanctuary for many Arctic wildlife, including caribou populations that have experienced sharp global declines in recent years.

The reserve's open tundra provides critical calving, foraging, migratory and winter habitat for three of the four caribou herds on Alaska's North Slope. These herds undertake some of the longest overland migrations on Earth. Infrastructure such as roads and industrial activity can disrupt their movement, further harming the populations' health.

The NPR-A is also globally significant for migratory birds. Situated at the northern end of five major flyways, birds come here from all corners of the Earth, including all 50 states. It hosts some of the highest densities of breeding shorebirds anywhere on the planet.

An estimated 72% of Arctic Coastal Plain shorebirds – over 4.5 million birds – nest in the reserve. This includes the yellow-billed loon, the largest loon species in the world, with most of its U.S. breeding population concentrated in the reserve.

Expanding oil and gas development in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska could threaten these birds by disrupting their habitat and adding noise to the landscape.

Many other species also depend on intact ecosystems there.

Polar bears build dens in the area, making it critical for cub survival. Wolverines, which follow caribou herds, also rely on large, connected expanses of undisturbed habitat for their dens and food. Moose browse along the Colville River, the largest river on the North Slope, while peregrine falcons, gyrfalcons and rough-legged hawks nest on the cliffs above.

A large stretch of the Colville River is currently protected as a special area, but the Trump administration's proposed plan will remove those protections. The Teshekpuk Lake special area, critical habitat for caribou and migrating birds, would also lose protection.

Indigenous communities in the Arctic, particularly the Iñupiat people, also depend on these lands, waters and wildlife for subsistence hunting and fishing. Their livelihoods, food security, cultural identity and spiritual practices are deeply intertwined with the health of this ecosystem.

The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska is vast, and drilling won't occur across all of it. But oil and gas operations pose far-reaching risks that extend well beyond the drill sites.

Infrastructure like roads, pipelines, airstrips and gravel pads fragment and degrade the landscape. That can alter water flow and the timing of ice melt. It can also disrupt reproduction and migration routes for wildlife that rely on large, connected habitats.

Networks of winter ice roads and the way exploration equipment compacts the land can delay spring and early summer thawing patterns on the landscape. That can upset the normal pattern of meltwater, making it harder for shore birds to nest.

ConocoPhillips' Willow drilling project, approved by the Biden administration in 2023 on the eastern side of the reserve, provides some insight into the potential impact: An initial project plan, later scaled back, included up to 575 miles (925 kilometers) of ice roads for construction, an air strip, more than 300 miles (nearly 485 kilometers) of new pipeline, a processing facility, a gravel mine and barge transportation, in addition to five drilling sites.

Many animals will try to steer clear of noise, light and human activity. Roads and industrial operations can force them to alter their behavior, which can affect their health and how well they can reproduce. Research has shown that caribou mothers with new calves avoid infrastructure and that this impact does not lessen over time of exposure.

At Alaska's Prudhoe Bay, the largest oilfield in the U.S., decades of oil development have led to pollution, including hundreds of oil spills and leaks, and habitat loss, such as flooding and shoreline erosion, extensive permafrost thaw and damage from roads, construction and gravel mining. In short, the footprint of drilling is not confined to isolated locations — it radiates outward, undermining the ecological integrity of the region. Permafrost thaw now even threatens the stability of the oil industry's own infrastructure.

The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska and the surrounding Arctic ecosystem also play an outsized role in regulating the global climate.

Vast amounts of climate-warming carbon is currently locked away in the wetlands and permafrost of the tundra, but the Arctic is warming close to three times faster than the global average.

Roads, drilling and development can increase permafrost thaw and cause coastlines to erode, releasing carbon long locked in the soil. In addition, these operations will ultimately add more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, further warming the planet.

The decisions made today will shape the future of the Arctic – and one of the last wild ecosystems in the United States – for generations to come.

The DHS Secretary moved forward with the layoffs immediately after the disaster, as the demand for help was highest.

Outrage continues to grow against U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem over her response to the deadly floods that ravaged Texas last week.

According to a Friday report from The New York Times, more than two-thirds of phone calls to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) from flood victims went unanswered after Noem allowed hundreds of contractors to be laid off on July 5, just a day after the nightmare storm.

According to The Times, this dramatically hampered the ability of the agency to respond to calls from survivors in the following days:

Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day.

On July 5, as floodwaters were starting to recede, FEMA received 3,027 calls from disaster survivors and answered 3,018, or roughly 99.7 percent, the documents show. Contractors with four call center companies answered the vast majority of the calls.

That evening, however, Noem did not renew the contracts with the four companies, and hundreds of contractors were fired, according to the documents and the person briefed on the matter.

The next day, July 6, FEMA received 2,363 calls and answered 846, or roughly 35.8 percent, according to the documents. And on Monday, July 7, the agency fielded 16,419 calls and answered 2,613, or around 15.9 percent, the documents show.

Calling is one of the primary ways that flood victims apply for aid from the disaster relief agency. But Noem would wait until July 10 — five days later — to renew the contracts of the people who took those phone calls.

“Responding to less than half of the inquiries is pretty horrific,” Jeffrey Schlegelmilch, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, told The Times.

“Put yourself in the shoes of a survivor: You've lost everything, you're trying to find out what's insured and what's not, and you're navigating multiple aid programs,” he added. “One of the most important services in disaster recovery is being able to call someone and walk through these processes and paperwork.”

The lapse is a direct result of a policy introduced by Noem last month, which required any payments made by FEMA above $100,000 to be directly approved by her before taking effect. Noem, who has said she wants to eliminate FEMA entirely, described it as a way of limiting “waste, fraud, and abuse.”

Under this policy, Noem allowed other critical parts of the flood response to wait for days as well. Earlier this week, multiple officials within FEMA told CNN that she waited more than 72 hours to authorize the deployment of search and rescue teams and aerial imaging.

Following The Times' piece, DHS put out a statement claiming that “NO ONE was left without assistance, and every call was responded to urgently.”

“When a natural disaster strikes, phone calls surge, and wait times can subsequently increase,” DHS said. “Despite this expected influx, FEMA's disaster call center responded to every caller swiftly and efficiently, ensuring no one was left without assistance. No call center operators were laid off or fired.”

This is undercut, however, by internal emails also obtained by The Times, which showed FEMA officials becoming frustrated and blaming the DHS Secretary for the lack of contracts. One official wrote in a July 8 email to colleagues: “We still do not have a decision, waiver, or signature from the DHS Secretary.”

Democratic lawmakers were already calling for investigations into Noem's response to the floods before Friday. They also sought to look into how the Trump administration's mass firings of FEMA employees, as well as employees of the National Weather Service (NWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) may have hampered the response.

Following The Times‘ revelations, outrage has reached a greater fever pitch.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) called it “unforgivable and unforgettable” and an “inexcusable lapse in top leadership.”

“Sec. Noem shows that dismantling FEMA impacts real people in real time,” he said. “It hurts countless survivors & increases recovery costs.”

In response to the news, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) simply wrote that “Kristi Noem must resign now.”

Others pointed out that Noem has often sought to justify abolishing FEMA by characterizing it as slow and ineffectual. They suggested her dithering response was deliberate.

“She broke it on purpose,” said Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) in an interview on MSNBC. “So that when it fails this summer, she can say, ‘Oh, see, we told you — FEMA doesn't work.'”

“It's not really incompetence because they know what they are doing,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). “They are intentionally breaking government — even the parts that help us when we are deep in crisis.”

SAN FRANCISCO—A group of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents had to force their way through about two dozen protesters on July 8 to escort a detained man through the gate of the San Francisco Immigration Courthouse to a vehicle waiting outside.

“On July 8 protestors violently attacked and obstructed federal ICE officers who were simply doing their job by enforcing our nation's laws. Of course these protestors have zero respect for the rule of law, as they so casually violate it,” an ICE spokesperson said in an email to The Epoch Times.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

            Several children were killed in an Israeli airstrike at a water distribution point in central Gaza Sunday, health officials said, one of several deadly incidents in the territory that come as ceasefire talks in Doha falter.
    


            Hopes had been high for the latest negotiations but after days of negotiations the two sides accused each other of blocking an agreement while on the ground there has been no let-up in Israel's military campaign, which resumed when the last ceasefire collapsed in March.
    


            The Palestinian health ministry reported Sunday that 139 bodies had been brought to Gaza hospitals in the past 24 hours, with a number of victims still under the rubble. The number is the highest reported since July 2 and brings the total number of people killed since October 7, 2023 to 58,026, according to the ministry.
    


            That was before the Israeli airstrike Sunday killed six children and four others at a water distribution point in central Gaza, according to Al-Awda Hospital. Video from the chaotic scene showed multiple casualties including children amid buckets and water carriers.
    


            The Israeli military acknowledged that an airstrike targeting an “Islamic Jihad terrorist” had gone wrong and the “munition fell dozens of meters from the target,” saying the incident was under review.
    


            Also in central Gaza on Sunday, at least 12 people were killed and more than 40 injured when an Israeli airstrike targeted a crowded junction, according to Dr. Mohammed Abu Salmiya, Director of Al-Shifa Medical Complex central Gaza City. The dead included a prominent doctor, Ahmad Qandeel, described by the health ministry as “one of Gaza's most respected medical professionals.”
    


            Sunday's heavy toll followed several deadly incidents Saturday. The ministry said 27 were killed and many more injured when Israeli troops opened fire on people trying to obtain aid from a distribution site near southern Rafah run by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).
    


            GHF denied the claim, saying “there were no incidents at or in the immediate vicinity of our sites” on Saturday.
    


            The Israeli military also denied that anyone was injured by gunfire from its troops in the vicinity of the site but said it continued to review the reports. It told CNN Sunday it had no further comment.
    


            However, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said its field hospital near the site had received 132 patients suffering from weapon-related injuries. Twenty-five were declared dead on arrival and six more died after being admitted – the largest number of fatalities since the hospital began operations in May 2024, according to the ICRC.
    


            “This situation is unacceptable. The alarming frequency and scale of these mass casualty incidents underscore the horrific conditions civilians in Gaza are enduring,” the ICRC added.
    


            Nearly 800 Palestinians were killed while trying to access aid in Gaza between late May and July 7, according to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), when the GHF began operating.
    


            Elsewhere in Gaza, 13 people were killed Saturday in airstrikes in Al-Shati refugee camp near Gaza City, in the north of the territory, according to Mohammed Abu Salmiya, director of Al-Shifa Hospital. Salmiya told CNN that 40 injured people had been admitted. Geolocated video showed at least one child among the victims.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces said Sunday it had destroyed weapons and tunnels used by Hamas in northern Gaza and the air force had carried out attacks on more than 150 targets across the Gaza Strip, including “booby-trapped buildings, weapons depots, anti-tank missile and sniper positions.”
    


            The spike in casualties in Gaza comes as talks on agreeing a new ceasefire deal and hostage continue in Doha, with optimism having faded that an agreement can be quickly reached.
    


            US President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff said Tuesday he was hopeful of a deal by the end of the week.
    


            “We had four issues, and now we're down to one after two days of proximity talks,” Witkoff said.
    


            The same day Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed Gaza at length at the White House.
    


            “We got to get that solved,” Trump said.
    


            But despite days of proximity talks in Doha between Israel and Hamas, significant gaps remain between the warring parties.
    


            An Israeli source familiar with the matter said last week that the outstanding issue was where  the Israeli military would redeploy in Gaza once the ceasefire takes effect. The latest proposal called for the military to withdraw from parts of northern Gaza on the first day of a ceasefire and from parts of southern Gaza on the seventh day.
    


            The detailed maps were left to negotiations between Israel and Hamas, and that appears to be the main sticking point.
    


            The talks had “stalled,” a senior Hamas official told CNN on Saturday, claiming Israel had added new conditions, “the latest being new deployment maps for the Israeli army's presence in the Gaza Strip.”
    


            But an Israeli political source told CNN Saturday that “Israel has shown willingness to be flexible in the negotiations” and that “Hamas remains obstinate, sticking to positions that prevent the mediators from advancing an agreement.”

            Netanyahu is set to meet Sunday with his national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, to discuss the negotiations, according to a source familiar with the matter.
    


            Ben Gvir and finance minister Bezalel Smotrich – the far-right members of Netanyahu's government – have both been vocal critics of any deal with Hamas, instead calling for Israel to cut off aid to Gaza and escalate its war until the militant group is destroyed.
    


            Recent opinion surveys in Israel suggest overwhelming approval for a deal that would end the war and return all the hostages, living and dead. A poll for Israel's Channel 12 Friday said that 74% of the public believes that Israel should end the war in Gaza in exchange for the return of all the abductees in one step, with only 8% supporting the phased deal that the government is trying to promote.
    


            Netanyahu has insisted that Israel has the right to return to combat at the end of the 60-day ceasefire now on the table. Hamas is demanding a pathway to an indefinite cessation of hostilities, with the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.

            Rookie pitcher Jacob Misiorowski has only played five MLB games. But in that short time, the Milwaukee Brewers starlet has produced such impressive performances that he was named a National League All-Star on Friday, an honor he achieved after the fewest MLB games ever.
    


            The 23-year-old was named as a replacement for the Chicago Cubs' Matthew Boyd, who will be inactive since he is expected to start on Saturday against the New York Yankees ahead of Tuesday's All-Star Game.
    


            Wielding a fastball that has reached speeds as high as 103 mph (166 kph), Misiorowski has long been tipped for All Star honors – the only surprise, perhaps, is just how quickly he achieved that.
    


            He only began his MLB career last month, with a streak of 11 no-hit innings, more than any other starter has managed at the start of their career since baseball's modern era began in 1900.
    


            On his five starts for Milwaukee, he has gone 4-1 with a 2.81 ERA. He has averaged 99.3 mph (160 kph) on his fastball, with 89 pitches reaching 100 mph (161 kph).

            Still, Misiorowski said the call-up left him “speechless,” per MLB. Brewers manager Pat Murphy told him just three minutes before he lined up for the national anthem ahead of their 8-3 win over the Washington Nationals on Friday but told him to keep it a secret.
    


            Murphy then announced the news to the entire Brewers team after the game before an emotional Misiorowski addressed his teammates.
    


            “I honestly have no words guys,” he said. “I don't know what to say. It's an honor and, you know, there's a lot of older guys around that have been around for a lot longer than I have so I just wanted to say thank you for all the help you guys have given me to get through these couple of weeks I've been here, it's been huge.”
    


            Misiorowski's selection comes just a year after the Pittsburgh Pirates' Paul Skenes made history by earning All-Star honors 11 games into his MLB career. Before Skenes, three players reached All-Star selection after 13 games – Mark Fidrych in 1976, Hideo Nomo in 1995 and Dontrelle Willis in 2003.
    


            Elsewhere, Seattle Mariners slugger Cal Raleigh took his season total of home runs to 38, breaking the American League record and putting him just one shy of Barry Bonds' MLB record for the most homers hit before the All-Star break.
    


            He hit two home runs on Friday – the second of which was a grand slam – propelling the Mariners to a 12-3 win over the Detroit Tigers.
    


            “Trying to go hit home runs is probably not going to help me,” he said afterward. “I'm going to do my best to stay within myself.”

PRAIRIE ISLAND INDIAN COMMUNITY, Minn. (AP) — Some Native Americans traditionally bestow bald eagle feathers at ceremonies to mark achievements, such as graduations, and as a form of reverence for the bird they hold sacred as a messenger to the Creator.

This year, many are doing so with elevated pride and hope. The bald eagle is now the official bird of the United States, nearly 250 years after it was first used as a symbol of the newly founded nation that's deeply polarized politically today.

“The eagle is finally getting the respect it deserves. Maybe when the nation looks at the eagle that way, maybe there will be less division,” said Jim Thunder Hawk. He's the Dakota culture and language manager for the Prairie Island Indian Community, a small Mdewakanton Sioux band on the banks of the Mississippi River in Minnesota.

This wide, unruffled stretch of water framed by wooded bluffs is prime bald eagle territory. The size of Minnesota's population of the majestic, white-head-and-tail birds that are exclusive to North America is second only to that of Alaska.

The legislation that made the eagle official came from members of Minnesota's Congressional delegation. The federal act recognizes the eagles' centrality in most Indigenous peoples' “spiritual lives and sacred belief systems,” and a replica of it is on display at the National Eagle Center in Wabasha, Minnesota, 40 miles (65 kilometers) downriver from the Prairie Island community, which partners with the center in eagle care.

“If you grew up in the United States, eagles were a part of your everyday life,” said Tiffany Ploehn, who as the center's avian care director supervises its four resident bald eagles. “Everyone has some sort of connection.” 

A bald eagle, its wings and talons spread wide, has graced the Great Seal of the United States since 1782, and appears on passport covers, the $1 bill, military insignia, and myriad different images in pop culture.

But a prolific collector of eagle memorabilia based in Wabasha realized recently that, while the United States had an official animal (the bison) and flower (the rose), the eagle was getting no formal credit. Several Minnesota legislators sponsored a bill to remedy that and then-President Joe Biden's signature made it official in December.

With their massive wingspan and stern curved beak, bald eagles are widely used as symbols of strength and power. In reality, they spend 95% of their day perched high in trees, though when they hunt they can spot a rabbit 3 miles (5 kilometers) away, Ploehn said.

For many Native Americans, the soaring eagle represents far more; it delivers their prayers to the Creator and even intercedes on their behalf.

“My grandma told me that we honor eagles because they saved the Ojibwe people when the Creator wanted to turn on them. The eagle, he can fly high, so he went to speak with the Creator to make things right,” said Sadie Erickson, who is Ojibwe and Mdewakanton Sioux.

Erickson and a dozen other high school graduates received a bald eagle feather at an early July celebration by the riverbank at Prairie Island. 

Thunder Hawk said a prayer in the Dakota language urging the high school graduates and graduates receiving higher education degrees to “always remember who you are and where you come from.”

Then they lined up and a relative tied a feather — traditionally on the left side, the heart's side — as tribal members sang and drummed to celebrate them.

“It just feels like I went through a new step of life,” said Jayvionna Buck.

Growing up on Prairie Island, she recalled her mother excitedly pointing out every eagle.

“She would genuinely just yell at me, ‘Eagle!' But it's just a special occurrence for us to see,” Buck said. “We love seeing it, and normally when we do, we just offer tobacco to show our respects.”

Some Native Americans honor the eagle by taking it as their ceremonial name. Derek Walking Eagle, whose Lakota name is “Eagle Thunder,” celebrated the graduates wearing a woven medallion representing the bird.

To him, eagles are like relatives that connect him to his future and afterlife.

“Being able to carry on to the spirit world … that's who guides you. It's the eagle,” Walking Eagle said.

That deep respect attaches to the feathers, too.

“It's the highest respect you can bestow on a person, from your family and from your people, from your tribe,” Thunder Hawk said. “We teach the person receiving the feather that they have to honor and respect the eagle. And we tell them why.”

In many Native cultures, killing an eagle is “blasphemous,” he said. It is also a federal offense.

Historically, Sioux warriors would lure an eagle with rabbit or other food, pluck a few feathers and release it, said Thunder Hawk, who grew up in South Dakota.

Today, there's a nationwide program that legally distributes eagle feathers and parts exclusively to tribal members, though it's very backlogged. U.S. wildlife and tribal officials worry that killings and illegal trafficking of eagles for their feathers is on the rise, especially in the West.

In Minnesota, eagles are most often harmed by road accidents and eating poison – results of shrinking wildlife habitat that brings them in closer contact with humans, said Lori Arent, interim director of the University of Minnesota's Raptor Center.

The center treats about 200 injured bald eagles each year. Of those they can save, most are eventually released back into the wild. Permanently disabled birds that lose an eye or whose wings are too badly fractured to fly are cared for there or at other educational institutions like the Wabasha eagle center.

The official designation could help more Americans understand how their behaviors inadvertently harm eagles, Arent said. Littering by a highway, for instance, attracts rodents that lure eagles, which then can be struck by vehicles. Fishing or hunting with tackles and ammunition containing lead exposes the eagles eating those fish or deer remains to fatal metal poisoning.

Humans have lost the ability to coexist in harmony with the natural world, Thunder Hawk said, voicing a concern shared by Indigenous people from the Chilean Andes to the U.S.-Mexico borderlands.

He hopes more people might now approach the eagle with the same reverence he was taught. It's what leads him to offer sage or dried red willow bark every time he spots one as a “thank you for allowing me to see you and for you to hear my prayers and my thoughts.”

Erickson, the new graduate, shares that optimism.

“I feel like that kind of shows that we're strong and united as a country,” she said by the Mississippi, her new feather nestled in her hair.

At least 31 Palestinians were fatally shot on their way to an aid distribution site in the Gaza Strip on Saturday, Palestinian hospital officials and witnesses said. The Israeli military said it had fired warning shots toward people it said were behaving suspiciously to prevent them from approaching.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip killed at least 30 people on Sunday, including six children at a water collection point, while the Palestinian death toll passed 58,000 after 21 months of war, local health officials said.

Israel and Hamas appeared no closer to a breakthrough in indirect talks meant to pause the war and free some Israeli hostages after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Washington visit last week. A new sticking point has emerged over Israeli troops ' deployment during a ceasefire.

Israel says it will end the war only once Hamas surrenders, disarms and goes into exile, something it refuses to do. Hamas says it is willing to free all the remaining 50 hostages, about 20 said to be alive, in exchange for an end to the war and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.

Throughout the war in Gaza, violence has surged in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Funerals were held there Sunday for two Palestinians, including Palestinian-American Sayfollah Musallet, killed by Israeli settlers, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.




In central Gaza, officials at Al-Awda Hospital said it received 10 bodies after an Israeli strike on a water collection point in nearby Nuseirat. Among the dead were six children.

Ramadan Nassar, a witness who lives in the area, told The Associated Press that around 20 children and 14 adults had been lined up to get water. He said Palestinians walk some 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) to fetch water from the area.

The Israeli military said it was targeting a militant but a technical error made its munitions fall “dozens of meters from the target.”

In Nuseirat, a small boy leaned over a body bag to say goodbye to a friend.

“There is no safe place,” resident Raafat Fanouna said as some people went over the rubble with sticks and bare hands.

Separately, health officials said an Israeli strike hit a group of citizens walking in the street on Sunday afternoon in central Gaza City, killing 11 people and injuring around 30 others.

Dr. Ahmed Qandil, who specializes in general surgery, was among those killed, Gaza's Health Ministry said. A ministry spokesperson, Zaher al-Wahidi, told the AP that Qandil had been on his way to Al-Ahli Arab Baptist Hospital.

In the central town of Zawaida, an Israeli strike on a home killed nine, including two women and three children, officials at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital said.

Israel's military said it was unaware of the strike on the home, but said it hit more than 150 targets over the past 24 hours, including what it called weapons storage facilities, missile launchers and sniping posts. Israel blames Hamas for civilian casualties because the militant group operates out of populated areas.

Gaza's Health Ministry says women and children make up more than half of the over 58,000 dead in the war. The ministry, under Gaza's Hamas-run government, doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count. The U.N. and other international organizations see its figures as the most reliable statistics on war casualties.

The Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the war killed some 1,200 people and abducted 251.

Israel's Energy Minister Eli Cohen told right-wing Channel 14 that his ministry will not help rebuild infrastructure in Gaza. “Gaza should remain an island of ruins to the next decades,” he said.

In the West Bank, which has seen violence between Israeli troops and Palestinians and Israeli settlers' attacks on Palestinians, funerals were held for a Palestinian-American and a Palestinian friend.

The Palestinian Health Ministry said Musallet, from Florida, had been beaten by Israeli settlers. Diana Halum, a cousin, said the attack occurred on his family's land. The ministry initially identified him as Seifeddine Musalat, 23.

Musallet's friend, Mohammed al-Shalabi, was shot in the chest, the ministry said.

Israel's military has said Palestinians hurled rocks at Israelis in the area on Friday, lightly wounding two people and setting off a larger confrontation. Palestinians and rights groups have long accused the military of ignoring settler violence.

Their bodies were carried through the streets on Sunday as mourners waved Palestinian flags and chanted, “God is great.”

Musallet's family has said it wants the U.S. State Department to investigate his death and hold the settlers accountable. The State Department said it had no comment out of respect for the family.

Former U.K. Defense Ministry official Nick Pope tells Fox News Digital that the declassification of federal secrets and other documents is of very high interest to the American people.

Declassified documents revealing a United States military aircraft was previously struck by an unknown flying object is raising eyebrows as experts point to other unexplainable sightings suggesting otherworldly technology flying within the country's airspace. 

The incident occurred in January 2023, after an unidentified object collided with the left side of an F-16 Viper jet participating in training exercises near Gila Benda, Arizona, an Air Force spokesperson confirmed to Fox News Digital. 

The flying object struck the clear ""canopy"" at the top of the aircraft and was first spotted by an instructor pilot sitting in the rear of the plane, officials said. An initial investigation determined no damage was done to the near $70 million jet, with officials ruling against a possible bird strike.

Authorities ultimately determined the aircraft was struck by a drone, but the location and operator of the device have yet to be determined, the spokesperson said. 

The incident was the first of four encounters with unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) that were reported a day later, according to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) documents obtained by the War Zone. 

""According to military personnel I've personally met with, there were objects 200 miles off the East Coast that were extensively loitering and had no visible means of propulsion,"" James Fox, a director specializing in films about UFO activity, told Fox News Digital. ""So a report from 2023 about an actual impact with a UAP doesn't really surprise me.""

The concerning collision comes as the Department of Defense reported 757 incidents involving UAPs from May 1, 2023, to June 1, 2024, according to an unclassified document released by the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office. 

Of those encounters, 708 occurred in the air, with only 49 instances marked as ""case closed"" by officials. Additionally, the department received 18 reports regarding UAP incidents near nuclear infrastructure, launch sites and weapons, according to the report.

""None of these resolved cases substantiated advanced foreign adversarial capabilities or breakthrough aerospace technologies,"" the report states.

The sightings of UAPs near military sites are nothing new, according to Fox. 

""There are reports dating back to the 1930s and 1940s,"" Fox said. ""Where you had mysterious, glowing, and orb-like objects that emitted very bright light that could just fly rings around the military planes from World War II.""

Fox pointed to the sheer advanced technology showcased within these sightings, such as aircraft that do not emit a heat signature or have the ability to fly stationary in high wind conditions.

""This has been well-documented for decades,"" Fox said. ""So either we've managed to track the same thing it's been, [possibly] non-human intelligence, since the 1940s. Or someone has managed to replicate the technology, reverse engineer it and they're flying it around.""

In 2020, the Department of Defense established an Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF) to further research and investigate the various UAPs spotted throughout American skies. 

""The mission of the task force is to detect, analyze and catalog UAPs that could potentially pose a threat to U.S. national security,"" the department said in a statement. 

Fox also cited officials' use of updated technology to pinpoint the location and characteristics of UAPs possibly contributing to the influx in reports over recent years.

""They've adjusted the frequency on particular radars to pick up smaller objects that maybe have been here all along,"" Fox said, adding, ""it's a global phenomenon exhibiting the technology that's just lightyears ahead from anything we have. Has there been a successful effort in reverse engineering? [If not], then it falls into the category that many would say is non-human intelligence."" 

While a vast majority of UAPs spotted by officials are quickly identified, Fox insists there are a select few that have origins unknown to even the highest of government authorities and do not match the technology owned by the country's adversaries. 

""A small percentage of these objects display a technology that's just light-years beyond anything that we or anybody else on the planet has,"" Fox said. ""Which would imply, once you do the process of elimination, if it isn't Russia or China, and if it's not us, what's left?""

Fox also attributes overall public skepticism regarding UAPs to the U.S. government remaining tight-lipped about its findings over the years. However, officials have continued to work toward transparency with the American public, with a congressional hearing on UFOs occurring for the first time in decades in 2022 and continuing to take place on the floors of Congress.

""The primary reason for secrecy is that it's difficult for any governing body to admit that there are structured craft of unknown origin whizzing around with impunity,"" Fox said.

Fox News' Chanley Painter reports on a growing rift between FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino and Attorney General Pam Bondi over the handling of the Epstein file release. The ‘Fox & Friends Weekend' co-hosts react.

FBI Director Kash Patel on Saturday squashed rumors of a rift inside the Trump administration's law-and-order team, just hours before the president himself defended Attorney General Pam Bondi amid Jeffrey Epstein probe backlash.

The criticism came after the FBI and Department of Justice on Sunday released a memo shutting down theories about an alleged Epstein client list, finding a tell-all document exposing his associates did not exist. Fueling the fire was a one-minute gap in a surveillance video from Epstein's cell, which was part of the evidence the DOJ released. The review found the disgraced financier died by suicide in jail in 2019.

INSIDE DAN BONGINO'S TENSE MEETING WITH WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS OVER JEFFREY EPSTEIN FALLOUT

Fox News reported Friday that Patel's No. 2, Deputy Director Dan Bongino, was considering resigning if Bondi stayed on as head of the Department of Justice, which oversees the FBI. There were unconfirmed reports that Patel might step down as well, but he shot that down with a social media post Saturday, saying ""conspiracy theories"" about a potential resignation over Bondi's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files ""just aren't true.""

""The conspiracy theories just aren't true, never have been,"" Patel wrote. ""It's an honor to serve the President of the United States @realDonaldTrump — and I'll continue to do so for as long as he calls on me.""

Hours after Patel's post, President Donald Trump took to Truth Social to express unhappiness with his follower's reaction.

Trump supporters posted videos to social media Saturday afternoon charring MAGA hats in protest.

""What's going on with my ‘boys' and, in some cases, ‘gals?' They're all going after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is doing a FANTASTIC JOB,"" Trump wrote. ""We're on one Team, MAGA, and I don't like what's happening."" 

FBI'S DAN BONGINO AND ATTORNEY GENERAL PAM BONDI CLASH OVER HANDLING OF EPSTEIN FILES

He went on to describe Epstein as a ""guy who never dies"" and shifted blame to former President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former FBI Director James Comey, former CIA director John Brennan, and the Biden administration.

""They created the Epstein Files, just like they created the FAKE Hillary Clinton/Christopher Steele Dossier that they used on me, and now my so-called ‘friends' are playing right into their hands,"" Trump wrote. ""Why didn't these Radical Left Lunatics release the Epstein Files? If there was ANYTHING in there that could have hurt the MAGA Movement, why didn't they use it?""

The president claimed that one year ago, the country was ""DEAD,"" but is now ""the ‘HOTTEST' Country anywhere in the World. 

""Let's keep it that way, and not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about,"" Trump wrote.

Rumors about a change in leadership were triggered by Patel's apparent X biography change, where his title as FBI Director was removed to only read, ""Fmr Chief of Staff @DeptofDefense.""

10 REASONS THE DOJ AND FBI FACE BACKLASH OVER EPSTEIN FILES FLOP

Multiple sources told Fox News Digital Bongino and Bondi butted heads at a White House meeting Wednesday, with Bongino accusing Bondi of a ""lack of transparency from the start"" in the Epstein files probe. 

The former Secret Service agent-turned FBI official allegedly raised his voice at Trump's White House chief of staff before storming out, and has since been weighing resignation over the episode, insiders said. 

Bondi and Patel, however, have presented a united front. Sources close to Bondi claim she has ""no intention of stepping down"" and the pair are in constant communication.

""Any attempt to sow division within this team is baseless and distracts from the real progress being made,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Harrison Fields told Fox News Digital, emphasizing that Trump's law-and-order lineup is working ""seamlessly and with unity.""

The last time Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) threatened to withhold Democratic votes and force a government shutdown, it ended in a bitter internal feud that, at one point, seemed it might cost him his job.

Now, just four months later, Schumer may be headed down a similar path that could spark more Democratic fury.

As he tries to stop Republicans from approving a $9.4 billion batch of President Donald Trump's spending cuts, GOP senators see Schumer's threat that Democrats will retaliate by not funding the government this fall as a bluff. Republicans are placing early bets that this latest shutdown talk will lead to the same conclusion: Schumer caving.

“I don't take it serious,” Sen. John Curtis (R-UT), a centrist Republican with a bipartisan streak, told the Washington Examiner. “Everybody knows a ‘Schumer shutdown' is too easy to brand, and I can't imagine that he wants that brand. He'd be walking right into it.”

For their part, Democrats have but one main tool in their limited arsenal as the minority party: the 60-vote filibuster. However, the White House's rescissions bill, which Senate Republicans aim to pass next week after amending the House-passed version, requires only a simple majority.

Democrats see Republicans as the ones picking a funding feud by trying to roll back money Congress has already appropriated for foreign aid programs and public broadcasting.

“It's fundamentally changing the way the government is supposed to function. That kind of poisons the well a bit here,” said Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ), a battleground state Democrat also known for his work across the aisle. “How do we do our jobs when the president's just going to undo our work? That's not right.”

Still, Schumer remains under immense pressure to show his frustrated base that Democrats are doing whatever they can to combat Trump after blinking first in the prior shutdown showdown and on the heels of Republicans passing the president's marquee One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

“It's absurd to expect Democrats to play along with funding the government if Republicans are just going to renege on a bipartisan agreement by concocting rescissions packages behind doors without the customary 60 votes required in the appropriations process,” Schumer said in recent Senate floor remarks.

In March, Schumer and nine other Democrats gave Republicans the votes they needed to fund the government out of fear that GOP leaders could have allowed a shutdown to carry on indefinitely. But that didn't stop a Democratic revolt, including demands for Schumer to step down as leader and renewed calls for a more liberal primary challenger in 2028.

While many Democrats are behind his latest strategy, there's at least some angst in the party over using a maneuver Schumer has consistently blasted Republicans in the past for threatening.

“I refuse to ever vote for anything that would shut the government down. It was wrong when they threatened to shut the government down,” Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) told the Washington Examiner. “That's our core responsibility: to keep the government working.”

No matter which side may have begun what has quickly descended into another Capitol Hill blame game, Congress has until Oct. 1 to achieve one of two scenarios: pass the annual budget or some sort of funding measure, or face a government shutdown.

Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Susan Collins (R-ME), a key figure in any government funding fight and a centrist with a battleground reelection next year, gave little weight to Schumer's rhetoric.

“Sen. Schumer has never been a strong supporter of the appropriations process,” Collins said, citing his decision to advance one large bill rather than individual funding bills when he was the majority leader. “It's no surprise to me that he is once again trying to create difficulties for the Appropriations Committee.”

SCHUMER TEES UP EARLY BLAME GAME WITH GOP OVER GOVERNMENT FUNDING FEUD

When the Washington Examiner asked Collins whether she could continue effectively crafting the annual budget despite escalating tensions, Collins pointed to her panel's latest meeting. Hours earlier, members advanced two tranches of funds that comprise the 12-bill budget, passing the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration appropriations bill unanimously and the Legislative Branch appropriations bill 26-1.

The committee's negotiations over the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies appropriations bill, however, did end in a stalemate over a long-standing battle to relocate the FBI headquarters. Lawmakers promised to revisit the subject at a later date.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Megyn Kelly targets Bondi again shortly after Trump defense","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice/3469635/megyn-kelly-targets-bondi-again-after-trump-defense/","Sun, 13 Jul 2025 01:33:41 GMT","

Conservative commentator Megyn Kelly continued to target Attorney General Pam Bondi over the weekend over her handling of the Epstein files, claiming she “repeatedly misled” the public about the them.

Kelly, who on Friday called for Bondi's resignation amid a rift with top FBI officials Kash Patel and Dan Bongino, repeated her criticism of the attorney general on Saturday night after President Donald Trump came to Bondi's defense.

“I'm sure it's a relief for Pam Bondi to hear the president is still in her corner. Unfortunately, huge swaths of the party are not. She repeatedly misled on Epstein. Then didn't have the courage to explain herself. Suddenly, she's camera shy & no Qs allowed. Good luck!” Kelly posted on X.

Those claims largely echo ones Kelly made following the conclusion of the DOJ and FBI's investigation into disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, an investigation that found no evidence of a “client list” and that Epstein committed suicide in his Manhattan jail cell.

Speaking on Emily Jashinsky's podcast After Party earlier this week, Kelly said Bondi “has definitely made multiple inconsistent statements” and “does not deserve the benefit of my good opinion.”

She amplified that criticism on Friday night at a Turning Point USA event alongside Charlie Kirk, saying Bondi knew the Epstein files, of which only a small batch were released, “were bulls***.”

“She knew that there was nothing in there,” Kelly added.

CHARLIE KIRK AND MEGYN KELLY COME TO DAN BONGINO'S DEFENSE IN PAM BONDI EPSTEIN FEUD

Kelly later laid out two possible explanations for the way the Epstein files were handled, one of which is a cover-up at “his [Trump's] direction” after the president in his defense of Bondi urged the FBI to move on from Jeffrey Epstein, who he said “nobody cares about.”

“There are really only two options: 1. There's no huge undisclosed there there on Epstein, Bondi misled on it (until she didn't) & Trump is quick to forgive a loyal soldier for being desperate to get on TV; or 2. There is a scandal that's being covered up & it's at his direction,” she posted on X.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Why FBI faces uphill battle to investigate Comey and Brennan","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice/3468311/why-fbi-faces-uphill-battle-brennan-comey-investigation/","Sun, 13 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

The FBI and Justice Department may face steep obstacles if they pursue prosecutions against former FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director John Brennan over their roles in the Trump-Russia investigation, despite growing scrutiny over the discredited Steele dossier's influence and allegations of perjury before Congress.

Both Comey and Brennan are under federal criminal investigation for allegedly misusing intelligence and making false statements related to the 2016 election and their investigation of President Donald Trump, Fox News Digital first reported on Tuesday. The investigation reportedly stems from a referral issued by current CIA Director John Ratcliffe, who declassified a “lessons learned” tradecraft review on July 2 that criticized Brennan's handling of the 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment that tied Russia's election interference efforts to material support for then-candidate Trump.

Ratcliffe's review casts Brennan's role in that assessment in a new light, asserting that he “showed a preference for narrative consistency over analytical soundness” when he brushed aside concerns from intelligence experts over the reliability of the Steele dossier because its unvetted and salacious claims conformed “with existing theories.” Brennan wrote of the Steele dossier in an email in December 2016 that “my bottomline is that I believe that the information warrants inclusion in the report.”

Despite the new revelations, experts say much of the new interest still relies on old information that has been the subject of multiple congressional inquiries, special counsel investigations, and Inspector General examinations, all of which turned up no evidence that led to criminal charges against the most senior officials.

Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett said on Hannity this week that the potential counts could include “defrauding the government, conspiracy, and deprivation of rights under color of law.” Jarrett added that the “knowingly” false use of the Steele dossier could form the primary basis for prosecuting government officials who advanced fabricated evidence to target Trump.

But bringing a case to trial in Washington, D.C., may be a nonstarter.

“You'd have to go to a grand jury in D.C. and get an indictment,” Jarrett said. “In D.C., bringing a case against a Democrat and a liberal is almost a fool's errand.”

While the Justice Department has declined to comment on whether any active investigations exist, Trump and Brennan have addressed the reports.

Asked during a Wednesday White House event whether he was aware of any investigation into his longtime adversaries, Trump told reporters, “I know nothing about it, other than what I read today.” Still, he said, “They're very dishonest people … maybe they have to pay a price for that.”

Brennan, appearing on MSNBC Wednesday, said he had not been contacted by the DOJ, FBI, or CIA and dismissed the investigation as politically motivated. “This is unfortunately a very sad and tragic example of the continued politicization of the intelligence community,” he told host Nicole Wallace, defending his agency's handling of the 2017 intelligence assessment and criticizing Ratcliffe for initiating the tradecraft review in the first place.

“I know nothing about this reported investigation or referral to the DOJ, other than what I read in these press reports, these leaks, which are not really supposed to happen,” he added, although the investigation into Trump and intelligence agencies' ultimately discredited suspicions about him and Russia were the subject of substantial leaks.

Complicating the matter further is the absence of a permanent U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., in the office that would lead any prosecution. A Senate confirmation fight looms for the nominee, currently interim U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, a longtime ally of Trump who would likely be tasked with heading up a case against the pair of former directors if the FBI's investigation uncovered further evidence of wrongdoing. The Senate is expected to vote on her confirmation next week after previous plans to confirm Pardon Attorney Ed Martin collapsed.

Career staff at the DOJ may also resist prosecution, particularly given Brennan and Comey's prior standing and the unprecedented nature of the charges.

Adding to the uncertainty is the statute of limitations. While many of the alleged misdeeds occurred during 2016 and 2017 period, Jarrett argued that the timeline may be extended if it can be shown that evidence was “deliberately withheld or fraudulently concealed.”

Other experts, such as former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani, were less convinced.

“This is old news,” he told the Washington Examiner. “You're talking about events from 2016 and 2017. These are five-year statutes of limitation, so unless there's something recent, it's going to be very hard to prosecute.”

Rahmani said prosecutors may try to argue that Brennan's 2023 testimony to Congress could restart the clock, but even that is murky, partially because those statements were not under oath. “If the comments were, maybe you get perjury. If not, maybe a Section 1001 false statement — or stretch it into a continuing conspiracy. But it's weak.”

The statute Rahmani referenced is the same one used by former special counsel John Durham in 2022 against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's former campaign lawyer, Michael Sussmann, for allegedly lying to the FBI during a 2016 meeting with the bureau's then-General Counsel James Baker. According to the complaint, Sussmann told Baker he was not representing any client when he presented data alleging a covert communication channel between the Trump Organization and Russia's Alfa Bank.

Prosecutors alleged that Sussmann acted on behalf of Clinton's presidential campaign and a tech executive. However, a D.C. jury ultimately acquitted him, finding that prosecutors could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement was knowingly false and material to the bureau's investigation.

Moreover, Durham's review of the intelligence community assessment and his broader Russia investigation were unable to surface sufficient evidence to charge Brennan with a crime.

Despite the potential challenges of bringing new indictments, the underlying conduct by Comey and Brennan still raises numerous red flags.

The ICA, produced over a condensed time frame of a few weeks in late 2016 and early 2017, concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to help Trump defeat Clinton in the 2016 presidential race. But the newly released records indicate Brennan received a December 2016 warning from his own deputy that including the Steele dossier — which was funded by Democrats, had not been verified, and was later discredited — would compromise the credibility of the assessment. The tradecraft review declassified by Ratcliffe concluded that Brennan's team introduced “procedural anomalies” that deviated from standard analytic rigor, according to the report, to assert that the intelligence community believed Putin wanted to help Trump win.

Comey's track record raises separate questions. As FBI director during the Obama administration, he authorized the use of the Steele dossier to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants on Trump campaign aide Carter Page despite the bureau lacking verification for any of the document's key claims. In a 2018 closed-door testimony before congressional investigators, Comey attempted to defend the dossier, even suggesting some Republicans had also backed its production, despite being aware that the Clinton campaign had its own plans to promote Trump-Russia ties to the public for political reasons.

Comey has also drawn attention for his erratic post-government behavior. In May, he posted and deleted an image to Instagram featuring the number “86 47” in seashells that was widely interpreted as a call to kill the 47th president. The Secret Service reportedly questioned him afterward, and a recent New York Times report cited three government officials who said the agency tracked his location using his cellphone data.

Although Trump himself has long alleged misconduct by Comey and Brennan, his administration's push for prosecution risks reinforcing claims that he is now weaponizing the Justice Department. Critics argue the investigations could be viewed as retaliatory, particularly after Trump's frequent public attacks on both men.

An MSNBC opinion column called the investigations “a sign of escalating authoritarian energy,” warning that they may serve more to vindicate Trump's narrative than to hold former officials accountable. The author pointed to current FBI Director Kash Patel's past statements labeling Comey and Brennan as part of the “Deep State” as evidence of potential bias.

Yet the reality of Brennan and Comey's conduct — particularly their reliance on false evidence, failure to follow protocol, and contradictory testimony — remains worthy of investigation, say supporters of the investigation, who further argue that federal law enforcement has a duty to revisit past abuses, even if politically fraught.

Legal experts say an indictment could be met with immediate malicious prosecution defenses — arguments Trump previously attempted to raise in his own criminal cases last year. Likewise, judges in the nation's capital, many of whom were appointed by Democrats, may be more receptive to those claims from Comey or Brennan than they were when they came from Trump.

While the DOJ has not publicly confirmed or denied any active investigation, the stakes are clear. In the eyes of Trump supporters and longtime detractors of Comey and Brennan, successful prosecution could help reset accountability standards for federal law enforcement. A failed case could backfire legally and politically, further eroding public trust in impartial justice.

Still, prosecution remains an open question that likely won't be resolved for several months.

 “These are political and investigative decisions,” Rahmani said. “They're rarely investigated — much less prosecuted.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

For the likes of Don Bacon, quitting Congress has become a familiar endgame.

Ideally, this interview would have been over breakfast at a diner in Omaha, and the local congressman, Don Bacon, would have ordered his namesake. He says he eats bacon two or three times a week when he's in Nebraska; he likes it extra crispy and, if possible, prepared at home. “If you ask me for my favorite bacon, it's Angie Bacon,” he told me this week, referring to his wife of 41 years. (Sadly, the congressman and I were speaking not over breakfast but by phone.)

Angie enjoys having her husband in Nebraska for a number of reasons. One is that if he's home, she's less likely to sleep with a gun—something she resorted to when harassment and death threats got really intense a few years ago. These menaces have become progressively worse in recent years. Protesters showed up at the Bacon house during an Easter-egg hunt that he put on for his grandkids two years ago. County police were parked in the driveway. Eventually, the Bacons moved to another house, in a more remote location. But it all can get exhausting. The congressman was working 12- to 14-hour days, bouncing between Washington, D.C., and Omaha. “After the last election, I was on E. I had no gas in the tank,” he said. Bacon announced last week that he would not run for reelection in 2026.

This was not a huge surprise. Bacon, who had spent 30 years in the Air Force before coming to Congress, in 2017, is one of the last remaining House Republicans who are not thrilled—and willing to say they are not thrilled—by the direction their party has taken since Donald Trump took it over. Bacon has been a rare GOP lawmaker willing to criticize Trump during a second presidential term that has otherwise been marked by acquiescence. After the Signalgate scandal, Bacon suggested that Trump should fire Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, whom Bacon dismissed as “an amateur.” He has also called Trump “very weak” in his approach to Russia.

None of which makes for a savvy career move if you're a Republican in these Trump-dominated times. For the likes of Don Bacon, quitting in disappointment has become a familiar endgame.

We've seen this miniseries before: A Republican who considers themselves to be a traditional Reagan conservative vows to fight for their principles and beliefs. But when these principles and beliefs conflict with what Trump wants, things get complicated—and often unpleasant. Your party threatens to recruit a primary challenger. The president does not take kindly to you. His supporters say nasty things. And it all takes a toll.

Read: No one loves the bill (almost) every Republican voted for

Bacon, 61, is coming off of an especially high-stress period. He was considered something of a wild-card vote on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the domestic-policy package that the president signed into law on July 4. It was not universally seen as beautiful, even among some who wound up voting for it, including Bacon. “To me, this bill was an 80–20–type bill,” Bacon said. He liked that the bill bolsters the military and protects the tax cuts that had passed during Trump's first term. He did not like how the bill will explode the deficit and lead to Medicaid cuts. Ultimately, Bacon swallowed his reservations, voted yes, and decided to head home.

Either you like bacon or you're wrong, reads a sign in the representative's Washington office, displayed not far from a prominent model pig. For the most part, House members from both parties seem to like Bacon, the colleague. They describe him as one of the few Republicans left in Washington who do not consider moderate or bipartisan dirty words. This has proved a winning position in Bacon's swingy Second Congressional District of Nebraska. (Kamala Harris carried it by 4.6 points in 2024, making this the bluest district that a House Republican represents.)

Still, Bacon's relative independence has made him a bipartisan target. The MAGA contingent derides his RINO, or “Republican in name only,” apostasies, such as when he was the only GOP House member to vote against a bill to rechristen the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America.” (“I thought it was dumb,” he told me.) Democrats, meanwhile, have been eyeing Bacon's district since he was first elected, in 2016. “Vulnerable House Republican” has effectively become part of his job title. After a three-term GOP mayor of Omaha was defeated in May by a Democrat, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries declared that the “Don Bacon retirement watch” had officially begun.

Bacon told me that the nature of the threats he has received has changed. He used to get the hardest time from the far left, “the Bernie Sanders crowd,” he said. “They hate Trump so much, they don't think straight.” But lately, threats have come more from the “dark MAGA guys.” As Bacon put it, “If you show any disagreement at all with Trump, you're a traitor. It's sort of strange.”

Read: What the next phase of Trump's presidency will look like

Things became really ugly in late 2023, during the race to elect a new Republican House speaker. Representative Jim Jordan, the choleric conservative from Ohio, was the clear favorite of Trump and his House acolytes; Bacon was not kosher with this, and the abuse followed. “There's, like, four people on social media, and they have a million followers,” Bacon told me. “And they are thugs.” He received 31,000 phone calls to his office during the speakership brawl, he said, plus texts and emails.

Bacon continues to believe that “we're just in a phase right now.” He is among the latest in a long line of departing Republicans who seem to think that the Reagan-vintage GOP will magically return when the phase—which has lasted about a decade—finally ends. “Maybe when President Trump's term is over, we'll see a readjustment,” he said. “Right now, what I think America wants is a little bit of normalcy.”

Bacon told me that one of his goals after leaving Congress will be to “fight for the soul of the party,” meaning the GOP. This struck me as typical of the tortured logic that many politicians rely on to justify their departures—the idea that they are pursuing a fight just as they exit the arena. Bacon countered with the idea that representing a district is not necessarily compatible with restoring a soul. Nor is serving in Washington. “I've got to worry about being reelected if I want to be a congressman,” he said. “I'd rather be more vocal about what I believe in.”

Bacon does not rule out running for Nebraska governor, or even for the presidency, in 2028—although the latter seems like something that Republican-primary voters would rule out fairly quickly. Whatever he winds up doing, he has more immediate priorities. He has 11 grandchildren who live within a 10-minute drive from his home in Papillion, south of Omaha. “I do feel like there's a little bit of weight off my shoulders,” Bacon said. He is trying to restore his own sense of normalcy.

He recently had his grandsons over and cooked for them. “They're not sure they like my eggs,” he told me, “but they like my bacon.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

﻿Finally, a painless IUD insertion?

IUDs have been a promising breakthrough in birth control, offering both convenience and effectiveness, and their use has exploded over the past few decades. But that progress has often come with some (painful) trade-offs. Vox senior reporter Allie Volpe has been digging into why medicine has been slow to catch up to the pain that IUD insertions can cause and doctors' plans to make the process for more palatable for patients in the future.

It is a big reproductive rights story, at a time when those rights are increasingly under threat. I sat down and chatted with Allie about it.

Allie, are IUDs becoming more popular? What do people like about them?

They're definitely more popular. Just over 6 million people, or 8.4 percent of contraceptive users between the ages of 15 and 49, use IUDs. It's actually the fourth most popular form of birth control. No. 1 is tubal ligation or, as people refer to it, getting your tubes tied. The pill is No. 2, condoms are No. 3, and IUDs are No. 4. That's a huge increase from the mid-‘90s when just 1 percent of birth control users used IUDs. 

Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

People really like the IUD. It's a set-it-and-forget-it kind of thing. Once you get past the act of placing it, you have it for anywhere from three to 10 years, depending on the type you have. Both do the same thing: They prevent the sperm and egg from meeting. 

A lot of people report less cramping on their periods, lighter periods, or even no periods in general. That's a huge draw for people who often have painful periods or endometriosis. It's a good way to treat those things. 

I think a lot of people have the perception of IUDs as a quick, painless insertion that's not really a big deal. Is that accurate? 

It depends on who you talk to, right? It is quick. It is all over within a matter of minutes unless you're getting anesthesia, which would make the process longer.

And for some people, it's historically not been all that uncomfortable. But for others, it's really uncomfortable. Pain is very personal, and it's hard to pinpoint what pain actually is. Some people are like, “Yup, didn't really feel it.” Others are like, “I've had multiple children, and this is more painful than childbirth.” 

What we've been seeing over the last couple of years is those people coming on social media talking about their experiences with painful IUD insertions. 

Why do you think that misconception persists? Why do even doctors misunderstand the pain that their patients are going through?

Women's pain in medicine has long been minimized. There's been reporting over the last couple of years about medical gaslighting, not just in gynecological procedures but across the board. Women will come in with a problem. And for decades, centuries, they've just been written off as being hysterical.

Specifically, when it comes to IUDs, as more people got them, you started to hear more stories about these being very painful. It's a numbers game — more people get them, more people are going to have problems — but also a medical history game.

You're writing about this now because things do seem to be changing. What's going on?

One of the OB-GYNs I talked to said, “I've been placing IUDs for like 37 years. It's not like I didn't mention that it would be painful, but I just tried not to bring it up. Because if a patient expects something's going to be painful, it's going to be more painful than they really thought.” These conversations about pain were not really happening until recently. 

Within the last year, the CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists both released recommendations telling doctors to talk to their patients about pain management during IUD placement. 

For a while, there just wasn't really good research that pointed to methods that might help during this procedure because the pain can come at multiple points. But these groups are urging doctors to talk to their patients about not only taking ibuprofen to manage the pain after the procedure but also using topical creams or an anesthetic shot during the procedure to reduce discomfort.

What questions should patients be asking their doctor?

All of the OB-GYNs I talked to really stressed this: Talk to your doctor before your appointment. Because if you walk in the day of, there's not really a lot they can do. So, as you're making this appointment, discuss your concerns with your doctor. Tell them if you're concerned about pain or if you have any past history that might make this procedure more difficult for you. Ask, “What can you offer me?” Ask as many questions as you want. 

If you don't feel satisfied with the options they have — like if you really want a paracervical block but your doctor doesn't offer it — ask if they have recommendations for another provider that will. Then start to talk through a plan with your provider. What medications will they give you pre-appointment? Some doctors now are giving people Xanax to chill out before the IUD insertion. They will probably often tell you to take ibuprofen beforehand. Ask what they will use during the procedure. Make sure you have that clear plan written out ahead of time.

If your doctor isn't taking your concerns seriously, they're blowing you off, or they don't offer pain management that meets your standards. Some of the experts I talked to recommended reaching out to a hospital affiliated with a university. They have a higher chance of having a provider that uses some of these pain management methods. Others recommended searching for someone who's trained in complex family planning. That means they have received additional training in abortion and contraceptive care, so they might also have more pain management options.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Marc Benioff says the narrative that AI will end white-collar jobs is wrong","https://www.businessinsider.com/marc-benioff-ai-white-collar-jobs-salesforce-2025-7","Sun, 13 Jul 2025 09:43:00 GMT","

Marc Benioff said that while artificial intelligence is drastically reshaping Salesforce, it doesn't mean that it will wipe out white-collar workers.

""That isn't how I see AI,"" Benioff, Salesforce's CEO, told Atlantic CEO Nicholas Thompson during a recent onstage interview at the 2025 AI for Good Global Summit. ""Maybe they have AI, I don't have. But in the AI I have, it's not going to be some huge mass layoff of white-collar workers, it is a radical augmentation of the workforce.""

Benioff's broader view of AI contrasts with how other in tech view the next decade. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who was not mentioned directly during Benioff's appearance, has said AI may eliminate half of entry-level, white-collar jobs within the next five years.

People need to get past this type of general ""fear,"" Benioff said.

""When I'm talking to our customers, I'm not hearing them say, ""Oh, now I'm laying off these people because this A,B,C technology increase because of AI.' So, I think we need to somehow shed the fear of what that all means.""

For his own company, Benioff says he's paused Salesforce's hiring of engineers, lawyers, and customer service agents for the year so the company can ""let AI productivity really take hold.""

""Right now, for engineering organization, because of the incredible productivity opportunity, for AI in engineering this year, let's take some time to actually incorporate that in so we're not focused on hiring another thousand, 2,000, 3,000 engineers,"" he said.

At the same time, Benioff said Salesforce is ramping up sales-related hires due to customer demand to deploy AI. That's likely because, in his view, we're on the edge of ""a radical explosion in small and medium businesses.""

""You're just going to see a lot more SMBs and a lot more general business and mid-market business, because their capabilities are radically amplified by the AI,"" he said.

These countermeasures, which the bloc had adopted in response to tariffs imposed by Trump on steel and aluminum, had been paused to allow for talks and are due to snap back automatically at midnight on Tuesday.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

The term “anti-involution” has cropped up in government documents over the past year, but gained prominence earlier this month when President Xi Jinping chaired a high-level meeting that pledged to regulate “disorderly” price competition. It refers to efforts to root out China's industrial malaise, marked by cutthroat price wars and overcapacity that have hurt profitability in sectors ranging from solar, new energy vehicles to steel.

Vehicles at the Stellantis Sterling Heights Assembly Plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan, in April.

Stellantis NV's truck plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan was evacuated Saturday afternoon after an armed man entered the premises, and the incident ended with the man in custody.

Police told CBS News earlier that the man had barricaded himself inside the assembly facility. The plant, which makes the Ram 1500, wasn't running production at the time and there was only a skeleton crew of skilled tradespeople inside, a Stellantis spokeswoman said.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

In this article

As the U.S. and China vie for economic, technological and geopolitical supremacy, the critical elements and metals embedded in technology from consumer to industrial and military markets have become a pawn in the wider conflict. That's nowhere more so the case than in China's leverage over the rare earth metals supply chain. This past week, the Department of Defense took a large equity stake in MP Materials, the company running the only rare earths mining operation in the U.S.

But there's another option to combat the rare earths shortage that goes back to an older idea: recycling. The business has come a long way from collecting cans, bottles, plastic, newspaper and other consumer disposables, otherwise destined for landfills, to recreate all sorts of new products.

Today, next-generation recyclers — a mix of legacy companies and startups — are innovating ways to gather and process the ever-growing mountains of electronic waste, or e-waste, which comprises end-of-life and discarded computers, smartphones, servers, TVs, appliances, medical devices, and other electronics and IT equipment. And they are doing so in a way that is aligned to the newest critical technologies in society. Most recently, spent EV batteries, wind turbines and solar panels are fostering a burgeoning recycling niche.

The e-waste recycling opportunity isn't limited to rare earth elements. Any electronics that can't be wholly refurbished and resold, or cannibalized for replacement parts needed to keep existing electronics up and running, can berecycled to strip out gold, silver, copper, nickel, steel, aluminum, lithium, cobalt and other metals vital to manufacturers in various industries. But increasingly, recyclers are extracting rare-earth elements, such as neodymium, praseodymium, terbium and dysprosium, which are critical in making everything from fighter jets to power tools.

""Recycling [of e-waste] hasn't been taken too seriously until recently"" as a meaningful source of supply, said Kunal Sinha, global head of recycling at Swiss-based Glencore, a major miner, producer and marketer of metals and minerals — and, to a much lesser but growing degree, an e-waste recycler. ""A lot of people are still sleeping at the wheel and don't realize how big this can be,"" Sinha said. 

Traditionally, U.S. manufacturers purchase essential metals and rare earths from domestic and foreign producers — an inordinate number based in China — that fabricate mined raw materials, or through commodities traders. But with those supply chains now disrupted by unpredictable tariffs, trade policies and geopolitics, the market for recycled e-waste is gaining importance as a way to feed the insatiable electrification of everything.

""The United States imports a lot of electronics, and all of that is coming with gold and aluminum and steel,"" said John Mitchell, president and CEO of the Global Electronics Association, an industry trade group. ""So there's a great opportunity to actually have the tariffs be an impetus for greater recycling in this country for goods that we don't have, but are buying from other countries.""

Although recycling contributes only around $200 million to Glencore's total EBITDA of nearly $14 billion, the strategic attention and time the business gets from leadership ""is much more than that percentage,"" Sinha said. ""We believe that a lot of mining is necessary to get to all the copper, gold and other metals that are needed, but we also recognize that recycling is going to play a huge role,"" he said.

Glencore has operated a huge copper smelter in Quebec, Canada, for almost  20 years on a site that's nearly 100-years-old. The facility processes mostly mined copper concentrates, though 15% of its feedstock is recyclable materials, such as e-waste that Glencore's global network of 100-plus suppliers collect and sort. The smelter pioneered the process for recovering copper and precious metals from e-waste in the mid 1980s, making it one of the first and largest of its type in the world. The smelted copper is refined into fresh slabs that are sold to manufacturers and traders. The same facility also produces refined gold, silver, platinum and palladium recovered from recycling feeds. 

The importance of copper to OEMs' supply chains was magnified in early July, when prices hit an all-time high after President Trump said he would impose a 50% tariff on imports of the metal. The U.S. imports just under half of its copper, and the tariff hike — like other new Trump trade policies — is intended to boost domestic production.

It takes around three decades for a new mine in the U.S. to move from discovery to production, which makes recycled copper look all the more attractive, especially as demand keeps rising. According to estimates by energy-data firm Wood Mackenzie, 45% of demand will be met with recycled copper by 2050, up from about a third today.

Foreign recycling companies have begun investing in the U.S.-based facilities. In 2022, Germany's Wieland broke ground on a $100-million copper and copper alloy recycling plant in Shelbyville, Kentucky. Last year, another German firm, Aurubis, started construction on an $800-million multi-metal recycling facility in Augusta, Georgia. 

""As the first major secondary smelter of its kind in the U.S., Aurubis Richmond will allow us to keep strategically important metals in the economy, making U.S. supply chains more independent,"" said Aurubis CEO Toralf Haag.

The proliferation of e-waste can be traced back to the 1990s, when the internet gave birth to the digital economy, spawning exponential growth in electronically enabled products. The trend has been supercharged by the emergence of renewable energy, e-mobility, artificial intelligence and the build-out of data centers. That translates to a constant turnover of devices and equipment, and massive amounts of e-waste.

In 2022, a record 62 million metric tons of e-waste were produced globally, up 82% from 2010, according to the most recent estimates from the United Nations' International Telecommunications Union and research arm UNITAR. That number is projected to reach 82 million metric tons by 2030.

The U.S., the report said, produced just shy of 8 million tons of e-waste in 2022. Yet only about 15-20% of it is properly recycled, a figure that illustrates the untapped market for e-waste retrievables. The e-waste recycling industry generated $28.1 billion in revenue in 2024, according to IBISWorld, with a projected compound annual growth rate of 8%.

Whether it's refurbished and resold or recycled for metals and rare-earths, e-waste that stores data — especially smartphones, computers, servers and some medical devices — must be wiped of sensitive information to comply with cybersecurity and environmental regulations. The service, referred to as IT asset disposition (ITAD), is offered by conventional waste and recycling companies, including Waste Management, Republic Services and Clean Harbors, as well as specialists such as Sims Lifecycle Services, Electronic Recyclers International, All Green Electronics Recycling and Full Circle Electronics.

""We're definitely seeing a bit of an influx of [e-waste] coming into our warehouses,"" said Full Circle Electronics CEO Dave Daily, adding, ""I think that is due to some early refresh cycles."" 

That's a reference to businesses and consumers choosing to get ahead of the customary three-year time frame for purchasing new electronics, and discarding old stuff, in anticipation of tariff-related price increases.

Daily also is witnessing increased demand among downstream recyclers for e-waste Full Circle Electronics can't refurbish and sell at wholesale. The company dismantles and separates it into 40 or 50 different types of material, from keyboards and mice to circuit boards, wires and cables. Recyclers harvest those items for metals and rare earths, which continue to go up in price on commodities markets, before reentering the supply chain as core raw materials.

Even before the Trump administration's efforts to revitalize American manufacturing by reworking trade deals, and recent changes in tax credits key to the industry in Trump's tax and spending bill, entrepreneurs have been launching e-waste recycling startups and developing technologies to process them for domestic OEMs.

""Many regions of the world have been kind of lazy about processing e-waste, so a lot of it goes offshore,"" Sinha said. In response to that imbalance, ""There seems to be a trend of nationalizing e-waste, because people suddenly realize that we have the same metals [they've] been looking for"" from overseas sources, he said. ""People have been rethinking the global supply chain, that they're too long and need to be more localized."" 

Several startups tend to focus on a particular type of e-waste. Lately, rare earths have garnered tremendous attention, not just because they're in high demand by U.S. electronics manufacturers but also to lessen dependence on China, which dominates mining, processing and refining of the materials. In the production of rare-earth magnets — used in EVs, drones, consumer electronics, medical devices, wind turbines, military weapons and other products — China commands roughly 90% of the global supply chain.

The lingering U.S.–China trade war has only exacerbated the disparity. In April, China restricted exports of seven rare earths and related magnets in retaliation for U.S. tariffs, a move that forced Ford to shut down factories because of magnet shortages. China, in mid-June, issued temporary six-month licenses to certain major U.S. automaker suppliers and select firms. Exports are flowing again, but with delays and still well below peak levels.

The U.S. is attempting to catch up. Before this past week's Trump administration deal, the Biden administration awarded $45 million in funding to MP Materials and the nation's lone rare earths mine, in Mountain Pass, California. Back in April, the Interior Department approved development activities at the Colosseum rare earths project, located within California's Mojave National Preserve. The project, owned by Australia's Dateline Resources, will potentially become America's second rare earth mine after Mountain Pass. 

Meanwhile, several recycling startups are extracting rare earths from e-waste. Illumynt has an advanced process for recovering them from decommissioned hard drives procured from data centers. In April, hard drive manufacturer Western Digital announced a collaboration with Microsoft, Critical Materials Recycling and PedalPoint Recycling to pull rare earths, as well as copper, gold, aluminum and steel, from end-of-life drives.

Canadian-based Cyclic Materials invented a process that recovers rare-earths and other metals from EV motors, wind turbines, MRI machines and data-center e-scrap. The company is investing more than $20 million to build its first U.S.-based facility in Mesa, Arizona. Late last year, Glencore signed a multiyear agreement with Cyclic to provide recycled copper for its smelting and refining operations.

Another hot feedstock for e-waste recyclers is end-of-life lithium-ion batteries, a source of not only lithium but also copper, cobalt, nickel, manganese and aluminum. Those materials are essential for manufacturing new EV batteries, which the Big Three automakers are heavily invested in. Their projects, however, are threatened by possible reductions in the Biden-era 45X production tax credit, featured in the new federal spending bill.

It's too soon to know how that might impact battery recyclers — including Ascend Elements, American Battery Technology, Cirba Solutions and Redwood Materials — who themselves qualify for the 45X and other tax credits. They might actually be aided by other provisions in the budget bill that benefit a domestic supply chain of critical minerals as a way to undercut China's dominance of the global market.

Nonetheless, that looming uncertainty should be a warning sign for e-waste recyclers, said Sinha. ""Be careful not to build a recycling company on the back of one tax credit,"" he said, ""because it can be short-lived.""

Investing in recyclers can be precarious, too, Sinha said. While he's happy to see recycling getting its due as a meaningful source of supply, he cautions people to be careful when investing in this space. Startups may have developed new technologies, but lack good enough business fundamentals. ""Don't invest on the hype,"" he said, ""but on the fundamentals.""

Glencore, ironically enough, is a case in point. It has invested $327.5 million in convertible notes in battery recycler Li-Cycle to provide feedstock for its smelter. The Toronto-based startup had broken ground on a new facility in Rochester, New York, but ran into financial difficulties and filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in May, prompting Glencore to submit a ""stalking horse"" credit bid of at least $40 million for the stalled project and other assets.

Even so, ""the current environment will lead to more startups and investments"" in e-waste recycling, Sinha said. ""We are investing ourselves.""

In this article

Optimism about the strong growth opportunities presented by the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom has been tempered by tariff-related distractions and macroeconomic challenges.

Against this uncertain backdrop, investors looking for consistent income can add attractive dividend-paying stocks to their portfolios, and studying top Wall Street analysts can offer useful insights into picking the right dividend payers.

Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance

Oil and gas exploration and production company ConocoPhillips (COP) is this week's first dividend pick. The company distributed $2.5 billion to shareholders in the first quarter of 2025 via $1.5 billion of share repurchases and $1.0 billion in dividends. At a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share (annualized dividend of $3.12), COP pays a dividend yield of 3.3%.

In a research note on the third-quarter update on RBC Capital's Top 30 Global Ideas for 2025, analyst Scott Hanold reiterated a buy rating on ConocoPhillips with a price target forecast of $115. The analyst expects COP to outperform its large-cap exploration and production peers.

""COP has a returns-focused value proposition, a strong balance sheet, and peer-leading distributions,"" Hanold said.

The analyst believes that ConocoPhillips is well-positioned to generate competitive free cash flow (FCF) through various commodity price cycles. Hanold highlighted that the company has a global and diversified asset base, which gives it spending flexibility to deliver industry-leading shareholder returns through economic and commodity price cycles.

Moreover, Hanold expects ConocoPhillips' vast position in the Permian basin to enable greater FCF generation, while providing asset diversity and development flexibility. He noted that the company has a low break-even point of below $40/bbl (WTI), where it can fund its production maintenance capital and dividends. The analyst also noted COP's solid balance sheet, which allows it to enhance shareholder value.

Hanold ranks No. 12 among more than 9,800 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 71% of the time, delivering an average return of 31.2%. See ConocoPhillips Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.

U.S. Bancorp (USB) is another stock that is a part of RBC Capital's list of Top 30 Global Ideas for 2025. It is the parent company of the U.S. Bank and offers customers financial services through a diversified mix of businesses, including consumer banking, commercial banking and wealth management, among others.

With a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share (annualized dividend of $2 per share), USB offers a dividend yield of 4.2%.

RBC analyst Gerard Cassidy reaffirmed a buy rating on USB stock with a 12-month price target of $50. He highlighted several positives supporting his bullish stance, including the bank's new leadership. Cassidy noted that Gunjan Kedia, who succeeded Andy Cecere as the CEO of U.S. Bancorp in April 2025, has reiterated the company's financial goals, including a target of delivering more than 200 basis points of operating leverage. USB reported 270 basis points of operating leverage in the first quarter of 2025.

Cassidy also highlighted that USB has consistently been one of the best-performing banks in the U.S., as reflected in an attractive compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in shareholder return generated over the past 20 years. That growth is mainly driven by the bank's focus on increasing its tangible book value and dividends per share. Notably, U.S. Bancorp has consistently returned as much as 80% of its earnings every year through stock buybacks and dividends.

Cassidy also cited USB's strong asset quality and underwriting skills. The long-time analyst  believes that ""following general underperformance over the last two years, USB is at an inflection point in 2025 where headwinds are becoming tailwinds."" The improvement is driven by the investments made by the bank over the past decade, which are expected to fuel revenue growth ahead of expense growth in years to come, Cassidy said. 

Cassidy ranks No. 24 among more than 9,800 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 72% of the time, delivering an average return of 21%. See U.S. Bancorp Statistics on TipRanks.

Finally, dividend-paying technology company HP (HPQ) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.2894 per share last month, payable on October 1, the fourth dividend in the company's fiscal year 2025. At an annualized dividend of $1.1576 per share, HPQ yields of 4.5%.

Despite tariffs and other ongoing challenges, Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated a buy rating on HPQ stock with a price target of $29. Following an investor webinar with HP's chief enterprise officer Ernest Nicolas, the analyst highlighted key takeaways supporting his bullish stance.  

Daryanani noted that HP is successfully diversifying and is on track to achieve its target of manufacturing 90% of all U.S.-bound products outside China. Much of the manufacturing will remain in Asia and take place in countries such as Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia, along with some planned in Mexico. The analyst added that HP is attempting to close the gap with rivals by adopting a multi-site approach to manufacturing and optimizing its supply chain.

HP expects the ""tariff environment to remain fluid,"" but management believes the company is now better equipped to face tariff-related challenges, Daryanani said.

HP also remains focused on generating $2 billion in gross annual run-rate savings from its Future Ready cost savings plan, the analyst said. The plan includes various initiatives, including internal artificial intelligence tools that could drive productivity and efficiencies.

Daryanani ranks No. 174 among more than 9,800 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 15.3%. See HP Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese arrived in Shanghai on Saturday for a six-day visit to three Chinese cities where regional security tensions and economic ties are likely to dominate talks.

Albanese's second visit to China, where he will meet President Xi Jinping, comes after Canberra stepped up screening of Chinese investment in critical minerals and as U.S. President Donald Trump rattles the global economy with sweeping import tariffs.

Here is a timeline of relations between Australia and China over recent years:

Nov. 17, 2014 - Australia sealed a landmark free trade agreement with top trade partner China, concluding a decade of negotiations. It comes into effect in late 2015.

Dec. 5, 2017 - Australia, concerned about Chinese influence, announces a ban on foreign political donations to prevent external interference in its politics.

Aug. 23, 2018 - Australia bans Huawei Technologies from supplying equipment for its planned 5G broadband network, citing national security regulations.

April 2020 - Australia seeks support for an international inquiry into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. China's then ambassador to Australia says that in response to the call, the Chinese public would boycott Australian wine, beef and tourism.

June 9, 2020 - China urges students going overseas to think carefully before choosing Australia, citing racist incidents, threatening a $27.5 billion market for educating foreign students.

August 2020 - Australian citizen Cheng Lei, a business anchor for Chinese state television in Beijing, is detained.

Nov 27, 2020 - China announces temporary anti-dumping tariffs on Australian wine. Shipments of Australian live lobsters, timber and barley are also blocked or restricted around this time. China's embassy lists 14 grievances with Australia, including the blocking of 10 Chinese investments on national security grounds.

May 22, 2022 - Australia's Labor Party, led by Albanese, wins the general election ending almost a decade of conservative rule.

Nov. 15, 2022 - Albanese meets Xi on the sidelines of the G20 in Indonesia. It is the first leaders' meeting since 2016.

Jan. 3, 2023 - China allows three government-backed utilities and its top steelmaker to resume coal imports from Australia.

Aug. 5, 2023 - China ends 80.5% tariffs on Australian barley.

Oct. 11, 2023 - China releases Australian journalist Cheng Lei after three years in a Beijing prison on national security charges.

Oct. 22, 2023 - China agrees to review dumping tariffs of 218% on Australian wine. Australia pauses WTO complaint.

Nov. 6-7, 2023 - Visiting Beijing, Albanese tells Xi and Premier Li Qiang that a strong relationship between the two countries was ""beneficial into the future"". Xi says stable bilateral ties served each other's interests and both countries should expand their cooperation.

Jan. 18, 2024 - Australia rejects comments by China's ambassador seeking to deflect blame from China's navy for the injury of Australian military divers in an incident near Japan in November.

Feb. 5, 2024 - A Beijing court hands Australian writer Yang Hengjun a suspended death sentence, five years after he was first detained in China and three years after a closed-door trial on espionage charges.

March 29, 2024 - China lifts tariffs on Australian wine, triggering a surge in imports.

Dec. 3, 2024 - China lifts final restrictions on Australian beef.

Dec. 12, 2024 - Australia strikes rugby league funding deal with Papua New Guinea that is contingent on its Pacific Islands neighbour rejecting security or policing ties with China.

Dec. 26, 2024 - China resumes imports of Australian lobster.

Feb. 21, 2025 - Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong raises concerns with Chinese counterpart over inadequate notice given by the Chinese navy of a live-fire exercise in international waters between Australia and New Zealand that forced airlines to divert flights.

May 3, 2025 - Albanese's Labor government is re-elected for a second term in national elections.

Earnings season always seems to roll around with alarming frequency.

The newsroom approaches each quarter with a nervous energy, but this summer it feels especially heightened. Recent market records in both the U.S. and Europe, alongside an unpredictable economic environment, paint a complicated picture for the second half.

It all kicks off on Tuesday with America's banking behemoths, as attention switches from the White House back to Wall Street.

But U.S. President Donald Trump's policies still loom large, with Goldman Sachs predicting that, this quarter, U.S. earnings will start to show the impact of the tariffs.

The investment bank's economists see ""conflicting messages on the margin outlook"" as companies have only announced modest price increases, despite the cost hikes associated with higher tariffs.

Earnings-per-share growth is also set to come under pressure, with Goldman suggesting, ""the consensus estimate among analysts sees S&P 500 companies' earnings-per-share growth decelerating to 4% this quarter relative to the same quarter last year — down from 12% in the first quarter.""

With the banks set to dominate next week — JPMorgan, Citi, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America are all reporting within just two days — maybe Europe can provide some optimism.

As reported by CNBC's Jenni Reid, European banks just recorded their best first half since 1997. Gains were driven by strong investment banking returns — something their U.S. counterparts are also likely to capitalize on — as well as stock rallies based on both deal speculation and actual M&A.

As someone who grew up in Cape Town, seeing this year's G20 meetings take place in South Africa makes me pine for the sunshine of the Southern hemisphere.

Next week's meeting in Durban between finance ministers and central bank governors comes at an interesting time for the country.

An Oval Office meeting between South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and Trump went spectacularly wrong back in May, when the latter, flanked by his South African (now former) right-hand man Elon Musk, made false claims of a ""white genocide.""

It seems tensions have not abated.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will skip the meeting altogether, opting to head to Japan instead, according to Reuters. South Africa is also subject to a new 30% tariff rate, the only country in sub-Saharan Africa to be singled out in the latest round of announcements.

It does not bode well for the G20 Leaders meeting, due to be held in Gauteng on Nov. 22-23. It remains to be seen if Trump will attend.

In May, South Africa's golfing greats — who traveled to the White House with Ramaphosa — failed to win over Trump. But maybe the lure of some of the best courses in the world, along with a South African summer, could see a seasonal change in his mood toward the country later this year.

 Senior Contributor. 

Bitcoin has hit a fresh all-time high this week, riding a wave that has sparked a wild new theory around the identity of bitcoin's mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto.

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can ""uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!""

The bitcoin price soared to almost $119,000 per bitcoin after Tesla billionaire Elon Musk confirmed a bitcoin bombshell, catapulting the crypto market toward $4 trillion.

Now, as U.S. president Donald Trump sees the bitcoin price and crypto going “through the roof,” the chief executive of crypto exchange Coinbase has issued a shock “10x” artificial intelligence crypto prediction.

Brian Armstrong, the chief executive of bitcoin and crypto exchange Coinbase, has predicted crypto ... More integration could ""10x"" artificial intelligence, potentially pushing the bitcoin price and crypto markets higher.

“I expect enhanced crypto functionality will be a catalyst for AI to achieve another 10x unlock,” Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong posted to X. “Personally I'm most excited to see crypto wallets fully integrated into large language model (LLMs) one day. That will be a huge step towards a permissionless, digital economy.”

Coinbase, the U.S.-listed crypto exchange that recently topped its 2021 Covid-era market capitalization and is now worth around $100 billion, has partnered with artificial intelligence-powered search engine startup Perplexity AI to create a real-time crypto data service.

The two-stage partnership will first see Perplexity pull market data from Coinbase to power “market analysis” in Perplexity's new Comet browser, effective immediately. The next step, date to be confirmed, will see responses to user queries linked to Coinbase market data.

Since crypto passed the hype torch to generative AI at the launch of OpenAI's ChatGTP in November 2022, crypto developers have been scrambling to hitch their rickety wagon to the AI rocket ship—searching for the holy grail that would see AI companies somehow adopt blockchain technology.

Coinbase's partnership with Perplexity follows a deal between crypto-powered prediction platform Polymarket and Elon Musk's xAI last month.

The bitcoin price has rocketed higher, topping $118,000 per bitcoin and unleashing a wave of bullish ... More bitcoin price predictions.

Meanwhile, Coinbase stock rose this week despite a rare double downgrade from analysts with H.C. Wainwright, going from a ""buy"" recommendation to a ""sell,"" and warning of disappointing second-quarter results.

“While we continue to view Coinbase as a ‘Best of Breed' crypto exchange and remain positive on the sector, we believe valuation has outstripped near-term fundamentals following the stock's ~150% rally since its April lows, which we view as overdone,” analyst Mike Colonnese wrote in a note to clients seen by Coindesk.

Despite some fears the latest bitcoin price and crypto market might be overdone, bullish bitcoin price predictions are still rolling in.

""We expect bitcoin to top $200,000 by the end of year, I think we're going substantially higher from here,"" Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan told Yahoo Finance, pointing to the friendly bitcoin and crypto policies coming out of the Trump administration and the huge bitcoin buying being done by bitcoin treasury companies and bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Is Bitcoin competing against gold as safe haven bet amid Trump's tariff uncertainty? EXPLAINED","https://www.livemint.com/market/commodities/is-bitcoin-competing-against-gold-as-safe-haven-bet-amid-trumps-tariff-uncertainty-explained-11752400379225.html","Sun, 13 Jul 2025 10:17:29 GMT","

Bitcoin surged to all-time record on Thursday, moving past $118,000 and even crossing the $119,000 mark on Friday, before settling at $118,780.

This sharp rise comes as global stock markets decline, driven by trade and tariff tensions sparked by US President Donald Trump's tariff notices to over 20 countries. The rally also marks the end of a two-month lull in the cryptocurrency market, with Ether rising above $3,000 for the first time since February.

“ The milestone comes amid growing allocations into bitcoin from institutional & corporate treasuries. They are accumulating bitcoin aggressively. Strategy Inc & GameStop Corp, have joined the ranks, announcing board‑approved Bitcoin purchases. Now bitcoin looks like a safe haven asset like gold against the market uncertainity, like war, trade tariffs & political unstability,” said Anuj Gupta, Director, Ya Wealth Research & Advisory.

Sugandha Sachdeva- Founder-SS WealthStreet, believes that Bitcoin is increasingly earning the moniker “digital gold” because, like the yellow metal, it tends to attract capital whenever traditional risk assets wobble.

Risk appetite faltered, but Bitcoin after an initial dip to $74,420 rebounded sharply, surging to a record $112,000 in May and still hovering near $111,150. That's a 49 per cent advance off its April low, far outpacing gold's 12 per cent rise from its April trough of $2,956.

“ With the US dollar retreating against major currencies, investors have migrated toward scarce, non-yielding stores of value. Both gold and Bitcoin benefit, but Bitcoin's thinner market depth magnifies price swings on incremental flows. Further, Bitcoin's fixed 21 million-coin supply shields it from the kind of balance-sheet expansion that debases fiat currencies an attribute that resonates as global sovereign debt scales fresh highs. However, the key difference is that central banks continue to diversify into gold, reinforcing its safe-haven pedigree. By contrast, official adoption of Bitcoin remains tentative, suggesting sovereign demand could be a future, rather than current, driver of flows,” Sachdeva said.

The post-tariff rally underscores that Bitcoin, despite its higher volatility, is starting to mirror gold's role as a refuge when policy shocks rattle conventional markets. As long as debt overhangs grow and the dollar stays soft, the search for debasement-resistant assets should keep Bitcoin in demand alongside bullion, she added.

Institutional holdings of Ethereum (ETH) have surpassed one million across various entities, including corporations, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and government bodies. This shift is largely driven by Ethereum's staking yield potential, a feature absent in Bitcoin, which lacks passive income mechanisms. 

SharpLink Gaming, a Nasdaq-listed betting technology company, recently acquired 21,487 ETH valued at $64.26 million. This significant purchase was executed through private over-the-counter (OTC) deals and Coinbase Prime, an institutional crypto service provider. The transaction underscores Ethereum's growing appeal as a strategic financial asset beyond speculative trading. SharpLink's acquisition follows a previous agreement with the Ethereum Foundation to purchase 10,000 ETH for $25 million, further solidifying institutional confidence in Ethereum's utility. 

Ethereum's appeal extends beyond its staking capabilities. Visa and PayPal have integrated Ethereum Layer 2 solutions into their settlement rails, using Optimism and Arbitrum to process stablecoin-based cross-border transactions. This integration expands Ethereum's real-world utility and positions it as a foundational layer for global financial transactions. Additionally, BlackRock has announced plans to tokenize a segment of its 401(k) retirement fund offerings using Ethereum smart contracts, marking the largest institutional commitment to on-chain finance to date. 

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has officially affirmed that ETH is a commodity, not a security. This legal clarity opens the door for ETH-based financial products and broader institutional participation without regulatory overhang. Furthermore, Ethereum's gas market has achieved significant efficiency milestones with the implementation of data blob compression mechanisms, reducing average gas costs on rollups by over 50%. This enhancement strengthens Ethereum's position as the most scalable general-purpose blockchain. 

Institutions are increasingly turning to Ethereum for their treasury reserves, driven by the growing appeal of Ethereum's decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. This shift is influenced by the potential for staking, which allows institutions to earn passive income by participating in the network's consensus mechanism. The versatility of Ethereum's smart contract capabilities enables the creation of complex financial instruments and applications, further enhancing its appeal as a treasury reserve asset. 

One notable example of this shift is BitMine, a company that plans to use its proceeds to purchase Ethereum as its primary treasury reserve asset. This decision underscores the growing institutional interest in Ethereum and reflects a broader trend among institutions recognizing the potential of Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem to drive innovation and generate value. 

The transition from Bitcoin to Ethereum for treasury reserves is not without its challenges. Institutions must navigate the complexities of the DeFi landscape, including regulatory uncertainties and the technical intricacies of smart contracts. However, the potential benefits of engaging with Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem are significant, and many institutions are willing to take on these challenges in pursuit of higher returns and greater financial flexibility.

Ethereum has recently surpassed Bitcoin in futures trading volume, marking a significant milestone in the cryptocurrency market. For the first time, Ethereum's futures trading volume reached $62.1 billion, narrowly surpassing Bitcoin's $61.7 billion. This shift indicates a growing interest in Ethereum among traders, potentially signaling a change in market dynamics and investor sentiment.

This event is attributed to several factors, including a surge in institutional interest. Significant inflows into U.S.-listed Ethereum spot ETFs have been observed, suggesting that institutional investors are increasingly drawn to Ethereum's evolving ecosystem and pending updates. This institutional backing has provided a strong foundation for Ethereum's recent gains, contributing to its ability to surpass Bitcoin in futures trading volume.

The markets responded quickly to this shift, with increased volatility in Ethereum futures resulting in higher liquidation rates. Despite this volatility, Ethereum's open interest has significantly risen, indicating that traders are preparing for further movements in the cryptocurrency. Analysts suggest that Ethereum might continue to draw investor attention as new catalysts emerge within its network. The lack of direct staking in spot ETFs limits some investor participation, potentially altering risk evaluations.

This technical flip in the derivatives market highlights Ethereum's potential to challenge traditional market structures, setting a precedent for future trading dynamics. As more institutional products enter the market, Ethereum's role could expand, reshaping cryptocurrency investments fundamentally. The futures volume flip suggests a potential rotation in trader focus and positioning ahead of possible Ethereum-specific catalysts, indicating a shift in trader strategies and a renewed focus on Ethereum.

Ethereum's open interest surged to $21 billion by mid-July 2025, marking a significant milestone not seen since 2022. This increase coincided with a rise in ETH's market price to approximately $2,930. The growth in open interest was driven by sustained ETF inflows that outpaced the current rate of new ETH issuance. This trend indicates a strong institutional interest in Ethereum, with traders heavily positioning themselves in Ethereum contracts, leading to multi-month highs in leverage.

From late 2023 through mid-2024, Ethereum experienced a period of rising open interest alongside increasing prices. After a market correction, the market rebounded in the second quarter of 2025. The derivatives volume accelerated in July as institutional flows increased, further fueling the growth in open interest. This surge in derivatives activity and institutional positioning highlights Ethereum's growing prominence in the cryptocurrency market.

In contrast, Bitcoin's open interest reached $40.3 billion during the same period, nearly double that of Ethereum. However, Bitcoin's open interest growth remained more gradual. Bitcoin's price climbed from $20,000 in early 2023 to above $117,000 in July 2025, with open interest rising in a parallel but slower trajectory. Over the past two months, Ethereum's open interest growth outpaced Bitcoin's, driven by increased leverage during the ETF accumulation phase. Chart trends show Ethereum leading recent derivatives activity despite Bitcoin's higher notional value in open contracts.

ETH ETFs recorded a combined daily net inflow of $204.82 million on July 11, with total assets reaching $13.53 billion. This cumulative net inflow reached $5.31 billion, accounting for 3.77% of Ethereum's market capitalization. The overall value traded across these ETFs reached $1.40 billion on the same date. ETHA, sponsored by BlackRock and listed on NASDAQ, held the largest net assets at $6.14 billion, with a daily inflow of $137.08 million and traded $990.76 million in value. ETHA also had the highest daily volume of 43.78 million units and closed at $22.80 with a 6.79% gain.

Grayscale's ETHE on NYSE showed a cumulative net outflow of $4.26 billion despite a $9.96 million daily inflow. Its net assets stood at $3.44 billion. Grayscale's second product, ETH, reported $823.83 million in cumulative inflows and $1.68 billion in assets. Fidelity's FETH recorded $11.99 million in daily inflows and $1.66 billion in assets. Other ETFs, including ETHW, ETHV, EZET, CETH, and QETH, all closed higher with positive net flows and daily volume activity across different exchanges.

This surge in ETF inflows and open interest indicates a significant shift in market dynamics, with Ethereum leading the growth in derivatives activity over Bitcoin. The sustained ETF inflows outpacing new ETH issuance suggest a strong demand for Ethereum, which could continue to drive its market price and open interest higher. The increased institutional positioning and leverage in Ethereum contracts further support this trend, making Ethereum a key player in the cryptocurrency derivatives market.

According to CoinDesk Data price information, at 2:20 p.m. UTC on Sunday, the bitcoin BTC$118,714.83 price set a new all-time high of $119, 308, up 1.4% in the past 24-hour period.

Bitcoin's achievement was a little bit surprising because the crypto market was  waiting for the U.S. stock market to open on Monday to discover the reaction to the 30% tariffs against imports from the EU and Mexico that Trump announced late Friday on Truth Social.

Analysts expect the bitcoin price to reach as high as $250,000 by year-end. For example, in a recent interview on CNBC, Fundstrat Capital CIO Thomas Lee said that the demand versus supply imbalance for BTC meant that its price could easily reach anywhere from $150,000 to $250,000 by the end of this year.

As of 4:11 p.m. UTC, bitcoin is trading at around $118,882, which is a gain of 1.38% in the past 24-hour period. 

Meanwhile, on the same day, XLM got as high $0.4815 (at 3:20 p.m. UTC), but currently it is trading at $0.4578, up 22% in the past 24 hours. XLM's performance, although highly impressive, was not a huge shock since on Saturday, it surged 6% to $0.3880, making it the top performer by percent change among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap.

As for HBAR, its intraday high of $0.2516 was reached at 3:10 p.m. UTC, but it is currently trading at around $0.2439, up 27% in the past 24 hours, which makes it right now today's top percentage gainer among the top 20 cryptocurrencies.

Crypto analyst Rekt Capital noted on X that HBAR's recent 62% surge aligns closely with its 2021 price cycle, suggesting the token could be setting up for a similar breakout pattern. According to the analyst, HBAR has been tracking the 2021 structure ""almost perfectly,"" and any near-term pullback should be viewed as a potential retest with the goal of breaking above the current lower high resistance level.

The pseudonymous analyst also pointed out that a modest 2.5% dip in bitcoin's market dominance has already fueled strong rallies across many altcoins. He noted that if such a small decline can trigger outsized altcoin moves, a more substantial drop in dominance — into double-digit territory —could significantly accelerate capital rotation into the altcoin market.

The chief executive of Bitcoin (BTC) financial services firm Fold is issuing a warning about altcoins, saying that the crypto king's market dominance isn't something that will backtrack.

In a new interview with CNBC Television, Fold CEO Will Reeves says that the top crypto asset by market cap's recent new all-time high was due to a combination of high institutional demand and low supply.

“This is what happens when massive demand meets the finite supply of Bitcoin. And what we're seeing right now is the supply shock in motion. 

So I'd certainly say what we are seeing is the fundamentals of Bitcoin in play…

What we've seen recently with the rise of Bitcoin treasury companies, the ETFs (exchange-traded funds) is that entirely new classes of capital are able to invest in the asset. What we're seeing is what happens when trillions of dollars start knocking on the door – the price tends to go up.” 

According to Reeves, the market's appetite for BTC will cause its dominance levels to irreversibly rise – a trend that would leave countless altcoins competing for capital.

“Frankly, I think [altcoins] will remain speculative. Bitcoin dominance is at 60% and rising. I think what we're seeing is an inevitable trend towards the signal, the apex asset. The issue is that Bitcoin is the only credibly neutral digital asset that is in issuance. 

All the other tokens are still proving extraordinarily speculative use cases without the track record of Bitcoin. And so what we are seeing today is the continued march of Bitcoin dominating this entire market… Ultimately, what we've seen is something that can't be reversed.” 

Bitcoin is trading for $117,613 at time of writing, a sideways move on the day. Meanwhile, Bitcoin dominance, which measures how much of the total crypto market cap belongs to BTC, stands at 64.58%.

Key Points

This cryptocurrency's track record and recent developments in government make it a no-brainer to buy and hold.

The cryptocurrency market has been heating up since the Trump administration assumed office in January.

President Donald Trump campaigned on supporting cryptocurrencies, and his actions have followed through on this promise. He signed an executive order to establish a strategic federal reserve for digital assets and has broadly loosened the regulatory grip on the industry.

But when it comes to deciding the smartest cryptocurrency to buy right now, it may still pay to stick with the basics. Most cryptocurrencies are highly speculative investments. That said, Bitcoin (BTC 1.06%) appears poised to build on its years of impressive returns.

I'll explain below why Bitcoin remains the smartest cryptocurrency to invest $1,000 into today.

Image source: Getty Images.

The price of any traded asset at any given moment boils down to market forces -- what someone is willing to sell something for, versus what someone is willing to pay for it. It's the fundamental basics of supply and demand.

Some assets represent tangible things. For instance, real estate is physical property that you can appraise. Stocks represent ownership in companies, with revenue and profits. Having something tangible helps someone determine how much to pay for it.

However, cryptocurrencies are digital assets, often with little or no tangible value to support their market prices. As a result, cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile. Their long-term price direction depends on factors that ultimately influence that delicate balance between supply and demand.

It's that simple. Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, has been such a lucrative investment over the years because it continues to get this right.

For starters, Bitcoin has a capped maximum supply, and new coins enter circulation at a slower rate following each halving, when mining rewards decline. Meanwhile, interest (demand) in Bitcoin has risen over time as it gains support from individuals, institutional investors, and even corporations and governments. For example, some companies have begun carrying Bitcoin on their balance sheets instead of cash and equivalents, and the U.S. government will start stockpiling Bitcoin thanks to Trump's executive order earlier this year.

Investors looking to invest in altcoins, or any cryptocurrency aside from Bitcoin, must consider their purpose and tokenomics. Many altcoins are meme coins, designed with little intention of real-world utility. Their market prices depend on sustained popularity.

Ethereum and XRP are popular altcoins, but both come with some issues. The Ethereum network's token, Ether, has an unlimited supply, which applies downward pressure on the token's market price. Meanwhile, XRP's creator, Ripple Labs, remains entangled in a civil lawsuit with U.S. regulators after a judge recently rejected their efforts to settle the case. It could weigh on XRP's real-world adoption and its market price until the litigation is resolved. 

Cryptocurrencies as a whole have become increasingly popular across the investing community, but Bitcoin remains, at least for now, the most widely adopted and valued cryptocurrency by a wide margin.

Bitcoin may not represent property or a business, but society has given it value as an anti-inflationary asset. This purpose drives higher interest in Bitcoin, and it's an important distinction that separates it from other cryptocurrencies at the moment.

One might think of Bitcoin as a digital version of gold. It doesn't have as much practical use as fiat currency, but it is valued, and there is only a limited amount of it. Just like gold, Bitcoin's price, denominated in U.S. dollars, continues to increase as more dollars flood the economy.



US M2 Money Supply data by YCharts

Bitcoin has risen much faster than gold, but it also started at a much smaller value. Even today, Bitcoin's fully diluted market value of $2.3 trillion is a fraction of the world's gold supply, which is about $22.3 trillion. I'm not sure that Bitcoin will ultimately match gold's value, but it's reasonable to think that there's more upside ahead, given the huge disparity.

The U.S. government's consistent fiscal deficit helps contribute to an expanding money supply. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the newly passed ""big, beautiful bill"" will likely increase the U.S.'s national debt during the next decade, which bodes well for Bitcoin and other assets priced in U.S. dollars.

These tailwinds, combined with a growing interest in Bitcoin from various parties worldwide, make it the clear choice for investors looking to invest $1,000 in cryptocurrencies today.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","A Company Tried to Put Real Estate on the Blockchain and Now It's Facing a Legal Disaster","https://futurism.com/detroit-crypto-realtoken","Sun, 13 Jul 2025 15:00:45 GMT","

Detroit is a city that's used to fighting. Once the third most populous city in the country, its citizens have long struggled against robber barons, anti-communist witch hunts, private sector looting, and racist housing laws. It hasn't had it easy, to say the least.

Now, Outlier reports, the city is doing battle against a $93 million crypto real estate scheme.

The city recently announced a massive lawsuit filed against RealToken, a cryptocurrency business that's snapping up hundreds of subsidized housing units to ""tokenize"" on the blockchain.

Once purchased by RealToken, the property is sold to international crypto speculators in tiny increments, a scheme known as ""fractional ownership."" A tenant's rent is then split among the property's investors based on how many tokens they own of a given unit.

The exploitative scheme was first uncovered by Outlier, which reported that RealToken properties are plagued by squalid conditions, unresponsive property managers, and arbitrary evictions. Operating through 165 shell companies, the crypto firm reportedly owes the city more than $3 million in unpaid fines and commercial property taxes.

Detroit announced the lawsuit after a five-month joint investigation spanning three municipal agencies.

""This is the largest nuisance abatement case in our history,"" said Conrad Mallett, counselor for the City of Detroit. ""These defendants have profited from our communities while ignoring their most basic legal obligations as landlords and property owners. Our neighborhoods are not investment portfolios — they are homes for Detroit residents.""

Though RealToken claims it has no direct interaction with the properties it gobbles up on the blockchain — and therefore had no idea about the state of its properties — Motown isn't hearing it.

""Any claims that RealToken was unaware of the condition of the subject property is simply specious,"" the city's court filing reads. ""The City of Detroit has sent numerous correction orders, emergency correction orders, blight violations and fair warning letters directly to Real Token, which have gone largely unheaded.""

""Furthermore,"" the city continues, ""RealToken refused to authorize payment for 'even the most basic repairs' with its former property maintenance company, thereby maximizing profits over health, safety, and welfare of Detroit residents.""

The city's suit covers over 400 RealToken properties, according to Outlier, none of which are in compliance with city code. Detroit alleges that the company is responsible for systemic code violations, evading responsibility for property upkeep through a ""complex web of LLCs and shell companies,"" and posing a danger to public health and safety.

It's a major lawsuit for low-income Detroiters who've become embroiled in the crypto scheme, and a major test for the swelling blockchain real estate industry more broadly.

Similar blockchain schemes include companies like Foreclosure Token, which ""aims to provide a secure and transparent platform for investors to participate in the distressed real estate market"" by offering clients tokenized shares ""in foreclosure properties and tax liens.""

Detroit's press release notes that this is believed to be the ""first lawsuit of its kind targeting a blockchain-based property investment platform for nuisance-related violations at scale.""

""This is not innovation,"" Detroit councilmember Angela Whitfield Calloway told Outlier. ""This is exploitation.""

Home - Opinion - Can Blockchain Help Revolutionize the Sports Industry? Experts Believe So!

TL;DR

The sports industry today faces major challenges in transparency, security, and fan loyalty. Blockchain technology has positioned itself as a solution capable of immutably recording operations, optimizing ticket sales and resales, authenticating merchandise, and empowering both clubs and fans. Below, we explore how various real-world innovations are changing the rules of the game.

The global sports market moves billions of dollars annually, traditionally relying on centralized databases vulnerable to fraud. However, with the integration of blockchain technology:

All ticket sales and resales are recorded on a public ledger, eliminating scalping through smart contracts with preset limits.

Every sponsorship deal and player transfer is traceable in detail — from contract clauses to payment terms — reducing the risk of disputes.

Digital collectibles like fan tokens and NFTs carry immutable metadata certifying their origin, making them impossible to counterfeit.

As a result, clubs, sponsors, and fans can verify every transaction with full confidence in its integrity.







Fan tokens are reshaping the relationship between supporters and teams. Thanks to platforms like Socios.com:

Fans vote on key decisions (kit designs, marketing campaigns), directly influencing club life.

They gain access to exclusive content, VIP experiences, and special promotions, strengthening their sense of belonging.

They can trade digital rewards, which fluctuate in value based on demand, creating new income opportunities.

Additionally, initiatives like Chiliz Chain aim to enhance this ecosystem by providing custom infrastructure to enable tokenized projects for ticketing, merchandising, and sponsorship.

Despite its advantages, adopting blockchain in sports comes with three core obstacles:

Infrastructure and scalability: Running nodes and handling high transaction volumes demands significant technical and financial resources.

Resistance to change: Traditional federations and operators are often reluctant to overhaul longstanding operational models.

Regulation and privacy: Legal frameworks are needed to balance transparency with personal data protection.

To address these issues, layer 2 solutions and private, customized blockchains — like Chiliz Chain — have emerged, offering instant transactions, high throughput, and pre-configured smart contracts.







Several examples already confirm blockchain's impact in sports:

FC Barcelona enabled fans to vote on a mural design for the team's locker room, strengthening emotional ties with supporters.

UFC allowed fans to help decide fighter bonus payouts, increasing audience involvement.

Formula 1 adopted blockchain systems to validate real-time telemetry, improving the reliability of data for teams and commentators.

On the other hand, LaLiga, in partnership with CoinW, is decentralizing access to performance statistics, setting a new standard for federations seeking to optimize their processes.







Experts foresee disruptive applications that will shape the next decade in the sports industry:

Tokenized athlete contracts allowing fans to invest in their idols' future success.

Anti-doping systems on blockchain, ensuring immutable records of every test and result.

Decentralized leagues managed by the community, where fans take part in both sporting and financial decisions.

Immersive virtual reality experiences, where tokens unlock exclusive spaces and virtual meetups with athletes.







Blockchain has the potential to redefine the foundations of sports. By bringing transparency, new revenue channels, and unprecedented engagement opportunities, this technology offers everything needed to deliver innovative and trustworthy experiences. Although it requires a high degree of adaptation and regulatory cooperation, current case studies and expert projections suggest that the clubs and organizers embracing blockchain technology will be best equipped to meet the expectations of today's audiences

Coinbase has made a significant move by updating its X account profile to feature a Pudgy Penguins NFT. This change is part of a broader trend in the cryptocurrency market where symbolic engagements often lead to surges in interest and trading activity. The update has sparked excitement within the crypto community, with active participation from both Coinbase and Pudgy Penguins on social media further amplifying the attention.

The PENGU token, associated with the Pudgy Penguins NFT, experienced a notable price surge of over 30%, reaching $0.02404. The market cap for PENGU also saw volatility, fluctuating between $968 million and $1.85 billion. This social media exchange highlights the strategic branding efforts within the crypto markets, where high-profile endorsements can significantly impact investor sentiment and related assets.

Trading activity for Pudgy Penguins NFTs saw a substantial increase, with NFT volume rising by 690% in just 24 hours. This surge in activity suggests both retail and potential institutional engagement, as shifts in investor sentiment often follow such high-profile endorsements. The economic implications of this move are far-reaching, with the potential for long-term growth tied to regulatory developments.

Long-term expectations for PENGU's growth are linked to the SEC's acknowledgment of a PENGU ETF proposal. Past rallies driven by branding and regulatory interactions suggest that if the ETF gains approval, PENGU could see further gains. According to the analyst's forecast, PENGU could hit $0.060 by August 2025—a 216% gain from its July 12 high—if the ETF gains approval. These insights underscore the potential ripple effects of large platform actions across the crypto ecosystem, influencing future economic and regulatory dynamics.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","Everything You Need to Know About Nitro Nation: World Tour","https://nftplazas.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-nitro-nation-world-tour/","Sun, 13 Jul 2025 13:13:02 GMT","

Nitro Nation: World Tour (NNWT) launched onto the mobile gaming scene in October 2023, delivering a high-octane drag racing experience with deep car customization for enthusiasts.

This free-to-play title includes officially licensed cars from prestigious manufacturers such as McLaren, Aston Martin, and Jaguar.

NNWT introduced a unique take on digital ownership—blending traditional mobile gameplay with optional NFT elements that let players truly own their virtual cars.

This guide covers everything from the game's origins to its core mechanics and what to expect in the future.

Nitro Nation: World Tour was created through a collaboration between Creative Mobile (CM Games), the longtime developers of the Nitro Nation franchise, and Mythical Games, known for their blockchain expertise.

Together, they aimed to merge Creative Mobile's racing game experience with the Mythos blockchain platform.

The game's development and rollout progressed across 2022 and 2023:

The launch drew attention thanks to high-profile collaborations:

NNWT took a hybrid approach to blockchain by integrating with the Mythos ecosystem. This allowed players to own in-game cars and workshops as digital collectibles.

Importantly, the game does not require interaction with NFTs or cryptocurrency—players can enjoy the full experience without ever touching blockchain elements. This aligns with Mythical's “gamers-first” philosophy.

At its core, NNWT is about fast, straight-line races that test timing and vehicle performance. Races are brief, making them ideal for quick play sessions.

Gameplay mechanics are intentionally streamlined:

Victory relies on both car performance and player timing. While the controls are simple, the impressive graphics and realistic effects help deliver a strong sense of speed and immersion.

The game offers a mix of modes to keep players engaged:

Seasonal content adds new themes and updates, with Season 1 focused on McLaren and Deadmau5.

The game offers an in-depth customization system:

Players progress from basic D-class vehicles to top-tier S-class models. Cars can be upgraded to improve acceleration, top speed, grip, and boost power. Fine-tuning allows for adjustments to grip balance and nitrous output. Cosmetic customisation includes paint jobs, decals, body kits, neon lights, and coloured smoke effects.

NFT cars offer slightly higher base stats but still need to be upgraded to remain competitive. A car loan system also lets friends try out vehicles they don't own.

Social Clubs are the foundation of the game's multiplayer features:

Progress within clubs unlocks bonuses for all members, and advanced upgrades are tied to club workshops. Workshop NFTs provide benefits such as reduced upgrade costs. The game also supports cross-platform play between Android and iOS users. Leaderboards track top racers across various categories.

Reviews for NNWT were mixed but noted several strengths. The casual-friendly gameplay was praised for being accessible to newcomers, whilst car enthusiasts enjoyed the detailed customization and licensed vehicle lineup.

The optional NFT integration received credit for staying unobtrusive for those not interested in blockchain. Visual fidelity and authentic car models also earned high marks.

However, criticisms were significant. Many reviewers highlighted how progression could become a grind, pushing players toward spending real money. Some argued that stats mattered more than skill, reducing the importance of player ability.

Online play drew complaints for lag and long matchmaking times. NFT car prices also raised concerns, especially when some digital cars cost more than real-world used vehicles.

Mythical Games continues to treat NNWT as a live-service title, regularly updating the game to address feedback. Major changes have been made to the tuning and upgrade systems, offering more control to players. The user interface has been refined, and technical issues like performance bugs have been fixed.

Seasonal content and limited-time events also help keep the game fresh.

The team plans to expand the game with new car brands, game modes, and special events. Existing systems will likely receive further refinement as feedback rolls in. The strong reception to multiplayer and social features suggests these will continue to grow.

Rather than releasing yearly sequels, the developers aim to evolve NNWT as a long-term platform. The “World Tour” name hints at future updates with new locations and race types beyond drag racing.

Deeper integration into the Mythos ecosystem seems likely, especially as blockchain features become more user-friendly. Competitive events like leagues or esports tournaments may also emerge. The in-game economy will likely expand to support more ownership and trading options—whether or not players choose to use NFTs.

The team has repeatedly emphasized community features, suggesting a strong focus on player creativity, trading, and cooperative play. Combined with the game's solid foundation, this direction gives NNWT strong potential for long-term success.

Nitro Nation: World Tour offers fast-paced racing with enough depth to satisfy tuning and customization fans. Its approach to digital ownership allows for blockchain integration without alienating traditional players.

Despite mixed reviews and monetization concerns, the game's strong core systems and developer support signal long-term potential. Whether you're chasing quick races or building your dream garage, NNWT offers a fresh take on mobile racing.

As updates continue to roll out, NNWT could serve as a model for how traditional games might successfully incorporate blockchain technology—and reshape the future of the mobile racing genre.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Bitcoin's recent surge to new highs has sparked contrasting reactions within the crypto community, with notable figures like Peter Schiff urging caution and suggesting alternative investments. Schiff recommends reallocating gains from Bitcoin into silver, citing silver's historically stable value and perceived limited downside risk compared to Bitcoin's volatility. This perspective underscores the ongoing tension between bullish crypto enthusiasts and traditional asset advocates.

Meanwhile, significant developments such as Grayscale's legal pushback against SEC delays and Binance's involvement in stablecoin creation highlight ongoing regulatory and market dynamics. Grayscale's legal challenge against the SEC's delay in approving its Digital Large Cap ETF exemplifies the friction between innovation and regulatory frameworks. The SEC's unexpected review after initial approval disrupts established timelines, raising concerns about regulatory transparency and market impact. Concurrently, Binance's reported involvement in developing the World Liberty Financial stablecoin highlights the exchange's expanding influence beyond trading, venturing into stablecoin issuance tied to high-profile political figures. These developments illustrate the complex interplay of regulation, institutional strategy, and market expansion.

The crypto market's volatility is further exemplified by the recent withdrawal of high-leverage trader James Wynn from social media following significant financial losses. Wynn's exit, marked by a stark profile update to “broke,” reflects the inherent risks associated with leveraged trading in digital assets. Wallet analyses reveal a drastic reduction in holdings, underscoring the potential for rapid capital erosion in highly speculative positions. This incident serves as a cautionary tale for traders leveraging substantial positions amid fluctuating market conditions.

Contrary to narratives of NFT market decline, Snoop Dogg's recent Telegram-based NFT drop sold nearly one million tokens within 30 minutes, generating $12 million in sales. Powered by the TON blockchain, the collection's success signals renewed interest and innovation in digital collectibles. This resurgence suggests that NFTs remain a dynamic sector with significant growth potential.

Bitcoin closed the week at approximately $117,967, with Ether and XRP also maintaining strong positions. Notably, altcoins such as MemeCore (M) surged by over 1,200%, while others like Jito (JTO) experienced declines. The total crypto market capitalization stands near $3.68 trillion, reflecting sustained investor engagement. These fluctuations highlight the diverse performance spectrum within the crypto ecosystem, emphasizing the importance of strategic asset selection and risk management.

Leading voices in the crypto space provide valuable context for current trends. Matthew Hyland confirms Bitcoin's technical breakout signaling an end to a prolonged downtrend, while Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin emphasizes the platform's scalability and regulatory compliance. Ethical considerations are raised by Richard Painter regarding conflicts of interest among regulators, and Nick Ruck forecasts substantial growth in the stablecoin market contingent on regulatory alignment. These insights contribute to a nuanced understanding of the market's trajectory and regulatory environment.

As Bitcoin and the broader crypto market reach new milestones, investors and stakeholders must balance optimism with prudence. Regulatory developments, market volatility, and evolving asset classes like NFTs demand informed decision-making. The contrasting viewpoints from industry experts and market participants underscore the complexity of navigating this rapidly changing landscape. Staying abreast of regulatory actions, market signals, and technological innovations will be crucial for capitalizing on opportunities while mitigating risks in the crypto sector.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","Pump.fun ICO Sells Out In Minutes, Raises $500 Million And $4 Biilion Fully Diluted Valuation","https://bitcoinist.com/pump-fun-ico-sells-out-in-minutes-raises-500m-and-4b-fully-diluted-valuation/","Sun, 13 Jul 2025 17:00:51 GMT","

Pump.fun's long-anticipated public token sale concluded in a mere 12 minutes, and investors snapped up the full 12.5% of its 1 trillion‑token supply in a quick move. The event raised a total of $500 million from the sale of 125 billion PUMP tokens priced at $0.004, which accounts for 12.5% of the total 1 trillion token supply. 

The Pump.fun ICO has officially become one of the most explosive token launches of the year after raising $500 million and closing out its sale in just 12 minutes. The Solana-based memecoin launchpad stunned the crypto community this Saturday with an explosive public token sale offering that distributed 125 billion PUMP tokens, which amounts to about 12.5% of the total 1 trillion supply at $0.004 apiece. This complete sale brings the PUMP tokens to a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $4 billion.

Investors participated in the ICO by buying directly on the Pump.fun official token website or any of the project's multiple centralized exchanges, which include Bybit, KuCoin, Bitget, Kraken, Gate.io, and MEXC. According to a dashboard on the official website, $448.5 million worth of PUMP tokens were purchased on the website, $5 million worth were purchased on Gate, $30 million worth were purchased on Kraken, and $16.5 million worth of tokens were purchased on KuCoin.



Image From Pump.fun

Buyers can expect PUMP tokens to be distributed within the next 48 to 72 hours, but transfers will be temporarily disabled during this window. Transfers will be enabled immediately after the distribution is complete. Nonetheless, pre-market activity suggests strong bullish sentiment. The quick sellout indicates that the crypto could surge massively in the first few trading sessions after launch, as long as the market is still in its current bullish state at the time it launches.

The earliest that PUMP could become tradable and accessible for US and UK users is Monday, July 14. Notably, PUMP's pre-listing price surged to as high as $0.006989 on Hyperliquid after the sale. Although it dropped after this peak, it has recovered a bit and is now around $0.006989. 

Notably, the project's post of the sellout on the social media platform X was met with mixed reactions, as shown in the comments. Supporters celebrated the event, but not everyone was impressed. Some users voiced frustration over exchange issues that prevented them from completing their purchases during the short 12-minute window, while others raised questions about token distribution fairness, especially considering the discrepancy between the 33% supply initially promised for the ICO and the 12.5% that was ultimately offered in the public sale.



Image From Pump.fun

One trader reportedly opened a huge short position on Hyperliquid on $PUMP using 2x leverage with $8 million in USDC. The position is already about $800,000 in the red and is steadily approaching liquidation at $0.0085.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

The $PUMP token has made a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market following a highly successful Initial Coin Offering (ICO). The ICO, which raised $500 million, sold out in just 12 minutes, demonstrating an overwhelming demand and early investor confidence. The token, launched at $0.004, quickly gained momentum, trading near $0.0056 within hours and reaching $0.006444, marking a 60% increase above its ICO price.

This early price action is indicative of strong demand and speculative excitement. On July 12, the PUMPUSD pair experienced its most significant move, surging from around $0.0055 to nearly $0.0070 in a single session. This 27% spike was supported by a substantial trading volume of over 518 million tokens, confirming that the price growth is backed by real interest rather than mere market hype.

The trading volume profile during the rally further validates the organic market interest and wide participation. Most of the volume occurred during the sharp breakout, not during quieter periods. The token dipped to around $0.0049 earlier on July 11 before rebounding aggressively, demonstrating strong support at lower levels. Despite a slight pullback after hitting its peak, the price remains above the post-sale lows, hovering near $0.0064 as traders digest gains and new investors evaluate their entry points.

Token distribution is currently underway, with pump.fun confirming that the process will be completed within 48 to 72 hours post-sale. During this period, the tokens will be locked and not tradable or transferable. Once distribution ends, trading will officially open across exchanges. The official contract address has been released, and users are advised to avoid counterfeit versions to ensure the security of their investments.

The success of the PUMP Token ICO and the subsequent price rally can be attributed to several factors. The project's innovative approach and unique value proposition have resonated with investors seeking cryptocurrencies that offer more than just speculative gains. Strong community support and effective marketing efforts have also driven investor interest and participation. Additionally, the overall bullish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market has created a favorable environment for new projects to gain traction and attract investment.

However, it is crucial for investors to approach such investments with caution. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility and unpredictability. Thorough research and due diligence are essential before making any investment decisions. Factors such as the project's team, technology, and market potential should be carefully considered.

In summary, the PUMP Token's $500 million ICO and 27% price rally represent a significant achievement for the project and the broader cryptocurrency market. The success of the ICO and the subsequent price movement underscore the growing interest in innovative cryptocurrency projects and the potential for substantial returns. As the market continues to evolve, investors should remain vigilant and conduct thorough research to navigate the dynamic landscape effectively.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, has been compared to the late tech visionary Steve Jobs, highlighting his leadership style amidst ongoing regulatory and market challenges. This comparison underscores Garlinghouse's ability to navigate through global crypto challenges with excellence, much like Jobs did in the tech industry.

Garlinghouse continues to lead Ripple despite intense regulatory scrutiny, earning recognition for his vision in transforming Ripple into a major player within the crypto ecosystem. His consistent public statements forecast ambitious trajectories for the company, aiming to capture a potential 14% share of SWIFT's cross-border payments by 2030. Garlinghouse's strategic focus is centered on expanding Ripple's reach and influence, drawing parallels to transformative technology leaders like Jobs.

The implications of Garlinghouse's leadership style are significant. They bolster investor confidence in Ripple's future and have the potential to reshape how cross-border payments are viewed globally. This transformational mindset aligns with industry aspirations, encouraging further investments in blockchain technologies. The emergence of new regulations could redefine boundaries for digital assets, affecting Ripple and possibly other blockchain initiatives.

Ripple's ambitions highlight technological advancements and industry shifts spurred by regulatory developments and blockchain innovations. These trends are emblematic of a changing landscape in international financial systems, often led by figures like Garlinghouse. His leadership has not only advanced Ripple's technological capabilities but also positioned the company as a leader in the blockchain space. His vision for integrating blockchain technology with traditional finance has the potential to revolutionize the way financial transactions are conducted globally.

Garlinghouse's recent activities have further solidified his reputation as a key figure in the crypto space. He has been actively engaged in pushing the boundaries of blockchain innovation, particularly in academia. Ripple's commitment to advancing blockchain technology through academic partnerships and research has reached new milestones, exciting Garlinghouse and the broader Ripple community.

In addition to his academic endeavors, Garlinghouse has been vocal about Ripple's role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. He recently testified before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, where he discussed the company's vision for crypto and institutional finance. His appearance at a Washington event also underscored his influence on market sentiment.

Garlinghouse's leadership extends beyond his public appearances and academic initiatives. He has also been instrumental in shaping Ripple's strategic partnerships and technological advancements. For instance, Ripple selected BNY Mellon to be the custodian of its stablecoin, a move that underscores the company's commitment to integrating traditional financial institutions with blockchain technology.

The comparison to Steve Jobs is not merely about Garlinghouse's charisma or public persona; it reflects his ability to drive innovation and disrupt traditional industries. Like Jobs, Garlinghouse has a clear vision for the future of finance and is relentlessly pursuing it through Ripple's technological advancements and strategic partnerships. His impact on the crypto industry is multifaceted, positioning Ripple as a key player in the blockchain ecosystem.

In summary, Brad Garlinghouse's likeness to Steve Jobs is a testament to his transformative leadership in the cryptocurrency industry. His commitment to innovation, strategic partnerships, and public advocacy has positioned Ripple as a key player in the blockchain ecosystem. As Garlinghouse continues to push the boundaries of what is possible with blockchain technology, his influence on the industry is likely to grow, further cementing his status as a visionary leader.

According to CoinDesk Data price information, at 2:20 p.m. UTC on Sunday, the bitcoin BTC$118,758.40 price set a new all-time high of $119, 308, up 1.4% in the past 24-hour period.

Bitcoin's achievement was a little bit surprising because the crypto market was  waiting for the U.S. stock market to open on Monday to discover the reaction to the 30% tariffs against imports from the EU and Mexico that Trump announced late Friday on Truth Social.

Analysts expect the bitcoin price to reach as high as $250,000 by year-end. For example, in a recent interview on CNBC, Fundstrat Capital CIO Thomas Lee said that the demand versus supply imbalance for BTC meant that its price could easily reach anywhere from $150,000 to $250,000 by the end of this year.

As of 4:11 p.m. UTC, bitcoin is trading at around $118,882, which is a gain of 1.38% in the past 24-hour period. 

Meanwhile, on the same day, XLM got as high $0.4815 (at 3:20 p.m. UTC), but currently it is trading at $0.4578, up 22% in the past 24 hours. XLM's performance, although highly impressive, was not a huge shock since on Saturday, it surged 6% to $0.3880, making it the top performer by percent change among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap.

As for HBAR, its intraday high of $0.2516 was reached at 3:10 p.m. UTC, but it is currently trading at around $0.2439, up 27% in the past 24 hours, which makes it right now today's top percentage gainer among the top 20 cryptocurrencies.

Crypto analyst Rekt Capital noted on X that HBAR's recent 62% surge aligns closely with its 2021 price cycle, suggesting the token could be setting up for a similar breakout pattern. According to the analyst, HBAR has been tracking the 2021 structure ""almost perfectly,"" and any near-term pullback should be viewed as a potential retest with the goal of breaking above the current lower high resistance level.

The pseudonymous analyst also pointed out that a modest 2.5% dip in bitcoin's market dominance has already fueled strong rallies across many altcoins. He noted that if such a small decline can trigger outsized altcoin moves, a more substantial drop in dominance — into double-digit territory —could significantly accelerate capital rotation into the altcoin market.

 Bitcoin's surge to all-time highs has barely moved the needle in Google search interest compared to the spike seen after Donald Trump won the US presidential election in November. 

Bitcoin has reached consecutive record highs this week, yet retail investors seem reluctant to jump back into the market, according to a crypto researcher.

However, demand for spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is surging, with Thursday and Friday recording daily inflows of over $1 billion, the first time this has happened on two consecutive days.

Bitwise head of research André Dragosch said in an X post on Friday, “Bitcoin is at new all-time highs but retail is almost nowhere to be found,” pointing to the lack of Google search interest in “Bitcoin” despite the asset setting consecutive all-time highs this week.

“Latest leg up is mostly driven by institutions,” Dragosch said.

Google global search interest for the term “Bitcoin” increased by 8% in the week of July 6 –12 compared to the previous week, June 29 – July 5. The increase coincided with Bitcoin breaking its previous all-time high of $111,970 on Wednesday, and climbing further to $118,780 by Friday, according to Google Trends and CoinMarketCap data.

However, Bitcoin search interest is 60% lower than the week of Nov. 10–16, 2024, which was the week after Donald Trump won the US presidential election.  

That week was followed by a month-long rally that propelled Bitcoin to reach $100,000 for the first time ever on Dec. 5.

Some Bitcoin advocates are speculating that retail investors may perceive the current price of Bitcoin as too high to enter the market.

Bitcoin commentator Lindsay Stamp said, “I think a lot of retail folks find out the price of one Bitcoin is 117k and think, nahhh I missed the boat and don't even give it a second thought.”

Echoing a similar sentiment, the Bitcoin Matrix podcast host Cedric Youngelman said in an X post on Saturday, “At what Bitcoin price do you think retail wakes up?” I'll go first. I don't think they're coming for a long time.” 

Bitcoin onchain analyst Willy Woo said Bitcoin's uptrend is far from over. “This run has plenty of legs left in it,” Woo said in an X post on Saturday.

Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs had a strong trading week, with $2.72 billion inflows over the five days, according to Farside data.

Cointelegraph recently reported on July 5 that if the end holder of a BTC ETF share is a retail client, it may be time to reconsider how onchain data is interpreted, as this could represent the reality of retail Bitcoin demand.

 Thousands of savers face potential losses after a $2.7 million shortfall was discovered at Ziglu, a British crypto fintech that entered special administration. 

Thousands of savers face the grim prospect of losing their investments after administrators uncovered a 2 million pounds ($2.7 million) shortfall at Ziglu, a British cryptocurrency fintech that collapsed earlier this year.

The company, which suspended withdrawals in May, was placed into special administration last week amid mounting concerns over its financial management, according to a Sunday report from The Telegraph.

Ziglu attracted around 20,000 customers with promises of high-interest returns, particularly through its “Boost” product, which offered yields up to 6%. Launched in 2021 during a period of low interest rates, Boost became popular due to its higher returns.

However, the product was not protected or ring-fenced, allowing the company to use customer funds for day-to-day operations and lending activities. Following the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) intervention in May, withdrawals were frozen, leaving savers locked out of their money for weeks.

At a recent High Court insolvency hearing, directors were accused of mismanaging funds, with evidence suggesting that money from Boost savers was diverted to cover general cash flow issues before the company applied for special administration in June, per The Telegraph.

The report said that around 4,000 customers had their Boost investments frozen, totaling approximately $3.6 million. With the $2.7 million shortfall, the majority of these funds could be lost unless recovered through a rescue or sale deal.

Ziglu, founded by former Starling Bank co-founder Mark Hipperson, described its mission as “empowering everyone to benefit from the new world of digital money, easily, safely and affordably”.

The company was once valued at $170 million and attracted a deal with US fintech giant Robinhood in 2022, which later fell through amid crypto market turmoil. Ziglu's administrators, RSM, will now seek buyers for the company.

The UK's unclear stance on digital asset regulation is drawing criticism from industry experts, who blame “policy procrastination” for the country falling behind the European Union and the US.

Last month, John Orchard and Lewis McLellan of the Digital Monetary Institute argued that the UK has squandered its early lead in distributed ledger finance by delaying concrete regulatory action.

Unlike the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework and the US Senate's recent passage of the GENIUS Act, which provide clear guidelines for crypto and stablecoins, the UK's FCA still lacks a confirmed launch date for its crypto regime.

 The Czech National Bank boosted its investment in Palantir and entered the crypto space by acquiring Coinbase shares in Q2. 

The Czech National Bank adjusted its US investment portfolio in the second quarter by increasing its stake in Palantir Technologies and initiating a new position in cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global.

These moves were disclosed in a Form 13F filing, which is a quarterly report filed by investment managers to the Securities and Exchange Commission that discloses their US equity holdings.

The filing shows the bank has added 51,732 Coinbase shares, worth over $18 million. The Czech National Bank also added 49,135 Palantir shares in the second quarter of the year, bringing its total to 519,950 by the end of June.

Palantir, a data analytics firm, saw its stock surge 80% in the first half of 2025, outperforming the S&P 500's 5.5% gain. The company has benefited from strong earnings reports and growing investor interest in artificial intelligence.

Coinbase became the first crypto company to join the S&P 500 in May. The S&P 500 is a stock market index that tracks the performance of 500 of the largest, publicly traded companies in the US, representing a broad measure of the overall US stock market.

The company's stock rose 41% in the first half of 2025 and gained an additional 10% in the following weeks. The exchange's shares are also up by around 60% over the past month, according to data from Google Finance.

Meanwhile, Coinbase's total revenue dropped 10% quarter-over-quarter to $2 billion in Q1, missing industry expectations as trading activity slowed across the market. The company's net income plummeted 95% to $66 million, largely due to a $596 million paper loss on its crypto holdings.

Transaction revenue also declined 18.9% to $1.26 billion, with trading volumes down 10.5% to $393 billion, reflecting a shrinking crypto market partly impacted by tariffs under the Trump administration. Despite this, earnings per share of $1.94 surpassed analyst estimates.

Coinbase has been expanding its market share in spot and derivatives trading with new acquisitions. In May, the firm announced that it had agreed to acquire the crypto options trading platform Deribit in a transaction worth $2.9 billion.

Earlier this month, the company purchased Liquifi, a token management platform specializing in early-stage tokenization projects. The move enhances Coinbase's token cap table management, vesting, and compliance capabilities, enabling it to support token creators earlier in their development.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Tirzepatide: The weight-loss drug that also shrinks breast tumors in mice","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250713031436.htm","Sun, 13 Jul 2025 09:25:14 GMT","

The anti-obesity medication tirzepatide, marketed as Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for obesity, reduced obesity-associated breast cancer growth in a mouse model, according to a study being presented at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif.

""Obesity is a significant risk factor for breast cancer, and while it is very preliminary data, our studies in mice suggest that these new anti-obesity drugs may be a way to reduce obesity-associated breast cancer risk or improve outcomes,"" said study author Amanda Kucinskas, B.S., a Ph.D. candidate in the labs of Drs. Erin Giles and Kanakadurga Singer at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Mich.

Existing research has shown that having obesity can lead to worse breast cancer outcomes compared to those who do not have obesity, and weight loss can improve outcomes. However, there are many challenges with traditional weight loss methods.

Kucinskas and colleagues leveraged tirzepatide, one of a new class of effective anti-obesity medications that target GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) receptors. The researchers sought to learn whether or not tirzepatide would reduce obesity-associated breast cancer growth.

This mouse study included 16 mice. The 9-week-old C57BL/6 mice were fed a 40% high-fat diet and housed in a warm environment to induce obesity. At 32 weeks of age, the mice with obesity were randomly assigned injections of tirzepatide or a placebo every other day for 16 weeks. Tumor volumes were measured twice weekly.

The researchers found that the anti-obesity drug reduced body weight and body fat by approximately 20% in mice, similar to the amount of weight loss achieved by women on this drug. They found this was primarily due to a loss of adipose mass, with a reduction in adipose depot weights compared to controls.

The anti-obesity drug also reduced tumor volume compared to the controls. At the end of the study, the researchers found that tumor volume was significantly correlated with body weight, total adipose mass and the amount of fat stored in the liver.

""While these are very preliminary results, they suggest that this new anti-obesity drug may also have a beneficial impact on breast cancer outcomes,"" Kucinskas said.

Ongoing studies are underway in collaboration with Dr. Steve Hursting's lab at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to separate the weight loss from the tumor-specific effects of tirzepatide.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","These mysterious stars could glow forever using dark matter","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250713031447.htm","Sun, 13 Jul 2025 17:34:24 GMT","

A new kind of cosmic object could help solve one of the universe's greatest mysteries: dark matter.

Particle Astrophysicists have proposed the existence of a strange new type of star-like object, called a 'dark dwarf', which may be quietly glowing in the center of our galaxy.

Far from being dark in appearance, these unusual objects are powered by dark matter (the invisible substance thought to make up about a quarter of the universe).

The discovery comes from a UK-US research team and the full research findings has been published in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics (JCAP).

Using theoretical models, the scientists suggest that dark matter can get trapped inside young stars, producing enough energy to stop them from cooling and turning them into stable, long-lasting objects they call dark dwarfs.

Dark dwarfs are thought to form from brown dwarfs, which are often described as failed stars.

Brown dwarfs are too small to sustain the nuclear fusion that powers most stars, so they cool and fade over time. But if they sit in a dense pocket of dark matter, like near the Milky Way's center, they could capture dark matter particles.

If those particles then collide and destroy each other, they release energy keeping the dark dwarf glowing indefinitely.

The existence of these objects depends on dark matter being made of specific kinds of particles, known as WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles).

These are heavy particles that barely interact with ordinary matter, but could annihilate with one another inside stars, providing the energy needed to keep a dark dwarf alive.

To tell dark dwarfs apart from other faint objects like brown dwarfs, the scientists point to a unique clue: lithium.

The researchers believe dark dwarfs would still contain a rare form of lithium called lithium-7.

In normal stars, lithium-7 gets burned up quickly. So, if they find an object that looks like a brown dwarf but still has lithium-7 that's a strong hint it's something different.

Study co-author Dr Djuna Croon of Durham University, said: ""The discovery of dark dwarfs in the galactic center would give us a unique insight into the particle nature of dark matter.""

The team believes that telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope could already be capable of spotting dark dwarfs, especially when focusing on the center of the galaxy.

Another approach might be to look at many similar objects and statistically determine whether some of them could be dark dwarfs.

Finding just one of these dark dwarfs, the researchers say, would be a major step towards uncovering the true nature of dark matter.

Using tirzepatide and menopause hormone therapy at the same time leads to increased weight loss in postmenopausal women with overweight or obesity compared to use of tirzepatide treatment alone, according to a study presented at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif.

""These data are the first to show the combined use of tirzepatide and menopause hormone therapy significantly increases treatment effectiveness in postmenopausal women,"" said Regina Castaneda, M.D., research fellow for the Division of Endocrinology at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Fla. ""Previous studies of the medication semaglutide found similar results. Achieving these outcomes with a second obesity medication may indicate a broader efficacy trend for pairing these two classes of medications.""

Menopause-related hormonal changes often result in increased abdominal fat, decreased muscle mass and altered energy expenditure that leads to weight gain and puts millions of women at risk for developing heart disease and other serious health issues.

To confirm the hypothesis that concurrent menopause hormone therapy enhances the effectiveness of tirzepatide for weight loss in postmenopausal women, researchers conducted a real-world study using the electronic medical records of 120 postmenopausal women over a median duration of 18 months. The study included two cohorts: 40 women using menopause hormone therapy concurrently with tirzepatide and 80 women using tirzepatide alone.

The results showed superior total body weight loss percentage for women using tirzepatide plus menopause hormone therapy (17%) compared to those using tirzepatide alone (14%). In addition, a higher percentage of menopause hormone therapy users (45%) also achieved at least 20% total body weight loss, compared to 18% of menopause hormone therapy non-users.

""The information garnered through this new study provides important insights to develop more effective and personalized weight management interventions to reduce a postmenopausal woman's risk of overweight and obesity-related health complications,"" said Maria Daniela Hurtado Andrade, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of medicine and consultant for the Division of Endocrinology at the Mayo Clinic. ""This study underscores the urgent need for further research to better understand how obesity medications and menopause hormone therapy work together. Gaining this knowledge could greatly improve the health and well-being of millions of postmenopausal women. It also points to the need for better strategies to make these treatments more accessible and available to those who need them.""

This research was funded by the National Institutes of Health Bridging Interdisciplinary Careers in Women's Health Research Grant and the Mayo Clinic Center for Women's Health Research.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Not all exercise boosts mental health — it's the why that matters most","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250713031443.htm","Sun, 13 Jul 2025 13:58:12 GMT","

Research often points to exercise as a good way to boost mental health, but a recent study from the University of Georgia suggests that it's not just physical movement that affects mental health.

It's how, where and why you exercise that makes the difference.

""Historically, physical activity research has focused on how long someone exercises for or how many calories were burned,"" said Patrick O'Connor, co-author of the study and a professor in the Mary Frances Early College of Education's Department of Kinesiology. ""The 'dose' of exercise has been the dominant way researchers have tried to understand how physical activity might influence mental health, while often ignoring whether those minutes were spent exercising with a friend or as part of a game.""

While research shows that leisure-time physical activity -- like going for a run, taking a yoga class or biking for fun -- correlates with better mental health outcomes, these benefits may vary significantly depending on the environment and circumstances surrounding the activity, according to the researchers.

To analyze these factors, the researchers reviewed three types of studies. These included large-scale epidemiological studies that examined health patterns in populations, randomized controlled trials where some groups received exercise treatments and others did not, and a much smaller but growing set of investigations into contextual factors.

Exercise and mental health

Multiple studies found that people who engage in regular leisure-time physical activity tend to report lower levels of depression and anxiety. But it's less clear for other forms of activity like cleaning the house or working for a lawn care company. The context may matter as much as the intensity or amount of physical activity.

""For example, if a soccer player runs down the field and kicks the game-winning ball, their mental health is fantastic,"" O'Connor said. ""In contrast, if you do the exact same exercise but miss the goal and people are blaming you, you likely feel very differently. Anecdotes such as these show how context matters even when people are performing a similar exercise dose.""

Numerous randomized controlled trials also showed that adopting regular exercise routines boosted mental health, especially for individuals with existing mental health disorders. However, these studies were typically based on small, short-term and homogenous samples, so the results likely aren't generalizable to larger, more diverse groups.

""The average effects on mental health are small across all the randomized controlled studies of exercise, and that's partly because most of the studies focused on people who were not depressed or anxious -- you do get bigger effects in those studies,"" added O'Connor. ""We're communicating to scientists that larger- and longer-term controlled studies are needed to make a compelling case whether exercise does, or does not, truly impact mental health.""

Why context matters

Where the evidence is thinnest -- but potentially most important -- is in understanding contextual factors. The same physical activity can feel very different depending on who the activity was done with, as well as where, when and how.

Context can range from peer dynamics and instructor style to external conditions like weather or time of day. ""If you're outside and it's hot, and you're having to walk to work, that's part of the context,"" he added. ""Or if you go and take a group exercise class -- some instructors you really like, and some you don't. So, that's also part of the context.

""If we're trying to help people's mental health with exercise, then not only do we need to think about the dose and the mode, we also need to ask: What is the context?"" O'Connor said.

For O'Connor, the takeaway is clear. It's not just movement that matters. It's the meaning, the setting and the experience surrounding the activity that determines the impact of exercise on mental health.

Co-authors of the study include Eduardo Bustamante of the University of Illinois Chicago; Angelique Brellenthin of Iowa State University; and David Brown, who recently retired from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Metabolic health factors, including small increases in blood sugar, are the main drivers of change in the reproductive systems and sexual functioning of aging men, according to a study presented at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif.

""Although age and testosterone levels have long been considered an impetus for men's declining sexual health, our research indicates that these changes more closely correlate with modest increases in blood sugar and other metabolic changes,"" said Michael Zitzmann, M.D., Ph.D., professor and doctor of medicine at University Hospital in Muenster, Germany. ""This means that men can take steps to preserve or revive their reproductive health with lifestyle choices and appropriate medical interventions.""

These conclusions follow a long-term study of healthy men (without diabetes mellitus, heart disease and/or cancer) aged 18-85 that began in 2014 with 200 participants and concluded in 2020 with 117 participants. Researchers studied progressive changes in participants' semen and hormonal profiles, erectile functioning and metabolic health (BMI and blood sugar levels marked by the HbA1c test).

Findings indicated that over time hormone levels and semen parameters stayed largely within normal ranges. However, sperm movement and erectile function declined in men with minimally elevated blood sugar levels that were below the 6.5% HbA1c diabetes threshold. The study also found that while testosterone levels did not have a direct impact on erectile function, they did correlate with participants' libido assessment.

""We're hopeful that the information gleaned from this study will help doctors and their patients formulate effective male sexual health maintenance plans,"" Zitzmann added. ""We now know that it's in our power to retain sexual and reproductive well-being in men, even as they age.""

This research was conducted as part of the FAME 2.0 study.

The Milky Way could have many more satellite galaxies than scientists have previously been able to predict or observe, according to new research.

Cosmologists at Durham University, UK, used a new technique combining the highest-resolution supercomputer simulations that exist, alongside novel mathematical modelling, predicting the existence of missing ""orphan"" galaxies.

Their findings suggest that there should be 80 or perhaps up to 100 more satellite galaxies surrounding our home galaxy, orbiting at close distances.

If these galaxies are seen by telescopes then it could provide strong support for the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) theory which explains the large-scale structure of the Universe and how galaxies form.

This ongoing research is being presented at the Royal Astronomical Society's National Astronomy Meeting being held at Durham University.

The Durham-led research is based on the LCDM model where ordinary matter in the form of atoms represents only 5% of the Universe's total content, 25% is cold dark matter (CDM), and the remaining 70% is dark energy.

In this model, galaxies form in the centre of gigantic clumps of dark matter called halos. Most galaxies in the Universe are low-mass dwarf galaxies, the majority of which are satellites orbiting around a more massive galaxy, such as our Milky Way.

The existence of these enigmatic objects has long posed challenges to LCDM - otherwise known as the standard model of cosmology. According to LCDM theory, many more Milky Way companion galaxies should exist than cosmological simulations have so far produced, or astronomers have been able to see.

The new research shows that the Milky Way's missing satellites are extremely faint galaxies stripped almost entirely of their parent dark matter halos by the gravity of the Milky Way's halo. These so-called ""orphan"" galaxies are lost in most simulations, but should have survived in the real Universe.

Using their new technique, the Durham researchers were able to track the abundance, distribution, and properties of these Milky Way orphan galaxies - showing that many more Milky Way satellites should exist and be observable today. It is hoped that new advances in telescopes and instruments like the Rubin Observatory LSST camera (which recently saw its first light), will give astronomers the ability to detect these very faint objects, bringing them into our view for the first time.

Lead researcher Dr Isabel Santos-Santos, in the Institute for Computational Cosmology, Department of Physics, Durham University, said: ""We know the Milky Way has some 60 confirmed companion satellite galaxies, but we think there should be dozens more of these faint galaxies orbiting around the Milky Way at close distances.

""If our predictions are right, it adds more weight to the Lambda Cold Dark Matter theory of the formation and evolution of structure in the Universe.

""Observational astronomers are using our predictions as a benchmark with which to compare the new data they are obtaining.

""One day soon we may be able to see these 'missing' galaxies, which would be hugely exciting and could tell us more about how the Universe came to be as we see it today.""

The concept of LCDM is the cornerstone of our understanding of the Universe. It has led to the Standard Model of Cosmology and is the most widely accepted model for describing the Universe's evolution and structure on large scales.

The model has passed multiple tests but has recently been challenged by puzzling observational data on dwarf galaxies.

The Durham researchers say that even the best existing cosmological simulations (which include gas and star formation, in addition to dark matter) do not have the resolution needed to study galaxies as faint as those astronomers are starting to discover close to the Milky Way.

These simulations also lack the precision required to follow the evolution of the small dark matter halos that host the dwarf galaxies as they orbit around the Milky Way over billions of years.

This leads to the artificial disruption of some halos, leaving galaxies ""orphaned."" Although the simulations lose the halos of ""orphan"" galaxies, such galaxies should survive in the real Universe.

The Durham researchers combined cosmological supercomputer simulations with analytical models to overcome these numerical issues.

This included the Aquarius simulation, produced by the Virgo Consortium. Aquarius is the highest resolution simulation of a Milky Way dark matter halo ever created and is used to understand the fine-scale structure predicted around the Milky Way.

It also included the GALFORM model, a cutting-edge code developed at Durham over the past two decades which follows the detailed physical processes that are responsible for the formation and evolution of galaxies.

Their results showed that halos of dark matter, which may host a satellite galaxy, have been orbiting around the central Milky Way halo for most of the age of the Universe, leading to the stripping of their dark matter and stellar mass, and rendering them extremely small and faint.

As a result, the research predicts that the total number of satellite galaxies - of any brightness - likely to exist around the Milky Way is around 80 or potentially up to 100 more than currently known.

The research puts particular emphasis on the approximately 30 newly discovered tiny Milky Way satellite candidates that are extremely faint and small.

Scientists are unclear if these are dwarf galaxies embedded in a dark matter halo, or globular clusters, collections of self-gravitating stars.

The Durham researchers argue that these objects could be a subset of the faint population of satellite galaxies they predict should exist.

Co-researcher Professor Carlos Frenk, of the Institute for Computational Cosmology, Department of Physics, Durham University said: ""If the population of very faint satellites that we are predicting is discovered with new data, it would be a remarkable success of the LCDM theory of galaxy formation.

""It would also provide a clear illustration of the power of physics and mathematics. Using the laws of physics, solved using a large supercomputer, and mathematical modelling we can make precise predictions that astronomers, equipped with new, powerful telescopes, can test. It doesn't get much better than this.""

The research is funded by the European Research Council through an Advanced Investigator grant to Professor Frenk, and by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC). The calculations were performed on the Cosmology Machine (COSMA), a supercomputer supported by the STFC's Distributed Infrastructure for Research using Advanced Computing (DiRAC) project, and hosted by Durham University.

The Royal Astronomical Society's (RAS) National Astronomy Meeting 2025 (NAM 2025) is being held at Durham University from 7-11 July.

Almost a thousand of the world's top astronomers and space scientists will attend NAM which sees researchers present the latest cutting-edge space research alongside outreach events involving schools, artists, industry and the public.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","For Algorithms, Memory Is a Far More Powerful Resource Than Time","https://www.wired.com/story/for-algorithms-a-little-memory-outweighs-a-lot-of-time/","Sun, 13 Jul 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

One July afternoon in 2024, Ryan Williams set out to prove himself wrong. Two months had passed since he'd hit upon a startling discovery about the relationship between time and memory in computing. It was a rough sketch of a mathematical proof that memory was more powerful than computer scientists believed: A small amount would be as helpful as a lot of time in all conceivable computations. That sounded so improbable that he assumed something had to be wrong, and he promptly set the proof aside to focus on less crazy ideas. Now, he'd finally carved out time to find the error.

That's not what happened. After hours of poring over his argument, Williams couldn't find a single flaw.

“I just thought I was losing my mind,” said Williams, a theoretical computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. For the first time, he began to entertain the possibility that maybe, just maybe, memory really was as powerful as his work suggested.

Over the months that followed, he fleshed out the details, scrutinized every step, and solicited feedback from a handful of other researchers. In February, he finally posted his proof online, to widespread acclaim.

“It's amazing. It's beautiful,” said Avi Wigderson, a theoretical computer scientist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. As soon as he heard the news, Wigderson sent Williams a congratulatory email. Its subject line: “You blew my mind.”

Time and memory (also called space) are the two most fundamental resources in computation: Every algorithm takes some time to run and requires some space to store data while it's running. Until now, the only known algorithms for accomplishing certain tasks required an amount of space roughly proportional to their run time, and researchers had long assumed there's no way to do better. Williams' proof established a mathematical procedure for transforming any algorithm—no matter what it does—into a form that uses much less space.

What's more, this result—a statement about what you can compute given a certain amount of space—also implies a second result, about what you cannot compute in a certain amount of time. This second result isn't surprising in itself: Researchers expected it to be true, but they had no idea how to prove it. Williams' solution, based on his sweeping first result, feels almost cartoonishly excessive, akin to proving a suspected murderer guilty by establishing an ironclad alibi for everyone else on the planet. It could also offer a new way to attack one of the oldest open problems in computer science.

“It's a pretty stunning result, and a massive advance,” said Paul Beame, a computer scientist at the University of Washington. “It's a little bit less of a surprise that it's Ryan doing this.”

Williams, 46, has an open, expressive face and a hint of gray in his hair. His office, which looks out over the colorful spires of MIT's Stata Center, is another illustration of the creative use of space. A pair of yoga mats have transformed a window ledge into a makeshift reading nook, and the desk is tucked into an oddly shaped corner, freeing up room for a couch facing a large whiteboard brimming with mathematical scribblings.

MIT is a long way from Williams' childhood home in rural Alabama, where there was no shortage of space. He grew up on a 50-acre farm and first saw a computer at age 7, when his mother drove him across the county for a special academic enrichment class. He recalled being transfixed by a simple program for generating a digital fireworks display.

“It was taking a random color and sending it in a random direction from the middle of the monitor,” Williams said. “You couldn't have predicted what picture you're going to get.” The world of computers seemed a wild and wonderful playground, full of infinite possibilities. Young Williams was hooked.

“I was writing programs to myself, on paper, to be run on a future computer,” he said. “My parents didn't really know what to do with me.”

As he grew older, Williams advanced from imaginary computers to real ones. For his last two years of high school, he transferred to the Alabama School of Math and Science, a prestigious public boarding school, where he first encountered the theoretical side of computer science.

“I realized that there was a wider world of things out there, and that there was a way to think mathematically about computers,” he said. “That's what I wanted to do.”

Williams was especially drawn to a branch of theoretical computer science called computational complexity theory. It deals with the resources (such as time and space) that are needed to solve computational problems such as sorting lists or factoring numbers. Most problems can be solved by many different algorithms, each with its own demands on time and space. Complexity theorists sort problems into categories, called complexity classes, based on the resource demands of the best algorithms for solving them—that is, the algorithms that run fastest or use the least amount of space.

But how do you make the study of computational resources mathematically rigorous? You won't get far if you try to analyze time and space by comparing minutes to megabytes. To make any progress, you need to start with the right definitions.

Those definitions emerged from the work of Juris Hartmanis, a pioneering computer scientist who had experience making do with limited resources. He was born in 1928 into a prominent Latvian family, but his childhood was disrupted by the outbreak of World War II. Occupying Soviet forces arrested and executed his father, and after the war Hartmanis finished high school in a refugee camp. He went on to university, where he excelled even though he couldn't afford textbooks.

“I compensated by taking very detailed notes in lectures,” he recalled in a 2009 interview. “There is a certain advantage to [having] to improvise and overcome difficulties.” Hartmanis immigrated to the United States in 1949, and worked a series of odd jobs—building agricultural machinery, manufacturing steel and even serving as a butler—while studying mathematics at the University of Kansas City. He went on to a spectacularly successful career in the young field of theoretical computer science.

In 1960, while working at the General Electric research laboratory in Schenectady, New York, Hartmanis met Richard Stearns, a graduate student doing a summer internship. In a pair of groundbreaking papers they established precise mathematical definitions for time and space. These definitions gave researchers the language they needed to compare the two resources and sort problems into complexity classes.

One of the most important classes goes by the humble name “P.” Roughly speaking, it encompasses all problems that can be solved in a reasonable amount of time. An analogous complexity class for space is dubbed “PSPACE.”

The relationship between these two classes is one of the central questions of complexity theory. Every problem in P is also in PSPACE, because fast algorithms just don't have enough time to fill up much space in a computer's memory. If the reverse statement were also true, the two classes would be equivalent: Space and time would have comparable computational power. But complexity theorists suspect that PSPACE is a much larger class, containing many problems that aren't in P. In other words, they believe that space is a far more powerful computational resource than time. This belief stems from the fact that algorithms can use the same small chunk of memory over and over, while time isn't as forgiving—once it passes, you can't get it back.

“The intuition is just so simple,” Williams said. “You can reuse space, but you can't reuse time.”

But intuition isn't good enough for complexity theorists: They want rigorous proof. To prove that PSPACE is larger than P, researchers would have to show that for some problems in PSPACE, fast algorithms are categorically impossible. Where would they even start?

As it happened, they started at Cornell University, where Hartmanis moved in 1965 to head the newly established computer science department. Under his leadership it quickly became a center of research in complexity theory, and in the early 1970s, a pair of researchers there, John Hopcroft and Wolfgang Paul, set out to establish a precise link between time and space.

“I thought about it, and I was like, ‘Well, that just simply can't be true.'”

Hopcroft and Paul knew that to resolve the P versus PSPACE problem, they'd have to prove that you can't do certain computations in a limited amount of time. But it's hard to prove a negative. Instead, they decided to flip the problem on its head and explore what you can do with limited space. They hoped to prove that algorithms given a certain space budget can solve all the same problems as algorithms with a slightly larger time budget. That would indicate that space is at least slightly more powerful than time—a small but necessary step toward showing that PSPACE is larger than P.

With that goal in mind, they turned to a method that complexity theorists call simulation, which involves transforming existing algorithms into new ones that solve the same problems, but with different amounts of space and time. To understand the basic idea, imagine you're given a fast algorithm for alphabetizing your bookshelf, but it requires you to lay out your books in dozens of small piles. You might prefer an approach that takes up less space in your apartment, even if it takes longer. A simulation is a mathematical procedure you could use to get a more suitable algorithm: Feed it the original, and it'll give you a new algorithm that saves space at the expense of time.

Algorithm designers have long studied these space-time trade-offs for specific tasks like sorting. But to establish a general relationship between time and space, Hopcroft and Paul needed something more comprehensive: a space-saving simulation procedure that works for every algorithm, no matter what problem it solves. They expected this generality to come at a cost. A universal simulation can't exploit the details of any specific problem, so it probably won't save as much space as a specialized simulation. But when Hopcroft and Paul started their work, there were no known universal methods for saving space at all. Even saving a small amount would be progress.

The breakthrough came in 1975, after Hopcroft and Paul teamed up with a young researcher named Leslie Valiant. The trio devised a universal simulation procedure that always saves a bit of space. No matter what algorithm you give it, you'll get an equivalent one whose space budget is slightly smaller than the original algorithm's time budget.

“Anything you can do in so much time, you can also do in slightly less space,” Valiant said. It was the first major step in the quest to connect space and time.

But then progress stalled, and complexity theorists began to suspect that they'd hit a fundamental barrier. The problem was precisely the universal character of Hopcroft, Paul and Valiant's simulation. While many problems can be solved with much less space than time, some intuitively seemed like they'd need nearly as much space as time. If so, more space-efficient universal simulations would be impossible. Paul and two other researchers soon proved that they are indeed impossible, provided you make one seemingly obvious assumption: Different chunks of data can't occupy the same space in memory at the same time.

“Everybody took it for granted that you cannot do better,” Wigderson said.

Paul's result suggested that resolving the P versus PSPACE problem would require abandoning simulation altogether in favor of a different approach, but nobody had any good ideas. That was where the problem stood for 50 years—until Williams finally broke the logjam.

First, he had to get through college.

In 1996, the time came for Williams to apply to colleges. He knew that pursuing complexity theory would take him far from home, but his parents made it clear that the West Coast and Canada were out of the question. Among his remaining options, Cornell stood out to him for its prominent place in the history of his favorite discipline.

“This guy Hartmanis defined the time and space complexity classes,” he recalled thinking. “That was important for me.”

Williams was admitted to Cornell with generous financial aid and arrived in the fall of 1997, planning to do whatever it took to become a complexity theorist himself. His single-mindedness stuck out to his fellow students.

“He was just super-duper into complexity theory,” said Scott Aaronson, a computer scientist at the University of Texas, Austin, who overlapped with Williams at Cornell.

But by sophomore year, Williams was struggling to keep up in courses that emphasized mathematical rigor over intuition. After he got a middling grade in a class on the theory of computing, the teacher suggested he consider other careers. But Williams wouldn't give up his dream. He doubled down and enrolled in a graduate theory course, hoping that a stellar grade in the harder class would look impressive on his grad school applications. The professor teaching that graduate course was Hartmanis, by then an elder statesman in the field.

Williams began attending Hartmanis' office hours every week, where he was almost always the only student who showed up. His tenacity paid off: he earned an A in the course, and Hartmanis agreed to advise him on an independent research project the following semester. Their weekly meetings continued throughout Williams' time in college. Hartmanis encouraged him to cultivate an individual approach to complexity research and gently steered him away from dead ends.

“I was deeply influenced by him then,” Williams said. “I guess I still am now.”

“If you get any mathematical result which is the best thing in 50 years, you must be doing something right.”

But despite earning a coveted graduate research fellowship from the National Science Foundation, Williams was rejected by every doctoral program he applied to. On hearing the news, Hartmanis phoned a colleague, then turned around and congratulated Williams on getting accepted into a yearlong master's program at Cornell. A year later Williams again applied to various doctoral programs, and with that extra research experience under his belt, he found success.

Williams continued working in complexity theory in grad school and the years that followed. In 2010, four years after receiving his doctorate, he proved a milestone result—a small step, but the largest in decades, toward solving the most famous question in theoretical computer science, about the nature of hard problems. That result cemented Williams' reputation, and he went on to write dozens of other papers on different topics in complexity theory.

P versus PSPACE wasn't one of them. Williams had been fascinated by the problem since he first encountered it in college. He'd even supplemented his computer science curriculum with courses in logic and philosophy, seeking inspiration from other perspectives on time and space, to no avail.

“It's always been in the back of my mind,” Williams said. “I just couldn't think of anything interesting enough to say about it.”

Last year, he finally found the opportunity he'd been waiting for.

The story of Williams' new result started with progress on a different question about memory in computation: What problems can be solved with extremely limited space? In 2010, the pioneering complexity theorist Stephen Cook and his collaborators invented a task, called the tree evaluation problem, that they proved would be impossible for any algorithm with a space budget below a specific threshold. But there was a loophole. The proof relied on the same commonsense assumption that Paul and his colleagues had made decades earlier: Algorithms can't store new data in space that's already full.

For over a decade, complexity theorists tried to close that loophole. Then, in 2023, Cook's son James and a researcher named Ian Mertz blew it wide open, devising an algorithm that solved the tree evaluation problem using much less space than anyone thought possible. The elder Cook's proof had assumed that bits of data were like pebbles that have to occupy separate places in an algorithm's memory. But it turns out that's not the only way to store data. “We can actually think about these pebbles as things that we can squish a little bit on top of each other,” Beame said.

Cook and Mertz's algorithm roused the curiosity of many researchers, but it wasn't clear that it had any applications beyond the tree evaluation problem. “Nobody saw how central it is to time versus space itself,” Wigderson said.

Ryan Williams was the exception. In spring 2024, a group of students gave a presentation about the Cook and Mertz paper as their final project in a class he was teaching. Their enthusiasm inspired him to take a closer look. As soon as he did, an idea jumped out at him. Cook and Mertz's method, he realized, was really a general-purpose tool for reducing space usage. Why not use it to power a new universal simulation linking time and space—like the one designed by Hopcroft, Paul and Valiant, but better?

That classic result was a way to transform any algorithm with a given time budget into a new algorithm with a slightly smaller space budget. Williams saw that a simulation based on squishy pebbles would make the new algorithm's space usage much smaller—roughly equal to the square root of the original algorithm's time budget. That new space-efficient algorithm would also be much slower, so the simulation was not likely to have practical applications. But from a theoretical point of view, it was nothing short of revolutionary.

For 50 years, researchers had assumed it was impossible to improve Hopcroft, Paul and Valiant's universal simulation. Williams' idea—if it worked—wouldn't just beat their record—it would demolish it.

“I thought about it, and I was like, ‘Well, that just simply can't be true,'” Williams said. He set it aside and didn't come back to it until that fateful day in July, when he tried to find the flaw in the argument and failed. After he realized that there was no flaw, he spent months writing and rewriting the proof to make it as clear as possible.

At the end of February, Williams finally put the finished paper online. Cook and Mertz were as surprised as everyone else. “I had to go take a long walk before doing anything else,” Mertz said.

Valiant got a sneak preview of Williams' improvement on his decades-old result during his morning commute. For years, he's taught at Harvard University, just down the road from Williams' office at MIT. They'd met before, but they didn't know they lived in the same neighborhood until they bumped into each other on the bus on a snowy February day, a few weeks before the result was public. Williams described his proof to the startled Valiant and promised to send along his paper.

“I was very, very impressed,” Valiant said. “If you get any mathematical result which is the best thing in 50 years, you must be doing something right.”

With his new simulation, Williams had proved a positive result about the computational power of space: Algorithms that use relatively little space can solve all problems that require a somewhat larger amount of time. Then, using just a few lines of math, he flipped that around and proved a negative result about the computational power of time: At least a few problems can't be solved unless you use more time than space. That second, narrower result is in line with what researchers expected. The weird part is how Williams got there, by first proving a result that applies to all algorithms, no matter what problems they solve.

“I still have a hard time believing it,” Williams said. “It just seems too good to be true.”

Phrased in qualitative terms, Williams' second result may sound like the long-sought solution to the P versus PSPACE problem. The difference is a matter of scale. P and PSPACE are very broad complexity classes, while Williams' results work at a finer level. He established a quantitative gap between the power of space and the power of time, and to prove that PSPACE is larger than P, researchers will have to make that gap much, much wider.

That's a daunting challenge, akin to prying apart a sidewalk crack with a crowbar until it's as wide as the Grand Canyon. But it might be possible to get there by using a modified version of Williams' simulation procedure that repeats the key step many times, saving a bit of space each time. It's like a way to repeatedly ratchet up the length of your crowbar—make it big enough, and you can pry open anything. That repeated improvement doesn't work with the current version of the algorithm, but researchers don't know whether that's a fundamental limitation.

“It could be an ultimate bottleneck, or it could be a 50-year bottleneck,” Valiant said. “Or it could be something which maybe someone can solve next week.”

If the problem is solved next week, Williams will be kicking himself. Before he wrote the paper, he spent months trying and failing to extend his result. But even if such an extension is not possible, Williams is confident that more space exploration is bound to lead somewhere interesting—perhaps progress on an entirely different problem.

“I can never prove precisely the things that I want to prove,” he said. “But often, the thing I prove is way better than what I wanted.”

On July 2, NASA revealed the existence of 3I/ATLAS, only the third ever interstellar object observed in the universe. These are objects that exist in interstellar space—the areas between stars—and which are not gravitationally bound to any star. The two other interstellar objects discovered to date are the comets 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov.

3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, when its existence was reported by a telescope at Rio Hurtado in Chile, operated by the Asteroid Terrestrial Impact Alert System. Known commonly as ATLAS, this is a NASA-funded system developed and operated by the University of Hawaii to detect asteroids that could potentially hit Earth. It uses four telescopes—two in Hawaii, one in Chile, and one in South Africa—to automatically scan the entire sky several times each night to monitor celestial movements.

An image of 2I/Borisov, the second interstellar object discovered in August 2019. It is thought to be about 975 meters in diameter and moving at 177,000 km/h.

Archived data collected in the preceding weeks by ATLAS' three other telescopes, as well as by the Zwicky Sky Facility at the Palomar Observatory, operated by the California Institute of Technology, confirmed the discovery. Additional observations of 3I/ATLAS were then made by numerous telescopes around the world, gradually revealing more details about it.

Observations of 3I/ATLAS taken by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.

3I/ATLAS is estimated to be, at most, about 20 kilometers in size. It is currently located about 670 million kilometers from the sun and is approaching our star from the direction of Sagittarius at a speed of about 61 km per second. Its speed is expected to increase as it approaches the sun.

When astronomers studied its orbit, they found that 3I/ATLAS was moving too fast to be bound by the sun's gravity and so will head straight through the solar system and into interstellar space, never to be seen again.

Generally, celestial bodies are named after their discoverers, but in the case of 3I/ATLAS, it was named after the ATLAS research team. The “I” stands for “interstellar,” indicating that the object came from outside the solar system; the “3” was added to the name because it is the third interstellar object discovered.

The object was was uncovered because ATLAS initially identified it as something that might be on a possible collision path with Earth, but NASA says there is no risk of the object hitting our planet. Even when 3I/ATLAS is closest to Earth, it will be about 240 million kilometers away.

An animation of 3I/ATLAS observations made on July 2 by astronomers at the Near Earth Object Coordination Center, a division of the Planetary Defence Office of the European Space Agency.

3I/ATLAS will be visible using ground-based telescopes until September. It will then enter the inner orbit of Mars in late October and will be hidden in the sun's shadow when it passes our star at its closest point, making it impossible to observe from Earth. However, it will reappear from the sun's shadow in early December and become visible again.

3I/ATLAS is an active comet, which means that as it gets close to the sun and heats up, the ice in its nucleus could sublimate and form a nebula-like cloud of gas and dust called a coma—otherwise known as a tail.

Because 3I/ATLAS is an object that came from outside the solar system, it may provide valuable data about objects that exist in the further reaches of space. For this reason, astronomers around the world are now paying close attention to it.

Nearly 100,000 car buyers of 2025 model-year autos were asked what they thought of their gleaming new rides. The results are revealing, to say the least. Want to know who was the worst performer? That ignominy goes to Audi, with an embarrassing 269 problems reported per 100 vehicles.

However, one of the most interesting discoveries of the J.D. Power Initial Quality Study (labelled as a “key finding”, no less) concerned not annoyance with the lack of physical buttons, nor, amazingly, intrusive bongs from speed-warning systems, but a marked increase in “cup-holder frustration”.

“While it seemed like manufacturers had cup holders figured out … manufacturers are struggling to keep up with being able to accommodate all the different shapes and sizes [of containers] that are increasingly available,” says the report.

So it seems that despite the auto industry's obsession with software-defined vehicles, many purchasers would forego any number of digital doohickeys, so long as there was enough room in their new cars for multiple Big Gulps. Paying through the nose for a fancy new car stuffed with tech—ADAS, ambient lighting, back-groping seats, dog modes—doesn't stop auto buyers from complaining about insufficiently expandable beverage bays.

For several years, this long-running annual benchmarking report has advised car brands to pay closer attention to the cup-holder kvetching. The cylindrical voids of space—or, in some cars, flip-out trays, door spaces, fancy holsters, or hinged pockets—are still too small, gripe many of those surveyed. Too small for what, though? Most likely gargantuan Stanley cups, giant Yeti Gallon Ramblers and similar such bladder-busters, the spilt contents of which could drench a desert into bloom.

Even though center console real estate in today's cars is at a premium—especially now that ever-bigger touchscreens have become seemingly essential in every self-respecting digital cockpit—America's (and increasingly the Middle East and Australia's) big-drink culture dictates that automakers not scrimp on cup storage.

Twenty years ago, a PricewaterhouseCoopers report suggested that the number of cup holders in a US vehicle was one of the most critical factors in clinching the purchase decision for potential auto buyers. That it remains just as vital today must rankle with auto software engineers, but it doesn't surprise Chris Fischer, Nissan's go-to engineer for cup holders. “That cup holders work well is important to customer satisfaction,” Fischer tells WIRED. “It's a key decider when buying a car.”

Working from Nissan's North American technical center in Farmington Hills, Michigan, Fischer is the company's senior manager of vehicle performance development, and, along with a team of “cabin utility” engineers, he has toiled to improve in-car beverage storage since 2015, when poor cup holder performance adversely impacted Nissan's J.D. Power benchmarking scores.

Cup-holder design matters intensely to many consumers, he says. “If they're mad about a touchpoint every day, it'll sour their desire to want this vehicle again.”

“Touchpoints are critically important,” agrees Dick Powell, cofounder of London-headquartered design and innovation company Seymourpowell. “Great design is fundamentally about making things better, and when you go into a car showroom, the touchpoints are the first interactions you have with the car. How does the [door] handle feel? What's it like opening the door? Where are the cup holders?”

“The assumption [from the car buyer] is that, if the touchpoints are great, the rest of the machine will also be great,” says Powell.

Seymourpowell, founded in 1984, has worked on car interior designs, including cup holders, with several automakers over the years, and Powell confirms to WIRED that auto buyers often base their final purchase decisions on “little things” rather than the specification sheets that auto makers might think customers obsess over. “It's not top speed, power, four-wheel drive capabilities, or any of these things, it's the little touchpoints that really knock you out,” says Powell.

Fischer stresses that Nissan's cabin design team sweat every detail, from seat comfort to storage, ensuring each in-car interaction feels just right. “We start super early in the car's design process when everything is still a sketch,” says Fischer.

Testing—initially virtual—is the best way to maximize compatibility, using cups, cans, travel mugs, tumblers, and vacuum flasks from various sources and in different sizes, ranging from espresso to grande and beyond, even to today's almost bucket-sized containers. “We work hard to fit large Hydro Flask-size bottles in the doors, making sure even the largest bottles fit with ease,” says Fischer.

But how does an espresso cup stay securely grasped in the same holder as a grande? Fischer says this is achieved with spring-loaded plastic tabs that adjust to varying diameters. And mugs fit in what Fischer calls the “dog bone” space, a center console double cup holder now cut with a seemingly superfluous channel that was designed as a slot for mug handles.

Fischer pays keen attention to the monthly info drop from J.D. Power. “We're always looking at data; we're the voice of the customer,” he says. “People love as many cup holders as possible. If space were no issue, we'd add another couple in the center console.”

Hold my beer can, says Subaru. The company's Ascent SUV features a market-leading 19 cup and bottle holders (that's nearly three for every human it can carry)—several of which are cleverly concealed—and, if Facebook love is anything to go by, such liquid storage largesse is what attracts many consumers to this particular model.

America's need for copious, and now voluminous, cup holders went mainstream with the advent of minivans in the mid-1980s. However, the first cup-holder patent was granted to a Texas inventor 30 or so years prior, in 1953. Burnard W. Byford's “automobile seat article holder” design had been filed four years earlier, in 1949. It consisted of a hinged tray that could be folded down from the rear seat of a car, intended for use at rest by passengers rather than the driver.

He surmised in his patent application that those who rode in what he called “pleasure cars” would appreciate a “seat attachment having facilities for conveniently supporting and holding a nursing bottle, bottle containing a soft drink, a glass full of water, a package of cigarettes, and so on.”

“I am aware,” he continued, “that curb-service attendants supply detachable door trays for use at roadside restaurants.” (Indeed, in 1934, he had patented such an external tray.) Undaunted, he predicted, “there is a definite need for a suitable holder such as may be laid or placed upon the seat adjacent to the user.”

The year before Byford filed his patent, Citroën introduced the 2CV, which, despite its diminutive Gallic footprint, had a door pocket designed wide enough to swallow a wine bottle. But, quelle horreur, the “tin snail,” as was the period norm, sported no other specifically designed liquid storage options.

The first cup holders in a mass-market vehicle had to wait until 1984, when rudimentary depressions appeared in Chrysler's Plymouth Voyager. Not grippy from the get-go, these ancestor cup holders were, however, the start on the road to better, deeper designs to come.

Of course, whether shallow or deep, not everyone puts cups in their cup holders. Some fill them instead with coins, phones, keys and other odds and ends; when not spreading stickiness from juice boxes, children often place toys in theirs; Tishoo makes a cylindrical box of tissues entirely designed for cup-holder deployment; and Keep Technologies sells a cup-shaped cellular-connected alarm-and-camera gizmo that supposedly turns a center console cup holder into a sensor-laden “security guard” complete with siren and flashing lights.

Those in their rolling living rooms who use cup holders for their intended design understandably want drinks to be close to hand. However, as the average American spends about 50 minutes commuting by car each day, there's time for drinks to lose or gain heat, automakers started fitting warming and chilling cup holders. Chrysler's 300C sedan came with these as standard in 2011, three years before Tesla got all the kudos for doing the same.

“You'd be amazed how much technology goes into producing today's car seats, center consoles and, yes, even cup holders,” says Paris-based Edouard Da Silva, vice president of the cockpit of the future division at auto interiors maker Forvia, which supplies cabin essentials—from massaging chairs through to heat-controlling cup holders—to many of the world's leading car makers, including the increasingly dominating Chinese brands.

The beverage-holding arms race was won some years ago, say some, by the Euclidean contortions of the slide-out cup holster in the Saab 9-3, but, clever though that was, it didn't solve the spillage problem. Open cups and cans, whose liquids slosh from side to side in moving vehicles, easily shed their contents; hence, the in-car need for plastic lids on takeaway cups and straws on vacuum tumblers.

A no-spill solution was invented 11 years ago by Maksim Ghyvoronsky of Seattle. His Maksimatic cup holder of 2014 featured a self-leveling design that prevented drinks from spilling. His cup holders pivoted freely, keeping liquids level—without caps or lids—even on steep hills, or when braking hard or turning sharp corners. Yet despite the apparent need for such a clever design, Ghyvoronsky failed to raise enough crowdfunding for his product at the time, and 10 years later, he came up short again.

Nor have any automotive cup-holder specialists bought his patent. Not even Matikon of Germany, a leading car interiors manufacturer, which makes for Audi through to Xpeng, but which declined to comment for this article. According to Matikon's website, the company makes cup holders designed around the principles of kinematics, the geometrical study of the motion of physical objects independent of the forces that set them in motion.

Ghyvoronsky's tilting cup holder would have allowed the open carry of liquids in cars—or even on motorbikes, and for which there are a variety of gyroscopic holders on Walmart, Amazon and Temu—but perhaps his design failed because some people still prefer to suck from a teat? Cultural anthropologist and marketing consultant G. Clotaire Rapaille once likened the desire for the hand-to-mouth comfort of capped car drinking to breast-feeding. “What was the key element of safety when you were a child? It was that your mother fed you, and there was warm liquid,” he told The Tipping Point author Malcolm Gladwell in 2004. “That's why cup holders are absolutely crucial for safety. If there is a car that has no cup holder, it is not safe. If I can put my coffee there, if everything is round, if it's soft, and if I'm high [off the ground in my SUV], then I feel safe.”

That's apparent not real safety, says Steven Kyffin, a former dean of design and pro vice-chancellor at Northumbria University in the UK. “Should we really be designing cars to facilitate food and drink while driving?” he asks. Instead, he advises WIRED, “automotive interiors should encourage attentiveness, not multitasking.”

While he frowns on the use of cup holders, he acknowledges their design chops. “Cup holders are part of the domestication of the automobile,” Kyffin says. They transform cars “from tools of transport into comfortable, private zones, which enable seamless changes in context and role.” And those who design cup holders “must factor in not merely the practical ergonomics of driving but also all the physical, emotional, and psychological aspects of such a change in role, particularly reach-and-glance time.”

The design and placement of automotive cup holders could be set to change soon, with auto suppliers such as Forvia and others working on commercializing what were previously concept car cabins. They are banking on the move toward self-driving accelerating the expectation that, in the near future, unencumbered by the need to actually pilot cars we'll need even more places to store cups as drivers become passengers and get time to sit back and enjoy a thoroughly hydrated ride.

For now, however, while we wait for the future of autonomous automotive beverage berths to arrive, Chinese brands (of course) look to be leading the liquid way—Li Auto's L6 Max comes with an 8.8-liter compartment capable of cooling drinks down to a frosty 0°C (32°F), or heating them to 50°C (122°F). Still, at least Lexus has solved the Stanley cup in-car quandary once and for all.

Last year's LG Gram Pro 17 was a classic study in laptop compromise. Incredibly thin and light, it was a veritable marvel of engineering that weighed in at half the heft of a typical 17-inch notebook. On the other hand, it was an unstable performance dud that ran so hot it nearly burnt the hair off my legs.

The compromise scales ultimately tipped against the Gram Pro in 2024, but I'll give credit to LG for staying the course and continuing to iterate on this design, and fixing many of the flaws I remarked on previously.

Summer 2025 sees the arrival of a new, 16-inch version of the LG Gram Pro. The slightly smaller laptop is a bit heavier than the old Pro 17 by a fraction of an ounce (now 2.9 pounds) but is 3 millimeters thinner with a girth of just 15 mm. As the name implies, it has a smaller touchscreen, at 16 inches diagonally instead of 17, featuring a resolution of 2,880 x 1,800 pixels. It no longer has an OLED panel, but it boasts an impressive 144-Hz refresh rate. While heavier than the old LG Gram Pro 17, it's still up to a pound lighter than a typical 16-inch laptop.

The new system is designed as a 2-in-1, with a hinge that allows the LCD to fold flat against the back of the laptop so it can be used as a tablet. An active stylus is included in the box. The stylus can dock magnetically against the right side of the laptop and charge without a cable while it's resting there, too.

Performance is the first place where things have picked up. While the unit I received for review is LG's lowest-end configuration, featuring an Intel Core Ultra 7 255H CPU, 16 GB of RAM, 1 terabyte of storage, and integrated graphics, it ran rings around the older Gram Pro 17 and handily outpaced recent vintage systems from other manufacturers on common tasks.

You wouldn't know it from Intel's arcane naming scheme, but the secret sauce seems to be the new 255H CPU, which has twice as many cores and double the cache of the 256V and 258V CPUs, which dominated the laptop market last year. Benchmark scores were up to 40 percent faster on CPU-focused tasks versus those systems, though most graphics and AI-focused tests were about even with other systems I've recently seen (this is a Copilot+ PC). The 17-inch Gram Pro had discrete graphics powered by Nvidia, so making apples-to-apples comparisons on graphics tests is difficult. In regular use, the system was snappy and responsive, and I rarely found myself waiting for apps to load or for complex tasks to complete.

LG has also figured out the heat situation that marred the 2024 Gram Pro experience so badly. Even under the heaviest loads I could muster, the system stayed wholly workable—slightly warm but never uncomfortable, in large part I presume due to the lack of a discrete GPU in the mix. I rarely got the fan to kick in, and when it did, the output was barely audible—and no match for the Pro's solid speakers.

Port selection is fine, with two USB-C ports that support USB4 (one used for charging), two USB-A ports, and a full-size HDMI jack.

What didn't I love about the device? To keep the laptop thin, LG has shaved keyboard travel down to nothing. That makes touch-typing difficult, as does the heavy shift of the keyboard to the left, done to make room for a very slim (and only moderately usable) numeric keypad. Some keys, including the function keys and, especially, the arrow keys, are so small that it's easy to mistakenly hit the wrong button, even when you're trying to be careful.

The 360-degree hinge could use a bit of tightening. I found its looseness caused the screen to flop and bounce quite a bit when I tapped on it with a fingertip, threatening to cause motion sickness after repeated use.

Battery life is downright poor too. While LG claims “AI-optimized battery efficiency” that can span more than 24 hours, I got just over eight hours on a full-screen YouTube playback test. (Typical battery scores for 16-inch laptops run 12 to 14 hours on this test.) Normally, I run that test at full brightness, but LG seemingly has some buried setting that I was unable to locate, which auto-dims the display periodically. Even this advice, which I found by scouring the web, was unable to disable the feature. The bottom line is that the aforementioned eight-hour battery mark isn't just low, it's probably better than it would normally have been due to the dimming feature being active. To that end, even at its maximum brightness, the Gram Pro's LCD is remarkably short on brightness.

I also encountered some lingering operational bugginess, namely around the laptop's Wi-Fi implementation. The system repeatedly disconnected from Wi-Fi during initial setup and would occasionally drop its connection during regular use, though never as egregiously as I experienced during first-time Windows configuration.

That may sound like a lot of negatives, but aside from the battery issue and the keyboard, the problems are largely manageable. However, at $1,500 for this configuration (it's even pricier from LG!), the Gram Pro 16 is getting up there, and the upgraded version featuring a Core Ultra 9 CPU, 32 GB of RAM, and a 2-TB SSD, is even more difficult to swallow. LG still has a few kinks to work out of the Gram Pro design, but it's covered a lot of ground since 2024—enough to merit a qualified recommendation of this 2025 update.

One Elon Musk business might be making a big investment in another.

According to a Wall Street Journal report that cites investors close to SpaceX, the company has agreed to invest $2 billion in Musk's AI startup xAI. The investment would reportedly be part of the $5 billion equity raise (along with another $5 billion in debt) that Morgan Stanley announced at the end of June.

This would be SpaceX's first investment in xAI, and one of its biggest investments in another company. The WSJ says SpaceX already uses xAI's chatbot Grok to power customer service for its Starlink internet service, with plans for more partnerships. 

Musk has not been shy about using his various companies to support each other, for example merging xAI with X (formerly Twitter) earlier this year.

The British Business Bank, owned by the UK government, is creating a £500 million (around $674 million) economic package to help support diverse and underrepresented fund managers and founders in the country. 

Fifty million pounds will be set aside for female-led venture funds, which means the BBB has now committed at least £100 million (around $135 million) to supporting female-led ventures and the government's Invest in Women Taskforce. Meanwhile, £400 million (around $539 million) will go to backing more diverse fund managers and supporting early-stage companies, as well as helping to boost the talent pipeline to provide those from disadvantaged backgrounds the opportunity to become investors. The package begins deployment in 2026. 

“The initiative announced today aims to reduce the significant gap in venture capital investment for underrepresented founders and investors,” the BBB said in a press release announcing the investment last week. “It will target at least 50% of investment going to female fund managers.” 

It comes as the U.K. continues its push to attract and sustain talent to its venture ecosystem. The press release states that “breaking down barriers to opportunity will help drive growth as part of the government's Plan for Change,” which encompasses various strategies to help drive economic growth in the country. 

For women and people of color, the UK venture landscape can often be as disheartening as it is in the U.S. Around 13% of venture teams in the UK have women at a senior level, while dismal amounts of venture funding goes to minorities (less than 2% for Black founders as of a 2023 report, and 2 pence (around 3 cents) for every £1 ($1.35) invested goes to women.

Presumably this is referring to Rust, which has a borrow checker and slow compile times. The author is, I assume, under the common misconception that these facts are closely related. They're not; I think the borrow checker runs in linear time though I can't find confirmation of this, and in any event profiling reveals that it only accounts for a small fraction of compile times. Rust compile times are slow because the language has a bunch of other non-borrow-checking-related features that trade off compilation speed for other desiderata (monomorphization, LLVM optimization, procedural macros, crates as a translation unit). Also because the rustc codebase is huge and fairly arcane and not that many people understand it well, and while there's a lot of room for improvement in principle it's mostly not low-hanging fruit, requiring major architectural changes, so it'd require a large investment of resources which no one has put up.

reply

Be aware that it is not part of the rust-lang organization, it's a third party.

reply

There are other legitimate criticisms you can raise at the Rust borrow checker such as cognitive load and higher cost of refactoring, but the compilation speed argument is just baseless.

reply

Lexically scoped lifetimes don't address this at all.

reply

What the C3 solution DOES to provide a way to detect at runtime when already freed temporary allocation is used. That's of course not the level of compile time checking that Rust does. But then Rust has a lot more in the language in order to support this.Conversely C3 does have contracts as a language feature, which Rust doesn't have, so C3 is able to do static checking with the contracts to reject contract violations at compile time, which runtime contracts like some Rust creates provides, can't do.

This post is about memory management and doesn't seem to be concerned much about safety in any way. In C3, does anything prevent me from doing this:  fn int* example(int input)
  {
      @pool()
      {
          int* temp_variable = mem::tnew(int);
          *temp_variable = input;
          return temp_variable;
      };
  }

  fn int* example(int input)
  {
      @pool()
      {
          int* temp_variable = mem::tnew(int);
          *temp_variable = input;
          return temp_variable;
      };

The blog claims that @pool ""solves memory lifetimes with scopes"" yet it looks like a classic region/arena allocator that frees everything at the end of a lexical block… a technique that's been around for decades.Where do affine or linear guarantees come in?From the examples I don't see any restrictions on aliasing or on moving data between pools, so how are use‑after‑free bugs prevented once a pointer escapes its region?And the line about having ""solved memory management"" for total functions::: bravo indeed…Could you show a non‑trivial case where @pool eliminates a leak that an ordinary arena allocator wouldn't?Could you show a non‑trivial case, say, a multithreaded game loop where entities span multiple frames, or a high‑throughput server that streams chunked responses, where @pool prevents leaks that a plain arena allocator would not?

Memory arenas/pools have been around for ages, and binding arenas to a lexical scope is also not a new concept. C++ was doing this with RAAI, and you could implement this in Go with defer and in other languages by wrapping the scope with a closure.This post discusses how arenas are implemented in C3 and what they're useful for, but as other people have said this doesn't make sense to compare arenas to reference counting or a borrow checker. Arenas make memory management simpler in many scenarios, and greatly reduce (but don't necessarily eliminate - without other accompanying language features) the chances of a memory leak. But they contribute very little to memory safety and they're not nearly as versatile as a full-fledged borrow checker or reference counting.

It doesn't solve the case when lifetimes are indeterminate. But often they are well know. Consider ""foo(bar())"" where ""bar()"" returns an allocated object that we wish to free after ""foo"" has used it. In something like C it's easy to accidentally leak such a temporary object, and doing it properly means several lines of code, which might be bad if it's intended for an `if` statement or `while`.

reply

But mentioning the borrow checker raises an obvious question that I don't see addressed in this post: what happens if you try to take a reference to an object in the temporary allocator, and use it outside of the temporary allocator's scope? Is that an error? Rust's borrow checker has no runtime behavior, it only exists to create errors in cases like that, so the title invites the question of how your this mechanism handles that case but doesn't answer it.

reply

This is of course not as good as ASAN or a borrow checker, but it interacts very nicely with C.

reply

reply

Now clearly people are misreading the title when it stands on its own as ""borrow checkers suck, C3 has a way of handling memory safety that is much better"". That is very unfortunate, but chance to fix that title already passed.It should also be clear from the rest of the blog post that it doesn't try to make any claims that it's a novel technique (it's something that has been around for a long time). What's novel is that it's well integrated into the stdlib.

@pool appears to be exactly what C++ does automatically when objects fall out of scope.

reply

(This doesn't seem to have anything to do with borrow checking though, which is a memory safety feature not a memory management feature. Rust manages memory with affine types which is a completely separate thing, you could write an entire program without a single reference if you really wanted to)

reply

reply

Rust doesn't even have a good allocator interface yet, so libraries like bumpalo have a parallel implementation of some stdlib types.

reply

reply

Because that is the context. It is the constraint that C3, C, Odin, Zig etc maintains, where RAII is out of the question.

reply

I think the only real grace is you don't have to pass around the allocator.  But then you run into the issue where now anyone allocating needs to know about the lifetimes of the pool of the caller.  If A -> B (pool) -> C and the returned allocation of C ends up in A, now you potentially have a pointer to freed memory.Sending around the explicit allocator would allow C to choose when it should allocate globally and when it should allocate on the pool sent in.

Given a function `foo` that is allocating an object ""o"" and returns it to the upper scope, how would you do ""escape analysis"" to determine it should be freed and HOW it should be freed? What is the mechanism if you do not have RAII, ARC or GC?

reply

reply

This is true for all similar schemes, that they have something for easy for simple-to-track allocations, and then have to fallback on something generic.But even that is usually assuming that the language is somehow having a built-in notion of memory allocation and freeing.

It has very little to do with trying to manage temporary memory lifetimes.

`@pool` flushes the temp allocator and all allocations made by the temp allocator are freed when the pool goes out of scope.There are similarities, but NSAutoreleasePool is for refcounting and an object released by the autoreleasepool might have other objects retaining it, so it's not necessarily freed.

Now we usually cannot do ""bar(foo())"" because it then leaks. We could allocate a buffer on the stack, and then do ""bar(foo(&buffer))"", but this relies on us safely knowing that the buffer does not overflow.If the language has RAII, we can use that to return an object which will release itself after going out of scope e.g. std::unique_ptr, but this relies on said RAII and preferably move semantics.If the context is RAII-less semantics, this is not trivial to solve. Languages that run into this is C3, Zig, C and Odin.With the temp allocator solution, we can write `bar(foo())` if `foo` always allocates a temp variable, or `bar(foo(tmem))` if it takes an allocator.

Artificial intelligence promises a future of unprecedented productivity and wealth, but for Senator Bernie Sanders, the crucial question isn't if the technology will change the world, but who will benefit from that change. As a lifelong champion for workers' rights, Sanders sees the rapid advancement of AI not just as a technological revolution, but as the next major battleground in the fight against corporate greed and inequality.

In a conversation with Gizmodo, the Vermont senator, who revealed he had just spoken with one of the world's leading AI experts, laid out his fears that the technology will be used to suppress wages, break unions, and further enrich the billionaire class. He also shared his concerns about AI's impact on our collective mental health and discussed the “doomsday scenario” that has some top minds in the industry worried that humanity could lose control of its own creation.

The conversation has been edited for clarity and formatted as a Q&A. All quotes are verbatim and unaltered.

Gizmodo: Senator, you've long fought for worker dignity. In an economy increasingly shaped by AI, what do you believe should be the new definition of meaningful work?

Sen. Sanders: Well, that is a very good question, and I don't know that I can give you an intelligent answer to it right now, but this is what I will say. What I think is being lost in the discussion over AI is what we have seen over the last 50 years: a huge increase in worker productivity. Almost all of the benefits of that productivity have gone to the corporations and to the companies that developed that technology. In fact, workers today, in real inflation-accounted-for wages, are earning less, and I fear very much that almost all the new benefits of worker productivity will go to the people on top at the expense of working people. That is something that concerns me very much.

So, the first point to be made: Technology and AI is neither good nor bad. It depends on how it is used, and it depends upon who benefits from it. Unless we change the political dynamics, the benefits are going to accrue to the people on top at the expense of working people. That to me is the most important issue. I want workers to benefit from this new technology, not just the people on top.

Historically, I mean forever—in human existence—people have had to struggle to put food on the table, to farm, to grow food, just to survive. And AI is going to change all that, and we want to make sure that this creates a better, wealthier future for ordinary people, not just the people on top.

Gizmodo: In terms of protection, what protections are needed for American workers to avoid being left behind in this transition?

Sen. Sanders: I think we have got to make it clear in some formulation or another, and some of the unions are beginning to negotiate for this. That if worker productivity, if you, the job you are doing right now becomes more productive with AI, I want the benefits to accrue to you.

What does that mean? It could mean a shorter work week, a 32-hour work week, which is what we're fighting for, with no loss of pay. Again, the main point is workers have got to benefit from increased productivity, not just CEOs. Right now, that is not the case, so that is what we have got to change.

Gizmodo: If a CEO says, “I've automated these tasks and I need fewer workers,” what should the response be?

Sen. Sanders: Exactly. Look, we have got to see that this technology benefits workers rather than just CEOs. So if a company develops AI that allows workers to be more productive, what we would like to see is a shorter work week with no loss in pay.

The other things that I worry about, which goes beyond economics and the potential of massive job loss, are two very important issues: mental health and the well-being of human beings.

Gizmodo: What do you mean by that, Senator?

Sen. Sanders: People interact more every day with artificial intelligence, with robotics. What is the impact on the mental health and the well-being of human beings?

If you spend your entire day interacting with a chatbot rather than talking to friends or family, what happens to you? What kind of problems develop?

We know that in America right now, a lot of young people are having a hard time interacting with other human beings because they spend so much time on the internet. And there are people out there, literally, people in the technology world, who are saying, “Look, if you can't make any friends, if you're very lonely, go to a chatbot and you can develop a friend right there.” I'm not sure that this is good for human beings.

Gizmodo: There's a sense that people are lost, that AI is erasing our identity, our role in society…

Sen. Sanders: Well, do you know the expression, “The operation was a success, unfortunately the patient died”?

In this context, the system is working well. We're developing all kinds of technology: you're going to be able to do this, you're going to be able to do that. Unfortunately, human beings are going to get lost in that development. And they will become more and more unhappy, more and more mentally unstable, more and more lonely.

So, we want to make sure the technology benefits human beings, economically as well as emotionally. That has got to be the driving force.

Gizmodo: Have you spoken to tech CEOs or experts about this?

Sen. Sanders: I have talked to CEOs. Funny that you mention it. I won't mention his name, but I've just gotten off the phone with one of the leading experts in the world on artificial intelligence, two hours ago.

Gizmodo: Did they share your concern? Did they offer any solutions?

Sen. Sanders: They're all different. He did. Somebody I talked to yesterday, not so much.

There are differences of opinion. On several major issues. Number one: What impact will AI have on the economy? Some people say there will be massive job losses. I tend to agree with them.

Other people say not so much, new jobs will be created. It will be like every other technological revolution. Jobs lost, jobs created, not such a big deal. So people disagree. I happen to believe this is not like the Industrial Revolution. I think this could be a lot more severe.

Second point: This is not science fiction. There are very, very knowledgeable people—and I just talked to one today—who worry very much that human beings will not be able to control the technology, and that artificial intelligence will in fact dominate our society. We will not be able to control it. It may be able to control us. That's kind of the doomsday scenario—and there is some concern about that among very knowledgeable people in the industry.

Gizmodo: Are you personally optimistic or pessimistic about AI, for workers, for society?

Sen. Sanders: That's a broader question. We have the worst president in the history of the United States in office right now.

We're seeing, all over the world, democracy itself being threatened. We see a terrible war in Ukraine, a terrible war in Gaza. So I think this is not a great moment for humanity.

I would hope, however—there are ups and downs—that we can turn this around. And among many other things, use the benefits of artificial intelligence and robotics to improve human life. To make sure we can wipe out poverty. That all of our people can have a decent standard of living. This is doable.

The greed of billionaires controls the process. But ordinary people must control the future.

Gizmodo: One final question: Do you believe AI could in any fashion be used to strengthen unions and worker rights, or is it inherently a threat to organized labor?

Sen. Sanders: I think at this moment it is more of a threat. And I think in some ways it is being used the way bad trade policies in the United States were used in the 70s.

In other words, what employers will say is: “Look, I want you to take a cut in pay. Or I want you to pay more for healthcare. And if you don't do that, by the way, we've got machines. We've got robots that can replace you. We've got artificial intelligence that can replace you. It's your choice. Take a cut or we replace you as human workers.

So I think we've got to mobilize the trade union movement to be militant in standing up against the dangers of AI to workers' rights.

Humans might not know of any intelligent beings beyond Earth, but if they exist, they might already know about us. New research shows that radar systems at commercial and military airports are inadvertently announcing our presence to any aliens with the ability to listen.

Preliminary results from a study led by Ramiro Caisse Saide, an astrophysics PhD candidate at the University of Manchester, suggest extraterrestrials up to 200 light-years away could theoretically detect electromagnetic signals leaking from global airline hubs such as John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and Heathrow Airport in London. Military radar systems are also detectable, and thanks to their unique pattern, these signals would look “clearly artificial to anyone watching from interstellar distances with powerful radio telescopes,” Caisse Saide said in a statement.

“In fact, these military signals can appear up to a hundred times stronger from certain points in space, depending on where an observer is located,” he added. “Our findings suggest that radar signals—produced unintentionally by any planet with advanced technology and complex aviation system—could act as a universal sign of intelligent life.” It's important to note, however, that it will take many more years for signals to reach any extraterrestrial civilizations located 200 light-years away from Earth. Airports and military operations have only been emitting signals of this strength since the 1950s, and therefore, the maximum distance at which aliens could currently detect them is about 75 light-years in all directions.

Seeing as we live in an unfathomably vast, ancient universe with billions of trillions of planets and moons, it stands to reason that we aren't the only intelligent lifeforms in it. Humanity's desire to contact extraterrestrials dates back more than 150 years. The first real communication attempt took place in 1974, when astronomers beamed a radio signal from a powerful transmitter at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico into space. This signal, known as the Arecibo message, consisted of binary code that conveyed information about the basic chemicals of life, the structure of DNA, Earth's place in the solar system, and even a stick figure of a human. If any aliens received it, they haven't responded.

That hasn't discouraged scientists from trying to find them. Those working on the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) do this passively, scanning space for electromagnetic signals that can't be explained by natural phenomena. Others have taken a more active approach by intentionally transmitting signals or messages to space, like the Arecibo message. These efforts are called METI (Messaging to Extraterrestrial Intelligence) or CETI (Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence). Not everyone believes this is a good idea. Detractors point out that telling aliens where we are could have disastrous consequences if these beings are capable of harming us or our planet.

That's a scary thought. Perhaps even more frightening is the fact that Earth is unwittingly shouting out our existence and location to any radar-detecting extraterrestrial civilizations within earshot. To get an idea of just how noisy our planet is, Caisse Saide and his colleagues simulated how radar signals from airports proliferate across time and space, then analyzed how detectable they would be from stars such as Barnard's Star and AU Microscopii. These stars are located roughly 6 and 32 light-years away from the Sun, respectively.

They found that airport radar systems, which sweep the skies for airplanes to inform air traffic control, send out a combined radio signal strong enough for aliens to detect it from up to 200 light-years away using telescopes similar to the Green Bank radio telescope in West Virginia. That's a vast distance. The nearest potentially habitable planet outside our solar system—Proxima Centauri b—is just over 4 light-years away, and it would still take humanity's most advanced spacecraft tens of thousands of years to get there. Signals from Earth's military radar systems are weaker, but more focused and directional, creating an obviously artificial pattern similar to a lighthouse beam sweeping the sky.

It's important to note, however, that it will take many more years for signals to reach any extraterrestrial civilizations located 200 light-years away from Earth. Airports and military operations have only been emitting signals of this strength since the 1950s, and therefore, the maximum distance at which aliens could currently detect them is about 75 light-years in all directions. But the point of the study stands; aliens located on a planet 200 light-years away should be able to detect airport signals—but not for another 125 years.

Understanding how intelligent extraterrestrials might become aware of our existence can also help guide our search for them, according to Caisse Saide. Identifying and characterizing our own planet's technosignatures, or detectable signs of technology, can tell astronomers what to look for from other planets, he said. At the same time, “we gain valuable insights into how to protect the radio spectrum for communications and design future radar systems,” said co-researcher Michael Garrett, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Manchester, in the statement. “The methods developed for modeling and detecting these weak signals can also be used in astronomy, planetary defense, and even in monitoring the impact of human technology on our space environment.”

“In this way, our work supports both the scientific quest to answer the question ‘Are we alone?' and practical efforts to manage the influence of technology on our world and beyond,” Caisse Saide said.

July 13th marks the end of this year's Wimbledon. Are you excited to watch Sinner vs. Alcaraz for free online? It's one of the top duels this year. Alcaraz defeated Fritz, while Sinner convincingly eliminated Djokovic in the semi-finals.

Sinner and Alcaraz, two of the world's top players, are meeting once again to gauge their strengths. If you don't want to miss this heart-pounding clash, here's how to stream the 2025 Wimbledon men's final on a free channel.

Let's explain where to find it.

While many paid channels broadcast Wimbledon, most people opt for free channels. BBC iPlayer, the BBC's video-on-demand service, allows you to watch Sinner vs Alcaraz online for free.

How to do it?

You go to BBC iPlayer (link: https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer), sign up (it's 100% free) or sign in, and enjoy the match when it starts. BBC iPlayer doesn't require a paid subscription. Moreover, it's in English and offers Full HD coverage of all Wimbledon matches.

Watch Sinner vs Alcaraz With NordVPN

Some people also use 9Now (link: https://www.9now.com.au/live/), an Australian platform.

9Now works identically. It requires an account, which costs nothing to make. This account lets you stream Sinner vs Alcaraz live for free.

The problem with both is their availability. As you can likely assume, BBC iPlayer and 9Now work only in the UK and Australia, respectively. If you're abroad, there's a reliable solution to unblock them and watch the match.

Many internet users believe VPNs are ideal options for unblocking BBC iPlayer and 9Now abroad. They often mention NordVPN, which is like Apple in the VPN world—the most popular and beloved option.

NordVPN offers 440+ servers in the UK and 190+ servers in Australia.

It also has unlimited bandwidth and some of the best streaming speeds. However, its primary purpose is to change the user's online location. Geo-restricted channels detect the user's IP and block or permit their access.

A user abroad can connect to NordVPN's UK server and obtain a British IP address for BBC iPlayer. Similarly, they can use an Australian VPN server to get an Australian IP address for 9Now. NordVPN effortlessly unblocks both channels.

Many would argue that NordVPN is a paid service, and they'd be right.

However, people often use its 30-day money-back guarantee to get a refund. This means they can watch Sinner vs Alcaraz on a free channel of their choice, and when the match ends, get a full refund the same day. Don't hesitate to check our article on how to get a NordVPN free trial for more details.

This renders the solution free. However, some people stick with the VPN and use it for cheaper online sports streams. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide.

Our trick works regardless of your location.

This means you can be in Asia or Africa and still use a VPN to watch Sinner vs Alcaraz on a free channel. Many other channels and platforms broadcast this match if you don't want to bother with a VPN.

In the USA, you have:

These three are exclusive to the USA, with hefty price tags and no refund policies. People abroad can use a VPN to watch Hulu, Sling TV, or fuboTV, albeit not sign up, as all three require US-based credit cards.

Canadians can't watch Sinner vs Alcaraz live for free, but they can use TSN Plus if they don't mind subscribing. TSN Plus costs a whopping CAD $80 + tax annually or CAD $8 + tax monthly, and there is no refund policy.

More importantly, TSN Plus is Canada-exclusive, so users abroad are unwelcome, unless they use a VPN. Many channels worldwide stream the match, but the only free, English options are BBC iPlayer and 9Now.

Try NordVPN Risk-Free

According to the H2H results, Carlos Alcaraz is a favorite.

So far, the two best players clashed twelve times; Janik Sinner took four, while Carlos Alcaraz took eight matches. Interestingly, Alcaraz has beaten Sinner five times in a row, from 2024 to 2025. Sinner's last victory was in 2023.

As you know, H2H statistics rarely give us the whole picture. We're discussing two magnificent, young talents likely at their apex. Regardless of your favorite, we know this Wimbledon final will be worth watching.

Prepare for trouble, and make it double!

Nvidia announced Smooth Motion back in January, as part of its initial RTX 50-series launch. Now the feature seems to have begun to trickle down to RTX 40-series graphics card owners, via a little Nvidia Profile Inspector tweak discovered by Macer, over at the Guru3D forums.

Much like AMD's Fluid Motion Frames, Nvidia's Smooth Motion claims to double your frame rate by putting one AI-generated frame in between two real ones. This is a driver-level solution so it works in any game, regardless of it being supported or not in any particular software. Upscaling technologies like DLSS or FSR can only shine when they're implemented in the graphics pipeline of the game by the developers, but no such effort is required here.

That's why this is such a prominent feature that can help players get more out of their games. However, Smooth Motion was limited to 50-series cards, a space where it's likely not needed as much. Thankfully, a new driver update has just revealed that it is making its way down to the RTX 40 GPUs, at last.



The GeForce 590.26 Preview Driver finally allows users to enable Smooth Motion on their RTX 40-series GPU. As the name suggests, this ""preview"" is not a stable, public release, but rather a sort of beta intended for developers or enthusiasts to test out the upcoming driver ahead of time. As such, Macer installed it on their computer running an RTX 4090, and through Nvidia Profile Inspector, were able to toggle Smooth Motion. Please note that it didn't appear in the Nvidia app UI directly.

Immediately, the user was able to double their frames in World of Warcraft from 82 to 164 FPS—all without incurring any additional latency—as noted in the performance overlay in the top corner. WoW doesn't natively support DLSS, so this was a long-overdue update, and others have reported similar gains across a multitude of different games as well.



You can also download the preview driver from Nvidia's developer page, but you need a developer account. Once installed, you'll need Nvidia Profile Inspector from GitHub which is fairly easy to install and use as well. We didn't get a chance to try it out on our systems, but it's safe to assume that this solution won't be as good as native DLSS. Expect a bit more artifacting and fluctuations in performance, at least until Nvidia polishes the feature for a public release, soon. It also won't actually upscale the game's resolution (from a lower internal one).

That being said, it's still a heck of a lot better than not having access to the feature. Now, your old games where upscaling tech was never realistically going to reach, can finally enjoy increased frame rates, sometimes with barely any noticeable dip in quality, and without investing in third-party software, such as Lossless Scaling, since your GPU now possesses driver-level chops to achieve the same goal.

Humans better remain creative.

There is a wide belief that artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to greatly increase productivity, which may also lead to widespread job displacement. This could happen sooner rather than later, if humanity loses its ability to innovate, indicated Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, in an interview with CNN.

""If the world runs out of ideas, then productivity gains translates to job loss,"" said Jensen Huang in an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria. Huang had been asked about comments made by Dario Amodei, who suggested AI would cause mass employment disruptions.

The Nvidia CEO's comments were in response to recent warnings from Dario Amodei, the head of AI firm Anthropic. Last month, Amodei told Axios that the rise of artificial intelligence might wipe out half of all entry-level office positions and push national unemployment as high as 20% within five years. Huang did not dispute the possibility, but said the outcome depends heavily on society's creative drive.

Indeed, he might be right. A century ago, there were complaints about cars based on the internal combustion engine (ICE) leaving those involved in servicing horses unemployed. Years later, the horse guys were servicing ICE cars and earning much more. While we are speculating, the same could happen here.

Industry surveys reflect these employment concerns. A 2024 study from Adecco Group found that 41% of corporate leaders expect AI to reduce staffing at thousands of firms over the next half-decade. Separately, a report released in January by the World Economic Forum (WEF) indicated that 41% of employers plan to shrink their teams by 2030 due to automation driven by AI.

Surveys also show a shift in how work is performed. A 2024 joint survey by Duke University and Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta and Richmond found that over half of large American firms intend to use AI to take over routine tasks like invoice processing and supplier payments.

Huang said all occupations will feel the effects of AI in some form. While certain roles will disappear, he expects many others to be introduced, so the fears about dramatically high unemployment rates are unsubstantiated for now. The head of Nvidia noted that even his own role has evolved due to AI, though he remains active in it. He called AI the most accessible technology advancement yet, capable of helping even those with limited technical skills.

Looking to the past, Huang pointed out that technological breakthroughs over the last several centuries — including the computing era — have historically resulted in both job creation and improved productivity. He argued that with the right ideas, technology can unlock entirely new areas of growth and benefit society as a whole.

The CEO of Nvidia expressed hope that increased efficiency across industries will ultimately improve living standards, but he cautioned that this outcome is not guaranteed unless innovation continues.

Nvidia, which briefly reached a $4 trillion market capitalization earlier this month, plays a central role in the ongoing AI boom as its data center GPUs are used for both AI training and inference by companies like Amazon Web Services, Google, and Microsoft.

Despite claims that layoffs target mostly mid-level managers.

Intel this month officially began to cut down its workforce in the U.S. and other countries, thus revealing actual numbers of positions to be cut. The Oregonian reports that the company will cut as many as 2,392 positions in Oregon and around 4,000 positions across its American operations, including Arizona, California, and Texas.

To put the 2,392 number into context, Intel is the largest employer in Oregon with around 20,000 of workers there. 2,392 is around 12% of the workforce, which is a lower end of layoff expectations, yet 2,400 is still a lot of people. The Oregon reduction rose sharply from an initial count of around 500 to a revised figure of 2,392, making it one of the largest layoffs in the state's history. Intel began reducing staff earlier in the week but confirmed the larger number by Friday evening through a filing with Oregon state authorities.

Intel's Oregon operations have already seen 3,000 jobs lost over the past year through earlier buyouts and dismissals. This time around, Intel does not offer voluntarily retirement or buyouts, it indeed lays off personnel in Aloha (192) and Hillsboro (2,200).

Although Intel officially says that it is trying to get rid of mid-level managers to flatten the organization and focus on engineers, the list of positions that Intel is cutting is led by module equipment technicians (325), module development engineers (302), module engineers (126), and process integration development engineers (88). In fact, based on the Oregon WARN filing, a total of 190 employees with 'Manager' in their job titles (8% of personnel being laid off) were included among those laid off by Intel. These comprised various software, hardware, and operational management roles across the affected sites.

Earlier this month, it was reported that Intel began to cut-down its workforce in Israel. Those affected included mid-level managers (e.g., team leaders), first-line supervisors, and technicians from the Remote Operations Center (ROC). According to a media report, the supervisors oversee shift operations and sit one or two tiers above production workers, so their roles are phased out as part of the company's intention to flatten the organization. Intel is also laying off ROC technicians, who remotely monitor and control fab tools, manage workflows, and detect issues. Their roles are being automated as part of a global move to cut manual oversight in chip production. It is reasonable to assume that something similar is happening in the U.S.

Interestingly, Intel is implementing a new approach to workforce reductions, allowing individual departments to decide how to meet financial goals rather than announcing large, centralized cuts. This decentralized process has led to ongoing job losses across the company, with marketing functions being outsourced to Accenture and the automotive division completely shut down.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J (AP) — President Donald Trump on Sunday will attend the FIFA Club World Cup final, a match that will offer Trump a preview of the globe's premier soccer tournament that North America will host next year.

Trump and first lady Melania Trump will travel from their golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, to East Rutherford 40 miles (64 kilometers) away to watch the final match of the U.S.-hosted tournament between Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea at MetLife Stadium.

MetLife in a little over a year will host the 2026 World Cup final. 

The Trumps will be looking on as PSG attempts to win its fourth major title of the season, exactly 100 days after it clinched Ligue 1 on April 5. The team added the Coupe de France by beating Reims 3-0 on May 24, then romped over Inter Milan seven days later in the Champions League Final.

Trump's trip Sunday falls on the first anniversary of the assassination attempt he survived in Butler, Pennsylvania, while campaigning for president.

The president did not have any public plans to mark the date beyond participating in a taped Fox News Channel interview with his daughter-in-law Lara Trump that aired Saturday night.

Sporting events have made up the bulk of Trump's trips in the U.S. since taking office this year. In addition to his visit this weekend to the soccer tournament, he's attended the Super Bowl in New Orleans, the Daytona 500 in Florida, UFC fights in Miami and Newark, New Jersey, and the NCAA wrestling championships in Philadelphia.

The president, who has a warm relationship with FIFA President Gianni Infantino, has said he plans to attend multiple matches of the World Cup tournament next year.

One of the most divisive football competitions created comes to an end on Sunday with the Club World Cup final between Paris St-Germain and Chelsea.

Fifa president Gianni Infantino said on the eve of the final ""we can say definitely that this Fifa Club World Cup has been a huge, huge, huge success"". 

Previously an annual winter tournament for the six continental champions plus one host club, it now takes the format of the World Cup, although that too is being expanded from 2026 onwards.

Thirty-two teams - some from every continent - will have played 63 games, including the final, in the US over a month.

Critics have called it an Infantino vanity project and former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp referred to it as the ""worst idea ever implemented in football"".

Issues have included sparse crowds for some group games, extreme weather and player fatigue - and what the knock-on effects could be.

""It's been a big success. I've been everywhere and it's been a brilliant tournament to work on and to watch here,"" Michael Brown, who has been covering the games for broadcasters Dazn, told BBC Sport.

BBC Sport looks at what the interest levels have been like and whether the tournament in this format can be considered a success or not.

You can have your say throughout.

Has run to Club World Cup final been worth it for Chelsea?

Club World Cup 'world's most successful club competition'

Much has been made of some of the low attendances.

Four matches failed to get 10,000 fans, with the lowest the 3,412 who watched Mamelodi Sundowns beat Ulsan HD 1-0.

But there have been 15 crowds of 60,000 or more, with the highest the 80,619 who saw PSG beat Atletico Madrid 4-0 in Pasadena.

Most of the highest attendances were at games involving PSG or Real Madrid, and the majority of knockout games have been well attended.

The average attendance of 38,369 is below that of any World Cup since Chile 1962.

Reasons given for some low attendances were the kick-off times (many were in the middle of a weekday), ticket prices, weather and concerns about Immigration and Customs Enforcement raiding games.

""The decisive question is 'do the fans like it or not'?"" said former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, Fifa's chief of global football development.

""We believe the attendances were projected as low and in reality were much higher. The answer is there.""

A dynamic pricing structure, which is common in US sports, is being used, where the cost of tickets can change regularly.

Ticket prices for Chelsea's semi-final against Fluminense reportedly dropped from almost £350 to less than £10 in the week before the game.

Tickets for the Blues' quarter-final against Palmeiras ended up at £8, with fans talking about having paid more than £250 when they first went on sale.

""From the fans point of view, it's been positive,"" said ex-Premier League midfielder Brown, who has worked on 10 games involving 12 clubs.

""Everyone I've spoken to thinks it has been an incredible tournament and they have had a wonderful time.

""It feels like it's raised the awareness of football in so many countries. The other countries have absolutely loved it and really got behind their clubs.""

The answer to this question is yes - helped to a large extent by the huge prize fund available.

Teams could win up to £91m for winning the tournament, with Manchester City pocketing £38m despite going out in the last 16.

Chelsea have probably earned about £80m for reaching the final, with Joao Pedro repaying over a third of his transfer fee with two semi-final goals against Fluminense.

The winners will be allowed to wear a badge on their kit saying they are world champions until the summer of 2029, when the next tournament is played.

Players of Brazilian clubs celebrated wins and broke down with defeats every bit as much as any major cup.

As the tournament went on, European teams were determined to win it too.

""We had a lot of ambition for this Club World Cup and we wanted to win it,"" said City captain Bernardo Silva after losing to Al-Hilal.

Asked if it hurt as much as Champions League elimination, he said: ""Yes, a little bit.""

Wenger said: ""If you make enquiries to all the clubs who were here, then 100% of answers would be that they would want to do it again.

""That's the best answer of what the clubs think of a Club World Cup.""

Purely in football terms, the tournament could be considered a success.

The group stages were a slow burner, with mismatched games like Bayern Munich 10-0 Auckland City.

There have been plenty of dramatic games and surprising scorelines - and an average of more than three goals per game.

Manchester City were knocked out 4-3 in extra time by Al-Hilal. Benfica took Chelsea to extra time thanks to a 95th-minute penalty - after a two-hour weather delay - before the Blues won 4-1.

Chelsea scored a late winner in the quarter-final against Palmeiras, with Estevao Willian, who joins them after the competition, netting against his soon-to-be team-mates.

Lionel Messi scored a free-kick, amateur side Auckland City picked up a point against Boca Juniors, having lost their first two games by a total of 16-0, and there have been games with scorelines of 4-4, 4-3, 4-2 and 5-2.

PSG, who have been sensational at times, beat Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid and Inter Miami 4-0.

PSG beat Bayern 2-0 despite having nine men - and there were three stoppage-time goals and a red card as Real beat Borussia Dortmund 3-2.

""We saw a few games at the start of the tournament which were a bit of a mismatch, but after that all the games have been competitive,"" said Brown.

""The mixture of cultures has been amazing. We've seen some different styles of play but a lot of quality everywhere.

""The Brazilian teams in particular contributed to that in a massive way. They set the standard in matches, put pressure on European teams and made them respond.

""What we do have to understand is that the European teams had not hit their stride when the tournament started because they'd had a bit of a rest first [after the end of their domestic seasons].""

The tournament - inevitably considering the lack of history or prestige - has not grabbed the attention of all football fans.

For example, the BBC Sport live pages and reports for the knockout rounds have had between 40% and 50% of the audience they would normally get for the Champions League equivalent.

But those are still big figures compared to many lesser followed competitions and sports.

Every match has been available to watch for free in the UK, with all 63 games on the Dazn app and Channel 5 showing 23.

Dazn has not replied to requests for the viewing figures, but Channel 5 said it was happy with how many people have watched the games it broadcast.

Chelsea v Los Angeles FC was watched by a peak of 1.6 million people in the UK. Real's game against Al-Hilal was seen by a peak of 1.1 million.

In Saudi Arabia more than 1.5 million people watched their win over Manchester City in the last 16 despite kicking off at 4am local time.

""There was not a single place that didn't have the Al-Hilal game on, and everyone was off the streets and watching it,"" content creator Fayad told BBC Sport, speaking about the quarter-final loss to Fluminense.

""The freeway was so empty. On a Friday night that never happens, not even during Ramadan.""

Brazilians have arguably bought into the Club World Cup more than fans from any other nation. All four of their teams reached the knockout stages.

The Copacabana fan-fest hosted about 100,000 fans across the tournament.

How have global football fans embraced Club World Cup?

We will not know for several months yet how much of an impact this could have.

Many players involved have not had any break yet, with last season leading straight into international fixtures, which led straight into the Club World Cup.

Most teams start their 2025-26 campaign about a month after the Club World Cup ends, with the need to have a break and fit their pre-season into those four weeks.

""I try not to think about it, otherwise I will be so anxious,"" Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said, external recently.

""Maybe in November, December, January, ask me. I may say 'So listen, we are a disaster. We are exhausted. The World Cup destroyed us.' 

Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Maheta Molango told BBC Sport: ""It's this feeling of accumulation of competitions that just do not talk to each other and create a calendar that is just nonsensical.

""Let's see what happens in October, November - that's when you're going to start seeing because you pay the price. This Club World Cup gives us a chance to start looking at the bigger picture.""

For Bayern, the competition posed a more immediate problem.

Midfielder Jamal Musiala faces a long time out after suffering a broken leg and dislocated ankle after being caught by Gianluigi Donnarumma during the defeat by PSG.

The tournament had a few quirks that might be alien to traditional football fans.

The man of the match was instead called the superior player of the match.

The 22 starting players were called out one by one on the loudspeaker, instead of all running out together.

American sports announcer Michael Buffer called the players out for the semi-finals.

There were loud countdowns to kick-off and music played during cooling breaks.

Video assistant referee (VAR) decisions have been shown in the stadium and a 'ref cam' has shown footage from referees' bodycams during the game.

The final will have a Super Bowl-style half-time show with acts selected by Coldplay singer Chris Martin, although there was a Linkin Park concert before this year's Champions League final.

Chelsea needs Enzo Fernández and Caicedo to cook in the midfield – and João Pedro to find a way to score – if they're to upset Paris Saint-Germain in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup Final.

This special 2025 FIFA Club World Cup edition of Oppo Research features two posts, one that profiles Chelsea FC and one that profiles Paris Saint-Germain. Read one, then the other: Here is your 2025 FIFA Club World Cup Final preview.

João Pedro began his professional career at Fluminense FC before moving to Watford FC, where he scored 24 goals in 109 appearances. He then signed for Brighton & Hove Albion FC in 2023, scoring 30 goals in 70 games across two seasons. 

Chelsea signed the 23-year-old striker for $82 million this summer, and he joined the squad on July 2, after the FIFA Club World Cup was well underway. For reasons that escape many, this was perfectly within the rules. 

João Pedro made his Chelsea debut in the quarterfinal win over Palmeiras, coming on in the 54th minute, and looked dangerous. But he would prove his value in his first-ever Chelsea start, when he filled in for the suspended Liam Delap against Fluminense.

João Pedro scored two outstanding goals against his boyhood club, leading Chelsea to its second-ever Club World Cup final. Chelsea were awarded about $30 million after advancing to today's game, which offsets a good chunk of the transfer fee paid to Brighton. 

When this tournament started, João Pedro was on holiday in Brazil and still a Brighton player. Now, he's the reason Chelsea is in the final, and could provide the team with their best chance to stage an upset win over PSG that most pundits pick to lift the trophy later today.

Chelsea played six matches at this summer's competition, winning five and losing just once, a 3-1 defeat against Brazilian side CR Flamengo in the Group Stage. None of those six matches saw the same Starting XI put forth by Chelsea boss Enzo Mareca, with the Italian making at least two changes to his starting lineup in every match. 

Strikers Liam Delap, Nicolas Jackson, and the newly acquired João Pedro all started at least once during this competition. The same can be said for members of Chelsea's stacked midfield, with Cole Palmer, Christopher Nkunku, Enzo Fernandez, Pedro Neto, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, and recently departed Noni Madeuke (who is now back in England ahead of a $70 million transfer to Arsenal FC according to Fabrizio Romano) all securing starts as No 10s or out wide.

Maresca was asked all season long about the ever-growing size of his First Team squad, and the acquisition mode under American ownership led by the controversial  Todd Boehly, which seems to consist of adding more players than is reasonable or possibly legal. The doubts carried over into the summer as Chelsea remain active in the transfer market, but the FIFA Club World Cup has served as a perfect testing ground for answering those questions within the squad.

Chelsea typically lines up in a 4-2-3-1, with two midfielders — Enzo Fernández and Moisés Caicedo — playing above the back four. The duo complement each other perfectly: Enzo gets forward and creates chances, while Caicedo stays home and helps win the ball back. 

Enzo has a tournament-leading three assists, created three big chances, and created 10 overall chances. As for Caicedo, he averages 2.1 successful tackles per 90 minutes, which translates to a tackle success rate of 56.3%. He's a key reason why Chelsea has recorded three clean sheets and allowed just four goals in five Club World Cup games.

Caicedo will try to prevent PSG from thriving from its quick build-up plays, while Enzo must create chances and help break down a PSG side that has only conceded one goal all tournament. If Chelsea is to have a chance at winning this game, both players will need to cook.

Chelsea can make history by becoming just the fifth team to ever win a second FIFA Club World Cup title, while also becoming the first English team to accomplish that feat. 

But a 2025 win would mean more than just that.

Take your mind back to 2020, when  the world was wrapped in turmoil because of COVID. The expanded FIFA Club World Cup was scheduled to begin in China in 2021, but the pandemic postponed the new-look event for what turned out to be five years. In the meantime, fans saw three FIFA Club World Cup tournaments played under the old single-elimination format. Chelsea was triumphant in one of those, winning the 2021 FIFA Club World Cup in February 2022.

Only one player from the matchday squad that faced Palmeiras for the title remains at the club, center-back Trevoh Chalobah. He is also the last player remaining at Chelsea from the UEFA Champions League-winning squad four years ago (he was rostered but on loan to FC Lorient in France at the time), which just happens to be the game that secured the team's place in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.

All this to say, Chelsea is a team looking for boosts. The four-year stretch since 2021 has seen the team fall in the league table, finish runner-up in domestic competitions, and get knocked out of Champions League competitions early. May's win over Real Betis to secure the 2024/25 UEFA Conference League could be seen as cathartic – silverware is silverware, after all – or as slumming it: What is a club that by many estimates spent more than $1 billion in transfer fees doing in Europe's third-tier tournament? 

Winning a legit world championship would be so monumental that nobody will remember that they qualified for the tournament only thanks to a pandemic-era title.

In a case of ""who the hell are you talking about?"" there is one familiar face on Chelsea's roster that Major League Soccer fans might recognize, and who could be one win away from a world championship.

Backup goalkeeper Gabriel Slonina did not seem like he was going to be on the roster for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, after being loaned out by the club every year since he joined in 2022 from Chicago Fire FC. But the Addison, Illinois native was called in after Djordje Petrović (another MLS alum)asked to be left out of Chelsea's FIFA Club World Cup squad. Slonina has been on the bench every game in the knockout rounds.

Slonina came up through Chicago's youth academy, then he went on to play 43 games for the first team between 2021 and 2022. A Homegrown, he made history in his MLS debut on Wednesday, August 4, 2021, by becoming the youngest goalkeeper to ever start an MLS match when he earned a clean sheet in a 0-0 draw against New York City FC at Soldier Field.

As Christian Smith wrote in these pages at the halftime break in that game, “The Fire are currently using a goalkeeper that has never played before and is the youngest keeper to ever play an MLS game. If City are to come away with a win, they need to start challenging him with shots.”

NYCFC didn't, and now Slonina is 90 minutes away from standing on the podium at MetLife Stadium. 

Paris Saint-Germain are favorites to roll over Chelsea FC and win the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup title — and lift their fifth trophy of the year.

Paris Saint Germain rolled to its third shutout win in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup knockout rounds, outscoring opponents by a combined 10-0. 

Paris Saint-Germain score early and often against Real Madrid in the FIFA 2025 Club World Cup, humiliating the 15-time winners of the UEFA Champions League.

It's a glitzy semifinal between two of the biggest club teams on the planet, but which team is best set up to prevail and play Chelsea in the final? Five things to know ahead of PSG vs Real Madrid.

                One man who already knows what it takes to become a world champion is Enzo Fernandez and our midfielder has outlined what he feels could make the decisive difference in the FIFA Club World Cup final.
            

Fernandez was a key part of the Argentina team which triumphed at the 2022 FIFA World Cup. He featured in every minute of a gruelling final against France which ended in victory for the South Americans in a penalty shootout, after a 3-3 draw across 120 minutes of football.

He now has the chance to become a double world champion simultaneously, having helped Chelsea reach today's final of the Club World Cup in the USA, where we will also face French opposition in the form of Paris Saint-Germain.

That gives the midfielder rare experience of what it takes to succeed in a global final, which he shared ahead of today's 3pm kick-off local time (8pm UK time) at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium.

'The key, I think, is that in finals you play very focused,' explained the 24-year-old, who also tasted victory in a final with the Blues in May's UEFA Conference League triumph.





‘We know that we can't give them space and we know that we can't give them chances, because they have very good players.

‘Winning this Club World Cup would be very important for the club. Obviously, Chelsea have won it in the past, but a second wouldn't be a bad thing!

‘So we've been preparing for the match in the best possible way. We know we are facing a great team, but we are confident in ourselves and are also a great team.

‘So we have prepared well and now we will go out onto the pitch and give our best.'

There is one big difference for Fernandez this time around, though. In 2022, he was the new face in the Argentina team, becoming the breakout star for his country at that World Cup.





Now with Chelsea in 2025, he is already established as a senior figure in the squad and captains the side in the absence of skipper Reece James.

‘I don't view being captain as a responsibility, but something that comes naturally to me,' he added. ‘It's beautiful being able to captain Chelsea. I arrived a few years ago and now I'm one of the captains, which says that I've been doing something well.

‘I am very grateful that my team-mates have trusted me and the club have trusted me. Obviously, I have a responsibility to train well every day, to be there for my team-mates, and to always give my best.'

The midfielder also discussed the evolution of his role under the guidance of Maresca, who has encouraged the Argentinian to play as a more advanced midfielder and increase his presence in the final third.





That has resulted in Fernandez posting career-best figures of nine goals and 18 assists across all competitions so far this season, with one last crucial fixture to play.

‘After he [Maresca] arrived, he told me about his idea of the position where he wanted me to play, and I think that with time I understood what he was asking me,' added the midfielder.

‘Since then, I have scored goals and made assists, which helps the team and personally helps me. So I am very happy.'

What better time for Fernandez to round things off with his 10th goal of the campaign than in today's final, to help make Chelsea Club World Cup winners and seal his own status as a world champion with club and country.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J (AP) — President Donald Trump on Sunday will attend the FIFA Club World Cup final, a match that will offer Trump a preview of the globe's premier soccer tournament that North America will host next year.

Trump and first lady Melania Trump will travel from their golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, to East Rutherford 40 miles (64 kilometers) away to watch the final match of the U.S.-hosted tournament between Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea at MetLife Stadium.

MetLife in a little over a year will host the 2026 World Cup final. 

The Trumps will be looking on as PSG attempts to win its fourth major title of the season, exactly 100 days after it clinched Ligue 1 on April 5. The team added the Coupe de France by beating Reims 3-0 on May 24, then romped over Inter Milan seven days later in the Champions League Final.

Trump's trip Sunday falls on the first anniversary of the assassination attempt he survived in Butler, Pennsylvania, while campaigning for president.

The president did not have any public plans to mark the date beyond participating in a taped Fox News Channel interview with his daughter-in-law Lara Trump that aired Saturday night.

Sporting events have made up the bulk of Trump's trips in the U.S. since taking office this year. In addition to his visit this weekend to the soccer tournament, he's attended the Super Bowl in New Orleans, the Daytona 500 in Florida, UFC fights in Miami and Newark, New Jersey, and the NCAA wrestling championships in Philadelphia.

The president, who has a warm relationship with FIFA President Gianni Infantino, has said he plans to attend multiple matches of the World Cup tournament next year.

Chelsea have reached the final of the Club World Cup

One of the most divisive football competitions created comes to an end on Sunday with the Club World Cup final between Paris St-Germain and Chelsea.

You can have your say throughout.

Has run to Club World Cup final been worth it for Chelsea?

Club World Cup 'world's most successful club competition'

Much has been made of some of the low attendances.

Four matches failed to get 10,000 fans, with the lowest the 3,412 who watched Mamelodi Sundowns beat Ulsan HD 1-0.

But there have been 15 crowds of 60,000 or more, with the highest the 80,619 who saw PSG beat Atletico Madrid 4-0 in Pasadena.

Most of the highest attendances were at games involving PSG or Real Madrid, and the majority of knockout games have been well attended.

The average attendance of 38,369 is below that of any World Cup since Chile 1962.

Reasons given for some low attendances were the kick-off times (many were in the middle of a weekday), ticket prices, weather and concerns about Immigration and Customs Enforcement raiding games.

""The decisive question is 'do the fans like it or not'?"" said former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, Fifa's chief of global football development.

""We believe the attendances were projected as low and in reality were much higher. The answer is there.""

A dynamic pricing structure, which is common in US sports, is being used, where the cost of tickets can change regularly.

Ticket prices for Chelsea's semi-final against Fluminense reportedly dropped from almost £350 to less than £10 in the week before the game.

Tickets for the Blues' quarter-final against Palmeiras ended up at £8, with fans talking about having paid more than £250 when they first went on sale.

""From the fans point of view, it's been positive,"" said ex-Premier League midfielder Brown, who has worked on 10 games involving 12 clubs.

""Everyone I've spoken to thinks it has been an incredible tournament and they have had a wonderful time.

""It feels like it's raised the awareness of football in so many countries. The other countries have absolutely loved it and really got behind their clubs.""

The answer to this question is yes - helped to a large extent by the huge prize fund available.

Teams could win up to £91m for winning the tournament, with Manchester City pocketing £38m despite going out in the last 16.

Chelsea have probably earned about £80m for reaching the final, with Joao Pedro repaying over a third of his transfer fee with two semi-final goals against Fluminense.

The winners will be allowed to wear a badge on their kit saying they are world champions until the summer of 2029, when the next tournament is played.

Players of Brazilian clubs celebrated wins and broke down with defeats every bit as much as any major cup.

As the tournament went on, European teams were determined to win it too.

""We had a lot of ambition for this Club World Cup and we wanted to win it,"" said City captain Bernardo Silva after losing to Al-Hilal.

Asked if it hurt as much as Champions League elimination, he said: ""Yes, a little bit.""

Wenger said: ""If you make enquiries to all the clubs who were here, then 100% of answers would be that they would want to do it again.

""That's the best answer of what the clubs think of a Club World Cup.""

Purely in football terms, the tournament could be considered a success.

The group stages were a slow burner, with mismatched games like Bayern Munich 10-0 Auckland City.

There have been plenty of dramatic games and surprising scorelines - and an average of more than three goals per game.

Manchester City were knocked out 4-3 in extra time by Al-Hilal. Benfica took Chelsea to extra time thanks to a 95th-minute penalty - after a two-hour weather delay - before the Blues won 4-1.

Chelsea scored a late winner in the quarter-final against Palmeiras, with Estevao Willian, who joins them after the competition, netting against his soon-to-be team-mates.

Lionel Messi scored a free-kick, amateur side Auckland City picked up a point against Boca Juniors, having lost their first two games by a total of 16-0, and there have been games with scorelines of 4-4, 4-3, 4-2 and 5-2.

PSG, who have been sensational at times, beat Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid and Inter Miami 4-0.

PSG beat Bayern 2-0 despite having nine men - and there were three stoppage-time goals and a red card as Real beat Borussia Dortmund 3-2.

""We saw a few games at the start of the tournament which were a bit of a mismatch, but after that all the games have been competitive,"" said Brown.

""The mixture of cultures has been amazing. We've seen some different styles of play but a lot of quality everywhere.

""The Brazilian teams in particular contributed to that in a massive way. They set the standard in matches, put pressure on European teams and made them respond.

""What we do have to understand is that the European teams had not hit their stride when the tournament started because they'd had a bit of a rest first [after the end of their domestic seasons].""

The tournament - inevitably considering the lack of history or prestige - has not grabbed the attention of all football fans.

For example, the BBC Sport live pages and reports for the knockout rounds have had between 40% and 50% of the audience they would normally get for the Champions League equivalent.

But those are still big figures compared to many lesser followed competitions and sports.

Every match has been available to watch for free in the UK, with all 63 games on the Dazn app and Channel 5 showing 23.

Dazn has not replied to requests for the viewing figures, but Channel 5 said it was happy with how many people have watched the games it broadcast.

Chelsea v Los Angeles FC was watched by a peak of 1.6 million people in the UK. Real's game against Al-Hilal was seen by a peak of 1.1 million.

In Saudi Arabia more than 1.5 million people watched their win over Manchester City in the last 16 despite kicking off at 4am local time.

""There was not a single place that didn't have the Al-Hilal game on, and everyone was off the streets and watching it,"" content creator Fayad told BBC Sport, speaking about the quarter-final loss to Fluminense.

""The freeway was so empty. On a Friday night that never happens, not even during Ramadan.""

Brazilians have arguably bought into the Club World Cup more than fans from any other nation. All four of their teams reached the knockout stages.

The Copacabana fan-fest hosted about 100,000 fans across the tournament.

How have global football fans embraced Club World Cup?

We will not know for several months yet how much of an impact this could have.

Many players involved have not had any break yet, with last season leading straight into international fixtures, which led straight into the Club World Cup.

Most teams start their 2025-26 campaign about a month after the Club World Cup ends, with the need to have a break and fit their pre-season into those four weeks.

""I try not to think about it, otherwise I will be so anxious,"" Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said, external recently.

""Maybe in November, December, January, ask me. I may say 'So listen, we are a disaster. We are exhausted. The World Cup destroyed us.' 

Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Maheta Molango told BBC Sport: ""It's this feeling of accumulation of competitions that just do not talk to each other and create a calendar that is just nonsensical.

""Let's see what happens in October, November - that's when you're going to start seeing because you pay the price. This Club World Cup gives us a chance to start looking at the bigger picture.""

For Bayern, the competition posed a more immediate problem.

Midfielder Jamal Musiala faces a long time out after suffering a broken leg and dislocated ankle after being caught by Gianluigi Donnarumma during the defeat by PSG.

The tournament had a few quirks that might be alien to traditional football fans.

The man of the match was instead called the superior player of the match.

The 22 starting players were called out one by one on the loudspeaker, instead of all running out together.

American sports announcer Michael Buffer called the players out for the semi-finals.

There were loud countdowns to kick-off and music played during cooling breaks.

Video assistant referee (VAR) decisions have been shown in the stadium and a 'ref cam' has shown footage from referees' bodycams during the game.

The final will have a Super Bowl-style half-time show with acts selected by Coldplay singer Chris Martin, although there was a Linkin Park concert before this year's Champions League final.

Michael Brown was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan

                One man who already knows what it takes to become a world champion is Enzo Fernandez and our midfielder has outlined what he feels could make the decisive difference in the FIFA Club World Cup final.
            

Fernandez was a key part of the Argentina team which triumphed at the 2022 FIFA World Cup. He featured in every minute of a gruelling final against France which ended in victory for the South Americans in a penalty shootout, after a 3-3 draw across 120 minutes of football.

The last few tickets are still available for our Club World Cup final so come and support the Blues by clicking here

He now has the chance to become a double world champion simultaneously, having helped Chelsea reach today's final of the Club World Cup in the USA, where we will also face French opposition in the form of Paris Saint-Germain.

That gives the midfielder rare experience of what it takes to succeed in a global final, which he shared ahead of today's 3pm kick-off local time (8pm UK time) at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium.

'The key, I think, is that in finals you play very focused,' explained the 24-year-old, who also tasted victory in a final with the Blues in May's UEFA Conference League triumph.





‘We know that we can't give them space and we know that we can't give them chances, because they have very good players.

‘Winning this Club World Cup would be very important for the club. Obviously, Chelsea have won it in the past, but a second wouldn't be a bad thing!

‘So we've been preparing for the match in the best possible way. We know we are facing a great team, but we are confident in ourselves and are also a great team.

‘So we have prepared well and now we will go out onto the pitch and give our best.'

There is one big difference for Fernandez this time around, though. In 2022, he was the new face in the Argentina team, becoming the breakout star for his country at that World Cup.





Now with Chelsea in 2025, he is already established as a senior figure in the squad and captains the side in the absence of skipper Reece James.

‘I don't view being captain as a responsibility, but something that comes naturally to me,' he added. ‘It's beautiful being able to captain Chelsea. I arrived a few years ago and now I'm one of the captains, which says that I've been doing something well.

‘I am very grateful that my team-mates have trusted me and the club have trusted me. Obviously, I have a responsibility to train well every day, to be there for my team-mates, and to always give my best.'

The midfielder also discussed the evolution of his role under the guidance of Maresca, who has encouraged the Argentinian to play as a more advanced midfielder and increase his presence in the final third.





That has resulted in Fernandez posting career-best figures of nine goals and 18 assists across all competitions so far this season, with one last crucial fixture to play.

‘After he [Maresca] arrived, he told me about his idea of the position where he wanted me to play, and I think that with time I understood what he was asking me,' added the midfielder.

‘Since then, I have scored goals and made assists, which helps the team and personally helps me. So I am very happy.'

What better time for Fernandez to round things off with his 10th goal of the campaign than in today's final, to help make Chelsea Club World Cup winners and seal his own status as a world champion with club and country.

The United States and North America as a whole will host the next FIFA World Cup in 2026, and President Trump met with several cabinet members to discuss a task force in charge of preparations.

President Donald Trump will attend the FIFA Club World Cup final Sunday at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. 

The president confirmed his attendance while speaking to reporters at a Cabinet meeting. Trump has attended multiple sporting events while in office, including UFC fights and the Super Bowl in February. 

The FIFA Club World Cup has served as a test run of sorts for the United States, which will host the 2026 World Cup next summer, along with Canada and Mexico.

Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain are playing against each other in Sunday's Club World Cup final. 

The match is set for 3 p.m. ET Sunday, July 13.  

Every game of the Club World Cup is streamed live on DAZN.

The backstory:

In March, Trump announced the formation of a task force to prepare for the 2026 World Cup, which will bring the globe's premier soccer tournament to North America. 

READ MORE: Trump to sign executive order establishing White House Task Force for 2026 FIFA World Cup

The task force, which Trump will chair, will coordinate the federal government's security and planning for a tournament that's expected to draw millions of tourists to the United States, Canada and Mexico.

Timeline:

The 2026 World Cup will be played at 16 stadiums in the U.S., Mexico and Canada from June 11 to July 19 next year, a tournament expanded to 48 nations and 104 games. All matches from the quarterfinals on will be in the U.S., with the final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

RELATED: World Cup 2026: Here's what you need to know

By the numbers:

There will be 12 groups of four teams. The teams in each group play each other and the top two will advance to a knockout stage. The eight best third-place teams will also advance. The knockouts will be played from the round of 32 to the final.

Local perspective:

The United States will host games in Arlington, Texas; Atlanta; East Rutherford, New Jersey; Foxborough, Massachusetts; Houston; Inglewood, California; Kansas City, Missouri; Miami Gardens, Florida; Philadelphia, Seattle; and San Jose, California.

Two Canadian cities will have World Cup games: Toronto and Vancouver, British Columbia.

In Mexico, games will be played in Guadalajara, Monterrey, and Mexico City.

Dig deeper:

U.S. World Cup organizers have conceded that the Trump administration's aggressive immigration crackdown could have an impact on the 2026 World Cup. Trump's travel ban on citizens from 12 countries exempted athletes, coaches, staff and relatives while not mentioning fans.

What they're saying:

""There are certainly things that are happening at the national level, the international level, there are going to be geopolitical issues that we don't even know right now that are going affect the tournament next year, so we recognize that we're planning within uncertainty,"" Philadelphia host city executive Meg Kane said last month at a gathering of the 11 U.S. host city leaders.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Is Lamine Yamal ready for Lionel Messi's No.10? ‘One more season' of 19 mooted for Barcelona wonderkid","https://www.goal.com/en-us/news/lamine-yamal-ready-lionel-messi-no-10-one-more-season-19-barcelona-wonderkid/bltd33bde8d5c821e3a","Sun, 13 Jul 2025 08:51:06 GMT","

Lamine Yamal is expected to take the No.10 shirt at Barcelona that Lionel Messi once filled, but “one more season” of 19 is being mooted.

The teenage wonderkid has been cleared to sign a lucrative new contract in Catalunya after celebrating his 18th birthday. His superstar status is being rewarded financially, while he could be moving up the pecking order on the field.

With Ansu Fati leaving for a loan spell at Monaco, the No.10 jersey is up for grabs once more. Eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi cemented his legacy in that shirt, with Yamal treading a similar path after graduating from the same La Masia academy system.

He has been dropping hints at taking a new squad number, with Guillem Balague saying in his column for BBC Sport: “He has posted pictures of himself one day with the number 19 jersey he currently wears - as a young Messi also did - followed by a homage to some previous wearers of the 10.

“The names read like a who's who of footballing royalty. Messi, of course, Diego Maradona, Ronaldinho, Rivaldo, Romario, Hristo Stoichkov, Juan Roman Riquelme, Pep Guardiola and Laszlo Kubala.”

It is, however, being claimed that Yamal could delay a huge career call. Balague added: “Speculation around Barcelona's number 10 shirt has followed him for months. Out of respect, he did not entertain conversations about it while Ansu Fati, the previous wearer, was still at the club, but he has since moved to Monaco.

""Barcelona have not announced anything officially, although there has been a dramatic surge in sales of said shirt. Yamal is wondering what to do. Take the weight of the 10? Or keep 19 one more season - perhaps until he turns 19?”

Yamal started in 41 at Barcelona, when making his senior bow at 15 years of age, before moving on to No.27. He has worn 19 since 2024, with that number also being taken with Spain, but is considered to be a natural fit for the iconic No.10 jersey.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

USMNT star Josh Sargent continues to attract Premier League interest, but Norwich's £20 million ($27m) asking price is putting suitors off.

That could be considered a fair price for a man that has hit 44 goals through 98 Championship appearances for the Canaries. He is also tied to a contract through to 2028, meaning those at Carrow Road are under no pressure to sell.

Sargent has seen a step up into the top-flight of English football speculated on for some time, having joined Norwich when they were competing at that level, but no deal has been done and there remains little substance to the speculation.

In the present, Everton, Leeds and Roma are among those to have been credited with interest. Italian giants are said to have turned their attention elsewhere, while teams in England are reluctant to meet Norwich's demands.

Alan Nixon has said via Patreon that Burnley are among those to have asked questions of Sargent, but consider him to be overpriced. The Clarets are, like Leeds, in the market for more firepower after securing promotion into the Premier League.

Jannik Sinner has won the second set against Carlos Alcaraz to level the Wimbledon final on Sunday. After one hour and 32 minutes of high-quality action, the match is poised at 4-6, 6-4 on Centre Court.

After Alcaraz claimed the opening set by winning one of the points of the tournament, a pumped-up Sinner responded in the second set by increasing his aggression. The World No. 1 hit with heavy pace into the Alcaraz forehand to rush the Spaniard and also used the drop shot more frequently than in the pair's past encounters, taking advantage of the World No. 2's deep court positioning at times to move closer to his fourth major title.

Last month, Alcaraz pulled off a thrilling escape at Roland Garros, saving three championship points to claw past Sinner in an epic five-set, five-hour, 29-minute final. That victory kept his flawless record in major finals intact (5-0) and pushed his Lexus ATP Head2Head advantage against the Italian to 8-4.

Alcaraz, who has beaten Sinner in their past five meetings, arrived in the Wimbledon final riding a career-best 24-match winning streak. If he claims his sixth major title and sixth crown of the year, he'll join Bjorn Borg as the only men in the Open Era to complete the Roland Garros–Wimbledon double in back-to-back years. Borg did it from 1978 to 1980.
Though Alcaraz faced a scare in the first round against Fabio Fognini, stretching to five sets, he's been firing on all cylinders since the fourth round. The 22-year-old has earned second-week victories against Andrey Rublev, Cameron Norrie and Taylor Fritz and is just one win away from becoming only the fifth man ever to clinch three consecutive Wimbledon titles.

Sinner is seeking Wimbledon redemption following his Roland Garros heartbreak. The No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings dispatched Novak Djokovic in straight sets to complete the set of final appearances at all four Grand Slam events. He is the 11th man to complete that feat in the Open Era.
The 23-year-old boasts a 3-1 record in major finals, having kicked off the year with victory at the Australian Open. A win on Sunday would make him the first Italian ever to lift the Wimbledon trophy — a feat his countryman Matteo Berrettini came to within a match of in 2021 before falling to Djokovic in four sets.
World No. 1 Sinner leads the PIF ATP Live Rankings with 11,330 points, while Alcaraz has 8,600 points, giving Sinner a 2,730-point advantage. But that margin will shift dramatically depending on Sunday's championship match. If Sinner wins his first Wimbledon title, his lead will grow to 3,430 points. However, if Alcaraz claims his third consecutive Wimbledon crown, he will narrow the gap to 2,030 points.

The two-time defending champion Alcaraz came out aggressively, hitting with heavy pace into Sinner's forehand to rush the Italian. The World No. 2 also used the drop shot frequently and showed trademark resilience to rally from to 2-4, sealing the set with a backhand defensive block on the stretch after a brutal baseline exchange, where both players were pulled from side to side.
Sinner responded by breaking Alcaraz at the start of the second set and was the more consistent in the baseline exchanges, committing five fewer unforced errors (8-13). After levelling the match with a forehand winner, the Italian, showing more emotion than normal, let out a roar and turned to his box, where coaches Simone Vagnozzi and Darren Cahill rose to their feet.
Did You Know?
In the Open Era, Sinner and Alcaraz are the only Roland Garros final opponents to meet again in the same season's Wimbledon championship besides Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, who did it in three consecutive years from 2006 through 2008. Sinner and Alcaraz have split the past six majors.

No matter who wins the Wimbledon final between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, there will be a big swing in the battle for the No. 1 PIF ATP Ranking.

Entering the match, Sinner has 11,330 points in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and Alcaraz has 8,600, giving the Italian a 2,730-point advantage. But that will change very quickly one way or the other following Sunday's championship blockbuster.

If Sinner lifts his first Wimbledon trophy, he will leave the grass-court major with a 3,430-point lead. If Alcaraz claims his third consecutive title at the tournament, he will claw to within 2,030 points. There will be a 1,400-point swing based on the match.

PIF ATP Live Rankings (entering Wimbledon final)




Entering the tournament, Sinner only led Alcaraz by 1,130 points. But because Alcaraz claimed the crown last year (2,000 points) and Sinner lost in the quarter-finals (400 points), the World No. 1 had an opportunity to extend his lead.

However, no matter who emerges victorious on Centre Court, the deficit between Sinner and Alcaraz will not be as big as it seems.

From the end of Wimbledon through the US Open, Sinner will defend 3,200 points, because last year he triumphed in New York, Cincinnati and advanced to the quarter-finals in Canada. During the same stretch, Alcaraz will only defend 60 points.

Even if Alcaraz loses the Wimbledon final and falls behind his rival by 3,430 points, he will have a chance to move far closer in the next two months, during which he will drop 3,140 fewer points.



For now, both men will be fully focused on capturing another Grand Slam trophy on Sunday. Will Alcaraz extend his 8-4 lead in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series or will Sinner earn revenge after his near miss against the Spaniard at Roland Garros?

Sixteen-year-old Bulgarian Ivan Ivanov joined countryman Grigor Dimitrov in the history books on Sunday by winning the Wimbledon boys' singles title.

The teen defeated American Ronit Karki 6-2, 6-3 to claim the trophy. The sixth seed did not lose a set en route to the trophy and earned revenge in the semi-finals against Max Schoenhaus, who eliminated him in the last four at Roland Garros.

""The last champion was Grigor in 2008,"" Ivanov said. ""So for me [it] was a privilege to play [the] final, that's for sure. And to be a great battle today was something very nice, too.""

Ivanov and Dimitrov are the only two Bulgarian boys to win a Grand Slam junior singles championship. Before Ivanov, no Bulgarian boy had made a major junior singles final since Dimitrov at the 2008 US Open. The 2017 Nitto ATP Finals champion won the 2008 Wimbledon and US Open boys' singles titles.



The championship clash Sunday was under Ivanov's control from early in the encounter. The 16-year-old did not face a break point, while he earned three service breaks in his 57-minute victory.

""Of course, I had to go to sleep one hour before my bedtime just so I can focus. I couldn't sleep at my bedtime. So one hour and a half I was just rotating in my bed and not able to sleep,"" Ivanov said. ""But today when I went in the court, I was enjoying. The pressure was out. I was very happy.""

Ivanov is the highest-ranked player younger than 17 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. He is currently World No. 798 with fellow 16-year-old Cruz Hewitt, the son of Lleyton Hewitt, ranked No. 827.

Clay-court tennis resumes after Wimbledon with two ATP 250s in Europe. One of those is the Nordea Open in Bastad, which features two main draw matches and three qualifying matches on the opening day. Who will reach the main draw and who will reach the second round?

Head-to-head: first meeting

18-year-old William Rejchtman Vinciguerra hasn't played on the ATP Tour. The closest he has been to this stage was when he lost in qualifying in this tournament last season. Jesper De Jong was a Top 100 player a couple of months ago after a third-round finish in Rome as a lucky loser. But the Dutchman has won two main draw matches in his last five tournaments and is currently outside the centurion club. Still, he has a winnable opening match where he will be heavily favored to progress against a relatively inexperienced teenager.

Prediction: De Jong in 2

Head-to-head: Monteiro 1-0 Gaubas

Just two spots separate Gaubas and Monteiro in the rankings. They will meet in the second round of qualifying in Bastad. Monteiro defeated the Lithuanian in a tight two-setter when they met at the Bad Waltersdorf Challenger last season. Consistency is usually Monteiro's biggest problem, but his depth and power can be overwhelming when firing on all cylinders.

Prediction: Monteiro in 3

Head-to-head: first meeting

This is a qualifying match pitting the experienced Misolic against the rookie Olle Walin. The Swede picked up a high-quality opening win against Viktor Durasovic to move within one win of the main draw. But this will be a huge challenge against the high-flying Austrian who has Top 100 ambitions and could well achieve that milestone this week.

Prediction: Misolic in 2

Head-to-head: first meeting

Both Darderi and Collignon have accomplished resumes competing on clay. But it is the Italian who has enjoyed a steadier rise on the ATP Tour this season, winning his second title in Marrakech and posting 16 wins from 27 matches on clay. Collignon won the Monza Challenger in April and reached two additional quarterfinals in his subsequent four tournaments on the dirt. Darderi hasn't played since Wimbledon, but that won't be an issue, and he should settle quickly.

Prediction: Darderi in 2

...

No. 1 Jannik Sinner and No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz meet again in another chapter of their storied rivalry. Just over a month after tussling for the title at Roland-Garros, the world's top two male tennis players will square off at Center Court in Wimbledon for another trophy.

Sinner came to the brink of elimination at one point in this tournament in his round-of-16 showdown with Grigor Dimitrov. However, his opponent suffered a partial pectoral tear, forcing him to retire. Sinner cruised through his next opponents, Blake Shelton and Novak Djokovic, to secure a spot in the final.

Alcaraz has seen his share of blowouts and nail-biters on his run, sweeping Oliver Tarvet in the second round and Cameron Norrie in the quarterfinal. He saw at least four sets against Fabio Fognini, Jan-Lennard Struff, Andrey Rublev and Taylor Fritz.

The Spaniard holds an 8-4 advantage over Sinner in their previous head-to-head matches, including their French Open barn-burner in June. Alcaraz is looking for his sixth Grand Slam title, while Sinner seeks his fourth.

Although Alcaraz has the upper hand over Sinner throughout their matches, Sinner has a victory over Alcaraz at Wimbledon. The pair faced off in the round of 16 in 2022, with Sinner emerging victorious.

Date: Sunday, July 13

Jannik Sinner-Carlos Alcaraz start time: 11 a.m. ET

LONDON (AP) — Jannik Sinner has taken the second set 6-4 against Carlos Alcaraz to level the Wimbledon men's final at 1-1.

Alcaraz won the first set 6-4 in a highly anticipated meeting that comes just five weeks after the pair played an epic match to determine the French Open champion.

But Sinner broke the Spaniard in the opening game of the second set and then held serve the rest of the way. That was despite being interrupted by a fan in the stands popping open a champagne bottle as Sinner was getting ready to serve out the game at 2-1 up. The cork landed at Sinner's feet, causing Alcaraz to raise both hands and shake his head in frustration.

Sinner lost the following point but went on to hold for a 3-1 lead.

The matchup at Centre Court between the No. 1-ranked Sinner and No. 2 Alcaraz marks the first time the same two men faced off in the title matches on the clay at Roland-Garros and the grass at the All England Club in the same year since Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal did it in 2006, 2007 and 2008.

Alcaraz, a 22-year-old from Spain, defeated Sinner, a 22-year-old from Italy, in five sets spread over 5 hours, 29 minutes in Paris on June 8, coming back from a two-set deficit and saving three match points along the way.

That made Alcaraz 5-0 in Grand Slam finals, including victories in 2023 and 2024 at Wimbledon.

He also carries a career-best 24-match winning streak into Sunday and has beaten Sinner five times in a row.

Sinner owns three major trophies and is playing in his fourth consecutive Slam final — but first at the All England Club.

He won the U.S. Open last September and the Australian Open this January.

Sinner is wearing the tape and arm sleeve to protect his right elbow that he has been using since falling in the opening game of his fourth-round win on Monday. After eliminating 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic in the semifinals, Sinner said he didn't think his elbow would be an issue on Sunday.

Princess Kate demonstrated her true feelings after arriving at the press box in Wimbledon ahead of the women's singles Wimbledon final. The Princess of Wales, who in January announced she was in remission from cancer, received a standing ovation from the 15,000 strong crowd inside Centre Court on Saturday (July 12) afternoon. It was noisier than ever before and expert lip reader Jeremy Freeman analysed her stunned response.

Looking at the crowd, he believes Kate said: “Thanks. Hi.” And turning to somebody out of shot, she gushed: “Sweet, very nice to hear!”

Moments earlier she shook hands with former Wimbledon champion Martina Navratilova, 68, before greeting tennis legend Billie Jean King, 81, who curtsied to her.





And after Billie asked how she was, she replied: “Beautiful.”

After watching the final, where Poland's Iga Swiatek defeated American Amanda Anisimova 6–0, 6-0, she offered words of encouragement to both the winner and loser.

Speaking to Anisimova, Jeremy had her saying: “You should be so proud, well done, and enjoy yourself.”

Kate, 43, later engaged in conversation with the winner Swiatek backstage and she reportedly advised her: “Ensure that you have some downtime.”

Earlier in the conversation, she said: “Wonderful, extraordinary achievement, very well done. Congratulations and enjoy it. Enjoy the celebrations back home.”

After becoming the first Polish woman to win at Wimbledon, Siatek told the crowd: “First of all I want to congratulate Amanda for an amazing two weeks no matter what happened today. I hope we're going to play many more finals here and at other tournaments.

“I didn't even dream [about winning] because it was way too far, I feel like I'm already an experienced player after winning the slams before but I never really expected this one.”

Kate is the patron of the All England Lawn Tennis Club and she has been present on Centre Court for many years since marrying Prince William back in 2011.

She presented the men's singles trophy to Carlos Alcaraz last year and she may do the same this afternoon when the Spaniard takes on Jannik Sinner in the highly anticipated final.

Sixteen-year-old Bulgarian Ivan Ivanov joined countryman Grigor Dimitrov in the history books on Sunday by winning the Wimbledon boys' singles title.

The teen defeated American Ronit Karki 6-2, 6-3 to claim the trophy. The sixth seed did not lose a set en route to the trophy and earned revenge in the semi-finals against Max Schoenhaus, who eliminated him in the last four at Roland Garros.

""The last champion was Grigor in 2008,"" Ivanov said. ""So for me [it] was a privilege to play [the] final, that's for sure. And to be a great battle today was something very nice, too.""

Ivanov and Dimitrov are the only two Bulgarian boys to win a Grand Slam junior singles championship. Before Ivanov, no Bulgarian boy had made a major junior singles final since Dimitrov at the 2008 US Open. The 2017 Nitto ATP Finals champion won the 2008 Wimbledon and US Open boys' singles titles.



The championship clash Sunday was under Ivanov's control from early in the encounter. The 16-year-old did not face a break point, while he earned three service breaks in his 57-minute victory.

""Of course, I had to go to sleep one hour before my bedtime just so I can focus. I couldn't sleep at my bedtime. So one hour and a half I was just rotating in my bed and not able to sleep,"" Ivanov said. ""But today when I went in the court, I was enjoying. The pressure was out. I was very happy.""

Ivanov is the highest-ranked player younger than 17 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. He is currently World No. 798 with fellow 16-year-old Cruz Hewitt, the son of Lleyton Hewitt, ranked No. 827.

WIMBLEDON, England -- Ivan Ivanov of Bulgaria won his first Grand Slam title by beating Ronit Karki of the United States 6-2, 6-3 in the Wimbledon juniors final on Sunday.

The 16-year-old Ivanov became the second Bulgarian to win the title after Grigor Dimitrov in 2008.

He never faced a break point against Karki and finished with 22 winners, compared to six for his opponent.

Karki was trying to become the first qualifier to win the title since Noah Rubin in 2014.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","tennis"

Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens are the Wimbledon ladies' doubles champions after overcoming Hsieh Su-wei and Jelena Ostapenko in an enthralling final on Centre Court on Sunday.

No. 8 seeds Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens are the 2025 Wimbledon ladies' doubles champions after an enthralling final on Centre Court on Sunday.

Kudermetova and Mertens fought past No. 4 seeds Hsieh Su-wei and Jelena Ostapenko 3-6, 6-2, 6-4 in a 2-hour and 23-minute thriller to take the championship trophy.

The victors made comeback after comeback on Sunday. After battling to level the match at one set apiece, Kudermetova and Mertens were down 4-2 in the third set -- but they won the next four games to hoist the hardware.

""It's an incredible feeling,"" Mertens said in the champions' press conference. ""There is no feeling like winning The Championships. It was a very close match today. I was so happy that we converted our first match point. So, yeah, two happy people.""

Successful reunion: It is a big win for Kudermetova -- she was the only player of the four who had not previously won a Grand Slam doubles title. Now she joins that list, four years after failing to convert two championship points in the 2021 Wimbledon doubles final.

""For the moment, I mean me, right now, [I don't] feel that I'm Wimbledon champion in doubles,"" Kudermetova said. ""Maybe in the evening or tomorrow I will realize it.

""When I finish the match, I mean, was so emotional. I even start to cry a little bit, but then I saw Elise. She cry, [so] OK, I have to hold my emotion!""

This is Mertens' fifth Grand Slam doubles title, and second at Wimbledon. She and Hsieh teamed up to win the 2021 Wimbledon doubles title -- in fact, they were the ones who saved championship points and outlasted Kudermetova and Elena Vesnina in that aforementioned final.

Kudermetova and Mertens were a top team in 2022, the year they won the WTA Finals. They disbanded for the 2023 and 2024 seasons, but re-paired this spring and made finals at WTA 1000 Madrid and Rome.

Now, in just their fifth event together since re-teaming, Kudermetova and Mertens have won the first title of their reunion here at Wimbledon.

""We played in the past, and we had some great results,"" Mertens said. ""We already felt like from the first match on, the first match we were back together, that you know, we're a good team and we can trust each other, we can build together. I think this is a cherry on top of the cake.""

Mertens is now looking forward to an event she missed four years ago: ""We have the Wimbledon [Champions'] Ball to go to. I won it in 2021, and it was COVID, so there was no ball. It's going to be my first time too. So it's going to be fun.""

Match moments: Ostapenko could have risen to WTA Doubles World No. 1 with a win today, and she was on track after she and Hsieh had a strong first-set comeback of their own. They were a point away from trailing 4-1, but they reeled off five games in a row to clinch the one-set lead.

In the second set, Kudermetova and Mertens led 3-1 once more. This time, they did not give up their lead, as Kudermetova's volleys particularly started to click into gear. The pair broke the Hsieh serve twice in that set to tie up the final.

In the decisive third set, Ostapenko's laser groundstrokes helped her and Hsieh come out on top in longer rallies, and they broke for 3-2. After Ostapenko held at love to consolidate for 4-2, her squad had all the momentum.

But Kudermetova and Mertens went on the attack again in Hsieh's next service game, and Kudermetova slammed a winning smash to break at love and level proceedings at 4-4.

At 5-4, 30-30, another lengthy rally saw Ostapenko fire a miscue wide, setting up championship point for Kudermetova and Mertens. There, Kudermetova exorcised the ghosts of 2021 by punching a volley winner to seal victory for her team.

WIMBLEDON, England -- Veronika Kudermetova secured her first Grand Slam title by teaming up with Elise Mertens to win the women's doubles final at Wimbledon on Sunday, rallying to beat Su-Wei Hsieh and Jelena Ostapenko 3-6, 6-2, 6-4 on Centre Court.

Kudermetova and Mertens were on opposite sides in the final in 2021 but were playing at Wimbledon together for the first time this year. They trailed 4-2 in the third set but won the last four games to seal the comeback.

It is Mertens' fifth Grand Slam doubles title and second at Wimbledon. In 2021, she teamed up with Hsieh to win a marathon final where they saved two match points against Kudermetova and Elena Vesnina.

""I lost that final and it was so painful,"" Kudermetova said. ""Today I said to myself, I really want it. And it's mine now.""

Hsieh has won the Wimbledon doubles title four times with three different partners.

Shakur Stevenson remained undefeated and defended his WBC lightweight title with a dominant performance in the first boxing card held on the grounds of the U.S. Open tennis tournament, beating William Zepeda by unanimous decision Saturday night

NEW YORK -- Shakur Stevenson remained undefeated and defended his WBC lightweight title with a dominant performance in the first boxing card held on the grounds of the U.S. Open tennis tournament, beating William Zepeda by unanimous decision Saturday night.

One judge favored Stevenson 119-109, while the other two had it 118-110 for the 2016 Olympic silver medalist.

Stevenson (24-0) won just before Edgar Berlanga and Hamzah Sheeraz fought in the final bout of the night in Louis Armstrong Stadium, the No. 2 venue at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.

But it was a main event-level performance from Stevenson and the first wide victory of the night after the previous two bouts were close right to the finish.

Zepeda (33-1) landed a left hand shortly after the opening bell that drew a smile from the champion, and he was able to get inside a number of times to unload a series of shots at Stevenson. But he was often powerless to stop the flurries that were coming back at him from Stevenson's hand speed that is up at the top of boxing.

The Ring Magazine held its second fight card in New York after staging one in Times Square in May. Tickets weren't sold then and just a few hundred people were able to see it, creating an atmosphere where the scene was impressive but the sounds were almost non-existent, leaving fighters to say it felt like a sparring session. 

This time, seats were sold and many were occupied well into the second deck of the 14,000-seat stadium, which had its retractable roof closed to create comfortable conditions on a humid day.

And the fans saw good action early in a brilliant performance from Stevenson, who has been criticized at times for a style that that seems too dependent on avoiding pain and not dishing it out. 

But he seemed happy to trade Saturday and most times came out ahead when he did.

Zepeda did trap Stevenson in a corner to score with some shots in the third round, bringing his Mexican fans out of their seats, but many other times Stevenson's quick head movement allowed him to dodge potential trouble. By the middle of the fight, Stevenson was firing off two, three, sometimes four unreturned shots

There was a title change in the previous fight, when Subriel Matias (23-2) edged Alberto Puello (24-1) by majority decision to take the WBC's 140-pound belt.

Before that, Cuban David Morrell (12-1) got up from a fifth-round knockdown to rally late and edge Imam Khataev (10-1) by split decision in a light heavyweight bout.

Pat Rafter, the Australian tennis star famed for his iconic ponytail and once crowned 'Sexiest Athlete Alive' nearly 30 years ago, has since traded in that look.

Rafter rose to prominence in the 90s, with his career-defining moment coming in 1997 when he clinched the U.S. Open title. His off-court appeal was just as strong, with his long hair, stubbled beard, and chiseled physique earning him the title of the world's most attractive sportsman by People magazine.

Even though time has caught up with the two-time Wimbledon finalist, the 52-year-old remains as handsome as ever.

In recent times, Rafter's public outings have been sparse. He's occasionally lent his expertise as a commentator in Australia and has also held administrative positions with Tennis Australia.

He did grace the court at the Brisbane International tournament last December, playing an exhibition match at the venue named after him. Post-match, while signing autographs, he revealed a slicked-back hairstyle under his cap, a far cry from his once shoulder-length locks.



Rafter is celebrated for breaking Australia's drought for a major champion, successfully defending his U.S. Open crown in 1998. Reflecting on his career in 2017, he said: ""I was at a time where there weren't a lot of players around,"".

""I came on the scene, I won a couple of Slams, and then I was revered a little bit more than if I had won that back in the 70s. You would have just gone, 'There's another good tennis player from Australia.' Maybe the personality of the media made me into something bigger than what I actually was. That's OK.""

Pat Rafter experienced two gut-wrenching defeats at Wimbledon, with the 2000 men's final against Pete Sampras being particularly tough as he admits to ""choking"" during the second set tie-break.



The following year saw yet another tough loss for Rafter, this time to Goran Ivanisevic. After hanging up his racket in 2003, he embraced family life with ex-model Lara Feltham, marrying her in 2004, and they have two kids together, Joshua and India, who are now grown up and can reflect humorously on their father's history.

Before settling down, Rafter had his share of dates with various Dutch models in the 90s, until he found lasting love with their mother, quipping, ""You know what, it is exhausting being this good-looking.""

Jannik Sinner Opens Up After Split With Anna Kalinskaya originally appeared on Athlon Sports.

Girlfriend rumors always follow champions, and Jannik Sinner's love life has also been the same. The World No. 1 has been creating records on court, but off it, he's had to do some emotional cleanup too.

During a recent press conference at the Italian Open in May, Sinner didn't dodge the most tough question in the room. “I'm not in a relationship,” the 23-year-old told reporters. “So, whoever is asking, that's it. It's all good.” That short but clear statement officially confirmed what many had been speculating, Sinner and Russian tennis player Anna Kalinskaya are no longer together.

The split comes just months after Sinner first opened up about their relationship. Back in May during the French Open, he told Tennis.com, “Yes, I'm with Anna, but we keep everything very confidential. I won't say more.” The pair later shared a warm post-match moment at the 2024 US Open, where Kalinskaya was seen congratulating him courtside after his win against Taylor Fritz.

But as Wimbledon rolled around, fans noticed something different, Kalinskaya was missing from the scene. Sinner hinted that all the attention off the court caught him off guard. “I was very surprised to see some pictures… which, you know, nothing serious,” he said.

In a June interview with Vanity Fair Italia, Sinner admitted that balancing love and life at the top of tennis isn't easy. “I travel a lot and during tournaments, I'm very focused,” he said. “But I think it's a beautiful thing when you find the right love.”

Before dating Kalinskaya, Sinner was linked to Italian model Maria Braccini. Kalinskaya had also dated Aussie star Nick Kyrgios.

Right now, though, Sinner's mind is firmly on Wimbledon. The Italian ace is chasing his first title at the All England Club, and this time, he's going all alone.

Sixteen-year-old Bulgarian Ivan Ivanov joined countryman Grigor Dimitrov in the history books on Sunday by winning the Wimbledon boys' singles title.

The teen defeated American Ronit Karki 6-2, 6-3 to claim the trophy. The sixth seed did not lose a set en route to the trophy and earned revenge in the semi-finals against Max Schoenhaus, who eliminated him in the last four at Roland Garros.

""The last champion was Grigor in 2008,"" Ivanov said. ""So for me [it] was a privilege to play [the] final, that's for sure. And to be a great battle today was something very nice, too.""

Ivanov and Dimitrov are the only two Bulgarian boys to win a Grand Slam junior singles championship. Before Ivanov, no Bulgarian boy had made a major junior singles final since Dimitrov at the 2008 US Open. The 2017 Nitto ATP Finals champion won the 2008 Wimbledon and US Open boys' singles titles.



The championship clash Sunday was under Ivanov's control from early in the encounter. The 16-year-old did not face a break point, while he earned three service breaks in his 57-minute victory.

""Of course, I had to go to sleep one hour before my bedtime just so I can focus. I couldn't sleep at my bedtime. So one hour and a half I was just rotating in my bed and not able to sleep,"" Ivanov said. ""But today when I went in the court, I was enjoying. The pressure was out. I was very happy.""

Ivanov is the highest-ranked player younger than 17 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. He is currently World No. 798 with fellow 16-year-old Cruz Hewitt, the son of Lleyton Hewitt, ranked No. 827.

No matter who wins the Wimbledon final between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, there will be a big swing in the battle for the No. 1 PIF ATP Ranking.

Entering the match, Sinner has 11,330 points in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and Alcaraz has 8,600, giving the Italian a 2,730-point advantage. But that will change very quickly one way or the other following Sunday's championship blockbuster.

If Sinner lifts his first Wimbledon trophy, he will leave the grass-court major with a 3,430-point lead. If Alcaraz claims his third consecutive title at the tournament, he will claw to within 2,030 points. There will be a 1,400-point swing based on the match.

PIF ATP Live Rankings (entering Wimbledon final)




Entering the tournament, Sinner only led Alcaraz by 1,130 points. But because Alcaraz claimed the crown last year (2,000 points) and Sinner lost in the quarter-finals (400 points), the World No. 1 had an opportunity to extend his lead.

However, no matter who emerges victorious on Centre Court, the deficit between Sinner and Alcaraz will not be as big as it seems.

From the end of Wimbledon through the US Open, Sinner will defend 3,200 points, because last year he triumphed in New York, Cincinnati and advanced to the quarter-finals in Canada. During the same stretch, Alcaraz will only defend 60 points.

Even if Alcaraz loses the Wimbledon final and falls behind his rival by 3,430 points, he will have a chance to move far closer in the next two months, during which he will drop 3,140 fewer points.



For now, both men will be fully focused on capturing another Grand Slam trophy on Sunday. Will Alcaraz extend his 8-4 lead in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series or will Sinner earn revenge after his near miss against the Spaniard at Roland Garros?

Jannik Sinner has won the second set against Carlos Alcaraz to level the Wimbledon final on Sunday. After one hour and 32 minutes of high-quality action, the match is poised at 4-6, 6-4 on Centre Court.

After Alcaraz claimed the opening set by winning one of the points of the tournament, a pumped-up Sinner responded in the second set by increasing his aggression. The World No. 1 hit with heavy pace into the Alcaraz forehand to rush the Spaniard and also used the drop shot more frequently than in the pair's past encounters, taking advantage of the World No. 2's deep court positioning at times to move closer to his fourth major title.

Last month, Alcaraz pulled off a thrilling escape at Roland Garros, saving three championship points to claw past Sinner in an epic five-set, five-hour, 29-minute final. That victory kept his flawless record in major finals intact (5-0) and pushed his Lexus ATP Head2Head advantage against the Italian to 8-4.

Alcaraz, who has beaten Sinner in their past five meetings, arrived in the Wimbledon final riding a career-best 24-match winning streak. If he claims his sixth major title and sixth crown of the year, he'll join Bjorn Borg as the only men in the Open Era to complete the Roland Garros–Wimbledon double in back-to-back years. Borg did it from 1978 to 1980.
Though Alcaraz faced a scare in the first round against Fabio Fognini, stretching to five sets, he's been firing on all cylinders since the fourth round. The 22-year-old has earned second-week victories against Andrey Rublev, Cameron Norrie and Taylor Fritz and is just one win away from becoming only the fifth man ever to clinch three consecutive Wimbledon titles.

Sinner is seeking Wimbledon redemption following his Roland Garros heartbreak. The No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings dispatched Novak Djokovic in straight sets to complete the set of final appearances at all four Grand Slam events. He is the 11th man to complete that feat in the Open Era.
The 23-year-old boasts a 3-1 record in major finals, having kicked off the year with victory at the Australian Open. A win on Sunday would make him the first Italian ever to lift the Wimbledon trophy — a feat his countryman Matteo Berrettini came to within a match of in 2021 before falling to Djokovic in four sets.
World No. 1 Sinner leads the PIF ATP Live Rankings with 11,330 points, while Alcaraz has 8,600 points, giving Sinner a 2,730-point advantage. But that margin will shift dramatically depending on Sunday's championship match. If Sinner wins his first Wimbledon title, his lead will grow to 3,430 points. However, if Alcaraz claims his third consecutive Wimbledon crown, he will narrow the gap to 2,030 points.

The two-time defending champion Alcaraz came out aggressively, hitting with heavy pace into Sinner's forehand to rush the Italian. The World No. 2 also used the drop shot frequently and showed trademark resilience to rally from to 2-4, sealing the set with a backhand defensive block on the stretch after a brutal baseline exchange, where both players were pulled from side to side.
Sinner responded by breaking Alcaraz at the start of the second set and was the more consistent in the baseline exchanges, committing five fewer unforced errors (8-13). After levelling the match with a forehand winner, the Italian, showing more emotion than normal, let out a roar and turned to his box, where coaches Simone Vagnozzi and Darren Cahill rose to their feet.
Did You Know?
In the Open Era, Sinner and Alcaraz are the only Roland Garros final opponents to meet again in the same season's Wimbledon championship besides Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, who did it in three consecutive years from 2006 through 2008. Sinner and Alcaraz have split the past six majors.

Iga Swiatek is known for winning sets on clay 6-0. Now, she'll be remembered for doing so on grass—and on tennis' most famous piece of turf, no less.The 24-year-old won her first Wimbledon title on Saturday with a never-in-doubt, 6-0, 6-0 victory over an overwhelmed Amanda Anisimova. It is the first shutout Slam final since Steffi Graf's 6-0, 6-0 oblieration of Natasha Zvereva at Roland Garros in 1988.In doing so, Swiatek has put together one of the most impressive 6-0 marks in tennis history: six final-round wins at Grand Slams, against zero final-round defeats. (Carlos Alcaraz can match that feat on Sunday.)

The four-time Roland Garros champion looked like she was playing on the terre battue. Anisimova looked like she was playing in her first Grand Slam final.The 23-year-old American was tight as a drum on Centre Court. Errors flowed while Swiatek showed no pity. It combined for the first 6-0 set in a women's Wimbledon final since Martina Navratilova—watching from the Royal Box—in 1983.In that final, Andrea Jaeger managed a 6-3 second-set loss. But by the time Swiatek won her 17th consecutive game of the fortnight—she won her semifinal over Belinda Bencic, 6-2, 6-0—all the patrons were hoping was that Anisimova could simply get on the board.“Even her strengths aren't working right now,” said Chris Evert on ESPN.

Through the first 10 games, Anisimova earned a game point in just one.“This is difficult to watch,” said Evert.Trailing 6-0, 5-0, the emotions caught up to Anisimova on the changeover. She finished the 57-minute match with 28 unforced errors and just eight winners.After leaving the court to compose herself, she was as brilliant on the mic as Swiatek was on the court. She tearfully thanked her mother and made the most of what was still a career-best showing.“It's been an incredible fortnight for me,” said Anisimova to the supportive crowd. “Even though I ran out of gas a bit today, and I wished that I could have put on a better performance for all of you, you guys have still been there for me, and lifted me up today.”

As poorly as Anisimova played, credit of course must be given to Swiatek. From the onset, the Pole took control of the match, moving her opponent out of position and using her experience to her advantage.Swiatek is now tied with Monica Seles for the longest undefeated record in Grand Slam finals among women in the Open Era. (Roger Federer holds the best mark in tennis at 7-0.)“I feel like I'm already an experienced player, after winning the Slams before, but I never really expected this one,” said Swiatek, who had not won a title since Roland Garros in 2024. “I want to thank my team because I feel like they believed in me more than I did.“Walking around here, being on Centre Court for me, it felt like a huge pressure. This year I really, really enjoyed it.”

The 22-year-old playing for his third consecutive Wimbledon has so many admirable qualities, but they are all subordinate to joy.ByPeter BodoPublished Jul 13, 2025 copy_link

Among the many wonders we're likely to witness when top-ranked Jannik Sinner and defending champion Carlos Alcaraz mix it up on Centre Court in the Wimbledon final, the rarest is likely to be a demonstration of this thing called “joy.”The emotion, so commonly displayed in life, so rarely in tennis, seems to be at the very center of the 22-year-old Spaniard's being. Some would call it his superpower. Others might describe it as the secret sauce in his success, and the happiness he knows at a time when so many of his peers struggle with occupation-induced stress.Alcaraz is no stranger to the sting of defeat, or even the loneliness that is part and parcel of the itinerant life on tour. But he's never lost his capacity for experiencing delight.“I've been feeling down a lot of times on the tennis court, or on [at] the tournaments,” Alcaraz admitted after his second-round win at Wimbledon. “I'm just really happy to have found the right path again with such a good joy on the court.”

“I've been feeling down a lot of times on the tennis court, or on [at] the tournaments,” Alcaraz admitted after his second-round win at Wimbledon. “I'm just really happy to have found the right path again with such a good joy on the court.”

Alcaraz went on to explain that he tries not to focus on outcomes, but on the fundamental pleasure of playing the game—on “living in the moment” and “having fun.” Other players say such things, only to have those goals evaporate under live fire. Alcaraz described every match he gets at Wimbledon as a “gift.” Then he turns right around and presents it to the crowd. It's a remarkable, three-way transaction.A cynic might scoff at the idea that joy can be as effective a weapon as a killer drop shot or bazooka serve, but here's what British star Cam Norrie said after bowing to Alcaraz in the quarterfinals:Yeah, I think he makes it look quite easy because he's enjoying it so much. Cam NorrieAlcaraz is gunning for his third consecutive Wimbledon title, his sixth major overall. Sseeded No. 2 despite his 19-match winning streak on the world's most hallowed court, is one year and nine months younger than Sinner, but he already has two more major singles titles. Alcaraz also enjoys an 8-4 advantage in their series, and has swept their last five meetings—degree of mastery that is somewhat baffling given the spectacular recent arc of Sinner's career.Let's not assume that Sinner doesn't take as much pleasure out of his own accomplishments as Alcaraz does of his. But “joy “ is not synonymous with pleasure, or satisfaction. It's more spontaneous, more emotional than mental and, ultimately, it is more communicable—as the French crowd demonstrated a few weeks ago, as it helped Alcaraz overcome Sinner in the waning moments of their epic final at Roland Garros.“You were unbelievable,” Alcaraz told them when the smoke cleared. “You were insane for me. I mean, I just can't, can't thank you enough for the great support during the whole week, for today's match… For today's match, you were really, really important.”

An epic is just a click away.

Alcaraz's claim that joy is the special fuel powering his game has given people plenty to think about. It has been a strange Wimbledon in that regard, with a number of players stepping up to publicly contemplate the things missing in their lives.Alexander Zverev, the No. 3 seed, was shocked in the first round by Arthur Rinderknech, but afterward he suggested that his poor performance was based on general despondency. “I've never felt this empty before. Just lacking joy, just lacking joy in everything that I do.”Former Wimbledon finalist Matteo Berrettini found himself in similar straits. “I am really sorry for the people that helped me to get here and everybody that made it possible,” the Italian star said after he was upset in the first round. Berrettini felt ashamed of his lack of passion on court, explaining, “This is not the way that I wanted to be on court and enjoy out there. I just have to take some time and think about my future.”Compare that with the words Alcaraz spoke after he defeated Norrie:Every time, once I start to enjoy a match, to enjoy the moment, I think my level shows (goes) up. My good level shows up. I think today the key was that I didn't think about anything. I just enjoy every single second out there. Playing a quarterfinal at Wimbledon is a gift. Carlos AlcarazThe players all heard the words of those who have been struggling. To some, including Aryna Sabalenka, joy as personified by Alcaraz seems to have very little place in the hierarchy of desirable attributes and emotions. After losing to Amanda Anisimova in the semis, Sabalenka told reporters: “Losing sucks, you know? You always feel like you want to die, you don't want to exist anymore, and this is the end of your life.”That sentiment has always existed in the game, it has powered many a terrific career. It also represents a vision of play in which the premium is on characteristics like grit, tenacity, aggression, courage, determination, striving. It isn't like Alcaraz doesn't have some or all of those qualities. He has all of them, but they are all subordinate to joy.

Alcaraz's peers on both tours appear to think that he's onto something with this “joy” thing. It's funny how often the word “enjoy” popped up during interviews at Wimbledon.“I've been enjoying just this new feeling of being a bit more comfortable on grass,” Iga Swaitek said, just days before she won the singles title. “I'm kind of maybe thinking about it a bit more. Yeah, as you said, when you're playing well, it's easy to enjoy.”Teenage sensation Mirra Andreeva is not quite as expressive as Alcaraz, but early in the tournament she was asked about her ambitions and mindset. She explained: “Of course, I wanted to win a lot and to achieve great things, but then after I started to play on tour, I was just approaching every match with, you know, trying to enjoy the game. I think that's what brought me here. Every match that I've played since the beginning, I was just trying to win every point, just to run for every point, put as many balls on the court as I can—but the most important thing is to just have fun and enjoy.”It may sound a little yadda-yadda-yadda, but it's not. Tennis may not be joy-averse, but you can be a titan of the game without experiencing the kind of joy that Alcaraz talks about, the kind that often gets lost and discarded on the ladder of success. Somehow, Alcaraz has retained that almost child-like emotion that accompanies running, jumping, whacking a ball with a racquet.“Here at Wimbledon for me is a gift,” he said last week. “Every match that I'm playing is a gift. I'm trying to make the most of it, trying to enjoy [it] as much as I can. Sometimes it's really difficult, I know. And I accept it.”

	With Sunday (July 13) serving as 713 day, it's only right that Travis Scott and Cactus Jack dropped off the JACKBOYS 2 compilation album in an homage to La Flame's hometown of Houston. 


	The anticipated sequel hit streaming services on Sunday and JB2 finds fellow H-Town rap dignitary Bun B onboard as host, while the project boasts 17 tracks in total.

	











	Alongside Scott and Cactus Jack high-flyers like Sheck Wes, Don Toliver, Sofaygo and Wallie the Sensei, La Flame invites a star-studded cast of collaborators into the mix that includes GloRilla, Tyla, Vybz Kartel, 21 Savage, Kodak Black, SahBabii and Waka Flocka Flame.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Following several teasers, Travis set the tone for the project's rollout with the release of the thumping single “2000 Excursion” earlier this week, which saw a racing-themed visual hit YouTube but never received an official streaming service arrival.


	There's plenty of merchandise for Ragers to cop on La Flame‘s website, as Cactus Jack released various merchandise collections and CD/vinyl bundles featuring alternate cover arts to accompany JACKBOYS 2.


	The first JACKBOYS project arrived in December 2019 with appearances from the late Pop Smoke, Young Thug, Quavo, Offset, Rosalia and Lil Baby. The effort reached the summit when it debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.












	It's been a busy year for Scott, who headlined night two of Coachella in April and notched another No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 with “4×4” in February. He even completed another side quest when making WWE appearances at Elimination Chamber and WrestleMania.

Drake's Saturday performance served as a love letter to the U.K., which he considers to be the preeminent hip-hop country. 


													By
												

	Carl Lamarre



Drake‘s love letter to London reached its climax Saturday night (July 12) when he performed night 2 of his Wireless Festival 2025 takeover. His second outing of the weekend had a grittier tone as he sought to abandon the melodies that had fans swaying Friday night and return to his punishing ways.


	“London, tonight is different,” Drake warned. “All that sweetheart, singing s—? That s— is over tonight. This is for my motherf—ing dogs. I see my dogs came out tonight.”


	Drake's menacing methods were felt by fans early on, as he jumpstarted night 2 with “IDGAF” alongside Yeat. The 2023 For All The Dogs heater seared through Finsbury Park, with a crowd of 50,000 fans-deep rapping alongside The Boy. The vengeful MC didn't hold back, either. He tossed darts at LeBron and Kendrick while crowning the U.K. as the preeminent leader in hip-hop. With his Iceman single “What Did I Miss?” brewing in contention for a potential high debut on the Hot 100, Drake performed the song for the first time. Surprisingly, fans recited the lyrics with gusto despite the track being a mere week old.


	Aside from Drake returning to prime form, his altruism peeked through on several occasions: First, he brought out a slew of U.K. stars to share the stage with him, including Skepta, Central Cee and Dave. Then, he called in his friends from the States to join in on his overseas escapades.


	Read on to see what made Drake's night 2 at Wireless Festival 2025 one for the books.




	The Drake-LeBron saga continued Saturday when The Boy subtly tweaked the lyrics on “Nonstop” to shade his newfound foe, LeBron James. “How I go from 6 to 23, no LeBron,” Drake rapped, flipping the original line and further straining the once brotherly bond shared between both men. The change in lyrics comes after fans noticed Drake recently covered his LeBron tattoo and replaced it with new ink honoring reigning NBA MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.


	The residue from Kendrick and Drake's contentious 2024 matchup seeped over the Pond on Saturday when fans hurled expletives toward the pgLang MC. As “F— Kendrick” chants echoed through the crowd, Drake caught wind and urged his right-hand man Chubbs to “grab me a shot. I'll drink to that.”


	Drake has never shied away from sharing the spotlight. On night 2, he used the Wireless stage as a homecoming of sorts for some of the U.K.'s brightest names. As fans reveled in watching established acts like Skepta and Headie One take centerstage, the night's biggest roars came when Dave and Central Cee joined forces and raced through the high-speed hit “Sprinter.”


	Before Drake tagged in Skepta for a fiery rendition of “Shutdown,” The Boy made a bold proclamation against America. “Nobody can out-rap London — nobody,” he said. “No disrespect to America. No disrespect to my country. But, nobody can out-rap London rappers. This is the best, this is the highest level. This is what I aspire to be.”


	On Friday, Drake told the London crowd that he wanted to bring an OVO Fest-caliber performance during his three days at Wireless. On Saturday, he doubled down on those claims by bringing a bevy of guests ranging from Yeat to Latto and Sexyy Red to 21 Savage to prove that his Rolodex is still strong amid his feud with Kendrick Lamar.


	Drake admitted to lying about Saturday's set being strictly “for the dogs,” as he called on Latto and Sexyy Red to supply some feminine firepower. The femcees didn't disappoint, as they punched in a fistful of anthems, beginning with Latto. The self-proclaimed “Georgia Peach” sweetened the night with “Brokey” and “Big Mama.” Following her performance, Sexxy Red kept fans enthralled with her buoyant bounce, ripping through her trifecta of hits like “Pound Town,” “Get It Sexy,” and “SkeeYee.” Despite the testosterone-driven night, the women held court with their vivacious presence.


	Though Drake vowed to have an edgier persona on night 2, he still wanted to party. He didn't shortchange fans, as he performed “NOKIA” and “SOMEBODY LOVES ME” with PARTYNEXTDOOR following their night 1 soiree, leaving fans satiated and swaying.

International Box Office Editor/Senior Contributor


SUNDAY UPDATE, Refresh for latest…: Superman, the first movie in Peter Safran and James Gunn‘s revamped DC Studios Phase I, “Gods and Monsters,” has leaped to a $217M global opening. That's in line with the pre-weekend projection of at least $200M. Yesterday (see below), we increased that to the $210M+ range. 


	The majority of business came from domestic as the Gunn-directed Warner Bros tentpole experienced some (not unexpected) softness in parts of Asia, while in such European majors as Germany, France and Italy, Supes landed a 2nd place start as Jurassic World Rebirth tugged on his cape to retain No. 1 in the sophomore session.

	











	The international box office debut for Superman is estimated at $95M.




			Watch on Deadline		







	We will have more on Superman in just a bit. In the meantime, some hot takes on other titles in the marketplace: Universal/Amblin's Jurassic World Rebirth easily crossed $500M worldwide this weekend, only the fifth Hollywood title to the milestone so this year (and the second for Universal) with $529.5M through today. Also, Disney's Lilo & Stitch is now thisclose to becoming the first $1B movie of 2025 with $994.3M through today. 


	MORE…




PREVIOUS, SATURDAY: On Friday, Warner Bros/DC's Superman added another $21.5M from 78 international box office markets. That brings the offshore flying cume to $40M through Friday.

	











	Globally, with Friday's domestic count, the worldwide running total is $96.5M. While we still have Saturday and Sunday to come overseas, what's clear here is that domestic is leaning harder into this latest iteration of the Man of Steel.


	All told, the James Gunn-directed Superman is expected to reach $210M+ in its worldwide bow. This is slightly above where we had it before the weekend, and of course could shift given Sat/Sun play. While we can't exactly call it kryptonite, there are some areas where Superman is facing a challenge: Asia is soft, for example. Though this should not come as a surprise. We've previously noted that Korea is a depressed market and that Clark Kent was not expected to make an impact in China. 


	For the record, the UK opened on Friday with $3.6M, a clear No. 1 with a 66% share of the Top 5 films. This is above all comps. 


China, as noted, grossed $2.4M through Friday including sneaks. Superman is an unsurprising non-starter in the market. The ultimate full-run prediction there is just above $11M. As we know, it happens.


	In happier news, Spain opened on Friday to $1M at No. 1 as the biggest debut for Gunn and 7% higher than Justice League, 29% over Aquaman, 77% ahead of Wonder Woman and 106% above Thunderbolts.


Japan, which is anxiously awaiting the arrival of the next Demon Slayer movie next week, had a fantastic start with $781K, super-passing comps.


	The Top 5 through Friday are: Mexico ($3.8M), UK ($3.6M), Brazil ($3M), Australia ($2.5M) and France ($2.5M).


PREVIOUS, FRIDAY: DC/Warner Bros' Superman has begun zipping around the world, ringing up $40.3 million through Wednesday and Thursday in North America and 57 overseas markets. The split there is a record-making $22.5M in domestic previews Thursday night, while $17.8M has come from the international box office so far in the movie's first two days of offshore release.


	The global total to date does not include Friday's estimates for North America.


	The James Gunn-directed latest installment about the Man of Steel debuted in nine offshore markets on Wednesday, with another 48 markets joining Thursday. Today adds another 21, which takes the total number of international territories in release to 78.


	In terms of openings on Wednesday, France was a No. 1 start at $1.3M including previews and ahead of a long weekend for Bastille Day; the debut is 3% above Thunderbolts and also over the most recent Venom and Aquaman movies (+8%). The cume through Thursday is $1.8M.


Korea, which we continue to stress is a depressed market, started at $700,000 on Wednesday. That was good for No. 1 and ranked roughly on par with Guardians of the Galaxy, and ahead of Thunderbolts and Aquaman & the Lost Kingdom. Imax repped a strong 18% of the box office from 26 locations. The Korea cume through Friday, not reflected in the international and global totals above, is an estimated $1.7M.


Italy's Wednesday opening of $519K was a No. 1 start and roughly on par with Justice League as well as 2% bigger than Man of Steel, 51% ahead of Guardians the first, 97% bigger than Wonder Woman and 159% higher than Aquaman & The Lost Kingdom.


Indonesia had a $462K No. 1 start on Wednesday, ranking No. 1 with results on par with Thunderbolts and ahead of GOTG1 & 2, Man of Steel, The Batman and Top Gun: Maverick.


	The Philippines on Wednesday saw Supes dominate at No. 1 with a 78% market share. The opening day of $386K was 22% above the most recent Mission: Impossible, 29% ahead of Aquaman & The Lost Kingdom, 31% higher than Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.


	On Thursday, some heavy-hitters chimed in. To wit: Mexico debuted at No. 1 with $2.2M. This is the 2nd biggest opening day for a DC movie ever and is roughly on par with The Batman.

	











Australia bowed to $1.3M at No. 1 and claimed the best opening day of 2025 to date. The launch is on par with Aquaman & The Lost Kingdom, 10% over The Batman, 13% ahead of Man of Steel, 56% bigger than Guardians 3.


	Super DC market Brazil came in with a strong No. 1 start for Superman on Thursday of $2M — the biggest opening day ever for James Gunn. The launch day was bigger than all Guardians movies as well as Joker and The Batman, notably. 


	In the UAE, the David Corenswet/Rachel Brosnahan/Nicholas Hoult-starrer ranked No. 1 accounting for half of the total market. Opening day results are roughly on par with The Batman and higher than Aquaman and the Mission movies


	In Thailand, Superman dominated at No. 1 on Thursday with 58% share at $631K.


	The Top 5 through Thursday are: Mexico ($2.2M), Brazil ($2M), France ($1.8M), Australia ($1.3M) and Korea ($1.1M).


China, where we have already estimated this is not going to move the needle, opened today to $2.4M.


	We'll have more during the weekend…

Great movie. Great message. They made an entertaining movie that really focused on the goodness of our hero and the struggles he faces daily as an honest caring meta human. Lex was fantastic as were Jimmy and Lois. Just an altogether phenomenal movie.

All that promotion and discourse for a 210-220 million worldwide opening weekend? Man of steel made 670 back in 2013 without the current inflation. It looks like Superman will make less than that especially with F4 releasing in two weeks. Non-Americans apparently don't like this characters very much, they probably think he's bland, boring and overpowered. 650 million final gross seems possible but it's not a great number for the most famous superhero character. No matter how many times they reboot the franchise, the results will always be lukewarm as it seems. Gloomy Batman made 770 two years ago because Batman is a much stronger IP than Superman.

Superman is not the most famous super hero character its Spidey.

This is going to make less than MoS, alarming.

I am so glad they got rid of the Snyderverse.  These new movies are so successful!

“successful”?!?!?!?!?

What are you even talking about?

It's barely going to eke out a (domestic) opening that's around what Man of Steel did THIRTEEN years ago with fewer premium screens and lower ticket prices.
(translation : Man of Steel sold more tickets. More people watched Man of Steel)

And it will be lucky to do what Man of Steel did internationally, as well as have an overall gross that it did.

Worldwide movies are not watched as they were before covid for example it took me 20 minutes to get to the nearest cinema and the ticket price especially for half price allowed me to at least watch 2 movies per visit bbecause of that never missed any movie I was curious b

100000 percent accurate analysis.

In today boxoffice world… with all factors such as post-pandemicnormals, as was previously mentioned, and the superhero burn-out that many people claim… This movie is hitting it so far out of the park that it borders on unbelievable.

You can't compare the market of 13 years ago to post-pandemic market. Less people go to comic book movies now a days than they use to. Even an excellent movie like Thunderbolts struggled to make money this summer.Unlike Man of Steel, the new Superman movie is a hit with critics and audience. If it makes over 500 million, the studio would be happy. It would be a solid start for the DC universe.

ALL OF A SUDDEN THE STUDIO WILL BE HAPPY WITH 500 GIVE ME A BREAK LMAO. THEY WERE HOPING 700+. 500 MILLION THEY WILL LIE AND SAY IT WAS WHAT THEY WERE EXPECTING.

Is your caps lock broken? Why are you screaming?

Superman Returns was pretty much DOA in overseas markets. Man of Steel faired better but wasn't exactly a home run either. Superman seems to be a tough sell in foreign markets. This film really needs to take off stateside to stand a chance. Will be seeing this week so can't comment on the quality but it looks
Like it was made with passion for the source material.

UPDATE EARLY SUNDAY: Refresh for more updates  Warners is reporting Superman this morning at a $122M opening, but this Man of Steel is higher per rivals in the $124M-$125M range. Splitting the difference is $123M. Saturday per Warner Bros and as we told was $37.7M, -33%, for the James Gunn directed movie. 


	Warners believes Sunday is -25% from Saturday with $28.2M while rivals believe that there's an even bluer sky for Kal-El around $30M. 


	Warner Bros execs have every reason to be doing the Krypto doggie dance this morning as it's the studio's second $100M-plus opening this year after A Minecraft Movie ($162M). Technically, Warners owns the No. 1 and No. 3 biggest openings of the year currently. Warners owns six No. 1 openings YTD. It's also DC Studios co-head Peter Safran's biggest opening ever at the box office (ahead of Aquaman‘s $67.8M), the second-best opening for a Superman movie overall behind Batman v. Superman ($166M), the best opening for a Superman first franchise installment ahead of Man of Steel ($116.6M reported 3-day), and the second best opening, as we said all along, for Gunn behind Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 ($146.5M).

	











	Talk about pressure. DC Studios in their new chapter bet on their co-studio Boss, Gunn, to tee them off. What if Superman didn't work? Then the whole house of cards falls down, right? But there's another way of thinking: Let's talk about the risk involved had DC Studios not tapped Gunn to direct Superman. He's arguably one of the best superhero filmmakers out there right now, and a visionary who can steer between art and commerce. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	In regards to how Warners and DC overcame the cynics, who were out there from the onset of the first trailer. Studio sources say that they always knew coming off recent broken DC movies, there would be an uphill battle to convince audiences and be open to the new DC and Superman. It was going to take more than a 2 1/2 minute piece to get people off their couches. Clearly in the first trailer, the story wasn't going to be fully told. Too soon. It was a feel piece, all tone and feel with no dialogue. Every beat of the campaign was planned and calculated until this weekend which culminated in a great orchestral swell of social sentiment, audience scores and critical reviews. 


	EntTelligence reports 7.7 million admissions this weekend for Superman off an average ticket price of $15.77 and average PLF ticket price of $18.95. 


	Wait, weren't some source expecting Superman to go hog wild after the $22M previews with a $140M-$150M opening? Is MAGA to blame? Is Gunn's “immigrant” comments to blame? It's my understanding, not at all, because the red county zones for this type of movie aren't underperforming (more on that soon), rather they're churning out the average amount of cash for a PG-13 family adventures movie. At $120M+, this is the ceiling for a standalone Superman movie when he's not fighting Batman in the desolate remains of Gotham.


Superman‘s legs aren't that different from Man of Steel‘s, but that's only for each movie's first three days (Thursday-Saturday), read the Zack Snyder movie between its $12M previews and Friday did…$56M. Its Saturday fell -35% for $36M [And as we told you further down, Matt Reeves' The Batman eased -24% between its Friday/previews and Saturday]. Back in the whip and buggy days of 2013, Warners didn't combine previews into Friday, rather they rolled into the weekend (Man of Steel doing a $116.6M 3-day and $128.6M running cume). Sunday held like a miraculous rock for Man of Steel earning $36.2M, even with Saturday. When does that ever happen? Why did it happen? It was Fathers Day. 


	AMC Burbank remains the highest grossing single-location gross for Gunn's Man of Steel at $261.2K.


	The top ten theater locations for Superman were 1. AMC Burbank, 2. AMC Lincoln Square New York, 3. Regal Irvine Spectrum Los Angeles, 4. AMC Empire New York, 5. AMC Disney Springs Orlando, 6. Regal Edwards Marq'E Houston, 7. AMC Universal Citywalk Los Angeles, 8. AMC Garden State New York, 9. Regal Kendall Village Miami, and 10. Regal Atlantic Station Atlanta.


	The top ten markets were 1. Los Angeles, 2. New York, 3. Dallas, 4. Chicago, 5. San Francisco, 6. Houston, 7. Washington DC, 8. Toronto, 9. Atlanta, and 10. Philadelphia.


	Comscore and Paul Dergarabedian report that this weekend is coming in at $200M, +59% from the same weekend a year ago. The summer box office is clicking at $2.35 billion, currently a post Covid best, +17% over last year's first Friday in May through July 13. Still, the summer lags behind 2019 pre Covid by -14%. Overall box office year for Jan. 1 through July 13 stands at $4.7 billion, +15% ahead of the same frame a year ago, but -24% behind pre-Covid 2019 (which at this point in time stood at $6.2 billion).

UPDATED SATURDAY AM:  Warner Bros/DC Studios' Superman after a $56.5M first day/previews is now looking at $115M-$121M opening. Many rivals believe that's on the high-end. 


	For a first superhero movie in a franchise with excellent scores at a time when the fanboy audience can toss these comic book movies away like tissues, you can get down on your knees and thank the almighty for that opening. Very good start here for a movie where there was cynicism early on about the trailer (more on that in a bit). Superman is able to leap tall buildings in a single bound in a way that the Marvel Cinematic Universe' Thunderbolts* ($74.3M) and Captain America: Brave New World ($88.8M) haven't. 


	Also, it's another great start for the summer box office, the second $100M+ opening after Lilo & Stitch‘s $146M. Superman cost before P&A $225M net. Zack Snyder's Man of Steel opened to $116.6M back in 2013, unadjusted for inflation. 


	In terms of walk-up business, 49% told Comscore/Screen Engine's PostTrak that they bought their tickets same day, a prized number. Compare this to 41% who bought their tickets on the first Friday of Deadpool & Wolverine and the 57% who bought their tickets on day one for A Minecraft Movie. 


	What's great about Superman: it has excellent audience exits of A- CinemaScore, 74% definite recommend and 86% positive on Comscore/Screen Engine's PostTrak. Solid A CinemaScores from the Under 24 set including kids. If it was just all beefcake grosses and so-so audience sentiment, there would be pause for concern. That's what happened with Batman v Superman. Despite holding the record for the biggest U.S./Canada opening for a DC movie at $166M stateside, that B CinemaScore was a tell-tale sign that audiences weren't entirely in love with the dark dwellings of the Snyderverse. 


Superman‘s A- CinemaScore is the same as Snyder's Man of Steel (A-) and ahead of Bryan Singer's Superman Returns (B+), and the Christopher Reeves 1987 bomb, Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (C). 

	











	On the high end, Superman is poised to rank second among Gunn's domestic openings behind Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 ($146.5M). Gunn's Man of Steel is playing evenly throughout the country with overindexed business in West, South and East. AMC Burbank is currently the highest grossing venue stateside with close to $170K. PLFs and Imax are driving 42% of the box office.  The 7:15pm Imax show at the Mann's Chinese Theatre last night was close to sold out with many sitting through the credits and some cheering. 


	Solid diversity demos here on Superman with 26% Latino and Hispanic, 19% Black, 9% Asian American and 41% Caucasian. Demo-wise, it looks like a fanboy film with exits similar to Deadpool & Wolverine even though that's a R-rated title. Male/female is 68%/32% (D&W was 63%/37%) with 66% under 35 (the same turnout as D&W). Demo quads in order are Men over 25 (43%, 87% grade), men under 25 (25%, 90% grade), women over 25 (19%, 81% grade) and women under 25 (13%, 90% grade). Biggest quad was 18-24 at 31%, which was the same exact percent as Deadpool & Wolverine. 


	Reasons why people went on PostTrak: 49% said it looked fun and entertaining, 43% said it's because it was a superhero movie, while 40% say it's part of a franchise they like, with David Corenswet, Rachel Brosnahan, Nicholas Hoult and the cast overallcoming in at 26%. 


	Most influential marketing materials per PostTrak were social media (20%), in-theater trailer (15%), online trailer (13%), friends and family (12%). 


	Forever and a day from the time the first Superman trailer dropped in December through CinemaCon, some were put off by what they saw, whether it was the over-sentiment with the dog (sorry, but Krypto is one of the best parts of the movie), the robots, whatever. The point is that clearly a lot was kept out of the trailer, and that's a selling point sometimes on these Gunn movies or for any superhero movie. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 in its trailers seemed to convey that nothing great would be going on, that it was more of the same, but then when one sat down in the theater, there was the Eureka that the sequel was significantly more in its fresh thread about Peter Quill and his father. Sometimes movie marketing has to risk it and keep their powder dry, with the actual film in the end being the biggest selling point, evident here in the great reviews at 82% and 94% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.  


	Overall second weekend of July is coming in at $197M for all titles, the best ever for the frame post Covid. That's 60% ahead of a year ago when Despicable Me 4 posted a second weekend of $43.5M, and it's +40% ahead of 2023 which was the frame's previous high mark post pandemic with $140M for all titles.

UPDATED FRIDAY MIDDAY: Warner Bros/DC Studios' Superman is looking at a great $55M first day, including all those $22.5M previews. This puts the James Gunn directed movie on course as of this minute for a $115M+ 3-day. The weekend is still young, and there's room for upside. Some are spotting $120M. 


	Is the MAGA sentiment hurting this movie? The notion is ‘No'. According to box office stat org EntTelligence, red county theaters average 33% of the weekend box office for PG-13 family adventure movies, while blue counties average 61%. Superman‘s presales through Wednesday saw 60% of its business from blue county theaters, and 34% from red county venues. Meaning, business is right in line for the movie in regards to where it's suppose to be grossing; there's no sour sentiment. Also, non-frequent moviegoers don't make their ticket purchase decisions based on a director and his opinions. EntTelligence is currently seeing 44% percent of the Peter Safran-Gunn production coming from population centers with over a million people (the norm is 44%). That's a very good sign.  


	With the major studios crying over fewer moviegoers watching their trailers, here's some great news: EntTelligence reports that the in-theater run of the Superman trailer reached 95.7M moviegoers, aided by prominent placement on Warner Bros/Legendary's A Minecraft Movie. Kudos to Warners for running a great in-theater marketing campaign. 


	The comps of it all: Matt Reeves' The Batman posted a $56.6M first day/previews and eased -24% for $43.2M on Saturday turning into a $134M 3-day. Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 posted a $56M first day/previews, dipped -9% on Saturday for a $146.5M 3-day. Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 posted a $48.1M first day/previews, -19% Saturday decline with $38.8M for a 3-day of $118.4M. 


	Wait, didn't you write $140M-$150M? Yes, sources get excited by big numbers. Here in L.A., you can forget about getting a good seat at the 7PM AMC Citywalk Imax. Premium seats are selling out.


	How the rest of the weekend is shaking out:


	1.) Superman (WB) 4,135 theaters, Fri $55M, 3-day $115M-$120M/Wk 1


	2.) Jurassic World Rebirth (Uni) 4,324 theaters, Fri $10.8M, 3-day $37M (-60%), Total $229.1M/Wk 2


	3.) F1 (WB) 3,412 theaters, Fri $3M 3-day $10.7M (-58%), Total $133.8M/Wk 3 


	4.) How to Train Your Dragon (Uni) 3,280 theaters, Fri $1.7M 3-day $5.7M (-49%), Total $237.7M/Wk 5


	5.) Elio (Dis) 2,730 theaters, Fri $950K, 3-day $3.1M (-46%), Total $62.8M/Wk 4


UPDATED FRIDAY AM AFTER EXCLUSIVE: Warner Bros is seeing $22.5M all in for previews for James Gunn's Superman. Not only is that still the best previews YTD and a record for James Gunn, but it's higher than the previews for 2023's Barbie ($22.3M, 3-day $162M) and ahead of all the previews for Matt Reeves' The Batman ($21.6M, $134M opening in 2022).


	What do audiences think? It's a 78% definite recommend on PostTrak for general audiences — you can take that to the bank, seriously. Five stars from kids under 12 and parents. Superman is flying around everywhere.


	Will President Donald Trump's meme posted on the White House X handle be Kryptonite to business in addition to the snarks from right-wingers on Fox News? Not a chance, insiders say. Get out of the way, here comes Superman.

Gunn told the Sunday Times last week: “I mean, Superman is the story of America … an immigrant that came from other places and populated the country. But for me it is mostly a story that says basic human kindness is a value and is something we have lost.”

	The statement was a reflection of the current aggressive immigration policies set forth by Trump. The filmmaker and co-DC Studios Boss in his chat with the Sunday Times isn't losing sleep over any criticism.


	“Yes, it plays differently,” Gunn said. “But it's about human kindness, and obviously there will be jerks out there who are just not kind and will take it as offensive just because it is about kindness. But screw them.”


	During an episode of Fox's table talk The Five this week, Republican operative Kellyanne Conway said: “We don't go to the movie theater to be lectured to and have someone throw their ideology on to us. I wonder if it will be successful.”

	Yes, Ms. Conway, the movie will be extremely successful. At this level, industry projections have raised to $140M-$150M+ for the weekend. As we told you, Thursday night's previews include the Tuesday Amazon Prime Members shows, which collected $2.8M.


	It's gonna be a fun weekend, and Warner Bros, you've done it again with an overperformance streak that includes A Minecraft Movie ($162.7M), Sinners ($48M), Final Destination Bloodlines ($51.6M), F1 ($57M) and now Superman. Weekend 28, the second weekend of July last year, brought in $123M with the second frame of Despicable Me 4. The marketplace is going to boom past that easily.

	2.)  F1 (Apple/WB) 3,732 theaters, Thu $2.5M (-34%), Wk $39.66M (-52%), Total $123.1M/Wk 2

EXCLUSIVE: Count gravitational pull as a superpower for James Gunn's Superman as the first movie under the filmmaker's DC Studios, which he co-runs with Peter Safran, is heading to a massive $21M+ in overall previews, sources tell us tonight.


	Oh, and audiences love it at 95% on Rotten Tomatoes. Gunn and Safran and all of Warner Bros can rest easy after the cynics' snarking over the first trailer back in December. That's the best RT audience score ever for a Superman movie, even better than Richard Donner's 1978 original (86%). Take that, trolls.


Superman‘s preview figure includes Tuesday night's Amazon Prime members screenings cash of $2.8M, plus monies from showtimes which began today at 2 p.m.

	Lots of records flying around here for the first title in DC's Phase One “Gods and Monsters”: First, Superman‘s previews rep a record for a James Gunn-directed film, besting Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3‘s $17.5M ($118.4M 3-day in 2023). It's also the best damn previews we've seen all year, ahead of Disney's Lilo & Stitch ($14.5M, $146M 3-day opening) and Captain America: Brave New World ($12M, $88.8M 3-day).


	While Warners was hoping for a $100M 3-day start and tracking and exhibition were spotting $115M-$130M, Superman, looks to be leaving all those projections in the dust. The IP has been done several times through history — not just on the big screen but going back to radio with several iterations on TV including the first 1950s George Reeves black-and-white show. So what's the deciding factor for non-frequent moviegoers to discover this superhero on the big screen again? Why, reviews. This Superman stands at 82% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, the second-best reviewed Superman ever after Richard Donner's 1978 original, which stands at 86%.


RELATED: ‘Superman' Review: James Gunn's Lively Reboot Takes The OG Superhero And His Dog On A Mission For A Kinder World


	Other intriguing benchmarks: Gunn's Superman is easily ahead of the preview box office of Zack Snyder's 2013 Man of Steel ($9M, 10 p.m. start time, different era for previews, which turned into a $116.6M opening). There's also a shot when we wake up tomorrow morning it could be higher than Matt Reeves' The Batman from 2022, which did $21.6M in overall previews (including $4M Tuesday shows and Thursday showtimes that began at 3PM; $134M opening). Gunn's Superman is close to the sun as far preview records go for Superman movies overall, but hasn't surpassed it (and that's not a bad thing), meaning 2016's Batman v. Superman holds the record for the best previews ever for a Superman movie with $27.7M ($166M 3-day).


	Social media analytics firm RelishMix has noticed positive word of mouth leading up to opening with a massive social media universe across YouTube, TikTok, X, Instagram and Facebook of 953.8 million, +20% of superhero genre pics' reach before their openings. That reach buries that of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (709.7M) and The Batman (631.7M), Joker Folie à Deux (567M), and it's not far from Deadpool & Wolverine (1.15 billion).


RELATED: James Gunn “Didn't Feel Guilt At All” Leaving MCU To Direct For DC


	Says RelishMix: “The exuberant tone and dedication to the characters is winning many fans over, i.e. ‘A comic book movie that's not ashamed to be a comic book is something we desperately needed,' and, ‘The trailers we've gotten for this movie have given me the warm fuzzy feelings…this Superman feels right.' After his widely popular Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy for Marvel, James Gunn in the director chair is inspiring a lot of confidence: ‘Mr. James Gunn is going to do us DC fans right for once.' The nostalgia is strong with this film, capturing the heart of the original 1978 film, ‘His look reminds me of Reeves Superman,' and, ‘The actors are great. And the theme music a remix of the old theme. Take my money now.'”


	These numbers do not come from Warners and by tomorrow business could be higher.

If it makes 550-mil it would be a single to borrow baseball terminology it seems well liked and reviewed generally which means it'll bolster future releases. I'd put the over/under at 700 mill though

Good opening considering it's difficult to get $100M openings in post-pandemic, post strikes times. Not a flop,the marketing expenses are covered by tie-ins presales, and ads running at WB properties.
 As long as they get 2.5 rule they'll cover the marketing costs contrary to what the anonymous anti-movies troll say. 

 However, this is far from being a Barbie level hit. No way he numbers needed to justify the blank check and total control of the DC to a director with mediocre box office outside Guardian of the Galaxy. None of his DC directed projects are box office successes. 

Did any of you guys pay attention to the movies that held best this weekend? Elio, HTTYD, Lilo & Stitch. Despite all the marketing on Krypto, the light-hearted approach and all the bright colors, families didn't find Superman appealing. This is a WW trend as according to Nancy Tartaglione article the movie was number 2 in Europe to Jurassic Park Rebirth, and the LATAM numbers are just okay. Latin markets are crucial to Disney and Universal family oriented properties; Lilo & Stich, How to train your dragon, IO2, Mario. If the markets that are crucial for family entertainment are not delivering for Gunn,then his DCU univerae isn't an improvement over Snider. Aquaman was a billion dollar film, Wonder woman managed to get some women in the seats. Replacing snydert was a good idea, but getting rid of the actors to give full control to a director that is too crass for families…not so much.

Keep James Gunn away from Batman. He didn't earn the right to cast a new one with these results. Bring Robert Pattinson back and give priority to The Batman sequel.

Congrats to Meh of Steel.

A- cinemascore. 

The narcissism of individual haters is astounding.

Im dying lmao what happened to everyone saying it was making 1 billion at the box office. Now they are happy it making below 600 i cant lmao.

Who is “everyone”? There were a lot of people here saying its ceiling was 600 million.  Not everyone had unrealistic expectations.

It doesn't change the fact that this movie was not good.  Superman and F1 are hyped-machined in our brains but at the end of the day these movies should be better.  The original Reeve Superman is still the best – by far!

Andy Samberg fondly remembered his late Brooklyn Nine-Nine costar Andre Braugher, reflecting on their time together on the two-time Emmy-winning sitcom and how the show has endured for audiences since its conclusion in 2021.


	During a recent episode of Good Hang with Amy Poehler, the Saturday Night Live alum discussed seeking Poehler's advice on taking the lead role in the Mike Schur and Dan Goor-created series about a Brooklyn-based precinct, as the writers were also behind her Parks and Recreation. Samberg said he didn't realize how well-known and beloved the show was until a family trip to Europe a couple years ago resulted in him getting recognized everywhere.

	“It's a gift that keeps giving,” the Palm Springs star said. “Because of the Netflix part of it, everywhere I went, it was like, ‘Jake Peralta!' I felt like I was on Friends. I was like, ‘Oh my God, the show is actually really big and people really watch it.' And kids love it and families watch it together, which was such a part of my experience growing up, was watching good quality sitcoms together as a family. And just being able to think that I did something that is that for people is really gratifying. And it was amazing, like I'm still really close with everyone I worked with there and loved it so much.”

	Poehler then brought up Braugher, whom she described as a “poised … playful and fun” performer, and Samberg emphatically agreed, adding, “And just a good person. Like so deeply moral and kind and pleasant and smart. We all absolutely loved him. I miss him a lot. Our dynamic worked immediately. It was like one of those things where you're just like, ‘This is kismet. I don't know how to explain it.'”


	He continued, describing their first table read together: “From that moment forward, the only thing me and him had to even talk about creatively was in the beginning he didn't trust himself to do comedy because he came so strictly from drama and Juilliard and five or six times we would do a more serious topic on the show and he would flip that switch and everyone would be like, ‘Oh my God, what is Andre doing here? He's so good.'”

	











	A venerated actor, the two-time Emmy-winning Braugher died in December 2023 at the age of 61 from lung cancer. Outside of his fan-favorite role as the stoic yet playful leader Captain Ray Holt, he starred in series Homicide: Life On The Street, The Good Fight, Men of a Certain Age and Thief, as well as films Salt, Passengers, Glory and Primal Fear. The Juilliard-trained actor was also a prolific stage performer.

From Frank Pembleton to Captain Holt, Andre was always gold.

Nine! Nine!

I don't mean to take from his extensive career of well received roles when I say that Braugher was the heart of Brooklyn 99, the best straight man in TV comedy. 

Sincerely,
Raymond Holt

he is so missed 😢

I really appreciated Andy Samberg's heartfelt tribute to Andre Braugher. Their chemistry on ‘Brooklyn Nine-Nine' was truly special, and it's touching to see how much their friendship meant to him. Such a great show!

B99 is comedy gold. It's my go to when I need a good laugh to relax. I actually cried when it was over. Andre Braugher was a beacon of light. RIP 👑 🕊️😢

I sometimes scour YouTube for clips and the Capt Holtz compilations are some of the best☺️😂😎

Gone way too soon, but I'm grateful he left us so many incredible performances to remember him by.

Well said☺️😎

Ariel Winter recently opened up about the traumatic experience of being preyed upon by older men as a child actress in Hollywood.


	The Modern Family alumna discussed her experience while promoting the YouTube true crime docuseries SOSA Undercover in which she appears; the online show follows members of the Safe from Online Sex Abuse nonprofit organization as they work with law enforcement to uncover and apprehend perpetrators of sexual abuse and sex trafficking.


	“I am familiar with male predators because I worked in Hollywood at a young age, I started at age 4,” she told the U.K.'s Daily Mail.

	She continued, “I don't wanna say too much about it, but by the time I was on a laptop and cell phone, I was getting inappropriate messages from older men, and it caused trauma.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	As a result, Winter said she sought professional help: “The experiences I had in person and online as a child have affected me so deeply that I've had to go to therapy for it. The movie and TV industry is a dark place.”


	Winter first rose to fame portraying brainiac middle child Alex Dunphy in the popular ABC mockumentary-style sitcom about a chaotic yet loving extended family, a part she landed at just 11 years old. Her experience unfortunately echoes what many young starlets have detailed about their time growing up in the public eye of the entertainment industry, including Jenna Ortega, who shared last year that she left social media after being sent explicit content as a young girl.


	Previously, Winter also discussed the relentless body-shaming she faced while going through her teen years on camera: “That was a major part of my teenage years,” she told People in part. “It was just everywhere. It was every headline I read about myself, like, grown people writing articles about me saying how I looked terrible or pregnant or like a fat slut. I mean, I was 14. It totally damaged my self-esteem.”

Emily Deschanel recalled struggling emotionally and professionally while filming the first season of Fox‘s Bones, to the point where she got a talking-to about her lack of preparedness.


	In a recent episode of podcast Fail Better with host David Duchovny, who once directed an episode of the police procedural, Deschanel opened up about the pain point and how her diagnosis of ADHD and dyslexia as a child affected her career later on. 


	“We were working insane hours, longer than just a normal series,” Deschanel began. “You're working 14- to 16-hour days, and then I had to memorize the lines. So I'd be staying up late night memorizing lines. I would joke that I would go home and just cry in a bathtub every night because I was just so overwhelmed.”

	She continued, “I'd come to set and I would be trying to remember the lines that — I got no sleep and trying to remember the lines that I had memorized the night before and then I had them in my head and couldn't remember them.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Deschanel said moments like that would result in “tunnel vision” and feel “exposing” in front of crew members and other peers who were dependent on her performance to get through shoot days.


	“I didn't know I was having panic attacks, but I was basically having panic attacks at the time,” she recalled.


	And when Deschanel was once 30 minutes late to work because of an accident on her commute, series creator Hart Hanson was forced to deliver a harsh message from his superiors.

	











	“Hart knocked on my trailer door, which was not a usual thing, he wasn't knocking on my door often,” she remembered, chuckling ruefully. “He took me aside and said, ‘The studio has concerns about your work.' They said that I was late and unprepared. And that to me — I get emotional just thinking about it now because it was probably shame [that I was feeling].”


	Continuing tearfully, she said, “I mean, I was a wreck … I took it so hard, and I was such a fragile person at the time. I got hardened up doing that show for so long. I was not sleeping, I was so stressed out. I was already, I'm an emotional person, so I was just beside myself.”


	However, Deschanel said the moment served as a wake-up call of sorts in that she was never late to set again. The following day Bones was also picked up for more episodes, with the eventual tally for the 12-season series comprising 246 episodes from 2005 through 2017. 


	Deschanel added that she was able to get through the long-running series after Hanson offered her practical “support,” such as by getting someone to run lines with her and a bigger trailer to match costar David Boreanaz's.


	“Hart helped me find ways to be better, get my job done in terms of learning my lines and remembering them, and a lot of it was having downtime or having some scene that I'm not in, et cetera. He's just a good one. We were so lucky,” she concluded.


	Loosely based on the life and novels of forensic anthropologist Kathy Reichs, a producer on the show, each episode of Bones unpacks an FBI case file surrounding the mystery of human remains, as well as the personal lives of its central characters. The show garnered two Emmy nods throughout its run.

I recently just finished binging the entire series of Bones again. It was such an amazing show. Emily Deschanel should be proud of the work she did. As a retired Special Education teacher, I give her kudos for sticking with the job. Having Dyslexia & ADHD would be difficult in any profession, but having to spend hours and hours just memorizing lines must have been traumatic for her. No winder she had so many anxiety attacks! I am horrified that she was disciplined because she was late due to an accident on her commute, which was not her fault. However, I am happy that Hart Hanson eventually assisted her in ways to help with the anxiety and making her life easier. Bones was an amazing series and with the talk of a possible reunion, I would love to see that come to fruition.

I have recently been looking at Bones again and still enjoy it greatly,  I think Emily and the entire Cast should be very proud of what they achieved on this Series as it can't have been easy to do day after day.

I agree. Bones is my “comfort”, go-to series. Sometimes I just let it play in the background while I work.

She was late once because of an accident?  Please.  Sounds like they were harassing her. That cast did amazing work.  Obviously.  It wss a major success because of them.  Enjoyed it immensly.

Try working that hard for 20 bucks or less an hour.

					By Damon Wise 

Film Editor, Awards


	The shadow of the Maysles brothers looms large over the surprise winner of the 59th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, a documentary that can't help but summon up the spirit of the duo's 1975 masterpiece Grey Gardens. That film told the story of two women living in squalor in the New York residence of the same name, revealing that they are not only mother and daughter but a part of the extended Kennedy family, aunt and cousin to JFK's glamorous wife Jackie. Directed by Slovakia's Miro Remo, Better Go Mad In The Wild makes Grey Gardens itself — the property, not the film — look like Mar-a-Lago by comparison, but it makes a similar case for not judging people by looks alone.

					'Don't Call Me Mama' Review: Pia Tjelta Stands Out In A Surprisingly Subversive Norwegian Immigrant Drama - Karlovy Vary Film Festival		
			








	It's more likely, however, that Remo was inspired by Dušan Hanák's Pictures of the Old World, a similarly influential doc made in 1972 and banned in the former Czechoslovakia until 1988. Hanák's film upset the authorities for seeming to show the impoverishing effects of living under Communism, a big propaganda no-no at the time. Nowadays, though, it can be seen for what it actually is: a sympathetic study of a rural generation that was left behind in the late 20th century, provincial postwar people that took their meager goods to city markets seemingly unaware that the '60s had ever happened, never mind the '50s.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Remo's film exists somewhere in between these two movies. Its subject is František Klišík and Ondřej Klišík,  a pair of grizzled, heavily bearded 60-ish twins who live in Sumava, a part of the Czech Republic known as the Bohemian Forest. Bohemian does not begin to describe the brothers, one of whom has a picture of the Dalai Lama in their kitchen, or the film, which is narrated by a philosophical bull called Nandy. Even their home is an unconventional space; after a brief heyday in which the brothers brought back women, it was split into two with a makeshift wall. The women stopped coming, but the wall remains.


	In the meantime, it seems, the two men have made a decision to drop out of society and therefore time, living like a warring but loving married couple in a remote, crumbling farmhouse. But these are not two feral outsiders: as their conversations show; they talk about life and poetry in unusually sophisticated ways, despite their frequent drunkenness and their gleefully filthy hands-on approach to working the land. Nandy the bull gives the game away, revealing that the siblings, embarrassed after flunking school, became voracious autodidacts. Not only that, it turns out they were major players in the Velvet Revolution of 1989, producing anti-regime pamphlets for the Movement For Civil Liberty.

	











	Remo's film gives out this information sparingly, with the unfortunate effect that the film becomes a little wearing; if you're expecting to see more expository backstory after this big reveal, all you're actually going to get is a couple of mutinous old men living their authentic lives, no matter what. This can be fun at times; one brother, sauntering naked down a country road (there's a fair bit of crumbly nudity), waves happily to a passing train then later rails against moles — moles! — for the crime of being “black, hairy, blind bastards”. The interstitial bickering, though, can become wearing, and when even Nandy notes that “the heat of their cabin fever is becoming too much to endure”, it starts to feel labored.


	Though they do open up to the cameras, the brothers are never, ever put on the spot, and the film focuses more on their charming eccentricity than the nuts and bolts of their lives and how they can afford to live it. It's an interesting trade. On the plus side, you get to men covered in cabbages, and having their beards enthusiastically sucked by a cow. On the downside — apart from a certain kind of countryside practicality about killing animals that definitely won't make it this year's The Truffle Hunters — there's a feeling that something altogether more profound could have been articulated here. “Separating twins is like breaking a mirror,” muses Nandy, and the claustrophobic closeness of the Klišíks would have benefited from just a little more interrogation of that fascinating thought.

After 55 years, numerous albums, and that weird period where society was forced to reckon with the memory of both ELO and ELO Part II, the band originally known as the Electric Light Orchestra—and billed in more recent years as “Jeff Lynne's ELO”—has apparently played its final show. And not the final show that was previously expected: Lynne revealed today that, due to his suffering from a “systemic infection,” the concert that was supposed to be the band's farewell show, scheduled for Saturday in London's Hyde Park, has been canceled, and will not be rescheduled.

Which means, per Consequence, that ELO actually had its final show back on Wednesday, at a Manchester show that the 77-year-old Lynne apparently “struggled to get through.” A statement provided to press said that Lynne “is currently in the care of a team of doctors who have advised him that performing is simply not possible at this time nor will he be able to reschedule. The legacy of the band and his longtime fans are foremost in Jeff's mind today—and while he is so sorry that he cannot perform, he knows that he must focus on his health and rehabilitation at this time.”

This small farewell tour for the group has actually been on the books for a while, and was originally announced back before the COVID-19 pandemic. (In fact, it was delayed for so long that Lynne's primary collaborator in the latter era of ELO, keyboardist Richard Tandy, died in 2024, before the already-announced tour could be launched.) The cancellation today would seem to bring to a close the long, odd history of the group, which started in the late '60s, and then splintered when Lynne announced he was done with the project in the 1980s. (Drummer Bev Bevan then re-launched the band, with Lynne's permission, as ELO Part II, which eventually changed its name to The Orchestra; of the various members of that still-extant group, only violinist Mik Kaminski was ever a member of the original ELO.) Lynne and Tandy reformed “Jeff Lynne's ELO” in 2014; they would eventually release two albums, Alone In The Universe and From Out Of Nowhere.

Just weeks after testifying in Sean “Diddy” Combs' high-profile trial, Kid Cudi is stepping into a new chapter — celebrating his marriage to fashion designer Lola Abecassis Sartore in the South of France.

The couple tied the knot on June 28 at Cap Estel in Èze, a private, oceanfront venue that featured scenic views, personal touches and tributes to the late Virgil Abloh — the same designer whose 2018 Louis Vuitton show first brought them together, according to People.

Their wedding follows what has been an especially personal year for the rapper. In early 2025, Cudi testified in Sean “Diddy” Combs' sex trafficking trial, revealing that his Porsche was once set on fire with a Molotov cocktail after his brief relationship with Cassie Ventura. Just months later, Cudi began this new chapter with Sartore by his side.

The “Pursuit of Happiness” artist also took to Instagram to share moments from the big day, calling Sartore his “ride or die” and writing, “Man, I've been waiting for this moment my whole life… Here's to a bright future together, Mrs. Mescudi.”

A post shared by Willis (@kidcudi)

Cudi proposed to Sartore during a December 2023 trip to Kyoto, Japan. Reportedly, the couple later announced their engagement in April 2024 with separate Instagram posts marking both their relationship debut and the big news. “Life became crystal clear with Lola,” Cudi wrote at the time.

In an interview with Vogue, Sartore described the wedding day as “the most perfect, flawless, peaceful day” and shared that she and Cudi were “on cloud nine” throughout the weekend.

The event took place just steps from the ocean, with vows exchanged in the garden followed by cocktail hour by the pool, dinner on the lawn and an after-party inside the villa. There, Cudi performed two unreleased songs from his upcoming album — a project he says was inspired by their love story.

Sartore wore a custom Paris-made gown crafted from six different laces, designed by her close friend and “bridesman,” Alain Paul. Meanwhile, Cudi collaborated with Saint Laurent's Anthony Vaccarello to create three separate looks for the occasion, including a double-breasted black suit for the ceremony and a crystal-embellished top for the after-party.

A post shared by Lola Abecassis Sartore (@lolaabecassis)

Now head of design at fashion house ERL, Sartore is a Paris-based menswear designer who studied at Atelier Chardon Savard and previously worked under Virgil Abloh and Pharrell Williams at Louis Vuitton. In a 2024 interview, she credited her upbringing around fashion for fueling her creative path.

The couple kept their romance relatively private before going public in spring 2024. Sartore has supported Cudi through both personal and professional milestones — including his recovery from a 2024 Coachella injury — and has been the inspiration behind his next album, “FREE”, which he says is “damn-near dedicated” to her.

Cudi has one daughter, Vada, from a previous relationship and has openly spoken about wanting marriage and more children. In his wedding post, he joked about what's next: “Next we need this baby… not joking.”

It has been quite a year for Lisa Yamada, who plays Luna Nozawa on “The Bold and the Beautiful.” She took the sweet, somewhat boring Forrester intern and turned her into one of the very best villains, maybe in all of soap history. It has been like watching two completely different characters collide, sometimes mid-sentence, thanks to the brilliance of the young actress.

On July 10, 2025, Lisa Yamada was nominated for her first Daytime Emmy in the category of Outstanding Emerging Talent in a Daytime Drama Series. The actress took to Instagram to share her joy with the B&B fans who believe that she has been the shot in the arm that the show needed. 

In an Instagram Story that has since disappeared, Yamada stated that she had been on a plane when the nominees were first announced, but not long after landing, she shared her joy in a post.

“impostor syndrome goin crazy rn 

15 years in and this career STILL feels like a pipe dream… that pipe dream just landed me an emmy nomination ????? say whaaaaat lol this is a prank right ???

thank you brad bell for trusting me with such a beautifully complex villain like luna. playing her has been the honor of my life. i walk into television city everyday full of gratitude. how lucky am i to call this my job.

i love you @christianweissmann, i'm so happy i get to do this with you

idk what i did to be deserving of this incredible life i live. I'm so eternally grateful for whatever magic the universe is working up there 7777 ,” said the actress in her caption.

A post shared by Lisa Yamada (@lisayamada)

It appears that the character of Luna Nozawa may have met her demise, but true soap fans know that death is negotiable and people often return to life in the world of daytime. As we wait to see what happens to Luna, her portrayer has a few other projects coming to a big or small screen near you.

Lisa announced on Instagram that she has a new film. “Wish You All the Best,” coming to theaters on November 7, 2025.

A post shared by Lisa Yamada (@lisayamada)

Then there is that spot that she has landed in “Elle,” the prequel to “Legally Blonde” that is coming to Amazon Prime.

While Luna Nozawa's true fate may hang in the balance, it's pretty clear that Lisa Yamada's career is only just now beginning to take

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Joanna Gaines on New Gig","https://entertainmentnow.com/hgtv/joanna-chip-gaines-back-to-frontier/","Sun, 13 Jul 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

Chip and Joanna Gaines are typically firmly rooted in the present, focused on “modern” farmhouse or midcentury “modern” designs.

But when they dove in to the Magnolia Network's newest project, it was a different story. In fact, Joanna says she and husband Chip's latest show “Back to the Frontier” is “unlike anything we've ever created.”

In an Instagram post, Joanna says the new series as “gives 21st century families a chance to experience life as 1880s homesteaders.”

Turns out it gave Chip and Joanna Gaines that same opportunity!

In that same Instagram post, which features pictures of Chip, Joanna and their youngest son Crew on the set of “Back to the Frontier,” Joanna writes, “Last summer @chipgaines and I had the chance to go back in time on the production of #BacktotheFrontier… It was truly incredible to watch these families give up modern comforts and embark on a journey to discover what matters most.”

A post shared by Joanna Gaines (@joannagaines)

A post shared by Joanna Gaines (@joannagaines)

Joanna Gaines says both she and Chip were inspired by their visit to the set of “Back to the Frontier.”

A video she posted on Instagram shows Chip, Jo and their youngest son Crew, now 7, behind-the-scenes learning what life was like on the frontier.

Joanna Gaines writes, “Chip and I loved visiting these families and left inspired by the risks they took to step back in time—trading modern technology for an older way of living. We're so proud of the bonds they formed, the food they grew, and all the ways they made the frontier feel like home.”

One of the three families featured on the show commented, “We loved meeting y'all at our homesteads! Such a great experience!” And another wrote, “One of my favorite days out on the frontier 🫶”

The three families that participated in the show had to give up running water and electricity.

And that's not all.

The trailer for “Back to the Frontier” shows families putting phones, laptops, video games and all other modern conveniences in plastic bins before they start their trip back in time.

The women even have to surrender their makeup and jewelry.

“I want my kids to learn humility and hard work,” says one of the parents. “We want to go backward so that we can go forward in the right direction,” says another. But reality is still a shock- especially when they get a first look at their new bathroom facilities. “We sit on that?” one mom asks.

And the odds aren't necessarily in their favor. “One out of three families fail when they're on the homestead, so we need to work together,” one dad tells the other families.

The first episode of “Back to the Frontier” is streaming now on HBO/Max. New episodes air Thursdays at 8:00 p.m. ET on HBO/Max and Magnolia Network.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Jack Nicholson UPDATE: Danny DeVito Makes Rare Comments About Buddy Jack","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/jack-nicholson-update-danny-devito-rare/","Sun, 13 Jul 2025 12:42:18 GMT","

Danny DeVito has starred in several classic movies. One of the most notable is 1975's “One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.” Jack Nicholson was also in the film, and the two have maintained a lasting friendship. Recently, Danny provided an update on his friend, as Jack Nicholson rarely makes appearances. 

Regarding Jack, Danny DeVito told PEOPLE, “I just saw Jack a couple weeks ago — it was his birthday a month ago, and he's great.” The “It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia” actor also recalled working with Jack Nicholson on set on the classic film.”

He revealed, “We're in the presence of this guy who's really at his moment, where he was breaking out into the big time.” Danny went on, “There was no need for an icebreaker. He was immediately just so embracing…He started out exactly the way everybody else did, where he couldn't get a job.” 

Danny added, “It was like he came to Hollywood and he was going to just write and direct, and then Easy Rider comes along after the Corman stuff… So he was in our milieu, and he was always just as open and genuine, and we all felt it immediately.”

Danny DeVito's first time working with Jack Nicholson was on the set of “One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.” However, the two had previous ties. Danny told PEOPLE that his sisters worked in the same hair salon as Jack's older sister. Additionally, Danny and Jack were born in the same hospital in New Jersey. 

He said, “When I was a kid, I always heard about this really handsome guy from Neptune who went out to California and became a movie star.” Danny then said, “I didn't want to ruffle the waters; I didn't want to add anything to the experience at that time.”

Despite this, Michael Douglas spilled the beans to Jack about their New Jersey ties. Danny DeVito recalled, “Jack came running around the corner: ‘Ahhhh! You're from Asbury Park?'”

According to Fathom Entertainment, “One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest” is returning to theaters. The special release is in celebration of the film's 50th anniversary. This time, it's been restored in 4K, and moviegoers can see it on July 13 and 16.

In addition to Danny DeVito and Jack Nicholson, the film stars Louise Fletcher, Will Sampson, and Sydney Lassick. Michael Douglas is a producer on the film. He said of the re-release, “I feel the film is more relevant than ever, and I am heartened that new and returning moviegoers want to seek it out on the big screen. I feel its messages need to be shared widely today.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Kelley Wolf Vulnerably Asks For Help Amid Divorce From Scott Wolf: ‘I Want My Kids Back'","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/kelley-wolf-update-help-kids-bruises/","Sun, 13 Jul 2025 10:44:30 GMT","

One month after “Doc” star and Hallmark Channel fan favorite Scott Wolf, 57, confirmed he had filed for divorce from his wife of 21 years, Kelley Wolf, she posted a series of unsettling Instagram Stories on the night of July 12, 2025.

Kelley, 48, who rose to fame on MTV's “The Real World” in 2000, shared photos of bruises on her arm and vulnerably asked for help, writing that she'd been placed under a second involuntary hold and was missing her kids, whom she lost temporary custody of in late June.

The Stories she shared were a stark shift from just one day prior, when Kelley posted an upbeat video as she helped a local florist who had a flat tire, reminding people that “kindness matters.” 

A post shared by KELLEY WOLF (@kelleywolf)

Early in the day on July 12, Kelley shared multiple upbeat videos from other accounts to her Instagram Stories, from a pretty Parisian flower shop to a hiking trail in Utah, where the Wolfs live. She also shared a Story from the woman she helped on the side of the road the previous day, who called Kelley “my fairy godmother and warrior mama.”

But by evening, Kelley's Stories took a dramatic turn. She posted a shocking photo in her Instagram Stories of bruises on her inner left arm and wrote, “I was held for 7 days and they tried to keep me for 90. I will not be quiet anymore.”

“I cannot be quiet anymore,” she reiterated, and then continued, “This is from the police. I will get myself safe but I'm asking for help. Thrown downs stairs. Broke my wrist. Contusions on my head. I'm bruised everywhere and I literally was released last night. This is the SECOND time.” 

“Summit county police took me from Sundance on July 6,” Kelley added. “I was in a hot tub. Placed me on an involuntary hold at Summit county behavioral health. The truth must be told.”

In her next Story, Kelley wrote in white text on a black background, “I love my kids. I'm not crazy. I need help. And I want my kids back. That's all for now.” 

“I am kind,” Kelley wrote in another Story. “I am a mother. I am a fighter. And I'll never back down.” 

Referencing the tagline of “The Real World,” she posted on another Story, “I will stop being polite…And start getting REAL if I have to. Because this is AMERICA.”

Kelley did not appear to have a cast on either wrist. She also did not share any visuals of the “contusions” on her head.

A post shared by KELLEY WOLF (@kelleywolf)

About an hour after Kelley's series of Instagram Stories on the evening of July 12, she returned with several more, assuring her followers that she was okay but upset over how she'd been treated. 

“Just so you all know….I'm safe,” she wrote over a mirror selfie. “Sad. Bruised. Strong and still alive…thank god. And still in my home town of Park City, Utah…with great friends and great humans and good everything! Come visit me! I have a suite in a hotel and I am safe. I'm just confused…and hurt.”

Kelley then posted a video to her Instagram Stories, showing a small dining table in her hotel set for two, with two glasses of wine poured, over which she wrote, “I don't want worry or even sympathy…I will use what voice I have left to speak out against this, what I believe is illegal and without question…cruel and WRONG.”

In her video, Kelley said, “I have a very good life. I'm a successful woman. I have a very generous family. I have great friends. I have a friend here for dinner. Okay? And definitely what's going on is not okay, it's not okay anywhere, especially not in this country.” 

“I'm angry, and I'm hurt, and I'm scared, and I'm going to use my rights as an American, to use Instagram, the free press, whatever it takes, for these kinds of things to not happen,” Kelley said, pulling her arm out of her sleeve to show her bruises again.

In Kelley's next Story that evening, she posted another photo of the table set for two, with a pasta dish at one seat and a salad at the other setting, and wrote over the photo, “I am a very blessed and privileged person in this world and I would rather we focus on real issues we are facing as a world.”

“So if this makes you angry,” she continued, “then speak up. Call out injustice, brutality, subjugationand speak up for this kind of insanity!!! I am just as confused as all of you…trust me. Last I checked this was a FREE country when we had rights as women and humans. So yeah….let's get loud!!!!”

Kelly, who appeared on 2022's “The Real World Homecoming: New Orleans,” announced her amicable split from Scott on June 10, calling him “one of the best partners a woman could have the privilege of sharing life with.” He released a statement to People the next day, calling filing for divorce the “most difficult decision of my life.” The Wolfs share three children — Jackson, 16, Miller, 12, and Lucy, 11. 

But things took a turn days later, when Kelley was detained by police at the Sundance Resort, according to People. On June 20, Kelley posted on Instagram that she was placed under an involuntary hold for several days but refused treatment. That same day, Scott posted a photo in his Instagram Stories of their kids on an airport's moving walkway and wrote, “With my forever squad.”

On June 26, Today.com reported that Scott was granted temporary physical and legal custody of the kids, as well as a temporary restraining order against Kelley. According to the outlet, Judge Richard Mrazik stated in his order that Kelley “has been engaged in an escalating pattern of behavior that poses a substantial threat of immediate and irreparable harm to the party's minor children.”

Judge Mrazik also stated that Kelley's behavior was “sufficient” for her “to be detained by law enforcement and subsequently placed on an involuntary psychiatric commitment,” per Today.com.

According to People, the court order did not allow for Kelley to be at the family's home nor to post anything on social media about the divorce, their kids or Scott. The order said, per People, “a failure to comply may be punishable by a fine or jail time.”

Scott is expected to still have a recurring role on season two of FOX's “Doc,” despite his character losing his job in the season finale after making some decisions with tragic outcomes. Interestingly, his character is overly stressed by having a son at home struggling enough with mental health issues that he needs to check into a mental health facility. 

In May, Wolf — who also starred in Hallmark's 2023 hit “A Merry Scottish Christmas” with Lacey Chabert — told Us Weekly, “In some ways, he is just responding to the next thing that is in front of him. He is just trying to get ahead of it, keep his family safe and then just sometimes you can lose control of it. Then you can actually be forced into situations where you're behaving in ways that you never thought you would.”

Lena Dunham isn't just making a comeback with her Megan Stalter-starring Netflix romantic comedy series “Too Much” — she also has a movie she wrote and is directing set to premiere on the platform, and starring Oscar-winner Natalie Portman. In fact, it would appear that Netflix really wanted “Good Sex,” also a rom-com which co-stars genre stalwart Meg Ryan, Mark Ruffalo, and Rashida Jones. After all, the streamer paid a reported $55 million for it.

Dunham, though, isn't precious about the movie forgoing a theatrical release to go straight to the platform. To her, that's someone else's battle.

 










“I really just want people to sit on a couch with their moms and their besties and lean in,” she said in an interview with Variety. “I love watching other filmmakers fight for the theatrical-release element — but I don't think this will live or die by that.”

“Good Sex” went into production this month, so a release date is still very much pending. Tucker Pillsbury, known to the music scene as rapper Role Model, will make his film debut in the movie. “He had this humor and essence that really felt like rom-com gold,” Dunham said, describing finding him on her shadow TikTok account. “He's giving early Brad Pitt, like when you saw him in ‘Thelma & Louise.'”

 










In a nod to her late friend and romcom queen writer/director Nora Ephron, Dunham was excited to get Ryan on board. She pitched the movie to Ryan when they both attended Taylor Swift's London stop on the Eras tour. “I decided, it's now or never, and I'm going to shoot my shot. She couldn't be a lovelier person,” Dunham related. “Shout-out Taylor — thank you for that. She brings everyone together; she makes the world go round.”

Ryan has been slowly raising her profile once again, after a fairly stagnant period without much mainstream action. In February, she appeared in a much-discussed Hellmann's Mayo Super Bowl commercial with Billy Crystal that lampooned undoubtedly her most famous movie moment from “When Harry Met Sally.” Two years ago, Ryan made her own stab at writing/directing a romantic comedy with the small-scale theatrical release “What Happens Later” alongside David Duchovny.

Dennis Lehane‘s Apple TV+ series “Smoke” is one of the most absorbing and unpredictable dramas of the year, an adaptation of the true crime “Firebug” podcast that throws a major plot twist at the audience at the end of episode two and then keeps the surprises coming right up until the season finale. Creating an opening credit sequence that captures the show's sense of menace, mystery, and intrigue while incorporating elements of the story — without giving away any of the series' secrets — was a tall order for award-winning design studio Digital Kitchen.

 










The artists at Digital Kitchen had two advantages as they began conceptualizing the title sequence. The first was that the music, an unreleased original track by Thom Yorke titled “Dialing In,” was in place from the beginning, giving the filmmakers a tone to work from and a rhythm to cut the images to. The other advantage was access to at least half of the show's episodes. “Sometimes we only get a logline to tell us what the show is going to be,” Nicoll said. “Usually it's scripts, sometimes it's a pilot. On this one, they had already gotten through a lot of the episodes, so we got to dive into it more.”

The first step in creating the credits, which would depict an arsonist's burning ritual in reverse, was to come up with a list of items to destroy. The filmmakers began with a list that Lehane created based on the story, then set about conducting extensive tests to see what burned most evocatively on camera. “We wanted them all to start in the same kind of charcoal briquette state,” Nicoll said of the first image viewers would see of each object before the reverse photography revealed its true nature. “Some got dropped off the list because the way they burned wasn't as interesting.” 

There was also the question of exactly how to burn the objects, a problem art director and cinematographer Rachel Brickel solved during the testing process. “I started with heat guns and fire from an actual match, and then propane torches,” Brickel said. “We found out pretty quickly that was the way to go, because this wasn't really about things being on fire. It was about the transformation of the objects as they burned.” For that reason, Brickel tested numerous types of material for each object; a scrunchie, for example, had to be tested in cotton, elastic, and nylon forms to see which would burn the best.

Different materials bubbled differently and behaved differently,” Brickel said, adding that once the objects were decided upon, the team needed to create a hero object along with several dummy objects, “because once it's burned, it's gone. That's why testing was so important — we had to make sure we knew what we were doing because we had a limited supply of objects.” On the shoot day, Brickel used a RED Raptor with macro lenses to capture the footage, “chasing whatever felt cool,” while a Blackmagic Pocket 6K was mounted above the table on a forklift to get a nice, clean locked off shot of everything.

 










One of the big challenges was figuring out what to place the objects on so that they would burn, but the platform would not. The solution the filmmakers settled on was to use borosilicate glass similar to what's used in glass cooking trays. “We had these big trays and we ran through three of them, but they held up pretty well,” Brickel said. 

After the practical shoot, which lasted a couple of days including reshoots, art director and designer Peter Pak brought everything into After Effects to combine elements from different takes in the same shot, taking the best moments from multiple takes and compositing them into the powerful final images. “When you burn an object, it's very difficult to make it perform in the way that you want it to,” Pak said. “For the logo, we were combining the way the letters would warp in one take and the way they would in another, and we combined it with some digital recreations of the fire and micro-cracks to make it perform exactly the way we wanted.”

Pak also added camera moves and perspective changes that were saved for post-production because the filmmakers wanted to maximize their time on set and capture as many burning objects as possible. Pak also experimented with color palette, noting that he had more creative freedom than on a more conventional series where the palette is set by the location or era, or genre. “We played with a spectrum of approaches,” Pak said. “We tried sepia tones to make it look like old documents, we tried vivid colors to accentuate the flames. Eventually, we landed on a muted palette, and by making it more muted, we had to make sure that every color that showed was deliberate.”

 










For Nicoll, the moment of truth came when the images started to cut together with the Thom Yorke song. “That was the biggest excitement, seeing that rough cut,” he said. “There's a bit of a leap of faith where you feel like these sequences will work together, but that was the moment where we saw, okay, this is going to work. As long as everything else goes according to plan, this is going to work out well.”

“Smoke” is currently streaming on Apple TV+.

In the early hours of June 23, 1993, after her husband, John Bobbitt, raped her, Lorena Bobbitt reached under the covers for his penis, grabbed it, then cut it clean off with a kitchen knife. With the severed penis in hand, she drove to a nearby field, threw it out the window, and called the police, telling them where to find it. She was jailed for “malicious wounding.”

Over 1.3 million column inches were dedicated to the subsequent trial, and for a brief period, American culture underwent a reckoning with male authority and phallic sovereignty. Tori Amos read every piece on the trial she could find. She celebrated the final verdict in Bobbitt's trial, in 1994: not guilty by reason of temporary insanity. Amos told Hot Press soon after: “I'm mad, mad at myself to this day that I didn't kill the man who raped me.” Her third album, 1996's Boys for Pele, plays out the fantasy: What if she had?

Two years before, Amos had released “Me and a Gun,” the a cappella retelling of her own sexual assault that—amazingly—launched her solo career. The song mimicked the meditative cadence of psalms as Amos recounted the unholiness of the act. It reflected the emerging third wave of feminism, part of a cultural reckoning with sexual violence that had produced Tracy Chapman's 1988 song “Behind the Wall,” Suzanne Vega's 1992 song “Bad Wisdom,” and Hole's “Asking for It,” in 1994. That year, when Rolling Stone asked what Amos' fans told her when they got the chance to speak to her, she replied: “That they've been raped.”

In order to survive your body being stolen from you, you have to take an active role. For Amos, that meant reviewing her own capacity for violence and violation, whether toward herself or others. On the Boys for Pele cover, Amos grips the weapon she once sang about, while a barnyard cock hangs dead from the rafters and a live snake curls behind her foot. With Amos now pointing the gun herself, Boys for Pele is her visceral and symbolically rich exploration of the fantasy of violent reprisal. While her previous albums, 1992's Little Earthquakes and 1994's Under the Pink, were more carefully wound and filled with an almost unrealistic clarity, Boys for Pele is a bristling, terrifying, and often inhuman affront in which Amos is an unholy brat on the edge of nonexistence, singing about clit-eating chickens, lacing ratatouille with poison, and coaxing men to kill themselves.

Through Boys for Pele, Amos finally found in herself a quality she had envied in her friend Trent Reznor. “I love the screaming male aggression of his music, because I'm not in touch with that part of myself so much,” she told Spin in 1994, eight months before she started work on her third album. On Boys for Pele, Amos brays bull-like with an open throat, her lyrics a revolt against the strictures of language. It is so strange, unsettling, and outside the bounds of any prevailing canons of good taste or common sense that it at once summons and repulses you. It is also extraordinarily beautiful.

Amos began working on Boys for Pele soon after ending her seven-year relationship with Eric Rosse, with whom she had co-produced her previous albums. During the album's writing, she transformed the breakup into a mythic quest, one that aligned tightly with the concept as defined by Joseph Campbell, a writer Amos occasionally quoted in interviews (“a culture that doesn't know its mythology is powerless,” she paraphrased to Spin). Campbell posited that the mythic quest involves a healer who can aid the hero in exposing that which is buried in the psyche, thus revealing society's fantasies and fears.

On Boys For Pele, Amos finds the border where language fractures and the psyche begins to speak in symbols—where private experience becomes mythic narrative. Across its 70-minute runtime, she refracts her most hidden thoughts into an archetypal drama.

Boys for Pele takes its name from the volcano goddess Pele, of Hawaiian mythology. Pele has long been a source of fascination for tourists, who write to her and send gifts, including sands extracted from the islands. Because the sand is believed to be Pele's body, scholars have interpreted its removal as a symbolic act of female violation. Before Amos, painter Enoch Wood Perry and explorer Isabella Bird likewise portrayed Goddess Pele as a symbol of the dark feminine.

Naturally, Amos went on an ayahuasca retreat in Hawaii shortly after her breakup. During her 16-hour trip, she drank tea with the devil and learned how to tango. She recounts the experience on Boys for Pele, whose mythic quest is ultimately a quest for provenance—tracing bloodlines back to the origins of music, femininity, and religion. In doing so, Amos seeks to understand herself and her own capacity for violence, much as a culture must confront its myths in order to understand its soul.

Amos' own bloodlines presented a neat conflict between the Christianity on her paternal side (her father was a Methodist minister) and her mother's Native American heritage. Within that lineage lay a story that she perceived as one of female triumph: Her Cherokee great-great-grandmother married the man who owned the plantation where she was enslaved. This was the side Amos sought to understand and claim.

Amos has said that 14 of the album's songs represent the dismembered body parts of the Egyptian god Osiris; she notes that each track also embodies a part of herself she had not yet embraced. “As I wrote the songs for Boys for Pele, I started valuing myself through my own eyes, instead of valuing me through the eyes of others,” she told the Dallas Morning News. To arrive at herself, she not only had to reconfigure her relationship with men but also her relationship with the piano.

Amos struggled to disentangle herself from the instrument. As a child prodigy, she derived her sense of self-worth from the piano, believing that she was only as good as how she played. At two, she had stacked up a pile of phone books and lifted herself onto the stool by the family's black upright piano, playing by ear the tunes her older brother and sister had practiced in their piano lessons that afternoon. Amos could not yet talk. By three, she was playing back in full the songs the family heard on the radio. By four, she could play Mozart and the entire songbook of Oklahoma! By five, she had composed her first song and auditioned for the prestigious Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, where she became the youngest student in the Conservatory's history.

Despite the Conservatory's strictly classical curriculum, she grew obsessed with Led Zeppelin while studying there. After school, she studied Jimmy Page's tones and phrasings and translated his guitar playing to the piano, figuring she had found the bridge between classical music and popular rock. She learned to view the piano as an instrument of synthesis, capable of uniting conflicting traditions and ideas. With her right hand, she played grand, stately, and studied filigrees; with her left, jazzier, funkier voicings.

At 11, after she started stitching too much Beatles into her Beethoven and the school withdrew her scholarship (Amos melodramatically claims she was “kicked out”), she began performing across Washington's lounge circuit. A gay bar took her in. There, she played almost nightly while the waiters taught her about men and the ways to please them. They gave her a cucumber to practice on: Teeth marks meant an extra late-night; a clean cucumber granted her a cup of chocolate milk. Around the same time, she began recording herself and sending the tapes to record executives in Los Angeles. Of the responses she did receive, most relayed the same sentiment: The girl-and-piano thing had died with Carole King. It was the early '80s, and the piano was considered a sexless instrument that bore associations with obsequiousness, dowdiness: long gray skirts and pinafores. Amos didn't so much sex the piano up as turn it into an instrument of masturbation.

The most succinct way to describe what it is like to witness Amos playing is to compare it to walking in on someone fucking themself. When she sings, she tugs at her own hair, throws back her neck, rocks back and forth on her stool in rapture—inspiring this all-time great Bob's Burgers bit. She made the link explicit in an interview with Mojo: “[masturbation] kept me alive! It's where I practice my piano licks.”

The word “masturbatory” is often applied to male musicians who take too much pleasure in their own virtuosity without troubling themselves with making sense or entertaining anyone else. That has some bearing on what Amos is doing, but she manages to invite others into her own world of self-gratification. Ultimately, her music asks: What if masturbation were generative?

Amos' music is autoerotic and sealed off from public life; her fans are known to listen to it in a fundamentally private, even antisocial fashion. Toriphiles come to her shows not as a unified collective but as multiplied egos. Insulating themselves in Amos' world, they have learned how to become fluent in Tori-speak, a lingua franca made up of illogical associations, overextended metaphors, and pop Jungianisms, that is almost unintelligible to anyone other than its speakers. Amos says things like: “Deep-sea dive with my male muses to explore new coral reefs,” and her fans say things like, “She tastes like a magical leader pied-piping us into the new millennium.” Inhabiting Amos' world feels like taking pleasure in the paroxysms of tantrum. Standing outside of it is akin to watching a grown adult wail in the supermarket. What is hallowed to insiders can be, to outsiders, annoying or even disgusting.

What is almost certainly the longest written piece on Boys for Pele, Amy Gentry's 33 ⅓ book on the album, also functions as a sociological treatise on disgust. “Disgust is a biological response onto which learned responses are easily grafted, both by way of and as a means of social reinforcement,” she writes, emphasizing disgust's gendered aspect as a policing instrument that restricts girlish norms.

Embarrassment and disgust are common reactions to Boys for Pele. Upon its release, critics wrote about the album with a sense of self-evident aversion: “I just don't like her,” wrote a reviewer in the Courier-Journal. “At 18 tracks, the album's way too self-indulgent,” wrote Evelyn McDonnell for Rolling Stone in the most infamous pan of Pele's press cycle, highlighting its “supposedly mystical” lyrics as “well, bad.” Yet these writers showed little desire to investigate this strong dislike. As forms of aesthetic (dis)engagement, embarrassment and disgust shut down critical faculties because they are so embodied—in the blush, the cringe, the gag.

Boys for Pele was met with one of the frostiest receptions of Amos' career when she first unveiled it to her inner circle. She went out to dinner while her team at Atlantic Records held their first listening session. When she returned and poked her head into the studio, she discovered them outraged. “It was really just vicious,” Amos later told Stereogum, “the most vicious, shocking things you could hear from people.”

The label gave her license to self-produce, given the surprising success of her previous two albums, which both went platinum by the time Boys for Pele was released. Boys for Pele was the first album over which Amos had near-total creative control, and it was, correspondingly, her most peculiar. Kate Bush's first self-produced album, The Dreaming, shares that insularity, though Boys for Pele is so deranged that it makes The Dreaming sound more like Teenage Dream in comparison.

On Boys for Pele, Amos is more willing than ever to build songs out of images and references whose significance is almost certain to elude anybody but her. On “Marianne,” a song she improvised on the spot, she sings about her childhood imaginary friends: Mr. Spaghetti and a purple monkey named Clunky. The Metro's reviewer advised skipping the album and spending time instead with something “a little bit more intelligible—like maybe Gravity's Rainbow written in Greek.” But even in gibberish, Amos voices the spontaneous expressions of the subconscious. To some, lyrics like “Marianne”'s infamous opening line: “Tuna, rubber/Little blubber in my igloo,” are hermetic nonsense. To others, they signal an entry point. Amos' metaphors lend themselves to nearly boundless interpretation, drawing one of two extreme reactions: absolute withdrawal or total immersion.

Boys for Pele requires the latter in order to really work. The listener must be willing to step into Amos' trip and find their own significance among the shapes in the floaty floors and ceilings. Just as Bible verses and horoscopes transcend literal interpretation, Amos' symbols require their own personal decoding. The listening experience frequently involves appropriating the lyrics for one's own understanding; even mishearing or misunderstanding the often indecipherable words can become an active part of this process. It's common for phrases like “tuna, rubber/little blubber in my igloo” to be misunderstood, with listeners not registering the precise words; instead, they function more as a Rorschach test. Even the official lyric booklet reads differently from the recording. On “Hey Jupiter,” she sings, “And I thought I wouldn't have to be/With you as something new,” while the lyric sheet renders the couplet as “And I thought you'd see with me/You wouldn't have to be something new.”

On top of its nonsense lyrics, Boys for Pele also offers little respite from the harpsichord. In keeping with her quest for provenance, Amos traced the piano's bloodline to its plectrum-equipped ancestor—an instrument she swiftly became obsessed with, despite its scant melodic or textural range, and, more crucially for Amos, its lack of sustain. For someone who pumps her piano's sustain pedal as if she's trying to resuscitate the notes back to life, Amos was severely tested by the harpsichord's constraints. “I wasn't interested in anything that didn't challenge me, and as I started finding different parts of myself, I brought in different instruments to express that,” she explained to Spin. The greatest challenge with the harpsichord was to cleave it from its Baroque associations. She wanted to take out the whimsy and give it some ass. To do that, she made the low end growl by feeding a Bösendorfer piano through a Marshall amp . You can hear the rusty buzz and rattle of each of its keys. For Amos, compression was the ultimate taboo.

Amos referred to Boys for Pele as her “thrash harpsichord” record, a descriptor most befitting of two songs: “Professional Widow” and “Blood Roses.” She plays the former in an unnervingly standard waltz time, with parallel fifths that she smashes to smithereens in every other measure. On “Blood Roses,” she growls, “Chickens get a taste of your meat, girl,” alluding to a scene in Alice Walker's Possessing the Secret of Joy in which the byproducts of female mutilation are tossed to the birds. On the harpsichord, she jounces between rapid-fire triplets and largo sequences, all while traveling across scales so swiftly it inspires the awe and horror of watching someone tap dance themselves into flight. She discovers the instrument's blood.

Amos' quest for provenance is also reflected in her deliberate choice of recording locations: a deconsecrated church in County Wicklow, Ireland, and a studio in New Orleans, Louisiana. Boys for Pele, with its bluesy tones and syncopations, re-synthesizes the influences that make up the musical identity of the rural South. She draws particular attention to the way Irish music made its way through the rivers of Louisiana in the 19th century, influencing the blues and the region's cultural sound. “Mr. Zebra,” with its bouncy piano line, has the feeling of a slip jig; “Horses” rolls in non-linear arpeggios like an Irish air. Boys for Pele is a spiritual as well as musicological investigation of place.

To Amos, these sites symbolized, more specifically, the New World church's stripping of Mary Magdalene's sacred sexuality. Much of Amos' musical project has long revolved around recovering Magdalene's legacy—a legacy the modern church had reduced from Jesus' bride to an unrepentant sinner. “If we were going to use a term to describe my music, it would have to be ‘theology of the feminine',” Amos told The Oregonian in 1996. She believed not only that Mary Magdalene was pregnant with Jesus' child but that this buried truth formed the blueprint for all women's sexual culture—and that had the original myth remained intact, Amos would have been raised with a healthier relationship to her sexuality, to men, and to herself. Boys for Pele is her attempt to violently write into existence the sacred Bride that Christian theology has long obscured.

These ideas were so heady that Amos was never quite able to synthesize them into talking points during Boys for Pele's lengthy press run. Many of the interviews instead concerned Amos' relationship with the internet, a hot-button topic at the time. A curiously under-remarked aspect of Boys for Pele is how much the internet contributed to its success. Though Amos had touched a computer maybe twice in her life up to that point, she had an unusually devout online following. Her fans were very early adopters. Digital mailing lists devoted to Amos even preceded the World Wide Web as it came to be known, with some fans sending out digests on a daily basis in the early '90s.

With the dot-com boom, a flurry of Amos fan sites emerged, including the First International Church of Tori, with its own dedicated “Altar Room.” At the time of Boys for Pele's release, there were some 70 websites devoted to Amos—an extraordinary amount for that nascent era of the internet—and Amos supported those sites by giving them exclusive interviews. Atlantic Records cleverly tapped into the new niche by making “Caught a Lite Sneeze,” the album's lead single, one of the world's first songs to premiere as a free digital download ahead of its official release. Amos' website also debuted samples of three Pele tracks on December 15, 1995, and upon the album's release a month later, the Atlantic Records website scored two million hits, their most in a single day.

At school, Amos, a self-proclaimed nerd, was voted homecoming queen by the school's nerd committee. This is sort of how her fame worked then and still does today. Despite significantly less radio play than her previous two records, Boys for Pele achieved platinum status much faster than its predecessors. The album debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 2, held from the top spot only by the unmovable Waiting to Exhale soundtrack. Her extensive 187-stop Dew Drop Inn Tour, running from February 23 to November 11, 1996, sold out within days and grossed $4.4 million, making it one of the highest-earning ticket sales of the spring.

Amos' reputation and fame in the '90s did not carry into the new millennium quite the way it had for her contemporaries Björk and PJ Harvey. She didn't possess either's sanguine cool. Before Amos made it as a musician, she'd ousted Sarah Jessica-Parker for a role in a Kellogg's commercial. The director told her she did a good job, but to “tone it down please.” Instead, Amos toned it up for the rest of her career, transforming herself into a meta-Jungian girlband for 2007's American Doll Posse and caressing herself onstage with a knife.

Even today, Boys for Pele remains the most distinctive record in her discography. Amos embodied such an extreme scope of emotion that it fell outside any frameworks capable of packaging or aestheticizing it. While other exceptional women of the '90s transmuted their rage into power, Amos did something more akin to turning excrement into ecstasy, delivering her rage with a barnyard stench. It was an absolutely monumental achievement, a dive into another world from which no sound could escape. On Boys for Pele, Amos truly came undone, un-disciplining music while disassembling the spirit. She was convulsing, untouchable, and often illegible. Mystical Christianity dictates that this kind of abjection is a sign of close proximity to the divine, but on Boys for Pele, there was no God to be found.

A Progressive Pastor Says That's Great","https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/irs-churches-politics-candidates-republicans-democrats-1235384507/","Sun, 13 Jul 2025 13:30:00 GMT","

Donald Trump's administration is giving churches a green light to explicitly endorse political candidates, without fear of losing their nonprofit tax status, under a proposed court settlement. And a leading figure on the Religious Left insists that's a good thing for Democrats.


	The Internal Revenue Service — now led by controversial Trump appointee and X enthusiast Billy Long — proposed a “consent judgment” last week, seeking to settle a court case brought by Christian broadcasters. The IRS seeks to effectively exempt churches from the Johnson Amendment, a federal law that bans tax-exempt groups from politicking. The proposed settlement states that “communications from a house of worship to its congregation… on matters of faith do not run afoul of the Johnson Amendment as properly interpreted.” The document likens endorsements from the pulpit to “a family discussion concerning candidates.” 


	Some progressives are sounding the alarm that this ruling will transform houses of worship into a political powerhouse for the MAGA GOP, which relies on evangelical Christians as its base. But Doug Pagitt, a progressive evangelical pastor and executive director of Vote Common Good, argues that ruling provides much needed clarity — and could actually give progressives a desperately needed boost.

	The Johnson Amendment has long been a phantom menace. It remains on the books, but has been all but unenforced against churches, either purposefully or passively, for decades. This has led to “wild imbalance,” Pagitt says, with right-wing churches becoming integral to Republican politics, while most mainstream and progressive church-leaders have abided by the (dead) letter of the law — contorting themselves to remain at arms length from anything to do with elections, lest they imperil their tax exemption.

	











	“For too long, Republican politicians and their allies have spoken freely from pulpits, while too many Democrats and faith leaders held back, worried they would cross an invisible line,” Pagitt says. “This decision removes that roadblock.”

	The pastor insists Democrats and progressives now have a chance to level the playing field with voters of faith — but acknowledges that doing so will force both the center-left political establishment and progressive church leaders to get out of their comfort zones. 


	Pagitt spoke to Rolling Stone by phone. The transcript that follows has been edited for length and clarity.

	I've been an evangelical pastor my whole adult life. I come from that small, dwindling, little wing of the evangelical world that's called progressive evangelicalism. I got into this in 1983, when there were still a bunch of Jimmy Carter evangelicals; I wax eloquently about how in 1976 and 1980, 60 percent of evangelicals voted for a Democrat from Georgia. My faith motivates what I do and the way I think about politics. And it doesn't end me up in the MAGA world.


What is the mission of Vote Common Good?


	We connect with faith voters who are thinking about their political and their religious identities. Many Christian faith voters have a religious identity that came as a package deal, which ended up with them becoming Republicans. People went to church to follow Jesus and ended up voting for Republicans every time — and they don't know how that happened.


	Then when someone like Donald Trump comes along, people are like, I didn't think that's what we were saying ‘Yes' to. But they watched as the Republican Party and their faith communities went down the road in lockstep.

	We know that doesn't fit a lot of those people. They're not sure what to do about that. We help those voters connect their faith identity, and consider voting for Democratic candidates.


How long have you been active?


	Since 2018. We do bus tours and events with Democratic candidates — introducing them to faith voters and faith leaders around the country. We've worked on hundreds of campaigns. We did events with [now governor] Josh Shapiro in Pennsylvania. We did a bunch of work with the Harris campaign. We work with about 40 or 50 congressional candidates per cycle.


Your argument that the IRS ruling could be a good development for Democrats is not intuitive. How do you see it?












	There has been this wild imbalance where Republicans speak about faith issues and faith voters all the time. Democrats rarely do. Republicans have organized almost exclusively under religious identity — so much so that the 2024 Trump campaign used an evangelical religious group, Turning Point USA, as their on-the-ground organizing. 


	Republican candidates will go to churches. Democratic candidates will — if they're Black churches. But rarely will they find themselves organizing in any other church context, or any other faith community organized around synagogues or mosques or temples. 


	And that's always been done under the guise of: Well, the IRS laws say that religious communities have to be politically neutral. And there's no way to be politically neutral if you're going to talk to a candidate. 


	Republicans have never had that problem. Republicans are just wildly running the table on this stuff — having absolutely no issues at all.


The Johnson Amendment has only been an obstacle, then, but only for one side? 


	The IRS became the rationale for the dividing line. I hear from [progressive] pastors and faith leaders all the time: All my conservative counterparts, they talk about politics and tell the people who vote for. But we follow the law. And they're just lawless. 


	Progressives and conservatives have been telling two different stories about what the Johnson Amendment implications are, because the IRS has not been clear about it. 


	And now that they have been clear about it, it really creates an opportunity for Democrats to be able to talk to faith voters. And for faith leaders to be open — if they choose — to talk about politics. Maybe to host a forum at their church, or have a political talking group, or let a candidate come in and meet some people in their church without feeling like they're somehow running afoul of the law.


So mainstream churches have been so afraid of jeopardizing their tax status they not only won't endorse Democratic candidates, but won't even invite them to speak?


	A lot of pastors are not even willing to show up at a public meeting supporting a candidate, because they're so afraid. We deal with this all the time. 


	The kind of kabuki theater that churches have had to do is almost comical. In a lot of Black churches, you'll see a separate part of the building that's the community center. And you could talk about politics over there, because that's run by a separate entity of the church. But you can't do it in the church. It's ridiculous. 

	











	Or we did an event at a church in New Hampshire. This is a Sunday night — it wasn't a church time. The pastor said, OK, and I'm going to give the welcome. But you have to rent the building with a rental contract — so you're an outside rental group at the church. Which is fine. And the pastor gave the welcome and said, I want to be clear that I'm giving my welcome from down here on the floor and not up there on the platform where the pulpit is, because when I'm standing up there, I'm in my church capacity, and when I'm here on the floor, I'm in my personal capacity. And you're just like, Come on. It's silly. But that was his workaround. He was just trying his best to find some way to not violate the law. 


	Pastor Jeffress [conservative megachurch pastor Robert Jeffress] doesn't have that concern. He's not worried about where he's saying it! Or anything else! So they've been running [around] basically saying to America, Republicans love religion, Democrats hate God. 


	And the last 30 years, Democrats have basically said, We have no argument with that.


Democrats seem institutionally ill prepared for the opportunity you're describing.


	We've been in a situation in which Democrats rarely want to speak about faith voters or even identify or understand faith voters. In 1992, the Democratic [tracking] system removed ‘faith identity' from the voter file, even organized by faith tradition. If Elie Wiesel was right that the opposite of love is not hate, it's apathy, the fact that Democrats don't even know, or care, or think about this is a real problem. 


	We've worked really hard to try to help Democrats overcome their fear and phobia of faith voters, and help faith voters overcome their fear and phobia of Democrats. Because it's not good for politics. It's not good for religion. Pastors feel it. Parishioners feel it. Political parties feel it. 


	In other words, Republicans have a food addiction when it comes to religion, and Democrats have an allergy. And we'd like to see, we'd like to see both of them have a healthier relationship. Anything that can get us greater parity and conversation about political and religious identity, we think would be a very good thing. 


You're confident Democrats can fish for votes in the pews?


	Ninety percent of Black church attenders vote for Democrats, while 80 percent of white evangelicals vote for Republicans. But the difference in the faith between a Black church member and a white evangelical, it's not very great. In fact, Black churches are sometimes more conservative socially, theologically, but they'll vote for Democrats.

	











	We think a lot of Democrats could really benefit from this [new opportunity to communicate with faith voters.]


	A big percentage of people who vote for Democratic presidential candidates are white Christians. Nearly 70 percent are religious people overall. Literally, the base of the Democratic party are religious people, and are white Christian people as well. But inside the Democratic Party it's like, We've never even heard of these people. We don't know who they are and how are they living in America. It's the strangest thing. 


	We just released a big poll on Christian voter identity, and 80 percent of Christian voters have said they're open to voting for a Democrat, including 40 percent of people who have never voted for a Democrat in their life. We know there's a real opportunity here. 


To play devil's advocate on this. I reported during the campaign on Trump joining a Christian nationalist broadcast promising to roll back the Johnson Amendment. To the extent that churches more explicitly become the GOP's turnout machinery, no holds barred, that could really deepen their advantage.


	It could. But I think there's going to be all kinds of blowback. 


	The churches that were already comfortable endorsing, despite the lack of clarity the Johnson Amendment, were doing it anyway. There is about 20 percent of the religious community where that's hard-wired into their political identity — and they're going to run wild. But their clientele is only so big. 


	There's a lot of conservative Republican pastors who've been doing a wink-and-nudge of endorsement. They don't say anything from the pulpit, but they put out a voter guide, and it all hints in one direction. But they don't ever have to own it. They're not going to be able to skate so comfortably down that road.


	In working with faith voters, we meet people all the time. They're like, I've gone to this church for six years. I had no idea they were wanting me to vote for Trump. I wouldn't have stuck around if I knew that. We never talked about it. And then there was all this implication that came right at the last minute. 


	And there are a lot of conservative pastors that didn't want the Johnson Amendment to be clarified for churches in this way. They're like, Oh, you gotta be kidding me. Now I'm going to have that person in my church say, flat out, ‘Why do you not endorse Ron DeSantis for President?' Right? 


	This is going to create more openness, more honesty. It's just going to clarify the relationship between pastors and their parishioners. Our politics and our religion in America could use more honesty, could use more openness, and could use more clarity on issues like this that matter. 

	











Folks are pointing to this ruling as a further collapse of the wall between church and state. Does that trouble you?


	We do a lot of work to try to stem Christian nationalism. We are deeply afraid of that. Some Republicans think that there's no way to be Christian without being a Christian nationalist. And some Democrats think there's no way to be talking about faith without also becoming Christian nationalists. Those things are not the same! 


	There are Christian nationalists. They are a real problem. We need to respond to them. But that doesn't mean you should just take the near 80 percent religious identity of America that is Christian, and say: Don't talk about it. Ignore it. It has not worked well for Democrats. And anything that gets us to a place that lessens the disadvantage that is faced by Democrats is a good thing.


What about your faith tradition leads you to believe the Democrats are a natural fit with religious voters?


	The particular movement from the hyper-neocon conservatives, through the Tea Party, now into MAGA — that whole continuum has become toxic in its narrative about the American people's relationship with one another. It's pitting people as good guys and bad guys, and patriots and enemies, in a way that is just really volatile. Not only to the American story, but really to the Christian story — as people try to recognize that loving one another is essential, whether that be with your neighbor, or your enemy, or yourself.

	We ask candidates and voters to consider making a love-in-politics pledge. If people come from the Christian tradition, we ask them to look at the section on love from the book of First Corinthians. Love is patient; love is kind; love is gentle; love is self control. And we say, if you see any of that in the current political movement on the Republican side, then feel free to vote your conscience. And if you don't? Don't feel that somebody's forcing you to do that because of some version of your faith. 


	Look, religious people don't vote for Donald Trump because they think he's like them. They vote for Donald Trump because he keeps telling them that he likes them. Democrats keep saying, We don't even recognize you. And that's that's the problem. The problem for Democrats is not about policy, because most religious people don't think a lot about policy. It's about identity and where you feel welcomed. And Democrats seemingly work really hard to try to say to religious people, We don't care one bit about your religion. Give us your vote. But please don't think about how religious you are when you're doing it. It doesn't make a lot of sense.

	President Donald Trump took to Truth Social on Saturday to support Attorney General Pam Bondi while chastising his “so-called ‘friends'” in MAGA for caring about Jeffrey Epstein, and making demands for her to release files related to Epstein, “a guy who never dies,” he wrote. The definitely dead mogul and convicted sex offender died while in prison in 2019.


	“They're all going after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is doing a FANTASTIC JOB! We're on one Team, MAGA, and I don't like what's happening. We have a PERFECT Administration, THE TALK OF THE WORLD, and ‘selfish people' are trying to hurt it, all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein,” Trump wrote on Saturday, July 12 in a lengthy screed on Truth Social.


	On Sunday, the Department of Justice released in a memo alleging that Epstein had killed himself, that his “client list” does not exist, and that the administration was pretty much closing the case, which has sparked a lot of conspiracy theories around his 2019 death in prison and the alleged client list. The memo drop was an about-face from what Trump promised before the election, when he said his administration would release the so-called Epstein files.

	In February, Bondi told Fox News that Epstein's client list was “sitting on my desk right now to review. That's been a directive by President Trump. I'm reviewing that.” A week later, the Justice Department released a “first phase” of Epstein files, and officials brought right-wing influencers to the White House to collect the report in person, an episode that embarrassed the administration when the files contained no new information. In March, she said “everything's going to come out to the public,” and accused the Biden administration of “sitting” on the documents. 

	











	Predictably, MAGA heard the siren call of a conspiracy case seemingly closed without resolve and got big mad. Many prominent right-wingers were outraged and some even called on Bondi to be fired, and it's been an unshakable issue within the Trump administration.

	On Saturday, Trump, who definitely seems to care himself about the Epstein files that he claims “nobody cares” about, had his own spin on the Epstein files, baselessly claiming they were written by a slew of Democrats and political adversaries and critics,  including former President Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired during his first term.


	“For years, it's Epstein, over and over again. Why are we giving publicity to Files written by Obama, Crooked Hillary, Comey, Brennan, and the Losers and Criminals of the Biden Administration, who conned the World with the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, 51 ‘Intelligence' Agents, ‘THE LAPTOP FROM HELL,' and more?” Trump claimed.


	“They created the Epstein Files, just like they created the FAKE Hillary Clinton/Christopher Steele Dossier that they used on me, and now my so-called ‘friends' are playing right into their hands,” he continued. “Why didn't these Radical Left Lunatics release the Epstein Files? If there was ANYTHING in there that could have hurt the MAGA Movement, why didn't they use it? They haven't even given up on the John F. Kennedy or Martin Luther King, Jr. Files.”


	The much-sensationalized and mostly unsubstantiated Steele dossier, compiled by British spy Christopher Steele, alleged connections between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia during his bid against Clinton.


	Trump then beckoned his base in an all-caps “LET PAM BONDI DO HER JOB — SHE'S GREAT!” while also claiming the left is “imploding.” He added that current FBI Director Kash Patel should focus on “investigating Voter Fraud, Political Corruption, ActBlue, The Rigged and Stolen Election of 2020, and arresting Thugs and Criminals,” all favorite issues of his base. He concluded by writing, “Let's not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about.”

	For days, several Trump administration officials and senior aides have been privately communicating with MAGA influencers and other prominent Epstein files obsessives who they've known for years, trying — largely in vain — to convince them to lay off the Epstein issue, post-memo release, according to sources with direct knowledge of the matter.

	











	Trump's social media post on Saturday is unlikely to quell any of this intra-MAGA unrest over his administration's alleged lack of transparency on this issue.

	One Trump administration official tells Rolling Stone on Saturday evening: “He is making it very hard for some of his biggest supporters to not think that maybe he really is in the Epstein files.”


	Another longtime Trump associate simply says: “awful damage control instincts.”

	White House “border czar” Tom Homan and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem played good cop, bad cop at a right-wing conference on Saturday. Both continued to push President Donald Trump administration's agenda to ramp up Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and raids as it attacks undocumented migrants across the U.S. 


	While Noem began her speech with prayer, Homan struck a threatening tone toward protesters. There were several dozen protesters gathered outside the event, according to photos from Fox News. “You know what? I'm sick of the assholes. You want some? Come get some,” he said, adding that a heckler in the audience “ain't got the balls to be an ICE officer.”


	As top immigration officials in Trump's administration, Noem and Homan are the TV spokespeople for the president's sweeping, militarized immigration crackdown and his campaign of arbitrary arrests by masked, undercover agents. These operations are likely to expand to more blue cities now that Congress just gave ICE tens of billions of dollars to hire 10,000 more agents. Homan said Friday on Fox News that ICE does not need probable cause and can detain people based on “physical appearance.” 

	











	Noem and Homan spoke at the weekend-long Student Action Summit held in Tampa Bay by Turning Point USA — the far-right, Christian nationalist group founded by Charlie Kirk, who is slated to close out the summit on Sunday afternoon. The event also featured Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard; political commentator and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson; Riley Gaines, a former swimmer and transphobe who's mad about tying for 5th place with a trans woman at a swim meet; and actor Russell Brand, who became a right-wing Christian following sexual misconduct allegations. He delivered an energetic, chaotic speech about how he no longer speaks with his “groin.”

	“My whole career speaking from my midriff,” he said, before Homan came on.


	Homan had glowing reviews of the Trump administration. “Unlike the last administration,” Homan said, “President Trump's policies are saving lives every day, and I wake up like a kid in a candy shop every day I'm working with this guy. And every day is an adventure, because I knew he's going to let us do what we do to not only secure the border but remove millions of illegal aliens that Joe Biden let in this country.”

	Toward the beginning of Homan's speech, he was interrupted by a heckler, who asked if Homan was a member of MS-13. The audience booed and then Homan led them in a chant of “USA! USA!”


	“This guy wouldn't know what it's like to serve his nation,” he said. “This guy ain't got the balls to be an ICE officer. He hasn't got the balls to be a border patrol agent. This guy lives in his mother's basement. The only thing that surprised me, you don't have purple hair and a nose ring. Get out of here, you loser. And if you're such a badass, meet me off stage in 13 minutes and 50 seconds.”


	“I guarantee you he sits down to pee,” Homan added.


	Trump's border czar came back to the topic of protesters several times in his speech. “If these protesters, these people with purple hair with a nose ring who live in their parents' basement, who don't work and want to go protest us, or getting paid by people if they think they're going to stop ICE or stop Border Patrol from doing their job, they got another thing coming, because every time they double down, we're going to triple down.” 


	The Trump administration is leading an unprecedented mass deportation campaign targeting immigrants, and the president sent in National Guard troops and Marines into Los Angeles following protests against ICE's arrests at worksites and courthouses.

	Noem, who leads the Department of Homeland Security and thus oversees ICE and mass arrests and deportation of migrants, offered a religious speech, at a time when Christian leaders are increasingly condemning Trump and Republicans' immigration policies. She began by offering a prayer for law enforcement officers. 


	“Grateful we come before you, extremely thankful for the blessings that you have given us, Lord, recognizing that we are a privileged people living in the greatest experiment on Earth, Lord,” she said. “You have given us a country that defends our freedoms and our liberties.”

	Noem, who, again, is indiscriminately deporting and incarcerating people, said everyone is “worth something in God's eyes,” as part of a longer message about George Washington.  


	“George Washington put his faith first, and then he called people to fight,” she said. “He called them to go out there and to act as Christians, to go out there and to defend our rights and our freedoms. But when you go forward and do that with morals and with values, and understand that every person out there is worth something in God's eyes, but yet we can disagree with them and still protect our freedoms and liberties. That's invaluable. And the general that gave us this country and became our first president understood it better than anybody else.”

	Rosie O'Donnell responded to Donald Trump's threats to revoke her citizenship in a pointed message to the president that the actress shared on social media.


	Trump previously warned that O'Donnell — who was born in America but currently resides in Ireland — “is not in the best interests of our Great Country” and “I am giving serious consideration to taking away her Citizenship. She is a Threat to Humanity, and should remain in the wonderful Country of Ireland, if they want her.”


	O'Donnell, who has long been critical of Trump, fired back at the threat in a lengthy message to the president that she posted on Instagram, alongside a photo of Trump and Jeffrey Epstein. “You call me a threat to humanity – but I'm everything you fear: a loud woman, a queer woman, a mother who tells the truth, an American who got out of the country b4 u set it ablaze,” O'Donnell wrote.

A post shared by Rosie O'Donnell (@rosie)


	“You are everything that is wrong with America – and I'm everything you hate about what's still right with it. You want to revoke my citizenship? Go ahead and try, King Joffrey with a tangerine spray tan,” she added, referencing the Game of Thrones villain.

	In an interview with Ireland's RTE on Sunday, O'Donnell said she “didn't take [Trump's attack] personally,” as the president is frequently picking fights with celebrities that don't agree with him.


	“There's a long list of celebrities he's threatened, including Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift, Meryl Streep, Robert De Niro, Mark Ruffalo,” O'Donnell said. “There are activists, artists who have always spoken out in their lives and career[s]. It's part of their public persona and their essence, and he's against all of us.”

	O'Donnell, who moved to Ireland following Trump's re-election, added of her decision to leave America, “I needed to keep myself healthy and alive and mentally stable enough to raise an autistic child. And that's the reason I left. I left because I love the United States of America, not because I don't.”


	She added, “I love democracy and what it stands for. I love the Constitution. I love what our founding fathers represented and made in this world as a beacon of hope and freedom for the rest of the world… But until we own what is true about our country and ourselves, we're never going to be able to move forward – and until we own what is true about Donald Trump”

T
ucked away in a hillside garden a short walk from the restive heart of Port-au-Prince, the Hotel Oloffson was a strange kind of refuge. Through good years and a lot of bad ones, it stayed open to all comers, welcoming despite its dark undertones and somehow immune to Haiti's political strife. A favorite haunt of artists, celebrities, and local intelligentsia, along with aid workers and journalists needing a stiff rum punch to ease the day's stress, the Gothic gingerbread mansion weathered brutal bouts of violence and natural disasters to become the most storied hotel in the Caribbean. Mick Jagger and Jackie Kennedy Onassis were guests, and it was a centerpiece in Graham Greene's classic novel The Comedians about the terrors of dictatorship. Later, it was reborn as a bohemian jam-hall where diverse crowds pulsed to Vodou-rock rhythms deep into the night. After the 2010 earthquake leveled much of the capital, the Oloffson was one of the few hotels left standing. The music went on. And the faithful kept coming back, even as the country descended into lawlessness.

	











	Last weekend, the armed gangs that have a stranglehold on Port-au-Prince burned the hotel to the ground. In recent months the gangs have attacked schools, hospitals, libraries, a historic radio station, and the offices of the country's oldest newspaper, part of a “very clear and obvious effort to erase all these institutions,” says Haitian American writer Edwidge Danticat, who grew up poor in the capital's Bel Air neighborhood. “[The Oloffson] was a bridge — a space for connection where different worlds could meet.” While the hotel may be just one more building, “it's a symbol of something that once might have been left alone,” she adds. “If this place that is so well-known — an international treasure — could not be protected, how much protection is there for ordinary people in Port-au-Prince right now?”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Owner Richard Morse told Rolling Stone the Oloffson had been closed since March, when members of the Viv Ansanm (Live Together) gang alliance raided the property after gun battles with police that had forced area residents and hotel staff to flee. Morse still hoped to reopen one day. But after watching a social-media video of the hotel aflame in the night, he asked a friend to do a drone flyover to check it out. “When he called me back, he said: ‘I think you better have a seat,'” says Morse. Aerial footage revealed a smoldering ruin.

	The sudden, total loss was a gut punch to the Morse family and generations of hotel patrons who enjoyed camaraderie and music at the Oloffson, no matter the troubles beyond its walls. “We're heartbroken,” says Isabelle Morse, Richard's daughter. “It touched so many people: artists, journalists, writers, rich, poor, Black, white, local, international, gay, straight; it was home to all. Everyone has a piece of memory attached to it, and they have no place to go anymore. It feels like somebody died.” Filmmaker Richard Sénécal put it bluntly in a post on X: “What nature couldn't destroy in nearly a century, barbarism and savagery by our fellow Haitians burned it down in one night.”


	The United Nations estimates the gangs now control 90 percent of the capital, which edges closer to collapse in a vacuum of international apathy and government infighting. Kenyan forces deployed to assist national police have had little impact, undermanned and outgunned by high-powered weapons smuggled in from the U.S. and the Dominican Republic. Nearly 5,000 people have been killed in the last nine months. And with the gangs expanding into new parts of the country, more than 1.3 million are uprooted from their homes, the highest total on record. Soaring costs and drastic aid cuts have left a million children to suffer critical levels of food insecurity.


	“So much devastation in the country, so many people getting killed, so many people getting raped — and so many people focusing on a hotel,” Morse says by phone from his home in Maine. “A lot of things are making me really angry. But I guess the bottom line is: If the hotel is going to attract attention to the people that need it, then I guess that's a positive thing.”

	Few establishments are as steeped in history and political intrigue. Built in the late 19th century, it was initially a private residence for the Sams, a powerful family that produced two Haitian presidents, one of whose killing at the hands of a mob spurred the U.S. military to intervene. During the 19-year occupation, it was used as a hospital by Marines until forces withdrew and Werner Gustav Oloffson, a Swedish sea captain, converted the grounds into a hotel in 1935. The Grand Hotel Oloffson, as it was then known, became jet-set famous after the 1950s, when a French photographer bought the hotel and attracted the likes of Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando, Tennessee Williams, and Graham Greene, some whose names adorned the guest rooms. 

	











	Greene immortalized the hotel in The Comedians, a haunting novel about life under dictator François “Papa Doc” Duvalier and his dreaded paramilitary goons, the Tonton Macoute. “With its towers and balconies and wooden fretwork decorations it had the air at night of a Charles Addams house in a number of The New Yorker,” Greene wrote. “You expected a witch to open the door to you or a maniac butler, with a bat dangling from the chandelier behind him.” The book was adapted into a 1967 film starring Taylor and Richard Burton, but Hollywood glamor was no match for the Duvalier nightmare. When tourism to Haiti dried up, the hotel was left to resident aid workers and journalists; and Aubelin Jolicoeur, the dapper Haitian newspaper columnist who inspired the Greene character “Petit Pierre.” Impossible to miss in a white linen suit and paisley ascot, Jolicoeur was a fixture at the hotel for four decades — an in-house attraction who trafficked in gossip and signaled his arrival each day by tapping the floor with his gold-tipped cane.


	Morse took over the lease in 1987 after the fall of the Duvalier regime. The son of a Caribbean scholar and a beloved Haitian entertainer, Morse says he'd learned how to mix art and business while working in New York for Steve Rubell, the co-founder of Studio 54, and set about transforming the Oloffson into a vibrant cultural space. Dropping the “Grand” from the hotel's name to make it more democratic, he renovated the mahogany bar, added more rooms, and installed a Haitian roots-music band that he named RAM, after his initials. As songwriter-cum-conductor, Morse helmed a rotating cast of musicians and dancers. His future wife, Lunise, became lead female vocalist. (His son William later joined as lead guitarist.) 


	By the early 1990s, RAM's Thursday night concerts were wildly popular, marathon affairs charged with increasingly brazen protests against the military junta that ousted president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. “The band thought, ‘Man, we are invincible,' you know? ‘We can say whatever we want because no one's messing with us,'” recalls Morse. “And then at some point in ‘94 they started threatening us. People started following us around thinking that the [U.S.] invasion would be triggered by me getting killed.” In September of that year, 25,000 U.S. troops surged into Haiti to restore democracy and the hotel enjoyed its most profitable run, though trouble was never far. A 1998 assassination attempt during Kanaval claimed the lives of eight supporters.

	











	On Jan. 12, 2010, Haiti was hit with a magnitude 7.0 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people and destroyed vast swaths of the capital. Damaged but unbroken, the Oloffson emerged as a hub for relief workers and journalists who poured in from around the world. Morse served as an essential source of information on RAM's Twitter feed, and held a free concert three months after the quake on the hotel lawn; thousands showed up. The band would continue to perform regularly to a packed house, a steady drumbeat for Haiti's recovery. The Oloffson stage also hosted big-name performers, from Preservation Hall Jazz Band and Jackson Browne to Jimmy Buffett and Arcade Fire. “Hotel Oloffson was a hotel on the surface, but it was really a temple, a refuge at the crossroads of culture, music, and social justice,” says Arcade Fire's Régine Chassagne. “It was an inn for the NGO workers and writers, people passing through, who all had Haiti at heart.”


	As reconstruction staggered along, armed gangs thrived during the 2011 to 2016 presidency of Michel Martelly. A cousin of Morse's, Martelly armed and financed gangs to extend his power and traffic drugs, laying some of the groundwork for the plague that now grips the country. (Morse served for a time in Martelly's administration but quit in 2013, citing corruption and mismanagement.) Morse says the Oloffson was deemed to be in a high-risk “red zone,” and foreign staff were either forbidden or discouraged from patronizing the hotel. The July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse plunged the country into greater chaos. And the Covid-19 pandemic brought business to a standstill.


	During a May 2023 trip to report on the gang war, I stopped by the hotel one afternoon for lunch. Its iron gates remained open and unguarded, the courtyard overgrown and prowled by dogs. The familiar statue of Baron Samedi, Vodou's top hat-wearing master of the dead, greeted me at the base of the staircase, but the bar was empty save for Madame Jeudy, its stalwart manager. I ordered a plate of poulet créole and wandered around the dining room taking in the art and curios. Out on the balcony a painter was at work touching up the facade, a small hedge against the decay. It didn't matter that the food took an hour to arrive. A faint sea breeze cut the heat, and I was glad to be off the streets.


	“The Oloffson was always a safe haven,” says Neil Brandvold, an American filmmaker who had to run from trouble in Port-au-Prince on more than one occasion over the years. “As long as you got through the front gates of the Oloffson, everyone left you alone. Just the respect for Richard and the hotel as an institution … It was sort of protected from the gangs and their violence.” On Brandvold's last visit, in late 2023, however, some attempted kidnappings in the municipal cemetery forced him to cut filming short. He holed up in the hotel for several days with a photographer watching gunfights flare through the night. “I think we were the last people to stay there.”

	In February, I ran into Morse at a heavily guarded hotel in Pétionville, a suburb of the capital. Commercial flights had been shut down for months and travel around Port-au-Prince was a roll of the dice. Morse told me he'd nevertheless walked down to the Oloffson out of habit, stopping to take selfies with fans along the way, until friends insisted it was too dangerous to go back again. Most members of RAM have since relocated to the northern city of Cap Haitien to keep making music. For his part, Morse released a new song the day before the Oloffson burned down, titled, “We Want Justice.” A cry for Haiti, and all that's wrong in the world.  


	“He's devastated — probably the most devastated of us all,” says Isabelle Morse. “That was our living room. The music, the characters, the people who kept coming back, all that he did to keep it alive and make it this place of resistance and freedom in a place that's so hard to do that. He spent his whole life doing it. And now it's gone.”

	Andy Greene



	It took 46 years, 14 albums, five Grammy Awards, well over 1,000 live renditions of “Fat,” and way too many Hawaii shirts to even contemplate counting, but “Weird Al” Yankovic finally took the stage at Madison Square Garden on Saturday evening as part of his biggest tour ever. It was an overwhelming moment for the song parody icon who spent the vast majority of his career playing venues roughly a quarter the size of the famed New York City arena, and he took a break from the carefully choreographed show after just a few songs to soak it in.


	“Often times really big moments in your life come and go so quickly that you can't really enjoy them while you're in them,” he said as he stared out at the capacity crowd, many of whom wore Hawaiian shirts or even curly-haired wigs and faux-mustaches. “Just 149 more [shows] and I'll be all tied up with Billy Joel.”


	When Joel played the first of those 150 MSG shows back in 1978, Yankovic was taking courses at California Polytechnic State University, spinning records on the campus radio station, and sending homemade parody songs to the Dr. Demento Radio Show. He made his professional debut the following year with the Knack parody “My Bologna.”

	











	Not a single person on the planet, Yankovic included, thought this would be the start of a half-century career that would take him to Madison Square Garden in 2025. It's one of the most wildly improbable sagas in the history of popular music. And even though there hasn't been a new “Weird Al” album or song parody since 2014's Mandatory Fun, his popularity has spiked thanks to the brilliant 2022 biopic spoof Weird: The Al Yankovic Story, and the simple fact that he's been at this so long his original fans now come to the shows with their kids or even their grandkids.

	











	Throughout the last decade, Yankovic played around with the format of his concerts by either ignoring his famous song parodies completely in favor of deep cuts (the 2018 and 2022/23 Ridiculously Self-Indulgent, Ill-Advised Vanity Tours) or teaming up with local orchestras (the 2019 Strings Attached Tour). On the ongoing Bigger and Weirder tour, he's gone back to the classic formula of beloved song parodies, costume changes, and video interludes. But he's turned it into an arena-ready bonanza by supplementing his longtime five-piece band with four additional musicians, including Probyn Gregory, a multi-instrumentalist who spent about 25 years in Brian Wilson's backing band.

	The full potential of this expanded band was clear on opening numbers “Tacky,” “Mission Statement,” and “Polkamania!,” where Yankovic raced through tunes by Adele, Bruno Mars, Miley Cyrus, Lil Nas X, and Taylor Swift in breakneck fashion. The show shifted into another gear when they recreated the “Smells Like Teen Spirit” video in “Smells Like Nirvana,” complete with cheerleaders, and Gregory playing the part of the janitor. They followed it up by strapping on red energy domes and yellow hazmat suites for the Devo spoof “Dare To Be Stupid.”


	Yankovic has way too many song parodies to fit into a single show, so he created a super medley that stuffed together bits of “Bedrock Anthem,” “I Love Rocky Road,” “Party in the CIA,” “It's All About the Pentiums,” “My Bologna,” “Ode to a Superhero,” and “Eat It” all together. That last one was a mild surprise since he's avoided his Michael Jackson parodies over the past few years due the revelations of Finding Neverland, and simple exhaustion after playing them every show going back to the Eighties.


	Yankovic and the band cleared the stage after the parody medley, and the beginning of the “Fat” video played on the screen. (It was a beautiful sight watching 15,000 or so people screaming out “Ding Dong, man, Ding Dong.”) Inevitably, Yankovic waddled back out in his famous “Fat” suit and bounced around the stage as he belted out the 1988 hit.

	We should pause here and note that even though Yankovic has looked roughly 45 for the past quarter century, he's now 65-years-old. But the strength of his voice is practically undiminished, and he showed not a hint of fatigue throughout the extended set even though he's hitting 67 cities on this tour, often playing three or four consecutive nights without break. It's a testament to a lifetime of clean living and his strict vegetarian diet that he's able to do this.

	











	The only real missteps of the night were his baffling decision to play the theme songs to both the 2017 Captain Underpants movie, and the 2016 Disney show Milo Murphy's Law. These may have been gestures to the many kids in the audience, but they came off like live trailers to two deeply forgettable animated projects. (They also took up space where we could have heard something like “The Night Santa Went Crazy,” “Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies” or “The Biggest Ball of Twine in Minnesota.”)


	On the Ill-Advised Vanity Tour, Yankovic always stuck in a random cover song that he delivered without any attempt at parody. He kept the tradition alive at MSG by playing Paul Simon's “You Can Call Me Al,” complete with a recreation of Chevy Chase's horn choreography from the video.


	The main set ended with gleeful renditions of “White & Nerdy” and “Amish Paradise” that had much of the crowd on their feet. They remained there after the encore break as the stage filled up with members of the band and crew dressed as Storm Troopers, Darth Vader, Sith Lords, Jedis, and Princess Leah. This could have only meant “The Saga Begins” and “Yoda” to close out the night.


	If anyone happened to stumble into Madison Square Garden at this moment, they would have thought this was the world's weirdest Star Wars fan convention. A mechanized R2D2 was even roving around the stage. But to the “Weird Al” fan community, this was a sacred encore ritual that goes back decades. It's been staged at innumerable casinos, state fairs, indoor theaters, and outdoor amphitheaters throughout Yankovic's live career. To finally witness it at the world's most prestigious arena was absolutely glorious.


	It was just one stop on a tour that will help him on the road through late September. (We urge everyone to arrive early to see opening act Puddles Pity Party, a singing clown with a strong YouTube following. His hysterical set culminates with a performance of the Gilligan's Theme song set to the tune of “Stairway To Heaven” as images from the 1995 Kevin Costner box office clop Waterworld flash on the screen.)


	Yankovic hasn't announced any plans once the tour wraps, but let's hope he eventually starts releasing new song parodies. We'll never tire of hearing the oldies live in concert, but he's really going to cede the entire space to randos on YouTube? We just have to imagine his Chappell Roan, Billie Eilish, and Morgan Wallen spoofs in our heads? 

	











	It's a frustrating situation for longtime fans, but maybe it's a little greedy to want more from a man who has already given the pop culture world so much. And now that he's sold out Madison Square Garden, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame should consider finally placing his name on the ballot. It's time. He's earned it.

If humans are ever going to live beyond Earth, they'll need to construct habitats. But transporting enough industrial material to create livable spaces would be incredibly challenging and expensive. Researchers at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) think there's a better way, through biology.

An international team of researchers led by Robin Wordsworth, the Gordon McKay Professor of Environmental Science and Engineering and Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences, have demonstrated that they can grow green algae inside shelters made out of bioplastics in Mars-like conditions. The experiments are a first step toward designing sustainable habitats in space that won't require bringing materials from Earth.

“If you have a habitat that is composed of bioplastic, and it grows algae within it, that algae could produce more bioplastic,” explained Wordsworth. “So you start to have a closed-loop system that can sustain itself and even grow through time.”

The research is published in Science Advances.

Growing algae in Mars-like conditions

In lab experiments that recreated the thin atmosphere of Mars, Wordsworth's team grew a common type of green algae called Dunaliella tertiolecta. The algae thrived inside a 3D-printed growth chamber made from a bioplastic called polylactic acid, which was able to block UV radiation while transmitting enough light to allow the algae to photosynthesize.

The algae was kept under a Mars-like 600 Pascals of atmospheric pressure – over 100 times lower than Earth's — and in a carbon dioxide-rich environment, as opposed to mostly nitrogen and oxygen like on Earth. Liquid water cannot exist at such low pressures, but the bioplastic chamber created a pressure gradient that stabilized water within it. The experiments point to bioplastics as potentially key to creating renewable systems for maintaining life in a lifeless environment.

The concept the researchers demonstrated is closer to how organisms grow naturally on Earth, and it contrasts with an industrial approach using materials that are costly to manufacture and recycle.

Humans living in space

Wordsworth's team previously demonstrated a type of local Martian terraforming using sheets of silica aerogels that mimic the Earth's greenhouse warming effect to allow for biological growth. A combination of the algae experiments with the aerogels would solve both temperature and pressure issues for supporting plant and algae growth, Wordsworth said, and could open a clearer path toward extraterrestrial existence.

Next, Wordsworth said the researchers want to demonstrate that their habitats also work in vacuum conditions, which would be relevant for lunar or deep-space applications. His team also has plans to design a working closed-loop system for habitat production.

“The concept of biomaterial habitats is fundamentally interesting and can support humans living in space,” Wordsworth said. “As this type of technology develops, it's going to have spinoff benefits for sustainability technology here on Earth as well.”

The research was supported by the Leverhulme Center for Life in the University grant, the Harvard Origins of Life Grant, and the National Science Foundation (NSF-2100509). Co-authors were Rafid Quayum, Elida Kocharian, Ann Pearson, Xavier Portillo, Madeleine Yang, Charles S. Cockell, Shannon Nangle, and George Church.

In humanity's eternal quest to find life beyond Earth, we may finally have a telescope that can spot not just planets—but oceans. On Earth, water is inseparable from life. It shapes our landscapes, carves canyons, forms clouds, and pulses through every living cell. It is no surprise, then, that our search for life elsewhere in the universe has become, at its core, a search for water. But while we've found thousands of exoplanets orbiting distant stars—some even within the so-called “Goldilocks zone” where temperatures might allow for liquid water—one critical detail has eluded us: proof. Are there truly oceans out there, shimmering beneath alien suns? NASA's proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) may soon be able to answer that question.

When light strikes a surface, the way it reflects depends on what that surface is made of. Rough, solid surfaces scatter light in all directions—a diffuse reflection. But liquids, with their smooth, mirror-like texture, reflect light in a way called specular reflection. On Earth, this is why a body of water can look dark and flat from one angle, but shimmer like a mirror from another. When the Sun hits it just right, that glint is unmistakable.

The Habitable Worlds Observatory is designed to capture this very phenomenon—not on Earth, but on exoplanets tens to hundreds of light-years away. If a distant world has oceans, they will reflect starlight in a distinctive, directional pattern. By watching how that light changes as the planet rotates or orbits its star, the HWO could piece together not only that liquid water is present—but where it pools on the surface. “Planets with large bodies of water on their surface will have more temperate and stable climates,” Cowan and his co-authors write. “Such planets are the ideal places for life-as-we-know-it to arise and evolve.”

“Earth's Core Is Acting Up”: NASA Links Planet-Wide Disturbance to Mysterious Energy Surge Emerging From Deep Within the Mantle



The beauty of the method lies in time—specifically, how a planet's brightness changes over time as it spins and moves through different phases of illumination. On a rotating planet like Earth, different features come into view with each turn. Oceans, continents, cloud systems—they all reflect light differently. The HWO will perform something akin to time-lapse photography from space, measuring how the reflectance of a planet varies over hours, days, even seasons. When a watery surface turns toward the right angle, it reflects light with a brilliance not seen in rocky terrain. That glint, carefully teased from the surrounding noise, could reveal a surface ocean.

These changes aren't just visible in brightness—they show up in polarization as well. At crescent phases, when a planet is backlit by its star, water-rich surfaces tend to polarize light in unique, detectable ways. In other words, oceans don't just shine—they whisper their presence through the alignment of light waves. Detecting it requires not just powerful optics, but stability and patience. The HWO will need to record high-precision, time-resolved measurements over long periods.

“Space Needs Nuclear Now”: This New Global Race to Harness Atomic Power Beyond Earth Is Accelerating Faster Than Expected



Earth has taught us much, but it's also revealed the complications. Our own atmosphere is often cloaked in cloud cover—so thick, in fact, that any attempt to map our oceans from a light-year away would be muddled by ever-changing clouds. Exoplanets, too, will likely have clouds—and those clouds will obscure parts of the surface, alter the reflected light, and complicate the story the data tells. The HWO's team knows this and is building models to work around it. Cloud-free regions can still reveal surface features, and by observing over time, the telescope may be able to average out the impact of variable weather systems.

Instrumental precision will be key. The authors emphasize that for rotational mapping to work, the telescope must be stable over the timescale of a planet's rotation—likely somewhere between 10 to 100 hours. That kind of stability is achievable, but photometric precision—measuring tiny changes in brightness—remains the telescope's biggest challenge. Four or more separate measurements per planetary rotation will likely be needed.

“NASA Sounds the Alarm”: Sudden Planet-Wide Disturbance Linked to Mysterious Subterranean Energy Surge Now Spreading Without Warning



Many potentially habitable exoplanets orbit red dwarf stars, and many of those planets are tidally locked—meaning one side always faces the star in unending daylight, while the other remains in perpetual night. That's not a death sentence for habitability. If the planet has a thick atmosphere or large oceans, heat could circulate efficiently. For tidally locked worlds, specular reflection might actually be easier to detect. Since the surface features never rotate out of view, any reflection from oceans would remain fixed relative to the planet's orbit. Over time, this stability could help astronomers isolate the signal from noise.

By observing how the brightness and polarization of reflected light change as the planet orbits its star, the HWO could identify oceans even on these strange, unmoving worlds. A mirror that never turns still shines, if you know when to look.

Discovering an ocean on an exoplanet would be more than just a scientific achievement—it would be a revelation. It would prove that conditions for life exist beyond Earth in a tangible, observable way. It would mean that somewhere, under a star not so different from our own, waves might be lapping at a rocky shore. NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory is still in the proposal stage. It has not yet been approved, funded, or built. But its vision is clear. If launched, it would not be alone. Europe's Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) will soon begin observations from the ground, and other proposed missions—like the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE)—may complement the HWO's efforts. In the end, the question is no longer if we'll find water among the stars. It's when. Could this discovery change our understanding of life in the universe?

Wow, this is like something out of a sci-fi movie! 🌌 Can't wait to see what we find!

Is the HWO already funded, or are we still waiting on that?

Entertainment Critic

Another day, another Stephen King adaptation—this time, of the prolific author's 2019 thriller The Institute. 

The story of a group of children who are kidnapped by a mysterious organization for seemingly malevolent purposes, King's novel is a hybrid of his own Firestarter and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. From its unique terminology to its cold, menacing atmosphere, Benjamin Cavell's MGM+ series (July 13) is as faithful as they come. 

Yet like its source, it's a saga that's short on real sparks, treading such well-worn supernatural territory that even the best efforts of stars Ben Barnes and Mary Louise Parker aren't enough to make it more than a passable entry in the ever-burgeoning King-to-screen catalogue.

From the outside, 14-year-old Jake Ellis (Joe Freeman) looks like the rest of his Timberwolves-loving Minneapolis peers. In reality, however, he's a child prodigy who's on the cusp of receiving an opportunity to attend MIT that will force his parents to uproot their lives and relocate to New England. That's not to be, since one evening Jake is snatched from his bed, and when he awakens, he's in a facsimile of his room that exists in a cold gray building. 

Emerging into a hallway that's covered in strange elementary school-style posters, Jake meets Kalisha (Simone Miller), who explains that he's now a resident of The Institute, whose pre-adult residents are all either TK (telekinetic) or TP (telepathic). Given that objects have a funny habit of moving around Jake when he's upset, this isn't altogether stunning news to the kid, and he's soon welcomed into a group that includes trusting George (Arien So), nervous Iris (Birva Pandya), and rebellious Nicky (Fionn Laird).

As Jake learns, the Institute is run by cunning head honcho Ms. Sigsby (Parker), her ruthless chief of security Stackhouse (Julian Richings), and rational Dr. Hendricks (Robert Joy), who with the assistance of sadistic orderly Tony (Jason Diaz) conducts tests on the kids that are designed to instigate and enhance their extraordinary powers—and, in the best case scenario, reveal them to be PCs (precogs) who can see the future. 

All of this takes place in the Institute's Front Half, after which the captive children graduate to the facility's Back Half and then, supposedly, gain their freedom. Nicky doesn't buy that story, and neither does Luke. From the outset, he's skeptical about everything sold by Ms. Sigsby, whom Parker embodies with a superficial positivity that reeks of deception, not to mention derangement—the latter of which is underscored by an early scene in which, upon returning home from work, she soothes herself by burning her leg with a red-hot wire hanger.

Strange, sinister things are afoot at the Institute, and Cavell's series doles out hints about the organization's true motives at an enticing pace. Those revelations are at once horrible and complex, as well as thematically related to the recent ordeal plaguing former cop Tim Jamieson (Barnes). 

Arriving in small-town Maine with few belongings and no overt purpose, Tim successfully gets a job as the police department's “night knocker,” whose job it is to nocturnally patrol the enclave's streets. This is Tim's way of feeling useful after a traumatic incident in which he shot and killed a kid who was threatening to shoot up a mall. During the course of his duties, he meets officer Wendy (Hannah Galway), to whom he slowly grows closer, and local homeless crank Annie (Mary Walsh), whose intriguing conspiracy theories involve the Institute and psychic phenomena.

Tim and Jake's paths are destined to cross, but The Institute is most captivating when focusing on the latter's plight, which involves bizarre experiments known as “Shots for Dots” that make subjects disturbingly sick and weak. The Institute's combination of pragmatism and cruelty cloaks the proceedings in ominousness, as do Parker and Richings as bureaucratic cogs in a machine that's ultimately cast in quasi-Holocaust terms.

Instead of just a one-note boogeyman nightmare, the show complicates matters by giving its villains a potentially altruistic reason for their monstrousness. While the moral questions raised by their conduct (and motivations) are ultimately discarded in a way that suggests no one involved really cared about them, they nonetheless add a tantalizing layer to the otherwise straightforward material.

What holds The Institute back from generating more suspense is its performances, especially from its greener cast members. Freeman is competent, if lacking the charisma required to elicit real engagement with his suffering. The same goes for Viggo Hanvelt as Avery, the newest and youngest Institute victim, whose abilities are so great that they afford Luke and company a chance to break out of the Institute. 

Their functional turns are a burden the series can't totally overcome, and the visually unimaginative direction by Jack Bender, Brad Turner, and Jeff Renfroe doesn't do them any favor—and, at times, seems to actively work against them. As with the Lumineers' morose credit-sequence cover of Tears for Fears' “Shout,” the flat action is gloomy to a fault.

Like the best-selling novel upon which it's based, The Institute feels a tad too much like reheated leftovers. Stackhouse and Tony are psychos that we've seen before, Tim is the sort of good-hearted hero that King has favored since Salem's Lot, and the plot weaves together its strands in a fashion that will be intensely familiar to the writer's constant readers. 

This isn't to knock those conventions (which remain sturdy and entertaining) so much as to wish that the narrative at hand were more animated and surprising. Even its climactic tragedies feel of a piece with King's prior output—and, in this instance, don't hit as hard as they should as a result of the proceedings' ho-hum Institute protagonists.

Despite its weaknesses, The Institute captures the eerie, constricting mood of the Institute as well as King's issue with the idea that the ends justify the means—even if, perhaps, those means really are in service of the greater good. It's also, by design, an efficiently structured and thankfully self-contained affair, all the way to a finale that leaves little wiggle room for any (unnecessary) follow-up. It may be a middle-of-the-road tale from the Master of Horror, but that's still better than most.

      While running in the park yesterday, I observed 12  black objects on the horizon moving horizontally at a consistent speed, similar to drones. As they passed overhead, they abruptly stopped and ascended vertically into the clouds, one by one, with no apparent pattern. There were no lights or sounds, and I couldn't identify them, even when zooming in with my camera. I'm sharing this to seek feedback and insights on what I may have seen. One or two drones isn't anything weird, but twelve…seems excessive. What would someone achieve with twelve that it can't with one? Why collect weather reports using this method? It all strikes me as odd.

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we spotlight some of our top stories and bring you behind the scenes of our newsroom. This week, we put a big question to BI readers: Can millennial dads really have it all?

Many fathers told us they're feeling burned out trying to excel at work and be fully present at home. I get it. As a dad of two young kids, I do my best to be an active, present, and equal parenting partner. But I also see, every day, just how much of the heavy lifting my wife does.

What's your take on the millennial dad paradox? Is true balance possible—or just a myth we're still chasing? We'd love to hear from you.

On the agenda today:

But first: Side hustle tips from the pros.

Kathleen Elkins is the kind of journalist who preaches what she covers. She's been writing for years about real estate investing, e-commerce entrepreneurs, and side hustles. She has taken this coverage and put it to practical use: Last year, she started her own business selling pickleball paddles online.

Kathleen recently profiled an exclusive group of Amazon sellers making seven figures in annual revenue. (No, she's not a member — maybe one day!) I sat down with Kathleen to learn more about these entrepreneurs and how they achieved their success.

How did you find out about this niche community of thriving Amazon sellers?

A previous source who I keep in touch with is super ingrained in the Amazon seller community and suggested I talk to one of the cofounders of Million Dollar Sellers. She put us in touch, we set up an intro call, and I pretty immediately knew that I wanted to proceed with a story about the community and how one gets into the exclusive club.

What is it like to be a member of this club? How does one get into it, and what are the benefits?

The cofounder I spoke to, Eugene Khayman, told me the two biggest perks of being a member are the Facebook Group and the events. He likened them to ""a family reunion, where you're actually excited to see everybody there."" He knows how difficult and lonely it can feel at times to sell to faceless customers, and the in-person events help him get fired up and gain positive momentum.

What did you learn from these e-commerce sellers that might help you in your own side hustle?

After writing about e-commerce entrepreneurs for years, I decided to give it a go myself, mostly out of curiosity: Can anyone — including a journalist with some savings and a couple of free hours after work — make money selling things online? What does it really take? Turns out, a lot of time and effort. Starting a business, even as a side project, is all-consuming.

I'll leave you with two takeaways: One, I'm going to have to spend money on Amazon ads. Two, keep talking to people in the e-commerce space who know what they're doing and get curious. As Eugene told me, ""It's all about putting yourself in a room with people that are smarter than you.""

For months, mass DOGE layoffs were stalled as a legal battle between the White House and advocacy groups played out. That all changed Tuesday, when the Supreme Court announced it wouldn't stand in the way of the Trump administration.

BI spoke to 16 employees at federal agencies to gauge the reaction. Most used words like ""fear,"" ""uncertainty,"" ""disheartening,"" and ""bleak"" to describe the mood within their agencies. Some expressed concern about their livelihoods and financial security, as well as the future of public service.

""I can't see any of this ending well.""

EDITOR'S NOTE:  Kara Alaimo is an associate professor of communication at Fairleigh Dickinson University. Her book “Over the Influence: Why Social Media Is Toxic for Women and Girls — And How We Can Take It Back” was published in 2024 by Alcove Press. Follow her on Instagram, Facebook and Bluesky.



            Many people try to limit the time they spend on social media when they're with their kids. But new research suggests social media use has a significant effect on interactions with children — even when adults aren't looking at their screens.
    


            Mothers who were in the habit of spending more time on social media talked much less to their kids when they played with them than did moms who spent less time on social networks, and that difference carried over when they weren't using their devices, according to a study to be presented Tuesday at the Digital Media and Developing Minds International Scientific Congress in Washington, DC.
    


            While past research has focused on how kids are affected when parents or guardians are on their screens, this study looked at the impact of cell phone use on parent-child interactions even when parents were offline, said Liz Robinson, a doctoral student at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa and lead author of the study.
    


            Mothers who used social media extensively spoke 29% less to their kids while playing with them — without their phones — compared with the moms whose social media use was low. Moms in the low-use category used social media an average of 21 minutes per day, while moms in the high-use category used social media an average of 169 minutes per day.
    


When kids use screens, parents worry about the wrong thing, new study suggests



            Other uses of screens, including checking email or the weather, weren't associated with talking less to kids, according to the study of 65 toddlers ages 2 through 5 years old and their mothers in Alabama.
    


            Although Robinson's research has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a journal, it doesn't surprise me. In my own research, people often say they still think about what they see on social media long after they log off. Although the moms in this study were physically present with their kids, it's possible their minds were elsewhere.
    


            “Often our minds wander to activities that are more pleasurable naturally, and we know social media is that experience for most people,” said Kris Perry, executive director of Children and Screens: Institute of Digital Media and Child Development, a nonprofit to help kids lead healthy digital lives and the organizer of the Congress.
    


            Perry, who was not involved in the research, pointed out that social networks show us tailored content that is intensely interesting to us, so “it makes you want to experience it longer.”
    


            Whatever the reason, kids need their parents to be mentally present when they play. Thankfully, there are things we can do to make sure our social media use doesn't interfere with our parenting.
    


            One of the most important things parents can do is to talk to their children all the time.
    


            Learning language is “a major feature of optimal child development” and it's “dependent on children expressing and receiving language from birth through (age) 18,” Perry said.
    


            Greater exposure to language tends to improve kids' brain development, academic outcomes, communication skills and language, she said.
    


            The interactions parents and kids have when they play are also important to children's socioemotional development, Robinson said, to help them develop their executive functions and attention spans and learn how to regulate their emotions.
    


            Interacting with adults is also one of the ways children learn what to prioritize. “Kids are acutely aware of where a parent is looking,” Robinson said, “and they learn what's important. So, when our gaze is constantly going towards a device, towards a smartphone, well, we're communicating to our children what's important in that moment, too.”
    


            That's why parents should make a conscious effort to be mentally present when interacting with their kids. “Our attention is one of the best things that we can give to our children,” Robinson said, noting that this conveys  to them that we love them.
    


            Robinson recommended that parents set aside certain times of the day to give their kids undivided attention. That's advice I also give when I speak to parent groups and at schools about how to handle kids' social media use.
    


            Of course, finding this time isn't easy. “None of us can give our kids undivided attention all the time, but it can be helpful to think on a smaller scale,” Robinson said. “Though I have many things to tend to today, I can give my child undivided attention for the next 15 minutes. That focused time goes a long way from the child's perspective.”
    


            When we're with our kids, we can remind ourselves “there is nowhere but here,   and there is no time but now in your child's mind,” Robinson said. “And so, you have many other thoughts and many other priorities that are floating around in your head. But we can compartmentalize those and be fully present with our child, who knows only this moment, and only our attention.”
    


Nearly half of teens say social media is bad for youth mental health, report finds



            Parents should also pay attention to how their social media use is affecting them and their children, Perry said. “Understand what the impact of using social media is on you personally, and make sure that you're mitigating what those impacts are when you go to interact with your child.”
    


            A simple way to do that? Limit the number of times you check it per week and how long you spend on it each time.
    


            “Reduce the amount of time you're on social media to prevent the likelihood that you would even inadvertently speak less” to your child, Perry said. And, of course, using social media less could also free up more time for parents to spend playing with their kids.
    


            Robinson said the biggest limitation of the research is that it's correlational — the authors couldn't establish whether social media was making parents more passive or whether more passive parents were using social media more. In addition, the study couldn't account for factors such as parents' mental health, income and education.
    


            I'd also love to see this study replicated with fathers, who should also be taking responsibility for playing with their kids and using social media responsibly.
    


            Still, the study suggests using social media more could reduce our conversations with our children, and that got me thinking. Next time I play with my daughters, I'll be checking in with myself on whether I'm talking to them or my thoughts are elsewhere.
    


            I'll also be more conscious of how much the content I'm seeing on social media is continuing to play out in my head even after I'm done scrolling. I might even talk to my kids about the changes I make as a result.

Recognising Putin is not serious about peace is first step towards ‘strategic neutralisation' proposed by ex-minister

While Donald Trump – and other western leaders – are taking their time to catch up with reality, it is obvious that Vladimir Putin has no apparent desire to halt the war in Ukraine. A realistic future military and diplomatic strategy for Kyiv has to accept that fact – and formulate a new approach.

The past six months have been dominated by the erroneous assumption that it would be possible for Trump to negotiate a ceasefire, even an armistice. That would be followed by the arrival of an Anglo-French led stabilisation force to secure the future of Ukraine. But Putin has shown no desire to stop attacking.

A fresh Russian ground offensive is emerging towards Velykyi Burluk, 50 miles east of Kharkiv, and for now is making some rare gains: three miles in 10 days. More significantly, the cynical bombing of Ukraine's cities by missile and drone is only intensifying, straining Kyiv's air defences and leading to more civilian casualties.

A record 728 Shahed drones and 13 missiles were launched on the night of 8 July and the next morning, many at Lutsk in the west, though the bombardment of 597 drones and 26 missiles on Friday night and Saturday morning showed no slackening of violent intent. It will be soon possible for Russia to attack with 1,000 drones in a night, Ukraine believes.

In a paper written last month, Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian defence minister, said “an acceptable armistice may never formally arrive” and that Kyiv should formulate “a revised theory of victory” – which accepts that the Kremlin considers itself engaged in a forever war against its smaller neighbour.

The former minister describes the new approach as “strategic neutralisation”, a permanent and dynamic military effort to ensure that Russia's forces cannot advance and that Moscow becomes “operationally incapable of disrupting key aspects of Ukrainian strategic, political, economic, and social life”.

It accepts that Ukraine cannot retake territories already occupied by Moscow, or attack again into Russia, as happened into Kursk oblast last summer, and instead pursues an active defence.

As an example for what might be possible, Zagorodnyuk refers to the situation in the Black Sea. Ukraine, which began the war without a navy, had managed to box in the Russian Black Sea fleet by mid-2023 by successfully sinking and threatening to sink warships with remotely piloted sea drones.

The result is the “functional defeat” of the Russian fleet, a phrase first used by a former British junior defence minister, James Heappey. Kyiv was able to unilaterally reopen a corridor for grain shipments from Odesa and nearby areas in 2023 without having to negotiate a special exemption for such traffic with Russia.

One question is whether strategic neutralisation is possible on land. Russia has struggled to gain territory inside Ukraine during 2025, though it has collapsed the Kursk pocket, and its forces incurred casualty rates (killed and wounded) of about 1,100 a day in June – showing that Kyiv can roughly hold the line largely with the help of £300-£370 ($400-$500) first-person view (FPV) drones that it can manufacture in bulk.

But the strategy goes further. The military aim in such a plan would be to extend the depth of FPV drone operations to 25, 50 or even 100 miles – to create a zone where it is effectively impossible for Russian forces to mass – and even to walk to the frontline. Rather than create a Korean style demilitarised zone, the effect would be to create a highly militarised zone in which Russian forces could not operate, a de facto border.

The already slow rate of Russian advance suggests this approach may be possible, though an important question is what will happen once the last of the US military aid approved by former president Joe Biden tails off. It is also challenged by Russia's expanding volume of missile and drone attacks – which in turn come at a time of growing concern about the amount of available air defence interceptors.

A series of ill-judged signals from the US reveal that the Pentagon is worried about the number of Patriot air defence missiles it has available, probably the single most important air defence system used by Ukraine. Weapons deliveries were halted at the end of last month amid fears US stockpiles were low (perhaps at 25% of the desired levels), though Trump has partially relented, sending a symbolic 10 Patriot missiles last week.

The US president, finally acknowledging that Putin is stalling, has promised a “major announcement” on Monday, which may involve extra sanctions on Russia and allowing European countries to buy more weapons for Kyiv. It would make strategic sense if whatever is offered comes with the recognition that Putin is not serious about peace – and gives Ukraine what it needs to neutralise the aggressor.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","France pledges more autonomy to overseas territory after unrest","https://www.rt.com/news/621400-france-promises-more-autonomy-to/","Sun, 13 Jul 2025 04:13:00 GMT","

France has agreed to grant greater autonomy to its Pacific territory of New Caledonia, stopping short of full independence sought by part of the indigenous Kanak population.

The accord follows unrest in the territory last year, when protests over proposed changes to the voting system escalated into violent clashes that left 14 people dead and caused an estimated €2 billion ($2.3 billion) in damage.

Under the agreement signed on Saturday at the Elysee Palace in Paris, New Caledonia will become the ‘State of New Caledonia', with its status enshrined in the French Constitution. The deal introduces a new nationality status that residents can hold alongside French citizenship, and leaves open the possibility of international recognition for the new entity.

The agreement also includes a financial recovery plan focused on revitalizing the local economy, including a renewal of New Caledonia's nickel processing industry, according to excerpts reviewed by AP. The French Parliament is expected to approve the deal in the fourth quarter of 2025, with a referendum in the territory scheduled for 2026.

“A State of New Caledonia within the Republic: it's a bet on trust,” French President Emmanuel Macron wrote on X, expressing hope for unity and stability.

“The accord will help us get out of the spiral of violence,” Kanak lawmaker Emmanuel Tjibaou said during the signing ceremony.

Home to around 270,000 people, New Caledonia was colonized by France in the 19th century and has seen a long-running independence movement since the 1980s. Three referendums held from 2018 to 2021 all rejected independence, though the final vote was boycotted by pro-independence groups due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Kanak population.

Tensions peaked in May 2024 when Paris proposed granting voting rights to thousands of long-term, non-indigenous residents. Kanak leaders argued that the move would cement their status as a permanent minority and extinguish hopes of future sovereignty. Under the new agreement, voting rights will be restricted to those who have lived in the territory for at least ten years.

DUBAI, July 13. /TASS/. Hamas demanded liquidation of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) managed by Israel and the United States, the Palestinian movement said on its Telegram channel.

""Continuing systemic murders near aid distribution points of Zyonist-American forces <...> affirm their criminal role in the siege, hunger and murders of our people. This requires prompt action of the entire Arab world and the international community to eliminate this ruthless mechanism and call its creators for accountability,"" Hamas said.

The international humanitarian aid is not coming to the Gaza Strip since March 2, 2025. All the checkpoints remain closed by the decision of Israel and food is distributed via the GHF chain of stations.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

A shipment of U.S. wheat intended to feed millions of starving Yemeni civilians has become a stark symbol of how the Trump administration weaponizes humanitarian aid not only to punish geopolitical enemies, but also to stage a hollow performance of compassion while doing so.

Earlier this year, a U.S. cargo ship carrying thousands of tons of wheat departed for Yemen, where an ongoing humanitarian catastrophe has left over 17 million people facing acute food insecurity. The aid could have fed more than 3.2 million people for a month. But after the Trump administration baselessly designated Ansar Allah as a terrorist organization — a move condemned by the United Nations and aid groups as disastrous for civilians — the wheat sat stranded at sea for months. The U.S. effectively blocked its own humanitarian mission, choosing political theater over human lives.

The result? Rotting wheat, wasted aid, and worsening starvation.

But the story doesn't end there. In an apparent attempt to salvage its image, the administration hastily rerouted the decaying wheat shipment to Sudan — a country experiencing widespread starvation and economic collapse due to destabilization by a United Arab Emirates-backed militia. The same administration that imposed unilateral sanctions and an immigration ban on Sudan, restricting financial flows and humanitarian operations, is now attempting to cast itself as a savior of Sudanese civilians.

The move was immediately hailed by Trump officials as a major humanitarian gesture. State Department spokespeople insisted the wheat would serve as a “lifeline” for the Sudanese people. But when the shipment finally arrived in Sudan this month, it was too late. The wheat was completely spoiled.

Dr. Ahmed Issawi, an official with Sudan's Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, confirmed that the shipment was rejected upon arrival. “The wheat was not suitable for human consumption,” he told Truthout. “It was rotten before it reached our port.”

It was an expensive, deadly spectacle.

Aid as a Global Weapon of War

This incident isn't just a breakdown in logistics or communication. It reflects a broader U.S. policy approach that treats humanitarian aid as a tool of geopolitical strategy — where food, medicine, and basic survival are used as leverage for imperial interests. Rather than being guided by human need, aid is distributed, withheld, or rerouted based on political agendas.

Food, medicine, and basic survival are used as leverage for imperial interests. Rather than being guided by human need, aid is distributed, withheld, or rerouted based on political agendas.

In Yemen, this has meant allowing millions to starve under the guise of “counterterrorism.” In Sudan, it means imposing sanctions that destabilize an already devastated economy, while issuing public statements about spoiled aid shipments to feign moral leadership and deflect accountability.

In Gaza, the Trump administration recently outsourced humanitarian aid drops to a private U.S. militia. They offered token amounts of food in a war zone they actively fund and arm, all whilst brutalizing civilians. This spectacle serves not to save lives, but to provide cover for a policy of starvation, forced displacement, and genocide carried out with U.S. complicity.

While the U.S. State Department attempted to spin the rerouting of the wheat to Sudan as a win — telling CNN that “the wheat won't go to waste” — the reality on the ground is different. Sudanese civilians continue to face hyperinflation, food shortages, and rampant malnutrition. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a genocidal militia group that terrorizes civilians, has weaponized hunger by controlling food and telecommunications infrastructure. Recent U.S. sanctions, far from pressuring warlords, serve to isolate Sudanese civilians from the resources they need to survive.

The Trump administration's politicization of humanitarian aid is not a break from U.S. policy tradition but a continuation of how aid has long been used to enforce global power hierarchies. Throughout Sudan's post-colonial history, the United States has positioned itself as the country's primary aid provider — leveraging food, development assistance, and financial relief as tools to shape Sudanese political alignment.

Since the Cold War, the U.S. has used development assistance through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) not only to offer help, but to control. Governments in the Global South were pushed to accept economic reforms that opened their markets to foreign investors, slashed public spending, and left local economies weakened. Sudan, in particular, was forced to restructure its agriculture, liberalize trade, and rely on imports — including imported food.

Whether under the guise of counterterrorism cooperation, structural adjustment demands, or support for democratic transition, U.S. aid has consistently prioritized Washington's geopolitical goals over the Sudanese people's material needs. This legacy of conditional aid is neocolonial at its core: It enforces dependency while maintaining the illusion of benevolence. When Sudan falls out of favor — as it has under the current Trump-era sanctions regime — the very aid that was once touted as support becomes a weapon of coercion or disappears altogether.

The effects of the Trump administration's cuts to U.S. humanitarian aid are now unfolding in full force. In Sudan and across the Global South, millions of people are being pushed to the brink of famine as food, health care, and emergency support vanish when they are needed most. The U.S. yanked the rug out from under countries like Sudan, cutting off lifelines it deliberately made them rely on, just as famine and collapse reach their most devastating point.

According to the Associated Press, recent U.S. budget cuts affect at least 18 million people worldwide who rely on U.S. food assistance. Boston University estimates that the abrupt cuts to USAID have meant nearly 300,000 people have died in the first three months of cuts, more than 200,000 of them children. In Sudan, these cuts have forced humanitarian organizations to halt food distributions just as hunger reaches catastrophic levels, forcing the closure of over 80 percent of the emergency food kitchens. Sudan is now home to the largest hunger crises in the world. The World Food Programme reports that nearly 25 million people — half the country — are facing starvation.

Local aid workers in Sudan are contending with this reality. According to Taysser Dafalla, a humanitarian worker who leads the Hasahisa Community Kitchen, the impact has been immediate and brutal. “Since the cuts, the kitchen has been barely able to continue. We are only operating with the help of diaspora sending money from abroad,” Dafalla told Truthout. “We used to serve hundreds of meals every day. Now, we're lucky if we can feed a quarter of that. The children ask for more, but we have nothing left to give.”

In displacement camps and conflict zones, the collapse of food programs has pushed communities past the breaking point. Adam Rojal, a humanitarian worker from Darfur who is currently volunteering at the Nertiti camp for internally displaced people, described the conditions in stark terms: “Nertiti camp and surrounding villages are experiencing mass starvation. Women are sacrificing themselves to feed their children so they can survive. People are dying of thirst. This is the worst situation we have ever been in.”

Rojal added, “Before, we were already struggling. Now, people are burying loved ones because they haven't eaten. The world needs to know … We are not starving because of nature. There is nothing natural about this.”

Meanwhile, USAID officials reported to Reuters that shipments of food are now sitting unused in warehouses due to budget freezes. Programs meant to support children, maternal health, and food delivery are being delayed or dismantled across multiple crisis zones. This bureaucratic standstill has turned urgently needed aid into dead weight — billions of dollars in resources stall in storage while lives are lost by the hour.

This is the harsh reality: The U.S. spent decades creating a model where countries were made reliant on aid for basic survival and is now pulling the plug in a moment of mass starvation. The people paying the price for this deliberate abandonment are civilians already trapped between war, sanctions, and climate disaster.

The deliberate weaponization of food and humanitarian aid by the United States amounts to collective punishment. It is a form of siege warfare waged through bureaucracy and diplomacy, targeting already starving populations in Sudan, Palestine, and Yemen.

Sanctions regimes imposed by the Trump administration must be lifted immediately. These unilateral coercive measures violate fundamental principles of international humanitarian and human rights law. Under Article 54 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions, starvation of civilians as a method of warfare is explicitly prohibited. Likewise, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights affirms the right to food, health, and an adequate standard of living. These rights cannot be realized when blockades and sanctions deliberately block the flow of aid and essential goods to those who need them most.

Sanctions are not weakening armed actors — they are strangling civilians and entire societies. Aid blockades and restrictions on financial systems have made it nearly impossible for humanitarian agencies to operate — exacerbating malnutrition, disease, and displacement on a mass scale.

There can be no justification for policies that knowingly deepen starvation and human suffering. Governments and international bodies must stop using humanitarian aid, sanctions, and blockades as tools of political coercion. These practices violate international law and inflict cruel collective punishment on civilian populations. The international community must demand accountability and take concrete steps to ensure that relief efforts are never weaponized.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Texas NWS office had no warning coordination meteorologist during the flood. Did it make a difference?","https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/13/weather/texas-flooding-nws-meteorologist-missing-climate","Sun, 13 Jul 2025 15:00:00 GMT","


            On the night the deadly floodwaters raged down the Guadalupe River in Texas, the National Weather Service forecast office in Austin/San Antonio was missing a key leader of its team: the warning coordination meteorologist, who had retired just a few months prior.
    


            Along with about 400 other experts at the NWS, the WCM at that office, Paul Yura, took an early retirement offer in April, according to an official at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees the agency. Yura could not be reached for comment.
    


            That early retirement option, also given to employees at other parts of NOAA and across the government, was part of the Department of Government Efficiency-related budget cuts designed to shrink the size of the federal government.
    


            The missing WCM is coming under scrutiny in the wake of the tragedy that has killed more than 120 people because they are the meteorologist responsible for interacting with emergency managers and public officials to ensure they know how to handle a severe weather event, should one occur.
    


            Much of their work takes place before extreme weather hits, with tabletop simulations, relationship building exercises and other activities designed to foster close working relationships between weather forecasters, emergency managers and local leaders.
    


            It is “hard to tell how much of an impact” the WCM's absence had that night, since the office had five staff members on duty, compared to the typical staffing level of two at that time of night, and they were communicating with emergency managers as the flood threat ramped up, the NOAA official told CNN.
    


            The official, along with other experts who spoke to CNN, said they did not think the vacancy affected the forecast. They noted the approximately three hours of warning lead time provided to many communities along the Guadalupe River, starting when the first flash flood warning was issued at 1:14 a.m. CT on July 4.
    


            “You can do a lot in three hours,” the official said, referring to taking flood safety measures.
    


            The Trump administration has targeted the NWS, along with NOAA overall, for steep staff reductions since the start of the president's second term.
    


            The NWS had about 4,400 staff members in January and this has fallen to about 3,700 as of this past week, according to the NOAA official.
    


            Some NWS offices are now so poorly staffed, they are no longer operating 24/7 and are not launching weather balloons — a vital source of weather data — at their typical cadence of twice a day.
    


            The NWS did recently receive an exemption to the federal hiring freeze to bring on about 125 meteorologists, but it won't make up for all the employees lost through early retirements, firings and other DOGE-related cuts.
    


            While it appears these cuts did not degrade the Weather Service's response in Texas, experts are still concerned as the peak of hurricane season is looming. The agency has not yet begun to hire those 125 roles and this season is expected to be another above-average one.
    


            Brian LaMarre, a former meteorologist-in-charge at the NWS' Tampa office, who also served as a WCM in Lubbock, Texas, earlier in his career, told CNN any mistakes that led to so many lost lives in this disaster were made once the warnings left the NWS forecast office in New Braunfels, Texas.
    


            In his view, they were not a result of the missing WCM position.
    


            “The break was outside of the weather service, and that's always been the biggest nightmare,” he said. “Hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, wildfires, whatever it is when we issue a warning, we could get several hours (of lead time), just like San Antonio did. It was a three-hour lead time… and no one was acting,” he said.
    


            “It became a dissemination challenge for people that didn't have a phone in their hand, or weren't woken up by a siren, which they don't have on the river,” LaMarre added.
    


            Much of the WCM's role is to work with the emergency management community and public officials well in advance of any severe weather, to conduct exercises and establish communications channels, for example. It's unclear if those activities stopped once Yura left in April. Even if they did, there was only a gap of a few months before the flooding hit.
    


            That is not enough time for local emergency managers to forget all of their extreme weather knowledge or miss many vital trainings, LaMarre stated.
    


            Plus, he said, others in the forecast office who aspired to serve as WCM would likely have taken over some of Yura's responsibilities. And notably, the meteorologist-in-charge of the Austin/San Antonio office is a former WCM as well, according to Erica Grow Cei, a spokesperson for the NWS.
    


            LaMarre said the focus of the investigation into what went so horribly wrong should largely be on the so-called “last mile” problem of weather forecasting: communicating warnings to the people who need to receive them and making sure they act on them.
    


            That is well within the purview of the WCM, but other meteorologists share these responsibilities, along with local officials.
    


            For its part, NOAA touted the accuracy of its forecasts and noted its flash flood warnings were sent via tone alerts to cell phones in the areas affected, as well as to NOAA weather radios.
    


            “The National Weather Service's Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) in Austin/San Antonio and San Angelo, TX had additional staff on duty during the catastrophic flooding event in Texas's Hill Country during the July 4 holiday weekend,” Cei said in a statement. “Both offices, in addition to the West Gulf River Forecast Center, had extra personnel on the night of Thursday, July 3 into the day on Friday, July 4. All forecasts and warnings were issued in a timely manner.”
    


            “Additionally, these offices were able to provide decision support services to local partners, including those in the emergency management community,” she said. “The NWS remains dedicated to our mission to serve the American public through our forecasts and decision support services.”

President Donald Trump‘s border czar clarified that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers cannot briefly detain suspected illegal immigrants based on physical appearance alone.

“Let me be clear: Physical description can't be the sole factor to give you reasonable suspicion,” Tom Homan told CNN on Sunday. “It's articulable facts, with an ‘s.' So appearance can be just one. For instance, if someone has an MS-13 tattoo on their face, that may be one factor to add to other factors to raise reasonable suspicion.”

Homan earlier this week told Fox News that ICE and other federal officials, including Border Patrol officers, do not need “probable cause to walk up to somebody, briefly detain them, and question them.”

“They just need totality of the circumstances, right? They just go through the observation, get our typical facts — based on the location, the occupation, their physical appearance, their actions,” he said on that network.

But on Sunday, Homan underscored that those comments had been “taken out of context” and reiterated that “physical description cannot be the sole reason to detain and question somebody” or give rise to reasonable suspicion.

“It's a myriad of factors,” he said on CNN. “So every officer, every situation, is different. But I can tell you this: Every ICE officer goes through Fourth Amendment training every six months and reminded what their authorities are for arrest, detention, and questioning. So the officers are very well trained.”

The issue of possible racial profiling has been in the political spotlight this week after a Los Angeles-area federal judge on Friday ordered that the Trump administration stop conducting raids in which federal officers are allegedly arresting possible illegal immigrants without reasonable suspicion and instead detaining them based on their race, accents, and occupation, in violation of the Fourth Amendment, in addition to not providing them with immediate access to lawyers.

On Sunday, Homan added that he “looked forward” to the Justice Department litigating California Central District Court Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong's order, expressing confidence that the Trump administration would win on appeal. 

In the same interview with CNN, Homan also expressed sadness after a farm worker in California, 57-year-old Jaime Alanis, died on Saturday following a 30-foot fall from a roof during an ICE raid at the cannabis facility where he worked.

MIGRANT DIES AFTER 30-FOOT FALL FROM GREENHOUSE ROOF DURING CALIFORNIA ICE RAID 

“It's sad. It's unfortunate,” he said. “He wasn't in ICE custody, and ICE did not have hands on this person. But it's always unfortunate when there're deaths. I mean, no one wants to see people die.”

At the same time, Homan defended the ICE officers, contending “they were doing the job” serving criminal arrest warrants as part of an investigation into alleged child trafficking and labor at Glass House Farms facilities in Camarillo and Carpinteria.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Joseph Kurihara watched the furniture pile higher and higher on the streets of Terminal Island. Tables and chairs, mattresses and bed frames, refrigerators and radio consoles had been dragged into alleyways and arranged in haphazard stacks.

National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Sunday that whether the Trump administration has the authority to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is ""being looked into.""

""But certainly, if there's cause, he does,"" Hassett said on ABC News' ""This Week"" of Trump's authority to remove Powell before his term is up next spring.

President Donald Trump has said that he does not want to fire Powell, but Hassett's comments suggest the White House is still considering — and potentially moving towards — the possibility.

Top Trump administration officials have escalated their criticisms of Powell in recent days, in particular by targeting the Federal Reserve's $2.5 billion renovation project, which Hassett said has gone over budget by $700 million.

Taxpayers are not paying for the renovations. The Fed is self-funded through interest it makes on securities held by the institution and through fees charged banks.

Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought last week accused Powell of having ""grossly mismanaged the Fed,"" and said he would seek an investigation into the ongoing project to renovate the Fed's headquarters.

Vought's remarks suggested that the Trump administration may be laying the groundwork to find a cause to remove Powell — a frequent target of the Trump administration — before his term is up.

In an escalation, Vought sent a list of questions to Powell last week demanding answers about the renovation project.

Hassett on Sunday said the answers to Vought's questions may determine how the administration proceeds.

""I think that whether the president decides to push down that road or not is going to depend a lot on the answers that we get to the questions that Russ Vought sent to the Fed,"" he said.

The Federal Reserve quietly rebutted many of Vought's questions last week with an updated webpage on the Fed website that addresses some of the questions.

""No new VIP dining rooms are being constructed as part of the project,"" the FAQs page on the website states, directly responding to one of Vought's questions.

The webpage was posted on Friday, the same day that Vought said on CNBC that a probe was warranted over Powell's management of the renovation project.  

While Trump suggested as recently as Friday that he does not want to fire Powell, he has said in recent weeks that he has a few people in mind for the post for when Powell's term expires next May.

Hassett is reportedly a top contender to replace Powell.

One other possible contender is former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Warsh was on Fox News' ""Mornings with Maria"" on Sunday, appearing to subtly pitch himself for the position.

He called the renovation project ""outrageous"" and said that ""the Fed has lost its way.""

""It's lost, lost its way in supervision, it's lost its way in monetary policy, and all this big money on big, fancy buildings is just another indication,"" he said.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

The NFT market has witnessed a notable surge in activity, with weekly transactions increasing by 20.6%. This substantial rise in transaction volume, totaling $122.6 million, highlights a growing interest and broadening engagement in the NFT space. The increase in transactions suggests that the market is gaining traction, with more individuals and entities engaging in the buying and selling of digital assets.

This trend is attributed to more accessible market conditions, as communities on social media platforms like Twitter and Discord have noted. The surge in activity underscores the potential for enhanced liquidity, although the total value locked (TVL) on platforms like Ethereum remains stable. Historically, volume surges have coincided with escalated interest in governance tokens such as LOOKS and BLUR, indicating a shift towards more frequent transactions and community-oriented exchanges.

The rise in NFT transactions can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the growing acceptance of blockchain technology and its applications has made NFTs more accessible to a broader audience. As more people become familiar with the concept of NFTs and their potential uses, the demand for these digital assets has increased. Secondly, the unique nature of NFTs, which allows for the ownership and transfer of digital assets, has made them an attractive investment option for many. This has led to a surge in the number of transactions, as investors seek to capitalize on the potential growth of the NFT market.

The increase in NFT transactions also reflects the growing interest in digital art and collectibles. NFTs have provided a new way for artists and creators to monetize their work, allowing them to sell digital art, music, and other forms of media as unique, verifiable assets. This has attracted a new wave of investors who are interested in supporting artists and owning a piece of digital history. The rise in NFT transactions is a testament to the growing popularity of digital art and collectibles, as well as the potential for NFTs to revolutionize the way we think about ownership and value in the digital age.

The 20.6% increase in weekly transactions is a positive sign for the NFT market, indicating that it is continuing to grow and attract new participants. As the market matures, it is likely that we will see even more innovation and development in the NFT space, as creators and investors continue to explore the potential of this exciting new technology. The future of the NFT market looks bright, with the potential for significant growth and development in the years to come.

Pump.fun did not sell the number of tokens initially planned for the public ICO and has given no updates on the changes.

The Solana-based meme coin launchpad, Pump.fun, has concluded the initial coin offering (ICO) for its native cryptocurrency, PUMP. Although the platform completed the public sale in 12 minutes, there are some controversies surrounding it.

Data from the Pump.fun token website shows that the launchpad raised $500 million during the sale. The platform sold 12.5% of the PUMP total supply for $0.0040 each in a public offering.

When announcing the ICO on July 9, Pump.fun said its native token will have a maximum supply of one trillion. 33% of the supply was to be sold at the ICO, 24% reserved for community and ecosystem initiatives, and 20% to the project's team. The project allocated 13% to existing investors, and the rest in smaller percentages to the ecosystem fund, exchange liquidity, and live streaming.

Out of the 33% allocated to the ICO, Pump.fun decided to keep 18% for a private sale to institutional buyers. The remaining 15%, accounting for 150 billion PUMP, will be offloaded in a public sale.

However, data on the project's website shows the team eventually offloaded only 12.5% of the supply in the public sale. At the time of writing, the firm has not published any update regarding the changes; hence, the community is speculating what could have happened to the remaining 2.5%.

While the crypto community continues speculating, Pump.fun confirmed it has allocated the tokens kept for the private sale to their buyers. Users who participated in the public sale will receive their assets within the next 48-72 hours. However, they will not be tradable or transferable till the distribution phase is over.

All ICO participants will be able to sell or transfer their PUMP allocations on the first day they become tradable.

“We'd like to thank everyone who participated in the sale, whether on pump fun or on one of the participating exchanges, and we look forward to the very bright future of pump fun and the wider Solana ecosystem,” the platform stated.

It is worth mentioning that Pump.fun faced a few challenges in the days leading up to the ICO. On July 8, the crypto exchange Gate.io abruptly removed its pre-market listing for PUMP and returned funds to all presale participants. The exchange eventually revealed that its decision stemmed from a discussion it had with the Pump.fun team. Notwithstanding the incident, PUMP ICO participants bought tokens worth $5 million on the exchange.

Andrew Bailey during a financial stability report news conference at the central bank's headquarters in the City of London, UK, on July 9.

Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has warned the world's largest banks against issuing their own stablecoins, setting up a potential clash with President Donald Trump's administration and its backing of the digital assets.

Speaking in an interview with the Times newspaper, Bailey said he “would much rather” banks offer digital versions of traditional money — known as tokenized deposits — than stablecoins, which are designed to hold a steady value and are usually pegged to a traditional currency. Bailey also warned that stablecoins threaten to take money out of the banking system and leave less funds available for lending, according to the Times interview.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","cryptocurrency"

Why, look at the leaves. It's Garmin running watch season again! The sweatiest time of the year! As luck would have it, we've got a new flagship running watch to pore over in the form of the Forerunner 970.

It features Garmin's brightest AMOLED screen yet, built-in maps, a flashlight, a speaker, a mic, and more data fields than most of us mere mortals can process. It also costs $150 more than the previous running flagship, the Forerunner 965. Let's see if it's worth it.

The Forerunner 970 is the high-end version of Garmin's storied running watch line. It has a 1.4-inch AMOLED touch display that is incredibly bright—it's quite a bit brighter than my Fenix 8. New hardware includes a bright LED flashlight (three levels of white and one level of red), Garmin's latest fifth-generation optical heart rate monitor, and a speaker and a mic for taking calls and interacting with the watch's (or your phone's) smart assistant.

It comes in three colorways—black, white and yellow, or gray and indigo—and features a sapphire crystal screen with a titanium bezel and a plastic body. It's 12.9 mm thick and is waterproof to 50 meters.

All of those features work well. The screen arguably works too well, because if you have it cranked to full brightness it will put a significant dent in your battery life. I chose to keep mine at power level 1 (out of three) and found it plenty bright, even when running in indirect sunlight. I also chose to use the gesture-based screen waking, so the display is off until I look at it. Between those choices, I averaged about two weeks of battery life, depending on how much GPS-tracked activity I was doing. The watch gets 26 hours of GPS tracking per charge.

I can't say enough good things about the external flashlight. It's bright enough to find my way down a dark trail at night, but the red light is enough for me to make my way to an unfamiliar hotel bathroom without blinding myself. It also has a strobe mode which can provide additional visibility for night runners. The optical heart rate monitor is fantastic. I tested it against a chest strap on a couple of activities, and it matched just about perfectly, which is really impressive for a wrist-worn HRM. It has sensors for your pulse oximetry and skin temperature, and it can take manual ECG readings, which can help detect AFib.

The speaker and mic are nice additions. Sound quality isn't great, but it's handy when I get an important call in the shower. More importantly, it allows you to interact with your phone's voice assistant, and even when you aren't connected to your phone it can understand a number of voice commands for specific features. This includes starting/stopping a specific activity, changing a setting on the watch, or starting a timer or stopwatch. It works well and can save a lot of menu navigation.

Garmin makes the best software of any sports watch, and that holds true with the Forerunner 970. We don't see any departures from the winning formula here. It still uses the same five-button navigation (plus touchscreen), it still has hundreds of downloadable watch faces, it still tracks a ton of 24/7 health metrics and a massive number of sports and activities (though not quite as many as the Fenix 8). There's plenty of new stuff to pick through, though.

If you've used a Garmin watch from the past few years, you're familiar with Morning Report, a breakdown you receive upon waking that details the quality of your sleep and recovery status, among other things. Now there is an Evening Report as well. This new report summarizes the day you just had, gives you recommendations as to how much sleep you should try to get, and offers a preview of your day tomorrow.

The Forerunner 970 does have some all-new training features. Most successful is the new Acute Impact Load data, which shows up for each run. Say you run three miles on flat ground at your normal pace. Garmin's programming would say that is a regular three-mile run. But if those miles were super hilly, with brutal inclines and declines, it might say that that probably felt like 5 miles, which will factor into your recovery. I really love this feature, which seems to nail exactly how my runs felt.

All of that is then factored into your Running Tolerance score, where it takes your actual miles run over the last week, plus your Acute Impact Load miles, and then tells you how many weekly miles it thinks you can tolerate. If you're training efficiently, hopefully this will steadily go up week by week. It estimated that my tolerance is 9 miles per week, which is probably about right. My watch doesn't know that I have a long history of knee issues, which is why running isn't my primary sport, so I'm hesitant to ramp up too quickly, because that's when I get hurt. So, y'know, take your watch's wisdom with a grain of salt.

Then there's the new Step Speed Loss and Running Economy scores. While the Forerunner 970 is the only watch in Garmin's lineup that can deliver these metrics (so far), it can't do it alone. It needs the new Garmin HRM 600 chest strap heart rate monitor, which will cost an additional $170.

When you're running, each time your foot hits the ground you slow down a little, hitting the brakes with every little landing. The Step Speed Loss measures exactly how much you slow down with each step, with the lower the number the better. Some of that is then factored into the Running Economy score, which makes some broader observations about your ground-contact time. (It takes a handful of runs with the HRM 600 before it'll show up.) This is getting pretty into the weeds, so unless you're an aspiring pro athlete, these metrics don't do a whole lot for you. I'd probably skip the strap.

Then there are some cool race-specific features, like Projected Race Finish Time. If you punch in all the details for an upcoming race (real or theoretical) and use the watch to train, it will tell you what your estimated finish time would be if you ran it tomorrow. But also, if your race is three months away, it will estimate what your time will be if you keep training like you have been. You can also load the race course into your watch, so on the big day you can get more specific data. For instance, it might give you more accurate splits, and it can even automatically go back and give you a Suggested Finish if you run past the line and are too busy celebrating to remember to stop your watch.

Triathletes will be excited that you can now build a full tri training plan. You punch in the details about the race, and the days you do/don't want to train, and it will build a whole training calendar for you, getting more intense as the race nears. It's really quite advanced and, from what I can tell, very thorough. Years ago, I worked with Team in Training to prepare for the NYC Triathlon, and Garmin's training plan looks pretty similar to the one I did then. If you're going for a specific time, it will push you toward that too.

It has 15 new sport profiles compared to the Forerunner 965, including things like Backcountry Snowboarding, Pickleball, and even some motor sports. The list isn't as extensive as the Fenix 8, though, which can track surfing and now works as a full-on dive watch for recreational scuba and freediving. It really feels like the lack is just to differentiate between the Forerunner and Fenix lines, because a software update could do it.

Fortunately, the map features have been cribbed from the Fenix 8, and they're excellent. It comes with extensive topographical maps installed. The maps are colorful, bright, and easy to navigate by pinching and tapping. A new feature is Round Trip Routing, with corrections (theoretically). If you're in an unfamiliar city, you can tell the watch that you want to do a 5-mile run and it will suggest a loop for you. If you accidentally take a wrong turn or see some pretty thing you want to go check out, it will fluidly reroute you to get you back to your hotel while hitting your goal distance (within reason, of course).

It's such a great idea, but I could never get it to work. If I went off the route, the whole watch would crash, and I had to power cycle it. Hopefully this is something Garmin can fix in a future software update (the updates come roughly once a month). On the upside, I found GPS performance to be accurate, even among trees, cliffs, and tall buildings.

It's worth mentioning that Garmin also launched the new, midrange Forerunner 570. It has a shorter battery life, less-premium materials (Gorilla Glass 3 vs. Sapphire, aluminum bezel vs. titanium), less memory at 8 GB vs. 32 GB, no built-in mapping, and no flashlight. You get the speaker and mic though, and there's the option of a 42 mm display instead of just 47 mm, which is nice for those with smaller wrists.

With all that said, a lot of these features are available on the Fenix 8. The Fenix 8 has more expensive materials, like a full titanium body; some of the same hardware, like the mic and speaker, and better battery life. There are some features that aren't currently available, like Running Tolerance, but those are coming via a huge new software update that Garmin just announced.

The Fenix 8 is way more expensive than the Forerunner 970, but it's also much older. If the Fenix 8 goes on sale, as it occasionally does, it's a no-brainer to get it instead. The Forerunner 970 is a premium watch with advanced features that will give you a lot of insight and assistance if you're trying to go pro, but it might be overkill if you're not and you occasionally like to surf instead.

Product description sparks worries over the display's visual quality.

Japan's Mizuki Co. is now crowdfunding a monitor to match its attractive X68000 Z Super and X68000 Z XVI miniature retro reprint PCs. What can a company do to create an era appropriate (late 90s) CRT-like monitor in 2025? Mizuki has decided to crowdfund the manufacture of a “4:3 LCD curved acrylic structure reproduces the atmosphere of a classic CRT” (machine translation). CRT enthusiasts may feel disappointed by this seemingly low-spec LCD-based offering.

The X68000 PCs were a popular home computer phenomenon in Japan in the late 1980s, and some of the most attractive examples of their kind were produced by Sharp. Latent demand for nostalgic computer products in Japan sparked the retro mini X68000 Z Super and X68000 Z XVI systems. These lovingly recreated systems with matching keyboards and mice are now also being distributed worldwide via Indiegogo.

Now, for the sake of completeness, Mizuki has designed “a dedicated monitor of the same scale that can be used alongside the X68000 Z SUPER/Z XVI.” The firm already had a mini monitor in the shape of a 5-inch unit. However, that didn't properly match the scale of the new retro mini X68000 Z Super and X68000 Z XVI systems, so it was prompted to design and deliver this 8-inch model. The original (larger) X68000 systems sold in Japan in the 1980s came with 14-inch monitors.

For appropriate physical scaling, the new monitor packs an 8-inch display in its appealing black chassis, positionable upon a rotating pedestal stand. This display is said to be a 1024 x 768 pixels (4:3 ratio) LCD with a 60 Hz refresh.

Weighing in at 1.5kg, the monitor is powered by USB Type-C delivered 5V/3A, and will connect up with your mini PC via HDMI. Stereo speakers are built in, and there is also a 3.5mm earphone jack, plus physical controls for volume, brightness, and contrast.

Something questionable that caught our eye was that Mizuki intends to use a “curved acrylic structure [which] reproduces the atmosphere of a classic CRT.” That doesn't sound like the nicest idea for a usable display. It raises the question of whether there will be a bulbous acrylic sheet in front of the LCD, or both acrylic and LCD will be somehow curved like a modern curved monitor. Without any depth to the hardware specs, it is probably best to wait for unit reviews before buying this product.

Though ornamentally appropriate, we think CRT enthusiasts might be somewhat disappointed in the results they get from the aforementioned LCD. CRTs have become highly sought after by members of the retro community, and others, for several great inherent qualities. First and foremost, the use of CRTs would be authentic in this case. Typically, CRTs come with exceedingly low input lag, and don't have motion-blur issues. Users may also prefer seeing genuine CRT features like scanlines, phosphor glow, and CRT dithering - to provide a well-rounded retro experience.

Some CRT-like effects can be emulated or replicated on LCDs. However, we see that for utmost authenticity, very high spec PC displays are required for tools like Blur Busters' authentic CRT simulator shader to work as intended – with a 240 Hz+ OLED recommended for the best experience.

At 35,000 Japanese Yen, which is roughly $240, the X68000 Z2 dedicated monitor isn't bargain priced, either. You are probably paying largely for the 'look and feel' rather than performance or quality in monitor terms.

This monitor began its crowdfunding journey in Japan on Friday, and the project will continue for another 18 days on the Kibidango platform (linked top). It has raised more than a third of the crowdfunder goal in just a couple of days, so it looks set to be a successful project. That means we might see it come west (or rather, worldwide) via Indiegogo, in due course. By that time we might have Japan-sourced reviews to check to see if this monitor is a worthwhile investment.

   14:27 EDT 13 Jul 2025, updated  15:30 EDT 13 Jul 2025    By JAKE NISSE and ASSOCIATED PRESS  

President Donald Trump arrived Sunday at MetLife Stadium for the Club World Cup final between Chelsea and PSG.

Roughly 35 minutes before kickoff, Trump's Marine One helicopter was seen touching down near the stadium for the game.

The chopper arrived at Teterboro Airport after Trump and first lady Melania Trump traveled from their golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey for the inaugural championship match of the newly-expanded tournament in East Rutherford.

In video from the White House's Rapid Response account, Trump could be seen stepping down from the helicopter before getting inside a motorcade.

Trump's son, Donald Jr., and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, were also seen headed to the game. 

The outing falls on the first anniversary of the assassination attempt he survived in Butler, Pennsylvania last year, and significant security measures were put in place for his arrival.

As detailed in The Athletic, secret service officials worked with organizers to put together a travel route to the venue, and it was believed he would be behind a pane of bulletproof glass at the game.

Trump was seen watching the game with FIFA president Gianni Infantino, while New York Jets' and incoming Crystal Palace owner Woody Johnson was also spotted nearby.

Reporting from before the game also suggested Trump would sit with PSG and Chelsea officials, as well as Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the emir of Qatar and previous owner of the Boeing 747-8 jet Trump controversially accepted as a gift.

The president, 79, was put on screen at MetLife during the singing of the national anthem prior to the game, and reports emerged from the stadium that he was booed before the stadium camera cut away from him.

Trump is also expected to conduct some business at the game, as his Middle East Special Envoy Steve Witkoff told reporters that he would meet with senior Qatari officials on the sidelines to discuss a ceasefire in Gaza.

Additionally, Trump is expected to be part of the trophy presentation after the game, which further complicates the required security around the American Commander-in-Chief.

'When you do the threat and risk assessment, you cover anything that could go wrong: if they were at a mass gathering, what if the stage collapsed?' Nigel Thomas, a former British Special Air Service (SAS) soldier and founder of security training firm, Blue Mountain Group, told The Athletic. 

'We will have a standard operating procedure for that, for example. You need to be prepared for it, and that takes communication with stadium security and emergency services.'

The World Cup Final next summer will also be hosted at MetLife Stadium.

The president has enjoyed a friendly relationship with Infantino, and FIFA actually opened up a new office in Manhattan's Trump Tower this week.

Since he took office for a second time this year, Trump has visited several sporting events - including the Super Bowl in New Orleans.

He's also attended the Daytona 500 in Florida, UFC fights in Miami and Newark, New Jersey, and the NCAA wrestling championships in Philadelphia.

While Trump has yet to attend a Club World Cup match ahead of the final, Vice President J.D. Vance was on hand when Borussia Dortmund took on Ulsan HD in Cincinnati. And the strict security measures were certainly felt in that case.

'We were checked by strict security,' Dortmund head coach Niko Kovac told assembled reporters.'

'When we left the hotel, we were given a sniff test by a dog. When we got into the stadium, someone came onto the bus with another dog. That's completely normal. It's a World Cup. They are high-level people, so I think it's normal, but it was relatively tight.'

Sunday's final will see reigning Champions League winners PSG face English giants Chelsea, who were last crowned winners of Europe in 2021.

PSG have gotten past a gauntlet of opponents this summer to reach the championship match, beating the likes of Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid along the way.

Their win over Los Blancos was particularly emphatic, as they beat the Spanish giants 4-0 on Wednesday in front of a packed MetLife crowd.

Chelsea, meanwhile, have beaten the likes of Benfica, Palmeiras and Fluminense in the knockout stages to reach the final. ","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","soccer"

This was only a warm-up for next summer.

Gianni Infantino is all over the place at the Club World Cup. Peruse his Instagram feed, and you'll see a steady drumbeat of images from across the United States as he and his handlers barnstorm the tournament, which concludes with Sunday's championship final between Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea at Metlife Stadium in New Jersey.

FIFA's president has been turning up at the stadiums themselves, usually catching the highest-profile matches, and often more than one game in a day during the busy matchdays early on. He's also hitting promotional events and grip-and-grin appearances with a who's-who of retired players, executives, politicians and the like, hyping up an event that's become his personal mission.

“This truly global and epic club competition is already a success, and it's going to get even more exciting as we enter the knockout phase,” he said in one reel. “It is epic and it's getting better and better, match by match.”

In another, he vowed, “the FIFA Club World Cup is there, it is there to stay, it is already epic, it will become even better.”

It's fair to say Infantino raised a few extra eyebrows that week, with a flurry of content from Washington, D.C. Most notable: a June 18 post from the White House, when he and several Juventus players, staff and executives posed for photos with Donald Trump and gifted the U.S. president customized jerseys in the Oval Office a few hours before the Italian powerhouse's CWC group-stage match vs. Al Ain of the United Arab Emirates.

“POTUS has always been a friend of football,” wrote Team Infantino.

Trump's decision to field questions from White House press pool reporters during the visit, which The Athletic later reported was a surprise to the Juventus contingent, turned the occasion into a major international news story that rumbled on for days.

The president's use of Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and their club teammates as a backdrop for his typically combative answers about the Iran-Israel conflict, his administration's new travel bans on a long list of foreign nations and his opposition to transgender participation in women's sports shined an even brighter spotlight than these superstar athletes are accustomed to.

Infantino was notably not on hand at Audi Field that night to help Weah explain why he and his teammates were standing behind the Resolute desk, the 145-year-old, 1,300-pound piece of office furniture that's come to signify the gravitas of the U.S. executive branch, as Trump held forth.

“It was all a surprise to me. Honestly, they just told us that, you know, we have to go. And I had no choice but to go,” Weah said postgame. “I mean, I guess it was a cool experience, obviously, I mean, being in the White House as a first time, it's always wonderful. But you know, I'm not one for the politics, so it wasn't that exciting.

“Yeah, it was weird. I was caught by surprise. A bit weird. I was caught by surprise, honestly, when he started talking politics with Iran and everything,” he added when this correspondent asked about the surreal experience of being roped into a POTUS media scrum. “I was kind of like, I just want to play football, man.”

The Club World Cup final arrives Sunday with global significance and continental firsts at stake.

For the first time, two clubs from the same continent — Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain — will meet in the title match, marking the first major international men's final between teams from England and France. It is a product of both performance and policy, with expanded entry granting Europe multiple spots, and wealth helping shape the field.

PSG, who have already swept Ligue 1, the Coupe de France and the Champions League, enter as overwhelming favorites. They have won four straight knockout matches by a combined score of 12-0, including a 4-0 demolition of Real Madrid in the semifinals.

Chelsea, under Enzo Maresca, have defied expectations and leaned on depth, defense and a red-hot João Pedro to reach the final.

Sunday's match will decide more than a trophy — it will offer a snapshot of modern football's economic divide, a clash of the two biggest spenders in the sport, and a battle between a finished product and a team still under construction.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — The FIFA Club World Cup concludes Sunday with Champions League winner Paris Saint-Germain facing English Premier League side Chelsea FC in the final.

PSG aims to cap a historic season, winning the French league, the French Cup, the French Super Cup and the club's first Champions League title in the last year. Meanwhile, Chelsea could raise some hardware of its own with an big upset after finishing fourth in the Premier League last season.

President Donald Trump is in attendance for the Club World Cup final at MetLife Stadium.

Here's everything you need to know about the PSG vs. Chelsea match today, and stay tuned for live updates from USA TODAY Sports:

Although PSG has had a handful of chances, Chelsea was the first team to put their opponents on their heels. Fortunately for PSG fans, the Blue missed a few shots and were not able to take advantage of their opportunities. As the game progressed to the 20-minute mark, PSG started to show why they were so heavily favored prior to the tilt, putting constant pressure on the Chelsea net.

It remains 0-0.

The match is available to live stream for free on DAZN. The match is also available on TBS in English, with Univision and TUDN in Spanish.

The match begins at 3 p.m. ET (8 p.m. in London, 9 p.m. in Paris).

Here are the betting odds for the Club World Cup final during regular time, according to BetMGM.

After speculation about whether the President would attend the Club World Cup Final, Trump was seen at the stadium. He even appeared briefly on the Jumbotron.

Trump's entourage includes special envoy Steve Witkoff, first son Donald Trump Jr. and girlfriend Bettina Anderson, and son-in-laws Jared Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump, and Michael Boulos, husband to Tiffany Trump. First lady Melania Trump is also accompanying her husband.

Attorney General Pam Bondi, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, retired NFL quarterback Tom Brady, and media magnate Rupert Murdoch have also been spotted in Trump's suite.

The match will be played at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey in the United States.

The Club World Cup winner will earn $40 million, while the runner-up gets $30 million as part of a $1 billion prize pool for the tournament.

FIFA has lowered prices for tickets to the Club World Cup final in the days leading up to the match between PSG and Chelsea: Here's how much they've dropped.

The odds may be stacked in PSG's favor, but Chelsea knows anything can happen in a one-off match like this Club World Cup final.

“Everyone has them down as strong favorites,” said Chelsea captain Reece James, the only player remaining from Chelsea's Champions League title in 2020-21, playing in this Club World Cup. “I don't really care, to be honest. Everyone is bigging up our opposition. We're preparing right, and we're going to win.”

There's only one trophy left for Paris Saint-Germain to raise this season. Can PSG cap their historic year with another title?

“We really want to make history, and we're hungry for a win,” PSG's Brazilian captain Marquinhos said.

Added coach Luis Enrique: “Best season in my career? Maybe. But we need to win Sunday's game to put icing on the cake.”

Trump and FIFA president Gianni Infantino have built a close relationship, showcased after several visits made by Infantino to the White House in the last year. FIFA also opened a new office inside Trump Tower this week during the Club World Cup.

Infantino further explained his connection with Trump derives from needing government support from the United States to run the Club World Cup this summer and the World Cup next summer, which will be co-hosted with Canada and Mexico. 

Major League Soccer commissioner Don Garber believes the FIFA Club World Cup has been an “absolute terrific success,” and has set the stage for an exciting World Cup 2026 next summer.

“The Club World Cup was the story this summer in sport,” Garber told USA TODAY Sports. “I think it did what it was intended to do – to launch something new, take some risk, show some courage, and then set the stage for 2026, which will be another example of soccer and football at its very best. I think the 2026 World Cup will be the most spectacular event in the history of our country.”

The FIFA World Cup begins in Mexico on June 11, 2026, and the final will be at MetLife Stadium on July 19, 2026. The tournament will be co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

Deen writes, ""Chelsea's Cole Palmer makes a statement with a chilling goal to open the scoring, but PSG's quality will overwhelm in this one. Ousmane Dembélé, Désiré Doué and Fabián Ruiz score in this match as PSG makes history winning the Club World Cup title.""

Leboff writes, ""Since the end of May, PSG has defeated Inter Milan, Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid by a combined score of 15-0. There are just too many ways that PSG can win this match, and it's hard to see this train coming off the tracks after months of domination.""

Cormack writes, ""This PSG team can get at you in so many ways, and while the Blues will offer collective coherence, they, too, are bound to suffer like many before them. We're talking about a potentially all-time great team here, and they'll want to rubber stamp their supremacy by securing their first-ever Club World Cup trophy. It might not be a battering, but it's hard to envisage anything but a PSG triumph here.""

Richman writes, ""Surely PSG will have too much for Chelsea when it comes to the crunch. Every single time the French club have been tested with a tough opponent over the last year, they've passed the test with flying colours. Their counter-attacking style is a joy to behold and even Europe's best have struggled to find a way to combat a team reaching its zenith.""

There was a significant security presence around the stadium before the Club World Cup final, with nearly 100 people representing multiple law enforcement agencies and stadium security personnel greeting fans as they entered the gates. 

The security perimeter, established several hundred feet outside the stadium entrances, featured 15-feet high chained fences on top of concrete bases with entry paths for fans to enter. 

Fans proceeded to walk through a winded line separated by metal barricades until they reached the front, where they walked through metal detectors and got their tickets scanned. If they had any bags, they were asked to check their items into a locker for the duration of the match. 

After entering, fans were able to pick up black and gold Club World Cup squared towels as a keepsake. They also found a clear spot to pose for photos and videos in front of the stadium to commemorate the occasion. 

One woman said it took “two seconds” to enter. Another woman said, “15 seconds.” Other fans said it took about 5-10 minutes to get past security. 

Laura Friedman and Joao Rosa from Brooklyn had to check in their camera bag before they could enter, but took five minutes to clear the obstacle to enter. 

“We had to adjust our timing to get through security,” Friedman said. “But once we figured it out, we were totally fine.”

“We didn't even know who was playing. We bought tickets before it was announced, and we just wanted to be part of the festivities,” Rosa added. “It's a big deal. FIFA is coming here, and it's a once in a lifetime opportunity. I took off from work to be here, and I'm here for fun.” − Safid Deen

President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump arrived at the FIFA Club World Cup final in MetLife Stadium Sunday to thunderous applause, getting a preview of the even grander soccer tournament the US is set to host next year.

The president and first lady had trekked up from the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster to watch Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea square off in the  showdown at the MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

FIFA Club World Cup is a global contest between club teams — not to be confused with the FIFA World Cup, which is the world's premier soccer competition between national teams.

The president and first lady were seen waving to the crowd as they took their seats to watch the big game.

MetLife Stadium is also poised to host the men's 2026 FIFA World Cup final, marking the first time the US will hold the feted event since 1994. 

Next year will be the 250th anniversary of the country's founding.

Trump did not have any other major events on his schedule for Sunday other than observing the FIFA Club World Cup final and traveling.

The president's visit to the FIFA Club World Cup final comes on the one-year anniversary of his brush with death in Butler, Pa., when a would-be assassin's bullet came within a quarter inch of killing him.

Trump did not have any announced plans to mark that harrowing date, though he did sit for an interview with his daughter-in-law, Lara, which aired on Fox News Saturday night, in which he reflected on the assassination attempt. 

“Well, it was unforgettable,” the president reflected during an interview on Fox News' “My View.” “I didn't know exactly what was going on. I got whacked. There's no question about that.”

“And fortunately, I got down quickly. People were screaming, and I got down quickly, fortunately, because I think they shot eight bullets.”

Throughout his second term, Trump has frequented blockbuster sporting events such as Super Bowl LIX and UFC fights, but Sunday marked his first foray of the year at a major FIFA game.

Trump has long been a sports fan, and during his second term, he has upped his attendance to major competitions, particularly the UFC, amid his friendly rapport with its CEO, Dana White.

Earlier this month, Trump unveiled plans to host a UFC fight at the White House within the next year as part of the festivities to herald America's 250th birthday.

Back in February, he became the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl. Trump's sports outings have become the top source of his public domestic travel, thus far in his second term, per a Newsweek tally.

In addition to hosting the FIFA World Cup Next year, the US is slated to host the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and the 2034 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.

Jannik Sinner clawed closer to Carlos Alcaraz in their Big Titles battle on Sunday when the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings defeated his great rival 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to claim the Wimbledon trophy.

Sinner has now won nine Big Titles, a combination of Grand Slam championships, trophies at the Nitto ATP Finals and ATP Masters 1000 tournaments, and Olympic singles gold medals. The 23-year-old has claimed two of them this year, emerging victorious at the Australian Open and SW19.

Big Titles Won: Alcaraz & Sinner




Sinner has won all of his Big Titles in the past two years, having earned his first in August 2023 at Toronto. During that period he has claimed four Grand Slam championships, four ATP Masters 1000 trophies and a title at the Nitto ATP Finals (2024). His winning rate over that stretch has been one Big Title secured for every 2.4 events played.

The Italian became the first man or woman from his country to earn a Wimbledon singles title. Matteo Berrettini reached the final in 2021 and Jasmine Paolini advanced to the championship match last year, but both stars fell short.

The World No. 1 is now just one Grand Slam title behind this year's Roland Garros champion Alcaraz, who has five. Sinner held three championship points against the Spaniard in the Paris final, but was unable to seize the Coupe des Mousquetaires.

Both men are one major triumph from completing the Career Grand Slam. Sinner only needs to win Roland Garros, while Alcaraz is only missing an Australian Open trophy.

Sinner has won a Big Title for every 4.6 tournaments he has played in his career. Only Novak Djokovic (3.3), Rafael Nadal (3.5), Alcaraz (4.3), Roger Federer (4.4), Pete Sampras (4.9) and Andre Agassi (6.1) have a better title conversion rate at the prestigious events.

Five weeks after his Roland Garros heartbreak, Jannik Sinner flipped the script in style at Wimbledon on Sunday to gain revenge against Carlos Alcaraz and capture his fourth major title.

Competing in his maiden final at The Championships, the World No. 1 overcame the Spaniard 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 in a high-quality clash to become the first Italian to win the Wimbledon singles crown.

""It's mostly emotional, because I had a very tough loss in Paris,"" Sinner said during the trophy ceremony. ""But at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter how you win or how you lose at important tournaments, you just have to understand what you did wrong and try to work on that, and that's exactly what we did. We tried to accept the loss and just kept working. This is for sure one of the reasons I am holding this trophy here. I am just so grateful that I am healthy and have great people around me, and holding this trophy means a lot."" 

THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS ❤️@janniksin | #Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/WqPYkmGSDf

In Paris in early June, Sinner came agonisingly close to glory at the clay-court major, where he held three championship points before Alcaraz mounted a jaw-dropping comeback, prevailing in a five-hour, 29-minute epic to keep his perfect major final record alive (5-0). But this time, under the sun on Centre Court, Sinner would not be denied.

The 23-year-old Italian came out with purpose and precision, hammering groundstrokes into the Alcaraz forehand and gradually tightening his grip on the match. As his serve grew stronger, Sinner wrestled control away from the 22-year-old Spaniard, halting a five-match losing streak in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

""Carlos, again, an amazing tournament, but mostly thank you for the player you are,” Sinner said. “It's so difficult to play against you, but we have an amazing relationship off the court and on the court, we just try to build up, and to do that we need the best teams in the world. Keep going, keep pushing and you are going to hold this [trophy] many times. You already have two [titles]!

""It's so special. Seeing my parents here, my brother, my whole team, it's amazing. Actually a special thanks to my brother, because there is no Formula 1 race this weekend, that's why he is here.""


Sinner not only etched his name into the history books as the first Italian man to win Wimbledon; he is also one title shy of completing the Grand Slam, with only Roland Garros missing from his collection. He leaves London with a 3,430-point lead over Alcaraz in the PIF ATP Rankings and a renewed edge in a rivalry that is fast becoming the defining duel of a new era.
""It's difficult to lose. It's always difficult to lose, even if it is in the final, but first of all I have to congratulate Jannik once again,"" Alcaraz said during the trophy ceremony. ""It is a really well-deserved trophy [after] an unbelievable two weeks here in London for you, playing great tennis. For your team as well. I know that there are a lot of family and a lot of friends watching you here, so it's just an amazing team around you.
“I'm really happy for you. So just keep it going, and I'm really happy to be able to build a really good relationship off the court but then a good rivalry on the court. It makes me improve every day, so thank you very much and congratulations.""

Sinner dropped just 17 games through his first three matches at this year's Championships to equal the Open Era record for the fewest games dropped into the men's fourth round. However, he survived a major scare in the fourth round, when Grigor Dimitrov was forced to retire with a pectoral injury when leading by two sets to love. That match left Sinner needing an MRI for an elbow concern, but the Italian powered on, dispatching Ben Shelton and Novak Djokovic in straight sets to reach his fifth major final.
And when the moment came against Alcaraz in the closing stages of the fourth set, Sinner didn't blink. He sealed the title on his second match point, raised his arms to the sky and let Centre Court soak in the roar of a new Wimbledon champion.
Alcaraz was chasing his sixth major and trying to become just the second man alongside Bjorn Borg to win back-to-back Roland Garros and Wimbledon titles in consecutive years. The Spaniard, who was on a career-best 24-match winning streak, leaves London holding a 48-6 record on the season after losing to Sinner in three hours and four minutes.
""I'm really proud about everything I'm doing,” said Alcaraz. “At the beginning of the season, I struggled a bit on the court and off the court, but then suddenly I just started to really enjoy being on court again, being happy again, and that excitement I have every time step on the court is thanks to my team, my family and lot of friends. I am happy that I have them here. Without them it wouldn't be possible to stand here right now- It's a great journey so far which I'm really proud about. I just want to keep it going.""

In an intense final, the two-time defending champion Alcaraz came out aggressively, hitting with heavy pace into Sinner's forehand to rush the Italian. The World No. 2 also used the drop shot frequently and showed trademark resilience to rally from 2-4 early on, sealing the opening set with a backhand defensive block on the stretch after a brutal baseline exchange during which both players were pulled from side to side.
Sinner responded by breaking Alcaraz at the start of the second set and was the more consistent in the baseline exchanges, committing five fewer unforced errors (8-13). After levelling the match with a forehand winner, the Italian, showing more emotion than normal, let out a roar and turned to his box, where coaches Simone Vagnozzi and Darren Cahill rose to their feet.
Sinner was aggressive on the Alcaraz serve in the third set, taking big cuts on return to pressurise the Spaniard. Alcaraz fended off two break points in the opening game but was unable to prevent the Italian in the ninth game, when Sinner backed up a heavy forehand by placing a volley into the open court. He then held serve to lead. With his tail up, the Italian then raced through the fourth set, winning 88 per cent of points on his first serve, to clinch his 20th tour-level crown.

In the Open Era, Sinner and Alcaraz are the only Roland Garros final opponents to meet again in the same season's Wimbledon championship match besides Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, who did it in three consecutive years from 2006 through 2008. Sinner and Alcaraz have split the past seven majors.

Sinner not only etched his name into the history books as the first Italian man to win Wimbledon; he is also one title shy of completing the Grand Slam, with only Roland Garros missing from his collection. He leaves London with a 3,430-point lead over Alcaraz in the PIF ATP Rankings and a renewed edge in a rivalry that is fast becoming the defining duel of a new era.

""It's difficult to lose. It's always difficult to lose, even if it is in the final, but first of all I have to congratulate Jannik once again,"" Alcaraz said during the trophy ceremony. ""It is a really well-deserved trophy [after] an unbelievable two weeks here in London for you, playing great tennis. For your team as well. I know that there are a lot of family and a lot of friends watching you here, so it's just an amazing team around you.

“I'm really happy for you. So just keep it going, and I'm really happy to be able to build a really good relationship off the court but then a good rivalry on the court. It makes me improve every day, so thank you very much and congratulations.""

LONDON (AP) — Italy's Jannik Sinner defeated two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 on Sunday (july 13) to win his first Wimbledon championship and reverse the result of their epic French Open final five weeks ago.

The No. 1-ranked Sinner earned his fourth Grand Slam title overall, moving him one away from No. 2 Alcaraz's total as the two young rivals separate themselves from the rest of the pack in men's tennis.

“Thank you, Carlos, for being the player you are,” said Sinner, the first Italian to win the Wimbledon men's title. “We have an amazing relationship off the court, and on the court we push each other to play our best.”

The victory allowed Sinner, 23, to end several streaks for Alcaraz, a 22-year-old Spaniard.

“I had a very tough loss in Paris,” Sinner admitted. “But you have to understand what you did wrong and try to work on that. That is what we did and is one of the reasons that I hold this trophy today.”

In addition to ending that piece of perfection, Sinner asserted himself in a match that featured moments of terrific play by both men, but also the occasional lapses.

Jannik Sinner ends the hopes of Carlos Alcaraz from winning a third straight Wimbledon title with four-set win; The US Open is live on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, streaming service NOW and the Sky Sports app from August 24

Sunday 13 July 2025 20:27, UK

World No 1 Jannik Sinner dethroned two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz to seal his maiden Wimbledon title with a stylish four-set win.

Sinner ended a five-match losing streak to Alcaraz, winning 4-6 6-4 6-4 6-4, just 35 days after losing an epic French Open title to the Spaniard.

The 23-year-old now holds three of the four Grand Slam titles and will head to Roland-Garros next year chasing the career Grand Slam.

The victory in three hours and four minutes was nearly two-and-a-half hours quicker than their Roland Garros epic.

Sinner, who was on the brink of defeat against Grigor Dimitrov in the fourth round until his pectoral muscle injury changed the course of tennis history, celebrated by thrusting both arms aloft, puts their rivalry back on a knife edge, with the 23-year-old now trailing Alcaraz only by five Grand Slam titles to four and putting an end to a five-match losing streak against the Spaniard.

It is also Sinner's first major title away from his favoured hard courts, while Alcaraz suffered a first major final defeat, unable to find the same magic that had brought him back from the brink on the clay.

Sinner said in his on-court presentation: ""I had a very tough loss in Paris. But it doesn't really matter how you win or lose the important tournaments, you just have to understand what you did wrong, try to work on that.

""This is for sure one of the reasons why I'm holding this trophy. I'm very happy that I held my nerves. It's an amazing feeling.""

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have won the last SEVEN Grand Slams:
Wimbledon 2025 - Sinner
French Open 2025 - Alcaraz
Australian Open 2025 - Sinner
US Open 2024 - Sinner
Wimbledon 2024 - Alcaraz
French Open 2024 - Alcaraz
Australian Open 2024 - Sinner

The 23-year-old Sinner drew first blood in the first Wimbledon men's final contested by a pair born in the 2000s, breaking for a 3-2 lead, but Alcaraz was certainly not holding back, slamming down a 136mph ace to start the match and hitting 139 in his second service game - a new record for the Spaniard, until he twice clocked 140 later in the contest.

Sinner struck the first blow, a wild Alcaraz forehand handing over the first break in the fifth game, but back came the second seed with three games in a row.

Soon that was four, with Alcaraz winning surely one of the best set-winning rallies seen on Centre Court: Sinner's 118mph second serve was returned with interest, Alcaraz angled a forehand out wide, his rival thumped a forehand into the corner only for the Spaniard to somehow conjure a backhand winner.

He stood with his finger pointed to his head as the crowd rose to acclaim another piece of tennis wizardry.

In four of the 22-year-old's run of victories against Sinner, he had lost the first set, so this was a big statement, but Alcaraz then threw in a poor game to start the second.

Sinner, who normally disguises his emotions as well as an Alcaraz drop shot, let out a loud shout of 'Let's go' when he saved a break point in the next game, the Italian determined to hold on to his advantage this time.

He was forced to delay his serve at a crucial moment two games later when a champagne cork flew from the stands and nearly hit him, prompting boos from the crowd and a rebuke from British umpire Alison Hughes.

If Sinner did have Paris in his mind then serving for the set at 5-4 would have been a moment to tighten up but instead he produced a series of greatest hits, chasing down an Alcaraz drop shot, drilling a forehand winner down the line to bring up set point and then crunching another winner cross court.

Sinner missed two chances for an immediate break at the start of the third set following a pair of Alcaraz double faults but the match was starting to feel marginally on his racket.

He showed his improvisational skills with a tweener drop volley, and at 4-4 it was the world No 1 who made the breakthrough, a forehand powered into the corner leaving Alcaraz on the floor and helpless as a volley landed mid court.

And this time the serve was all Sinner needed to open up a potentially decisive advantage, with the Italian then moving a step closer by breaking again to lead 2-1 in the fourth set.

Alcaraz survived a couple of close service games and the crowd willed him to turn it around, roaring as Sinner coughed up two break points at 4-3. Not this time, though, said the Italian as he responded with four points in a row.

Moments later he was serving for the title - as he had in Paris - and creating three match points. He netted a backhand on the first but a 137mph serve on the second gave him his moment.

Iga Swiatek - 6
Carlos Alcaraz - 5
Jannik Sinner - 4
Coco Gauff - 2
Emma Raducanu - 1

Alcaraz said: ""It's difficult to lose. First of all I have to congratulate Jannik once again. It's a really well-deserved trophy. Unbelievable two weeks here in London playing great tennis.

""Really proud of everything I'm doing. At the beginning of the season I struggled a little bit, on the court, off the court, but then suddenly I started to bring joy on the court again. I just want to keep going, to keep bringing joy on the court.""

""Last year was obviously such a special moment for me, but I don't think trophies compare to this atmosphere and this kind of support,"" said Hewett.

""Congratulations to Tokito, it was a good battle out there and it's well deserved.""

After attending the ladies' singles final on Saturday, the Princess of Wales returned to see who would take home the trophy for the men

 Kate Middleton is back at Wimbledon for the final day of competition, and she brought her family!


 After attending the ladies' singles final at the tennis tournament on July 12, the Princess of Wales returned the following day to see Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner compete for the top spot. This time, Prince William joined his wife at the sporting event with their two eldest children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte.


 The entire family color coordinated in blue for the day out. Prince William and Prince George sported suits and ties, while Princess Kate and Princess Charlotte wore summer dresses — with Charlotte's blue hair bow perfectly complementing her mom's ensemble.


 The Prince and Princess of Wales' family weren't the only royals in attendance at Wimbledon's final day. King Felipe of Spain was also spotted at the event, likely to support fellow countryman Alcaraz.


 Prince George, who turns 12 on July 22, and Princess Charlotte, 10, have both attended Wimbledon twice before. However, their 7-year-old brother, Prince Louis, has yet to make his Wimbledon debut.


Karwai Tang/WireImage

 Although the Royal Box at Centre Court is typically off-limits to kids given the high demand for a spot and limited 74 seats, exceptions are made for royal children.


 Prince George first attended Wimbledon 2022 alongside his parents, who are regulars at the sporting event, where Kate regularly awards trophies to Wimbledon winners as the patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. There, the young royal got the chance to hold Novak Djokovic's first-place trophy following the match!


 George returned to Wimbledon the following year, cheering from the stands alongside his parents and Princess Charlotte (in her debut appearance at the tennis tournament!) as Carlos Alcaraz won the men's singles final against Djokovic.


 Last year, Wimbledon was a girls' day out for Princess Kate, Princess Charlotte and Pippa Middleton, as the Princess of Wales made a rare outing amid her cancer treatment.


 Although Prince George missed last year's tennis tournament, he's no stranger to the sports stands. He often joins dad Prince William at soccer games, including a father-son outing on April 15 to cheer on Aston Villa.

 Princess Kate, 43, has watched the tournament in person almost every year since she married Prince William in 2011. There were a few notable exceptions, however: doctors advised against her attending in 2013 when she was ""heavily pregnant"" with Prince George, and Wimbledon was canceled in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic.


 Prince William, 43, also had a special reason for attending Wimbledon this year. Notpla, an organization that makes biodegradable packaging from seaweed and won one of the Prince of Wales' Earthshot Prizes, partnered with Wimbledon for both the food packaging and a spoon made from seaweed.


 Despite announcing she was in remission in January, Kate is continuing to balance royal duties with recovery. Earlier this month, the Princess of Wales opened up about the ""really difficult"" stage that follows the completion of cancer treatment.


 ""You put on a sort of brave face, stoicism through treatment. Treatment's done, then it's like, 'I can crack on, get back to normal,' "" she said during a July 2 visit to Colchester Hospital. “But actually, the phase afterwards is really, really difficult.""


 ""You have to find your new normal and that takes time...and it's a rollercoaster, it's not smooth, like you expect it to be,"" Kate added. ""But the reality is you go through hard times.""


 The family outing comes just one day after it was revealed that senior aides for Prince Harry and King Charles met privately in London on Wednesday, July 9 — a small but significant sign that efforts to mend the royal rift may finally be underway.


 A distance remains between the King's sons, whose relationship has been strained since Harry and Meghan Markle's 2020 step back from royal duties. Tensions escalated in the years that followed, with the couple's televised interviews, their Netflix docuseries, and Harry's memoir Spare, which included the shocking allegation of a physical altercation with Prince William.

Julian Cash (L) and Lloyd Glasspool (R)

Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool have made history at Wimbledon, becoming the first all-British duo to win the men's doubles final for 89 years. 

They had already made history as they stepped on to Centre Court for the match an all-British duo hadn't been in the doubles final since 1960. 

It was their 14th match win in a row, taking the victory with a 6-2 7-6 (7-3) win over unseeded team Rinky Hijikata and David Pel.

After the match, Glasspool said: ""We will never forget this day for all our lives"".

Five ace facts about Wimbledon

Brits have been successful in the men's doubles over the past few years, with seven different British players winning the title since 2012 but were paired with players from other countries.

Henry Patten claimed the title with Finnish player Harri Heliövaara in 2024 and Neal Skupski won with Dutch player Wesley Koolhof in 2023. 

Speaking about the win, Julian Cash said: ""We have played a crazy amount of tennis on the grass.

""There was a lot of pressure on our shoulders. The fact we could do what everyone said we could is surreal.""

Also making history on Centre Court on the final Saturday of Wimbledon 2025 was Iga Swiatek.

She claimed the title for the first time in straight sets against Amanda Anisimova.

It's the first 6-0, 6-0 win in a Grand Slam final since 1988.

It's also the first time a woman has won a Wimbledon final with a double bagel - the name given to a victory without dropping a game - since 1911.

Speaking after the match, Iga Swiatek said: ""Honestly, I didn't even dream of winning Wimbledon because it was way too far.

""I feel like I'm an experienced player, having won other Slams, but I didn't expect this.""

The Polish player has been known to celebrate her wins with a meal of pasta with yoghurt and strawberries.

The spokesperson of the US embassy in Poland said they would try the dish if she won over her opponent Amanda Anisimova who is from the US. 

If Anisimova won, the spokesperson for the Polish embassy in the US said they would try a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

World No. 1 Jannik Sinner denied No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz a three-peat at Wimbledon, winning the latest edition of tennis' best rivalry in four sets – and avenging his loss to Alcaraz at the French Open.

After dropping the opening set, Sinner took control of the match behind his overpowering serve to win his fourth career Grand Slam title, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4.

Two-time defending champion Alcaraz of Spain was no match for the Italian's serve, which only seemed to get better as the match progressed. In the end, Sinner was able to prevent the kind of comeback Alcaraz staged at the French.

""I had a very tough loss in Paris, but at the end of the day it doesn't really matter how you win or you lose the important tournaments, you have to understand what you did wrong, try to work on that. That's exactly what we did,"" Sinner said after the match.

""We tried to accept the loss and just kept working and this is for sure one of the reasons why I hold this trophy right here.""

For Sinner, it was his first Wimbledon title and his first Grand Slam victory on anything other than a hard court – after he won the 2024 and 2025 Australian Open and 2024 U.S. Open. He becomes the first Italian to win the men's singles title at Wimbledon.

""We would never have thought we would be in this position back in the days when I was young,"" Sinner said he discussed with his coaches before the match. ""This was only a dream of the dream because it was so far away where I'm from.

""I'm just living my dream, so it's amazing.""

Look back as USA TODAY followed all the action from Centre Court.

A brilliant backhand service return down the line gave Sinner an early service break in the fourth set at 2-1. And he never let Alcaraz have an opening to break back.

The two-time defending champion tried to rally the Centre Court crowd behind him, but each time Sinner was able to combat the pressure.

Sinner was able to keep his foot on the accelerator throughout the final set, holding serve to close out the match. His last serve came off his racket at 137 mph, his fastest of the final.

Could sweet revenge be in the cards for Jannik Sinner?

Looking to reverse the outcome of their classic French Open final, Sinner took the third set against Alcaraz with a powerful array of shotmaking. On his third break point of the set, Sinner came through with the winner he needed – helping him take control of the match with a two sets to one lead.

With the score even at 4-all and Alcaraz serving, Sinner crushed a forehand winner to put himself in position for the break. He capitalized when Alcaraz slipped on a deep baseline return, putting away the easy backhand volley into the open court.

Sinner then locked down the set with a couple powerful overhead shots and a service winner to close out the set 6-4.

Sinner did not have an ace in the first two sets, but he powered in six during the third.

These two tennis titans could be headed for second consecutive instant classic in a Grand Slam final.

After taking the opening set, Alcaraz couldn't keep the momentum going at the start of Set 2. Sinner bounced back to record a service break in the opening game and – unlike in the opening set – he didn't let Alcaraz come back.

Showing some uncharacteristic emotion, the usually mild-mannered Sinner gestured after several key points during the set. He closed it out with some great athleticism to win the final point on a cross-court stunner.

Carlos Alcaraz rallied from an early deficit to win the final four games and take the opening set against Jannik Sinner.

After both players held serve their first two times, Sinner recorded the match's first service break in the fifth game, winning the final four points with some aggressive returns.

But Alcaraz battled back to even the set at four games apiece thanks to a pair of unforced errors by Sinner on his serve.

Alcaraz broke Sinner once more to take the set, as Sinner double-faulted at deuce and Alcaraz hit an amazing return that just barely cleared the net for the clinching point.

There's a slight delay, but we're now just moments away from the start of the gentlemen's singles final at Wimbledon.

Alcaraz will serve first.

Among the celebrities spotted in the crowd: Actors Keira Knightley and Matthew McConnaughey, and recording artist Seal. There's a royal presence in the audience as well.

The 2025 Wimbledon men's final between No. 1 seed Jannik Sinner and No. 2 seed Carlos Alcaraz is scheduled for Sunday, July 13 at 11 a.m. ET (4 p.m. in London).

ESPN is televising the 2025 Wimbledon men's final between No. 1 seed Jannik Sinner and No. 2 seed Carlos Alcaraz at 11 a.m. ET, following the women's doubles final.

You can live stream the match between No. 1 seed Jannik Sinner and No. 2 seed Carlos Alcaraz on the ESPN app, Disney+, ESPN+  and Fubo, which carries the ESPN family of networks and is offering a free trial.

Although No. 2 seed Carlos Alcaraz was favored to beat No. 1 seed Jannik Sinner on Friday night, according to BetMGM, the odds have flipped as the match has drawn closer. The latest odds Sunday morning now have Sinner as the favorite by a small margin.

The Weather Channel is forecasting mostly cloudy skies for the afternoon of Sunday, July 13, with a temperature of 81 degrees at the start of the match and winds around 5 mph out of the Southeast.

The winner of the 2025 Wimbledon men's singles championship will take home $4.07 million (£3,000,000) in prize money. The runner-up earns $2,060,989 (£1,520,000).

Wimbledon 2025 marks the fifth Grand Slam final for Sinner. He won the 2024 and 2025 Australian Open and the 2024 US Open but lost in the final of the 2025 French Open to Alcaraz.

This is Carlos Alcaraz's sixth Grand Slam singles final. He has won his five previous major finals, capturing the 2022 US Open, the 2024 and 2025 French Open and the past two Wimbledon titles in 2023 and 2024.

Wimbledon 2025 marks the 13th meeting between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. Alcaraz has dominated the rivalry, winning eight of the 12 previous contests, including the past five. Their most recent meeting was a five-set thriller in the final of the French Open last month, when Alcaraz rallied from two sets down to win Roland Garros crown.

The duo has met four times total in Grand Slam tournaments. In addition to the 2025 French Open, Alcaraz beat Sinner in the semfinals at Roland Garros in 2024 and the quarterfinals of the 2022 US Open. Sinner won their first Grand Slam meeting in the fourth round of Wimbledon in 2022. — Ellen J. Horrow

Carlos Alcaraz has won 21 ATP Tour singles titles since turning pro in 2018. He has a career record of 251 wins and 61 losses and has amassed $45,277,264 in career prize money (singles and doubles combined) prior to Wimbledon 2025.

Jannik Sinner has won 19 ATP Tour singles titles since turning pro in 2018. He has a career record of 282 wins and 83 losses and has amassed $41,566,997 in career prize money (singles and doubles combined) prior to Wimbledon 2025.

Roger Federer has the record for most men's singles titles in the history of the event, winning all of his championships in the Open Era (since 1968). He won the Wimbledon championship eight times during his storied career, with his first victory coming in 2003 and last in 2017. That included a run of five consecutive titles at the tournament from 2003-07. — Jacob Camenker

A total of 9 men have won Wimbledon at least four times. Most titles (*-amateur era; ^-amateur and Open era):

Wimbledon is the only one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments played on grass. The Australian and U.S. Open are played on hard court and the French Open is played on red clay.

Wimbledon generally produces faster tennis and more volleys than the other majors, and balls do not bounce nearly as high. The surface can also be slippery at times, especially compared to hardcourts.

""You have to be more focused on the footwork here,"" Carlos Alcaraz told The Athletic after winning his second Wimbledon men's singles championship in 2024. ""Moving on grass is the key to everything on grass. I can't slide as I do on clay or on a hard court."" — John Leuzzi

The 138th edition of the Wimbledon Championships is being held at the All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club on Church Road in London. It is the 103rd time that the Grand Slam event has been held on Church Road, a streak that dates back to 1922.

The Grand Slam event hasn't always been held at the All England Club on Church Road, however. From 1877 through 1921, the Wimbledon Championships were held at the former All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club location on Worple Road in London. — John Leuzzi

Many people expected we'd get a second straight Grand Slam final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, and that's exactly what we got at Wimbledon. This time, it was Sinner who came out on top to capture his first career Wimbledon title.

The U.S. Open is the final tennis grand slam set for 2025, and with Sinner not only having won at Wimbledon but also being the defending U.S. Open champion, it should come as no surprise that he's the betting favorite in New York.

Odds via DraftKings Sportsbook

It's hard to imagine someone besides Sinner or Alcaraz winning the U.S. Open, and the odds reflect exactly that. Sinner and Alcaraz are a step above the rest at +125 and +175, respectively, putting their implied probabilities of winning at 44.44% and 36.36%. The two have already faced each other in back-to-back Grand Slam finals, and it's certainly likely we'll see a trilogy match at the U.S. Open.

Behind the top two names is Novak Djokovic at +700, who is in a tier of his own behind Sinner and Alcaraz but well ahead of everyone else in the field. Djokovic has won the U.S. Open four times in his career, including in 2023, which is his most recent grand slam victory. He's in the final stretch of his career at 38 years old, but he's hoping for at least one more major victory.

Behind the top three, Jack Draper and Alexander Zverev are next on the odds list at 12-1 odds.

The U.S. Open is set to begin on August 24.

Hamzah Sheeraz was the star of boxing's first show at the home of the U.S. Open tennis tournament at Flushing Meadows.

Sheeraz punctuated the card by stopping Edgar Berlanga in the fifth round Saturday night at Louis Armstrong Stadium, making a smashing debut in his first time fighting in the U.S.

“Massive, massive performance from myself,” Sheeraz said.

The English fighter moved up in weight for his first fight at super middleweight and showed he has plenty of power for it, dropping Berlanga twice in the fourth round and then pouncing quickly to start the fifth before referee David Fields stopped the fight.

Sheeraz (22-0-1, 18 KOs) has been touted as a potential opponent for 168-pound champion Canelo Alvarez and would not only deserve it but have a chance to win if if he looked as good as he did against Berlanga (23-2), who went the distance against Alvarez in his only previous loss.

In the co-main event, Shakur Stevenson remained undefeated and defended his WBC lightweight title with a dominant performance, beating William Zepeda by unanimous decision.

Berlanga had boasted that he would have an easy night. 

But it sure got tough in the fourth round, when Sheeraz dropped him flat on his back. Berlanga raised his arms in the air, perhaps trying to show he wasn't hurt, but Sheeraz knocked him down a second time in the corner before the bell sounded to end the round.

But it didn't take long once the fifth started, as a three-punch combination knocked Berlanga off balance and one of his gloves touched the canvas as Fields waved it off.

“Today there was nothing stopping me,” Sheeraz said.

Stevenson (24-0) won 119-109 on one card and 118-110 on the other two just before Berlanga and Sheeraz fought in the final bout of the night in Louis Armstrong Stadium, the No. 2 venue at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.

But it was a main event-level performance from the 2016 Olympic silver medalist and the first wide victory of the night after the previous two bouts were close right to the finish.

Zepeda (33-1) landed a left hand shortly after the opening bell that drew a smile from the champion, and he was able to get inside a number of times to unload a series of shots at Stevenson. 

But he was often powerless to stop the flurries that were coming back at him from Stevenson's hand speed that is up at the top of boxing.

The Ring Magazine held its second fight card in New York after staging one in Times Square in May. 

Tickets weren't sold then and just a few hundred people were able to see it, creating an atmosphere where the scene was impressive but the sounds were almost non-existent, leaving fighters to say it felt like a sparring session.

This time, seats were sold and many were occupied well into the second deck of the 14,000-seat stadium, which had its retractable roof closed to create comfortable conditions on a humid day.

“Who would have thought of putting boxing here?” promoter Frank Warren said. “The noise, it just seemed to be amplified. I'm sure this is going to be used on many many occasions now for boxing besides tennis.”

The fans saw good action early in a brilliant performance from Stevenson, who has been criticized at times for a style that that seems too dependent on avoiding pain and not dishing it out.

But he seemed happy to trade Saturday and most times came out ahead when he did.

“At the end of the day, I told you all, whatever it takes to get the job done,” Stevenson said. “I got dog in me. I'm not a puppy, I'm not a poodle, I'm a tough guy, so I got dog in me.”

Zepeda did trap Stevenson in a corner to score with some shots in the third round, bringing his Mexican fans out of their seats, but many other times Stevenson's quick head movement allowed him to dodge potential trouble. By the middle of the fight, Stevenson was firing off two, three, sometimes four unreturned shots

There was a title change in the previous fight, when Subriel Matias (23-2) edged Alberto Puello (24-1) by majority decision to take the WBC's 140-pound belt.

Before that, Cuban David Morrell (12-1) got up from a fifth-round knockdown to rally late and edge Imam Khataev (10-1) by split decision in a light heavyweight bout.

...

Jannik Sinner is the quiet man of tennis who has become a big noise, burnishing his legacy on Sunday by winning his first Wimbledon title.

The Italian beat his fierce rival Carlos Alcaraz 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 in the latest instalment of their captivating rivalry to claim his fourth Grand Slam at the age of 23.

The pair are the new dominant forces in men's tennis, sharing the past seven Grand Slams between them as the memory of the ""Big Three"" era fades.

While Alcaraz is the flashy showman of the game, adored by the fans for his high-risk, high-reward tennis, Sinner stays ice-cold on the court and mild-mannered off it.

His game is based on relentless power and accuracy from the baseline, resembling that of 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic.

The Italian is getting used to life at the top, reaching his fourth successive major final at Wimbledon this year -- a run that started with the US Open last season.

Sinner defended his Australian Open title in Melbourne in January but his career was put on hold after that as he served a three-month ban for twice testing positive for banned anabolic steroid clostebol last year.

Sinner has always maintained the product entered his system unintentionally through a massage from his physiotherapist, who had used a spray containing it to treat a cut.

The World Anti-Doping Agency said ""Sinner did not intend to cheat"" but that he would serve his suspension as he is responsible for the actions of his entourage.

- Alcaraz rivalry -

Sinner returned to the court in May, reaching the final of the Italian Open, where he was beaten by Alcaraz.

Next on his schedule was the French Open and again he reached the title match, this time suffering heartbreak as Alcaraz came back from two sets down, saving three match points to defend his title.

That gave the Spaniard an 8-4 lead in the rivalry between the pair and was his fifth straight win.

But the tables were turned on Sunday as Sinner showed impressive mental strength to come back after losing the first set.

Sinner was born in German-speaking San Candido, in northern Italy, near the border with Austria.

A career in professional tennis was not a given.

He was a champion skier as a youngster and still enjoys the sport in the off-season. He was also a keen footballer.

The right-hander, who stands six feet 3 inches (191 centimetres) tall, won his first title indoors in Sofia in 2020.

The 2024 season was his breakthrough year as he collected his first Grand Slam, the Australian Open, and followed up with seven other titles including the US Open.

He became world number one -- and the first Italian to reach top spot -- in June last year.

Sinner's super-power is his extraordinary ability to stay calm on court.

""I know he's just 23 years of age, but sometimes it feels like he's much older and wiser than what we are,"" said his coach Darren Cahill. ""He's an incredible young man.""

Sinner makes no secret of the fact that he loves the job he has chosen.

""I'm very lucky because tennis started off a hobby when I was young, and now it becomes my job,"" he said.

""In my mind it's still a hobby. I love to go on court and just play. There is no better place to do it than in big stadiums with packed crowd.""

Tennis star Nick Kyrgios has had his say about world number one Jannik Sinner reaching the Wimbledon final just months after serving a doping ban.

Wimbledon finalist Sinner failed two doping tests in March 2024 but accepted a deal with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) despite protesting his innocence.

According to BBC Sport, discussions between the Italian's lawyer and legal representatives for WADA in February 2025 led to an agreement that the player would serve a three-month ban after testing positive for the banned anabolic steroid clostebol but subsequently being cleared of wrongdoing by an independent tribunal.

Advert

The controversial deal between WADA and the man who'd won the previous two Grand Slam tournaments was reached in line with case resolution guidelines and allowed the player to return in time for the French Open.

Wimbledon final opponent Carlos Alcaraz defeated Sinner in the final at Roland Garros in June and his success in SW19 this month has tempted critics back into the open.

Kyrgios – a divisive character in his own right and never one to hide his opinion in any case – made his feelings clear on Sinner's doping ban deal and not for the first time.

Advert

""At the end of the day, the decision has been made, and it's kind of in the past,"" Kyrgios told The i Paper.

""Do I think it's a good look for the sport that [Iga] Swiatek [who served a one-month suspension for an inadvertent positive test last year] and Sinner are in the final at Wimbledon after serving a ban? I don't think it's a good look for the sport.

""And I think people could agree. But I'm not going to sit there and talk about that [on commentary] in the final. They've been playing some incredible tennis.""

Advert

30-year-old Kyrgios has been limited to broadcasting duty at Wimbledon this year.

The Australian has been battling with an awful series of injuries including a torn wrist ligament that's kept him on the sidelines after surgery.

Alcaraz won the first set 6-4 but Sinner levelled the match by securing the second set of the ongoing Wimbledon men's final against Alcaraz with a stunning cross-court shot at the conclusion of a fabulous last game.

The Spaniard's profligacy with first serves gave his opponent the opportunity to serve for the next set and Sinner leads by two sets to one despite a double fault in the last game of the third.

Five weeks after his Roland Garros heartbreak, Jannik Sinner flipped the script in style at Wimbledon on Sunday to gain revenge against Carlos Alcaraz and capture his fourth major title.

Competing in his maiden final at The Championships, the World No. 1 overcame the Spaniard 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 in a high-quality clash to become the first Italian to win the Wimbledon singles crown.

""It's mostly emotional, because I had a very tough loss in Paris,"" Sinner said during the trophy ceremony. ""But at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter how you win or how you lose at important tournaments, you just have to understand what you did wrong and try to work on that, and that's exactly what we did. We tried to accept the loss and just kept working. This is for sure one of the reasons I am holding this trophy here. I am just so grateful that I am healthy and have great people around me, and holding this trophy means a lot."" 

THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS ❤️@janniksin | #Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/WqPYkmGSDf

In Paris in early June, Sinner came agonisingly close to glory at the clay-court major, where he held three championship points before Alcaraz mounted a jaw-dropping comeback, prevailing in a five-hour, 29-minute epic to keep his perfect major final record alive (5-0). But this time, under the sun on Centre Court, Sinner would not be denied.

The 23-year-old Italian came out with purpose and precision, hammering groundstrokes into the Alcaraz forehand and gradually tightening his grip on the match. As his serve grew stronger, Sinner wrestled control away from the 22-year-old Spaniard, halting a five-match losing streak in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

""Carlos, again, an amazing tournament, but mostly thank you for the player you are,” Sinner said. “It's so difficult to play against you, but we have an amazing relationship off the court and on the court, we just try to build up, and to do that we need the best teams in the world. Keep going, keep pushing and you are going to hold this [trophy] many times. You already have two [titles]!

""It's so special. Seeing my parents here, my brother, my whole team, it's amazing. Actually a special thanks to my brother, because there is no Formula 1 race this weekend, that's why he is here.""


Sinner not only etched his name into the history books as the first Italian man to win Wimbledon; he is also one title shy of completing the Grand Slam, with only Roland Garros missing from his collection. He leaves London with a 3,430-point lead over Alcaraz in the PIF ATP Rankings and a renewed edge in a rivalry that is fast becoming the defining duel of a new era.
""It's difficult to lose. It's always difficult to lose, even if it is in the final, but first of all I have to congratulate Jannik once again,"" Alcaraz said during the trophy ceremony. ""It is a really well-deserved trophy [after] an unbelievable two weeks here in London for you, playing great tennis. For your team as well. I know that there are a lot of family and a lot of friends watching you here, so it's just an amazing team around you.
“I'm really happy for you. So just keep it going, and I'm really happy to be able to build a really good relationship off the court but then a good rivalry on the court. It makes me improve every day, so thank you very much and congratulations.""

Sinner dropped just 17 games through his first three matches at this year's Championships to equal the Open Era record for the fewest games dropped into the men's fourth round. However, he survived a major scare in the fourth round, when Grigor Dimitrov was forced to retire with a pectoral injury when leading by two sets to love. That match left Sinner needing an MRI for an elbow concern, but the Italian powered on, dispatching Ben Shelton and Novak Djokovic in straight sets to reach his fifth major final.
And when the moment came against Alcaraz in the closing stages of the fourth set, Sinner didn't blink. He sealed the title on his second match point, raised his arms to the sky and let Centre Court soak in the roar of a new Wimbledon champion.
Alcaraz was chasing his sixth major and trying to become just the second man alongside Bjorn Borg to win back-to-back Roland Garros and Wimbledon titles in consecutive years. The Spaniard, who was on a career-best 24-match winning streak, leaves London holding a 48-6 record on the season after losing to Sinner in three hours and four minutes.
""I'm really proud about everything I'm doing,” said Alcaraz. “At the beginning of the season, I struggled a bit on the court and off the court, but then suddenly I just started to really enjoy being on court again, being happy again, and that excitement I have every time step on the court is thanks to my team, my family and lot of friends. I am happy that I have them here. Without them it wouldn't be possible to stand here right now- It's a great journey so far which I'm really proud about. I just want to keep it going.""

In an intense final, the two-time defending champion Alcaraz came out aggressively, hitting with heavy pace into Sinner's forehand to rush the Italian. The World No. 2 also used the drop shot frequently and showed trademark resilience to rally from 2-4 early on, sealing the opening set with a backhand defensive block on the stretch after a brutal baseline exchange during which both players were pulled from side to side.
Sinner responded by breaking Alcaraz at the start of the second set and was the more consistent in the baseline exchanges, committing five fewer unforced errors (8-13). After levelling the match with a forehand winner, the Italian, showing more emotion than normal, let out a roar and turned to his box, where coaches Simone Vagnozzi and Darren Cahill rose to their feet.
Sinner was aggressive on the Alcaraz serve in the third set, taking big cuts on return to pressurise the Spaniard. Alcaraz fended off two break points in the opening game but was unable to prevent the Italian in the ninth game, when Sinner backed up a heavy forehand by placing a volley into the open court. He then held serve to lead. With his tail up, the Italian then raced through the fourth set, winning 88 per cent of points on his first serve, to clinch his 20th tour-level crown.
Did You Know?
In the Open Era, Sinner and Alcaraz are the only Roland Garros final opponents to meet again in the same season's Wimbledon championship match besides Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, who did it in three consecutive years from 2006 through 2008. Sinner and Alcaraz have split the past seven majors.

Jannik Sinner clawed closer to Carlos Alcaraz in their Big Titles battle on Sunday when the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings defeated his great rival 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to claim the Wimbledon trophy.

Sinner has now won nine Big Titles, a combination of Grand Slam championships, trophies at the Nitto ATP Finals and ATP Masters 1000 tournaments, and Olympic singles gold medals. The 23-year-old has claimed two of them this year, emerging victorious at the Australian Open and SW19.

Big Titles Won: Alcaraz & Sinner




Sinner has won all of his Big Titles in the past two years, having earned his first in August 2023 at Toronto. During that period he has claimed four Grand Slam championships, four ATP Masters 1000 trophies and a title at the Nitto ATP Finals (2024). His winning rate over that stretch has been one Big Title secured for every 2.4 events played.

The Italian became the first man or woman from his country to earn a Wimbledon singles title. Matteo Berrettini reached the final in 2021 and Jasmine Paolini advanced to the championship match last year, but both stars fell short.

The World No. 1 is now just one Grand Slam title behind this year's Roland Garros champion Alcaraz, who has five. Sinner held three championship points against the Spaniard in the Paris final, but was unable to seize the Coupe des Mousquetaires.

Both men are one major triumph from completing the Career Grand Slam. Sinner only needs to win Roland Garros, while Alcaraz is only missing an Australian Open trophy.

Sinner has won a Big Title for every 4.6 tournaments he has played in his career. Only Novak Djokovic (3.3), Rafael Nadal (3.5), Alcaraz (4.3), Roger Federer (4.4), Pete Sampras (4.9) and Andre Agassi (6.1) have a better title conversion rate at the prestigious events.

""You lie, you steal, you degrade — I nurture, I create, I persist,"" she wrote on Instagram. ""You are everything that is wrong with America.""

	Rosie O'Donnell is clapping back at President Donald Trump after he threatened to revoke her U.S. citizenship.


	Trump posted on his social media platform, Truth Social, on Saturday, writing, “Because of the fact that Rosie O'Donnell is not in the best interests of our Great Country, I am giving serious consideration to taking away her Citizenship,” Trump wrote. “She is a Threat to Humanity, and should remain in the wonderful Country of Ireland, if they want her. GOD BLESS AMERICA!”




	O'Donnell, who has been a longtime critic of the president, was quick to respond on her Instagram, calling the president “a bad joke who cant form a coherent sentence.”

	“The president of the usa has always hated the fact that i see him for who he is – a criminal con man sexual abusing liar out to harm our nation to serve himself – this is why i moved to ireland – he is a dangerous old soulless man with dementia who lacks empathy compassion and basic humanity- i stand in direct opposition all he represents- so do millions of others – u gonna deport all who stand against ur evil tendencies – ur a bad joke who cant form a coherent sentence,” she wrote.


	In a follow-up post, the New York-born actress-comedian also shared a photo of Trump posing with the late Jeffrey Epstein, who was arrested in 2019 on federal charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. He died in 2019. “You lie, you steal, you degrade – I nurture, I create, I persist you are everything that is wrong with america – and I'm everything you hate about what's still right with it you want to revoke my citizenship? go ahead and try, king joffrey with a tangerine spray tan i'm not yours to silence i never was,” O'Donnell wrote in part.

	











	Under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, birthright citizenship is protected and can't legally be revoked by the president. Julia Gelatt, associate director of the immigration program at the Migration Policy Institute, told The New York Times on the matter, “U.S. citizens can relinquish their citizenship voluntarily, and federal courts can strip naturalized citizens of their citizenship if there is proven fraud or misrepresentation or other major cause. But U.S.-born citizens cannot have their citizenship taken away.”


	Earlier this year, O'Donnell announced that she had moved to Ireland, where she's in the process of taking up citizenship, partly prompted by the current U.S. political climate amid Trump's return to the White House.

The Jackboys are back. 


													By
												

	Michael Saponara



Travis Scott and the Cactus Jack crew have been teasing the JACKBOYS sequel all year, and the day has finally arrived — and it's fittingly 713 Day in La Flame's hometown — with JACKBOYS 2 hitting streaming services first thing Sunday (July 13).


	“THIS ALBUM IS FOR ALL SEASON BUT WAS MADE FOR EVER SUMMER THAT COMES,” Scott told his X followers on Saturday (July 12), setting the stage for the compilation project. “I CANT F—IIING WAITTTTTT.”


JB2 has 17 tracks in total, including two previously released singles: “2000 Excursion,” which saw a music video released earlier this week on YouTube, as well as “ILMB,” with Sheck Wes and Scott going bar-for-bar.


	It's a star-studded cast joining the collective, as NBA YoungBoy, Future, Playboi Carti, GloRilla, Tyla, Vybz Kartel, 21 Savage, Kodak Black, SahBabii and Waka Flocka Flame are here for the JACKBOYS 2 party. Houston rap legend Bun B also serves as the album's de facto host, OG and professor, guiding listeners throughout the U.S. while serving up hip-hop history lessons.

https://t.co/OeoFlJYzhX pic.twitter.com/jInoSXV7fL


	After Pusha T dissed La Flame on “So Be It,” Bun B was one to nearly promise a Trav response, and there appears to be an answer on JACKBOYS 2. Scott got to business with an apparent right jab to Push coming on track No. 2, “Champain & Vacay.”


	JACKBOYS 2 is a loaded expedition from Houston to Florida, pulling on different flows and sounds that have graced hip-hop across the country, while Scott is the top chemist cooking up the ultimate rap cocktail. 


	After sifting through all 17 tracks, Billboard attempts to rank every song from JACKBOYS 2 below. Crack open a Cacti (if you're of age) and lock in. 


	A radio station promo introduction welcomes fans into the JACKBOYS world. Bun B, who plays host on the project, is the next voice heard in conversation with Scott as he reflects on a time when he had to convince the world that Houston was the next rap capital in hip-hop. 


	Bun B directs the project's transitions and he's highlighting Houston, of course, but also showing love to other cities that played an integral role in rap over the years. Here, he tips his cap nearly 600 miles north to Memphis, which is a fitting introduction for GloRilla, who isn't shy about making it known her “only regret is being too young to f—k Matthew McConaughey.” She even pronounces the actor's name twice to get her point across. “Shyne” was one of the weaker spots for La Flame on the album. 


	Don Toliver, it's your turn to shine. Plenty of artists could learn a thing taking Don's advice as he croons with a splash of AutoTune: “Turn off your comments.” A twitchy beat with a disco flair courtesy of Jahaan Sweet. I'd guess he sent this in a pack to Drake that was passed over and landed in Toliver's gift basket, and he makes the most of his solo opportunity with a robotic flow.




	Sheck Wes and Don Toliver have proven to be a potent pick-and-roll duo in the past, and they pick up where they left off with a Cactus Jack alley-oop while hyping up their women on “Velour.” Don handles chorus duties while Sheck picks up the tab for his girl. “She break the rules, I pay the funds/ She got a Birkin, she wanted more,” he raps. It's safe to say Tyler, the Creator doesn't subscribe to the same mentality when it comes to women [Listen to his verse on “P.O.V.” from Clipse's Let God Sort Em Out]. 


	Sheck Wes in love and he doesn't care who knows it. “ILMB” dropped in April and gave fans an early peek into the mojo of JB2.  It feels like a true Harlem love story as told by Sheck. “She roll up my blunts, heat up my meals, and watch me play 2k,” he raps. Does it get realer than that? Scott comes in to bat clean up and take the AM-produced track across the finish line. 


	Is that Molly Santana ad-libs on the intro? Don Toliver and Future join forces for a codeine-splashed chorus while passing the baton to Cactus Jack newcomer Wallie the Sensei, who left his mark on the masses with his guest appearance on Kendrick Lamar's 2024 GNX album. “I ain't even ate and I'm still s—g/ Won't make her my b—h, but I'm still hittin'/ F—in' on queens, but I ain't from Great Britain,” he cheekily raps.  


	La Flame is trying to have the dancefloors two-stepping with this one. As one of the artists ahead of his time when he burst onto the scene circa 2017, SahBabii has a well-deserved moment nearly a decade later with his mystical assist. As King Squid himself, Sah takes listeners on an underwater voyage in the depths of the ocean, and he's still good for a hilarious jab at the haters: “Ain't gon' shower for days, now how my d—k taste.”




	The 2000 Ford Excursion somehow led to the JACKBOYS 2 lead single 25 years later, go figure. Scott set the table for the compilation with the woozy “2000 Excursion” video earlier in the week, which finds him clearing the lane for Sheck Wes and Don Toliver to shine. La Flame and Cardo on the beat is never going to be a miss, and who doesn't love a Ye “Power” flip with Mike Dean's tonic synths. 


	A SoFaygo solo track. Fans of the Cactus Jack artist had been clamoring for music from the Michigan native, and he gets his chance to shine throughout JB2. “MM3” is SoFayGo's ode to his designer wardrobe and you can't keep up with him. Raging tracks like this should get more eyes on him and amp up the noise heading into the 23-year-old's next project.


	The Worl' Boss has shown up to the party. Scott gets into his dancehall bag while joining forces with Vybz Kartel and Tyla for the groovy “PBT.” The transitions on the album have been smooth and Scott's versatility is back on full display. But hold on, how does Gen-Z's South African singer know about Yellow Pages? “You want me back, don't want ya/ You the yellow book, search my number,” she sings. 


	Fans who watched or attended Scott's electric Coachella set in April got a first listen to the hasty “Kick Out,” which teased what was to come with the JB era. But Scott is always good for a surprise, and he enlists 21 Savage, who comes through with his signature menacing ad-libs, which are some of the best in rap today. “Kick Out” probably lands somewhere in the middle of the pack when it comes to the full album. 


	The first “outside” from Travis Scott is a longtime fan-favorite, which found him linking up with 21 Savage on a Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight standout. So that's to say the bar is high if Cactus Jack and Scott are going to top the 2016 edition. 


	Scott goes back-and-forth with himself, but the second voice is a much deeper version, and it would be interesting to hear him utilize this strategy more down the line. La Flame taunts the opposition while stealing their girl in the process. “Got your lil' b—h outside,” he repeats. Now, talk about a shock to the system. 


	YoungBoy Never Broke Again breaks the glass and takes the crown with the most surprising guest appearance of the night. Seriously, this was like the Hardy Boyz coming out at WrestleMania 33. And he handles business with ease, turning the unlikely collab into a potent track. 


	Another track that was previewed at Coachella. “Dumbo” finds Scott hitting on another lucid chorus that's also catchy — he's had a penchant for that over the course of his decorated career. But his punchy bars seemingly play hopscotch across the spacy production. For me, I would've preferred a different plan of attack with his verses to go with a plush hook, but there's definitely potential for “Dumbo” to grow on fans. 


	Next stop, Miami. Tay Keith lights up Vice City and Scott blankets the starry production with a raspy flow as if he smoked a pack of cigarettes before hitting the booth. La Flame turns into a Florida GPS on the second verse, which is some of his strongest rapping on the project as he found his pocket. Hailing from Broward County, Kodak Black is right at home driving in the Miami Vice fast lane. He teases a call with Baby Keem about potentially going on tour with Scott and then plays with fire while name-dropping Trav's ex, Kylie Jenner. “Florida Flow” better be on GTA VI. 


	The true project intro finds a peaceful wave, which is shredded by rambunctious Waka Flocka Flame Bricksquad ad-libs. Scott is at his best as a curator and he's laying the foundation for the world-building of JACKBOYS 2, which calls back to the chopped-n-screwed era. He ruminates on times stepping into Louis Vuitton while draped in 10 chains, dodging TMZ landmines in his blue Lamborghini and keeping his phone on DND. That's the Travis Scott experience in 2025. 


	Many wondered if he would respond, and this appears to be Scott's reply to Pusha T dissing him on “So Be It.” La Flame calls out “old heads” pissing him off and wastes no time giving a jab on track No. 2. “Man I sware these old n—s kill me/ Made a 100 off pushin tees/ Now my phone on DND,” he raps while seemingly taking a swipe at Push.




	LaFlame connects with SoFayGo as the duo invades the rage rap scene with a blaring beat that could've landed on Playboi Carti's WHOLE LOTTA RED. “I've been winnin' my whole life, it ain't no contest/ Judgin' by your first impression, b—h, I'm not impressed,” Scott spews on the chorus. This feels like it could be another response sniping back at Pusha T. Regardless, the chaos of “Contest” shines as a project standout and SoFaygo keeps up with La Flame, making him one of the clear early winners of JACKBOYS 2. 


	Plenty of eyeballs jumped to “Where Was You” when word got out that the “Type Shit” collaborators were reuniting. Well, the Cactus Jack x OO combination did it again. Carti kicks off flexing his private jet trips to Mexico and lacing his girl with icy chains. Scott seemingly takes a page out of Future's “Where Ya At?” flow while giving a rare look into personal life and surroundings while climbing the rap food chain.


	Let's show F1LTHY some love, who has been on a run this year. His skittering production feels like it could've soundtracked a Rush Hour scene if it were a horror. Future invades the scene like a superhero and his syrupy rhymes recalling his lavish Monaco escapades never get old, no matter how many times we hear about them.

An epic, early Christmas present dropped into Hallmark Channel fans' laps late on July 12, 2025, as the network pulled off a major surprise, announcing that Hallmark's 16th annual Countdown to Christmas programming lineup will include a third movie in the beloved “Three Wise Men” franchise. 

Hallmark hunks Tyler Hynes, Andrew Walker, and Paul Campbell appeared in a late-night promo that aired on the network and dropped on its social media accounts, where fans were told to “get ready for #ThreeWisestMen.” And all three subtly added their own Instagram teases, sending fans into a frenzy, crying happy tears and screaming with glee. 

A post shared by Tyler Hynes (@tyler_hynes)

Hynes, Walker, and Campbell scored a smash hit in 2022 with “Three Wise Men and a Baby,” written by Campbell and fellow Hallmark star Kimberley Sustad, who also appears in the movies along. After 18 months of fans begging for a sequel, they returned for a second movie, “Three Wiser Men and a Boy,” in 2024. Campbell and Sustad wrote that screenplay, too, with help from star screenwriter Russell Hainline. 

To coyly announce the new movie late on July 12, Hynes posted an image of himself, Walker, and Campbell — who play the Brenner brothers in the franchise — with “WM3 One more embrace…” written over the photo. Hynes tagged them and Sustad, as well as actress Margaret Colin, who plays the Brenners' mom, and wrote, “Take me home. 🎄”

Without revealing what he was about to film, Walker had told fans in an Instagram post on July 12 that after a short summer break with his family, he was heading “back to work now — feeling grateful for the time off, the people I spent it with, and the chance to keep doing what I love. 🎥”

Once the news broke that night, Campbell shared a screenshot on Instagram of People's article about the movie and wrote, “Whelp… here we go again. Buckle up kids…”

Then, on the morning of July 13, Hynes shared a brief video in his Instagram Stories of all three guys, dressed in their candy cane elf costumes from the second movie, as they each walked purposefully to their trailers on set as Phil Collins' “Take Me Home” played in the background. 

A post shared by Hallmark Channel (@hallmarkchannel)

Hallmark fans flooded social media as soon as the news dropped, flipping out over the unexpected third movie, with some admitting they were literally crying happy tears. 

One fan wrote on Hynes' post, “Permission to sob?? 😭 This reunion is everything I never knew I needed! Let the WM3 magic begin! 💥✨🍿

Another wrote on Hallmark's post, “I LITERALLY JUST SCREAMED seeing this pop up on my TV!!! I couldn't be More Excited!!! I KNEW something was happening! I just KNEW IT!!! Yes. YES. YEEEEAAASSSS!!!”

Someone else wrote, “Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!😲😁🥳🎉[Cue me – Jumping up and down]”

Another thrilled fan commented, “My hallmark dream coming true! The Brenner's are back!! ♥️ Brenner in EVER!”

Multiple Hallmarkies also made sure to note that they're game for as many movies as possible in the franchise, including one who wrote, “WM3 and 4 and 5 and 6 and… we are here for as many as you want to give us @tyler_hynes @awalkk35 @paulcampbellofficial 😍 we love the bromance!!!”

Early in “The Institute,” a 14-year-old genius named Luke (Joe Freeman) tries to explain to his parents why his traditional high school education isn't challenging enough. “There's so much I want to learn and figure out. It makes me feel so… small,” he says, in between bites of pizza at a busy restaurant. “I have this dream, and I'm standing on the edge of an abyss, and it's full of all the things I don't know. […] And there's a bridge, and I want to walk across that bridge, and all the things from the darkness will come flowing up–” 

 










Then the near-empty pizza pan that's been ominously vibrating as Luke speaks suddenly flies off their table and crashes to the floor. The whole room turns and looks at the family, more disturbed by the noise than curious of its cause. Joe quickly apologizes and picks up the pan. He grabs another slice. The other guests go back to their meals. The parents are equally unperturbed, but clearly they already know: There's something extra special about their son.

Stephen King loves contrasting the ordinary with the extraordinary, just as the prolific author has long shown concern for the world's children and wariness of their elders' so-called wisdom. “The Institute,” a dour, clunky MGM+ adaptation, brings these recurring themes together in familiar ways (along with a few more King trademarks, including a good-hearted drifter and an eerie small town in Maine). Although showrunner Benjamin Cavell doesn't show much interest in digging deeper than a surface-level appreciation of King's challenging juxtapositions, his simple story (shown with equal nonchalance by director and executive producer Jack Bender) still evokes the faintest pathos for Luke's plight. 

Oh so eager to throw himself into the unknown abyss yet far too innocent to appreciate what might be down there, the atypical, typical teen caught in extraordinary, ordinary circumstances is about to get the lesson of a lifetime: Be careful what you wish for.

That's because Luke does get to change schools, just not as he requested. Instead of heading to MIT in the fall, he's kidnapped and taken to an undisclosed location. Instead of a teary goodbye with his parents from his new dorm room, he wakes up alone in a cold, gray building made of dense concrete, steel doors, and plenty of secrets (which, come to think of it, isn't unlike some dorms). 

 










There are a few other kids around, at least, and Kalisha (Simone Miller) gives him the lay of the land as best she can: The handful of teens like she and Luke were “recruited” to “serve their country” using their unprecedented abilities: either telekinesis or telepathy. Each kid has one or the other when they arrive, and they're “encouraged” to learn the other as quickly as possible. In the building known as Front Half, they're given “tests” to develop their abilities until they're ready to move on to Back Half. Once they're done there (with Lord knows what), they get to go home! The scientists will wipe their memories, and each kid will return to their parents without a single memory — good or bad — of their time at the Institute.

Well, that's what the adults say anyway. Despite assurances from the administrator, Ms. Sigsby (Mary Louise-Parker), Luke remains skeptical of everything he's told. If they're really saving the world, why can't he know how? Why did he need to be taken? Wouldn't plenty of skilled kids volunteer for the chance to help humanity, especially if it only takes a few months and they won't remember the hard parts? Why can't they contact their parents? Why can't they leave the facility? And why is the punishment for disobedience akin to literal torture? 

 










Ms. Sigsby would answer that last question by saying what they're doing is too important to tolerate defiance. But psychologically and psychically abusing kids seems a bit extreme, and it's by far the most upsetting aspect of watching “The Institute.” While not as gruesome or unrelenting as other King adaptations, seeing children suffer episode after episode takes a toll. Paired with the gray-ish green color palette, sparse decor, and dark atmospherics in the Institute itself, the bleak vibes may be enough to turn some viewers off for good, especially those horror purists who tune in hoping to be terrified rather than just bummed out.

A rudimentary B-plot does what it can to balance out the bad with the good, but Ben Barnes' door-knocking drifter, Tim Jamieson, never develops beyond the generalized shape of America's few remaining nice guys. Still recovering from a justified shooting he still regrets, the former Boston cop rolls into town at random, grabs a flier for a “night knocker,” and proceeds to spend his nights patrolling the town. Just like his grandfather used to do, Tim makes sure the businesses are locked up and the residents are safe in their beds.

Until they're not. Soon enough, word of the Institute reaches Tim's ears, and the inquisitive newcomer has to get to the bottom of what's really going on there. Barnes' charisma is sanded down to nothing, which only magnifies how little is going on with Tim. The same substantive deficits afflict Louise-Parker, too, whose bright eyes and brusque wit are wasted in a role that's villainous potential exists only in exposition. The young cast fares slightly better, especially Freeman, although Bender's blocking undercuts their lived-in performances with awkward, ill-timed action sequences. 

 










The latter episodes find better pacing, even if there's no mystery around how things will wrap up. “The Institute” aptly identifies the keenness young adults have to reach the next level of life, embracing the control so often promised by their superiors and then rarely rewarded when the time comes. If you stretch, you could see a political allegory in there, but the show isn't aiming for anything so sophisticated and limits itself to a typical thought exercise. Once the moral quandary fully reveals itself, the answers are stripped of any possible complexity, as if grown-up problems can be solved merely by seeing the world in black-and-white. 

Sometimes they can, and “The Institute” can feel refreshing when its throwback style meshes with its timeless principles. Unfortunately, ordinary ideas aren't enough in a show lacking anything extraordinary whatsoever.

“The Institute” premieres Sunday, July 13 at 9 p.m. on MGM+.

It's been 11 years since Oscar-winning filmmaker Peter Jackson completed his “Hobbit” trilogy. He has not directed a narrative feature since, though he certainly has not been stagnant. 

He did, however, direct the Beatles' docuseries “Get Back” and the 3D WWI doc “They Shall Not Grow Old,” which colorized and restored wartime footage. He also wrote and produced “Mortal Engines” in 2018, and he was listed as an executive producer on the anime “The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim” in 2024. But since he completed his last ode to J. R. R. Tolkien, he has not led a film set. Jackson, though, insists that he is not out of the game.

“No, no. I'm certainly not retired,” Jackson told ScreenRant in an interview. “We are currently working on three different screenplays. I'm at the moment writing three different scripts.”

The “District 9” director teased that more will be coming from both his “Lord of the Rings” universe and Beatles retrospectives.

“We are producing and have been writing ‘The Hunt for Gollum,' which Andy Serkis is going to direct next year,” he said. “I've enjoyed working on documentaries, whether they show I've grown old or not, and obviously the ‘Get Back: The Beatles' project. I've enjoyed doing various things with The Beatles, which is great, and that'll probably carry on.”

 










What he might actually direct, he did not say. But what Jackson is most excited about, he revealed, involves pulling a real-life “Jurassic Park” with a large prehistoric bird.

“But to me, de-extincting the Moa would be just as exciting, if not more exciting, than any film I could possibly make. I've made a lot of movies, but to see the Giant Moa brought back would be a level of excitement that I think would supersede anything at this point in time,” he explained.

Jackson is speaking of the biotech company Colossal Biosciences, of which he is a major investor. The company, according to its website, is “the world's first and only de-extinction company,” and goes on to write that “Colossal is closer to restoring the past, preserving the present and safeguarding the future than anyone before. To truly illustrate our success, we must not only redefine de-extinction, but establish standards for the science behind it, as well.”

Last year, Colossal was able to use fossil DNA to bring two dire wolves back from extinction after 10,000 years. No, really: here's the Time cover story.

For David Corenswet and Rachel Brosnahan, their chemistry read as Clark Kent and Lois Lane — or Superman and Lois Lane — was over and done as quickly as it started. 

Corenswet told People that he met “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” Emmy winner “in sort of a flurry of handshakes and hellos.” It was summer 2023, Brosnahan had flown into Los Angeles from New York City, and she was due back for a performance of “The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window” on Broadway.

“We said a quick hello, and he was… very nice and very tall, and we read the scene together,” Brosnahan told People. The scene in question, Corenswet remembered, was on the long side, 10-12 pages, and ended up being shot again for the final film.

“Neither of us quite knew what we were doing,” he said. “We had each done the scene with other people, so we weren't sure if the blocking was going to be the same or whether we were going to figure something else out between the two of us. So, I think we both thought it was… sort of a warm-up, and we would get another shot. And then [writer/director James Gunn] yelled, ‘Cut,' and said, ‘Great, that was awesome. Alright, Rachel, I think you're getting on a plane.'”

 










“The whole thing is kind of a blur,” Brosnahan said. “Honestly, I don't remember anything about it. And then we said goodbye, and that was it.”

“The next thing that happened was we found out we were cast. We didn't know each other at all,” Corenswet said.

Since they'd be following in the footsteps of previous portrayers like Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Henry Cavill, and Amy Adams, the stars knew that they had to meet and get to know one another.

“We'd had this brief but obviously impactful moment together during our chemistry read… but I think we both left feeling like we didn't remember anything about it, and wanted to spend some time together. We had a really lovely breakfast [in New York] after we found out we were going to be playing the roles together… and got to know each other that way,” Brosnahan recalled.

Through the long production shoot, the two got to know one another very well, and discovered that they were such good scene partners, they'd often get totally lost in their characters.

“She made me curse at her,” Corenswet laughed. “The way she delivered one particular line made me sort of involuntarily say, ‘Oh, f*** you,' which I think was a great shock to all of us… She caught me off guard and made me feel really hurt in that moment, and so I, in character, shot back at her.”

 










Not all moments were so dramatic, however. Brosnahan recalled a lighthearted take where Corenswet made an “expression of how injured he was,” and she found it “so funny.” “I think about that face he made in that moment all of the time,” she said.

Jeff Lynne's ELO—the reformed version of Lynne's '70s and '80s prog-pop outfit Electric Light Orchestra—have cancelled what was slated to be their final show ever. The performance had been scheduled for tonight, July 13, to close out BST Hyde Park's 2025 summer concert series. A statement shared with Pitchfork explains that “Jeff has been battling a systemic infection and is currently in the care of a team of doctors who have advised him that performing is simply not possible time nor will he be able to reschedule.”

“The legacy of the band and his longtime fans are foremost in Jeff's mind today,” the statement continues, “and while he is so sorry that he cannot perform, he knows that he must focus on his health and rehabilitation at this time.”

In 2024, Jeff Lynne's ELO announced their Over and Out farewell tour of North America, which was subsequently extended into a run of European dates. The band were also forced to cancel a performance at Manchester's Co-Op Live last Thursday (July 10) due to Lynne's illness.

Lynne founded the Electric Light Orchestra in 1970 alongside Roy Wood and Bev Bevan. The band released four U.S. platinum records—A New World Record, Out of the Blue, Discovery, and Xanadu—before their breakup in 1986. 2014 saw the formation of Jeff Lynne's ELO, who went on to release two albums under the moniker: 2015's Alone in the Universe and 2019's From Out of Nowhere. In 2020, Lynne was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE).

The spirit of the Old Wild West will never die as long as there are towns like Pioche in Nevada, I can tell you!

This is a little part of Americana that outdid even the likes of the iconic Tombstone in building up a reputation for lawlessness and gunslingers.

We made our way there after spending a night in Vegas, heading off along the Great Basin Highway for a 585-mile trip that would take four days.

Setting off, our elderly driver, Earl, advised: “Buckle up, you are in for some ride,” and he wasn't wrong as we set off across the Mojave Desert.

Here we visited ghost towns where the silver miners fought it out with guns on the streets in scenes reminiscent of the old Western movies like High Noon, They Died With Their Boots On, The Gun Fighter and many more.

As I stood on the main street of Pioche I expected to see the tumbleweed coming towards me and the ghosts of those who died by the gun emerging to play out the violent scenes again.

This once prosperous and thriving silver mining town gained its deadly reputation when the word spread in the 1800s that none of the first 72 people to die there passed away from natural causes.

A visit to this town with its nice friendly community makes it hard to believe that it was once one of the roughest and toughest mining towns in the Old West - attracting thousands of fortune seekers who believed they would hit a rich vein of silver.

This ghost town in Lincoln County - and believe me there are ghosts aplenty here attracting supernatural hunters from all over the world -  was one of the highlights of our road trip along the Great Basin Highway.

Having been a fan of the great Western movies since my younger days, I was drawn to exploring the little town.

And there I found the Overland Hotel and Saloon, which on the Travel Channel's Ghost Adventures was deemed to have provided some of the most successful interactions with spirits.

So pro tip, if you want to stay there but don't want any interactions with the spirits, avoid room 10, where others have reported doors mysteriously slamming and being awakened from a deep sleep by something supernatural.

This was the town where the gunslingers let their guns do the talking because there was no law and order - life was cheap and the many saloons all led to the lawlessness for which Pioche became famous.

As a reporter who covers courts, I was fascinated by the Million Dollar Courthouse where many of those caught ended up.

Boothill Cemetery also exists to this day with some fascinating headstones - including one stating that the occupant of the grave was shot in an argument over a dog.

If it's phenomena of a different kind you want, we swapped ghosts for aliens.

The mysterious Area 51 is synonymous with tales of UFO's, and vehicles stopping for no reason on the Extraterrestrial Highway.

We even stopped under the sign to see if our presence could attract even the smallest of spaceships, but alas it was not to be.

You may not automatically think of Las Vegas, Nevada and State Parks, but we visited a number of great ones, including the amazing Valley of Fire, a geological park with rocks of many different colours.

It gets its name from the way the sandstone formations combine to give an image of a valley on fire. 

When you stand and gaze at so many different shapes and sizes of rock formations and realise you are looking at 150 million years in time with the maze of canyons, domes, ridges and towers carved from sand deposited back when dinosaurs walked the earth, it is truly awesome.

As we joined the queue to gain entry I was very taken with the sign which said “Heat warning. You might die.”

And seeing as it was late May, we were very lucky that the heat was not overwhelming, meaning we could spending hours there.

When it is too hot, the park can often close, which happened the day after we visited.

But be warned. Do not venture alone as people have been known to get lost and some have died.

Among the State Parks clustered around the towns of Caliente and Pioche is Cathedral Gorge, which many regard as one of the State's crown jewel.

This is thanks to spectacular slot canyons, spires, and other erosional features.

This is a place for exploring and is a hiker's paradise, which was once completely underwater.

As we drove along the highway with the Mojave Desert as our backdrop, we passed amazing sand dunes and forests of Joshua trees, but even more fascinating is the number of farms along the route, something you wouldn't expect in the dry desert.

It is truly nature's beauty in its very rawest form. 

An interesting fact about the Joshua trees, apart from the U2 connection, was that Mormon preachers used them as a navigational aid to find their way back home.

GET THERE: I flew with Aer Lingus to Las Vegas, who operate a seasonal service three times weekly from October to May with prices starting at €450 return

STAY THERE: Stay in Prospector Hotel and Gambling Hall in Ely, a really unique and very Wild West hotel for €112 for two sharing a room.

EAT THERE: Dining out was not a gourmet experience and very often it was grab-and-go at gas stops. But the Historic Silver Cafe in Pioche provided good food and great service.

MORE INFO: Visit TravelNevada.com to find out more info on the US state.

Then we went to the Great Basin National Park which stretches from California's Sierra Nevada to Utah's Wasatch Mountains.

They say “half the park is after dark”, the reason being that this is designated an International Dark Sky Park by DarkSky, and has its own amphitheatre for looking at the most amazing star-filled skies.

I was just blown away by the sight of so many stars against the very black backdrop and could never have imagined the sheer beauty and magnificence I was viewing.

In the park, too, are some of the oldest living trees on Earth. The ancient Bristlecone pine groves throughout are believed to be almost 5,000 years old.

The best place to see these ancient trees is along the Bristlecone Trail, which is accessed from the Wheeler Peak Campground.

And you just can't leave the park without a visit to the Lehman Caves, with marble roofs and limestone formations.

This is Nevada's largest cave system, but remember you must book in advance as visits require guides.

There was so much crammed into our trip, like the scenic drive up Wheeler Peak, or popping into towns like Ely, home to railroad museums and beautiful murals.

One thing is for sure, it made me see a whole new world in Nevada away from the slots and the lights of the city.

EDITOR'S NOTE:  Kara Alaimo is an associate professor of communication at Fairleigh Dickinson University. Her book “Over the Influence: Why Social Media Is Toxic for Women and Girls — And How We Can Take It Back” was published in 2024 by Alcove Press. Follow her on Instagram, Facebook and Bluesky.



            Many people try to limit the time they spend on social media when they're with their kids. But new research suggests social media use has a significant effect on interactions with children — even when adults aren't looking at their screens.
    


            Mothers who were in the habit of spending more time on social media talked much less to their kids when they played with them than did moms who spent less time on social networks, and that difference carried over when they weren't using their devices, according to a study to be presented Tuesday at the Digital Media and Developing Minds International Scientific Congress in Washington, DC.
    


            While past research has focused on how kids are affected when parents or guardians are on their screens, this study looked at the impact of cell phone use on parent-child interactions even when parents were offline, said Liz Robinson, a doctoral student at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa and lead author of the study.
    


            Mothers who used social media extensively spoke 29% less to their kids while playing with them — without their phones — compared with the moms whose social media use was low. Moms in the low-use category used social media an average of 21 minutes per day, while moms in the high-use category used social media an average of 169 minutes per day.
    


When kids use screens, parents worry about the wrong thing, new study suggests



            Other uses of screens, including checking email or the weather, weren't associated with talking less to kids, according to the study of 65 toddlers ages 2 through 5 years old and their mothers in Alabama.
    


            Although Robinson's research has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a journal, it doesn't surprise me. In my own research, people often say they still think about what they see on social media long after they log off. Although the moms in this study were physically present with their kids, it's possible their minds were elsewhere.
    


            “Often our minds wander to activities that are more pleasurable naturally, and we know social media is that experience for most people,” said Kris Perry, executive director of Children and Screens: Institute of Digital Media and Child Development, a nonprofit to help kids lead healthy digital lives and the organizer of the Congress.
    


            Perry, who was not involved in the research, pointed out that social networks show us tailored content that is intensely interesting to us, so “it makes you want to experience it longer.”
    


            Whatever the reason, kids need their parents to be mentally present when they play. Thankfully, there are things we can do to make sure our social media use doesn't interfere with our parenting.
    


            One of the most important things parents can do is to talk to their children all the time.
    


            Learning language is “a major feature of optimal child development” and it's “dependent on children expressing and receiving language from birth through (age) 18,” Perry said.
    


            Greater exposure to language tends to improve kids' brain development, academic outcomes, communication skills and language, she said.
    


            The interactions parents and kids have when they play are also important to children's socioemotional development, Robinson said, to help them develop their executive functions and attention spans and learn how to regulate their emotions.
    


            Interacting with adults is also one of the ways children learn what to prioritize. “Kids are acutely aware of where a parent is looking,” Robinson said, “and they learn what's important. So, when our gaze is constantly going towards a device, towards a smartphone, well, we're communicating to our children what's important in that moment, too.”
    


            That's why parents should make a conscious effort to be mentally present when interacting with their kids. “Our attention is one of the best things that we can give to our children,” Robinson said, noting that this conveys  to them that we love them.
    


            Robinson recommended that parents set aside certain times of the day to give their kids undivided attention. That's advice I also give when I speak to parent groups and at schools about how to handle kids' social media use.
    


            Of course, finding this time isn't easy. “None of us can give our kids undivided attention all the time, but it can be helpful to think on a smaller scale,” Robinson said. “Though I have many things to tend to today, I can give my child undivided attention for the next 15 minutes. That focused time goes a long way from the child's perspective.”
    


            When we're with our kids, we can remind ourselves “there is nowhere but here,   and there is no time but now in your child's mind,” Robinson said. “And so, you have many other thoughts and many other priorities that are floating around in your head. But we can compartmentalize those and be fully present with our child, who knows only this moment, and only our attention.”
    


Nearly half of teens say social media is bad for youth mental health, report finds



            Parents should also pay attention to how their social media use is affecting them and their children, Perry said. “Understand what the impact of using social media is on you personally, and make sure that you're mitigating what those impacts are when you go to interact with your child.”
    


            A simple way to do that? Limit the number of times you check it per week and how long you spend on it each time.
    


            “Reduce the amount of time you're on social media to prevent the likelihood that you would even inadvertently speak less” to your child, Perry said. And, of course, using social media less could also free up more time for parents to spend playing with their kids.
    


            Robinson said the biggest limitation of the research is that it's correlational — the authors couldn't establish whether social media was making parents more passive or whether more passive parents were using social media more. In addition, the study couldn't account for factors such as parents' mental health, income and education.
    


            I'd also love to see this study replicated with fathers, who should also be taking responsibility for playing with their kids and using social media responsibly.
    


            Still, the study suggests using social media more could reduce our conversations with our children, and that got me thinking. Next time I play with my daughters, I'll be checking in with myself on whether I'm talking to them or my thoughts are elsewhere.
    


            I'll also be more conscious of how much the content I'm seeing on social media is continuing to play out in my head even after I'm done scrolling. I might even talk to my kids about the changes I make as a result.

Cities Confront Cars:

Construction mogul Jay Cashman says Boston Mayor Michelle Wu's bike lane overhaul is such a disaster that he's willing to spend as much as $1 million to force the city to redo them.

Wu, who is seeking reelection this year, has added about 15 miles of bike lanes in a push to make it easier for cyclists to get around the notoriously labyrinthine city and inspire more Bostonians to commute to work this way. But Cashman, along with other residents, business owners and neighborhood groups, says the revamp was too hasty and ignored critics' concerns, which range from safety risks, loss of parking spaces, more congested street traffic and slower response times for emergency vehicles.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Ethereum has finally touched the $3,000 price level once again after spending weeks trading in a narrow range beneath $2,800. This recent breakout, although brief, marks the first time Ethereum reclaimed this level since early February. According to technical analyst Merlijn The Trader, Ethereum's next destination after breaking past $3,000 is already in sight.

Bull Flag Breakout Points To Measured Move For Ethereum

Ethereum went through an interesting rally last week alongside Bitcoin's push to new all-time highs. However, this Ethereum price rally, which saw it touch $3,000 again, wasn't based on momentum spillover from Bitcoin alone. This is because Ethereum itself experienced significant institutional interest from Spot Ethereum ETFs. 

According to data from SoSoValue, US-based Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a combined $907.99 million in inflows last week, their best week since the products launched in July 2024. Thursday, July 10, alone was highlighted by inflows of $383.10 million, making it the largest single-day inflow for any Ethereum ETF in 2025 so far.

In a post shared on the social media platform X, crypto analyst Merlijn pointed to a confirmed bull flag breakout on Ethereum's daily candlestick timeframe chart. Interestingly, the technical setup proposed by the analyst follows a falling wedge reversal that preceded the current uptrend. 

According to the chart attached to his analysis, the falling wedge that led to the reversal was formed from the December 2024 highs to the April 2025 lows, with the breakout occurring in mid-May. The breakout eventually saw Ethereum entering into a tight flag-like consolidation that spanned between May and June, until the most recent breakout above $2,700.

That pattern has now resolved to the upside, and the next technical level of interest is a measured move based on the price action that formed the pole of the bull flag. This measured move places the next technical level of price interest at $3,834.

80% Of ETH Now In Profit

On-chain indicators further validate Ethereum's current strength. According to data from on-chain analytics platform Santiment, Ethereum's price action has been dancing around the $3,000 mark since Friday, crossing it multiple times intraday. During this back and forth, 124.13 million ETH out of the 155.04 million total supply crossed into profitability, which represents 79.96% of all tokens. This reading is particularly interesting as it is the highest percentage recorded since January 2025.



Image From X: Santiment

The same data shows Ethereum is just 13 million coins away from matching the total supply in profit at its previous all-time high of profitability recorded in December 2024. This shift toward a profit-heavy network state tends to encourage holding behavior and long-term conviction, which could translate into reduced sell pressure in the coming week. This, in turn, could see Ethereum close a daily candle above $3,000 and move toward the $3,834 price target during the new week.

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,960, up by 17.5% in the past 24 hours.

FIFA Club World Cup

live

Updated 36s ago

Chelsea are leading Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 in the final of the 2025 Club World Cup, with President Donald Trump in attendance at the MetLife Stadium.

England international Cole Palmer scored Chelsea's first two goals with Joao Pedro adding the third shortly before the half-time break.

The game is live on DAZN and highlights will be available later on The Athletic.

HT Chelsea 3-0 PSG

If Chelsea are capable of thrashing a team like PSG, the Premier League is going to be ultra-competitive this season.

Liverpool are reigning champions and have added Florian Wirtz, Manchester City have comprehensively reloaded, Arsenal look to finally be signing a striker, Newcastle are making significant investments, and now you throw the presumptive world champions into the mix.

And that's before considering whether clubs like Manchester United and Tottenham can return to the domestic levels they expect to be at.

HT Chelsea 3-0 PSG

There was a bit of a sense of disbelief at MetLife Stadium after Chelsea's third goal.

They are doing to UEFA Champions League winners PSG what the French champions did to Real Madrid here on Wednesday. Remarkable.

HT Chelsea 3-0 PSG

A great roar from the Chelsea fans at the half-time whistle. Their supporters section behind the goal is full of energy as they serenade their players off the pitch. You have to imagine more than a few fans are pinching themselves, hardly able to believe what their team is doing to the European champions.

HT Chelsea 3-0 PSG

An extraordinary first half comes to an end and Chelsea are 3-0 up against the European champions in the Club World Cup final!

PSG are usually the team going in at half-time with a commanding lead, yet they have it all to do in the second half.

Cole Palmer has been excellent with two goals as well as an assist for Joao Pedro who got his third Chelsea goal on just his second start.

45+3' Chelsea 3-0 PSG

A collective gasp from every Chelsea fan inside MetLife Stadium as Joao Neves ghosted into the penalty area and made first contact with a well-angled cross.

His header was an accurate one and was headed for the bottom corner, but it lacked the pace it needed and Sanchez got down to his right to keep it out.

Another key contribution in this first half from the Chelsea goalkeeper.

45+1' Chelsea 3-0 PSG

The fourth official has shown us that there will be six more minutes of this first half.

That third goal makes it feel like PSG need to pull one back in this period of stoppage time.

45' Chelsea 3-0 PSG

Gusto did not touch the ball in the attacking half during that sequence, but he was absolutely crucial to the goal —  dragging Mendes away and allowing Palmer to do his thing.

44' Chelsea 3-0 PSG

I'm not sure even the most optimistic Chelsea fan was expecting this!

Palmer had so much space again and he drove towards the PSG penalty area under no pressure from the European champions. Lucas Beraldo made a pretty weak attempt to step onto the England midfielder and that allowed him to thread a lovely ball into Joao Pedro.

The new signing waited for Donnarumma to close him down and then lifted the ball over him and into the net.

Another superb finish and, if anyone was in any doubt, Chelsea are in total control of this Club World Cup final.

43' Chelsea 3-0 PSG

A third goal in this dream first half for Chelsea — they have been brilliant!

41' Chelsea 2-0 PSG

Another Chelsea yellow card, the first for a mistimed challenge.

Gusto is the reluctant recipient and becomes the third player in blue to be walking a disciplinary tightrope in this final after Neto and Caicedo.

40' Chelsea 2-0 PSG

In a really strong Chelsea performance, Sanchez has one of the stand-out performers. He has had his critics, but this has been a dominant showing from the Spaniard so far.

A dangerous-looking cross was aimed into the heart of the penalty area and he raced off his line, flew into the air and punched it away with both hands. It was greeted, as you can imagine, by huge cheers from the Chelsea fans behind his goal.

38' Chelsea 2-0 PSG

Teams often try to exploit Hakimi's advanced runs by countering down his flank, but Chelsea have found space on the opposite side. Left-back Nuno Mendes has also committed high upfield, with Vitinha legging back in hopes of slowing Palmer's progression toward the box.

By the time he reached the top of the box, the Portugal midfidlder was hoping a defender could pick up the England international, but that wasn't the case.

36' Chelsea 2-0 PSG

More petulant Chelsea behaviour that the referee is not happy with.

Caicedo fouled Joao Neves on the left-hand side and reacted by kicking the ball away. He looked straight over at the referee with his hands raised in apology but Faghani's mind was already made up.

Maresca won't be happy that two of his players are walking a tightrope for two pieces of rather childish behaviour.

35' Chelsea 2-0 PSG

Alireza Faghani has gone to his pocket for the first time in this game.

Pedro Neto, who was clearly very critical of the referee despite Chelsea winning a free kick, is the man to receive the first booking of the Club World Cup final.

Pretty silly from the Chelsea winger who now has an hour up against Hakimi having had his card marked.

33' Chelsea 2-0 PSG

The two PSG's full-backs have been the best in the world over the last six months, but this first half has not covered Mendes in glory.

Gusto dominated him for the first goal and he was completely missing in action when Palmer broke away down Chelsea's right for the second.

The main praise of Mendes and Achraf Hakimi is usually that they attack so well while also having a defensive influence, but they have not had an impact so far.

31' Chelsea 2-0 PSG

See what I mean? Another of those beautifully placed shots into the bottom corner from Palmer and Chelsea are 2-0 up.

31' Chelsea 2-0 PSG

This has been a staggeringly good start to this Club World Cup final by those Chelsea players — they are completely outplaying the European champions.

Mendes has not started well for PSG and his vacated left-hand side allowed James to clip a pass over the top for Palmer to chase. Vitinha was the recovering defender but his half-hearted attempt to stop Chelsea's talisman only opened up space for him in the penalty area.

With all the time in the world, Palmer coolly picked out the bottom left corner for the second time in this match. Cue the celebration!

30' Chelsea 2-0 PSG

He's at it again and Chelsea are in dreamland at MetLife Stadium!

28' Chelsea 1-0 PSG

Jannik Sinner has defeated two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to win his first Wimbledon championship and reverse the result of their epic French Open final five weeks ago

LONDON -- Jannik Sinner defeated two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 on Sunday to win his first Wimbledon championship and reverse the result of their epic French Open final five weeks ago.

The No. 1-ranked Sinner earned his fourth Grand Slam title overall, moving him one away from No. 2 Alcaraz's total as the two young rivals separate themselves from the rest of the pack in men's tennis.

This victory also allowed Sinner, a 23-year-old Italian, to put an end to several streaks for Alcaraz, a 22-year-old Spaniard.

Alcaraz had won the past five head-to-head matches between the pair, most recently across five sets and nearly 5 1/2 hours at Roland-Garros on June 8. Sinner took a two-set lead in that one, then held a trio of match points, but couldn't close the deal. That made Alcaraz 5-0 in major finals.

In addition to ending that piece of perfection, Sinner asserted himself in a match that featured moments of terrific play by both men, but also the occasional lapses.

Alcaraz stepped into the sunlight bathing Centre Court as the owner of a career-best 24-match unbeaten run. He had won 20 matches in a row at the All England Club, including victories against Novak Djokovic in the 2023 and 2024 finals. 

The last man to beat Alcaraz at Wimbledon? Sinner, in the fourth round in 2022.

So this served as a bookend win for Sinner, who proved what he kept telling anyone who asked: No, there would be no carryover from his heartbreak in Paris. Hard to imagine, though, that that collapse wasn't on his mind at least a little on Sunday, especially when he faced two break points while serving at 4-3, 15-40 in the fourth set.

But he calmly took the next four points to hold there, and soon was serving out the win. When it ended, Sinner put both hands on his white hat. After embracing Alcaraz at the net, Sinner crouched on court with his head bowed, then pounded his right palm on the grass.

Yes, Sinner put the French Open behind him in the best way possible and demonstrated that his matchups with Alcaraz could delight tennis fans for years to come.

They have divvied up the past seven Grand Slam trophies, and nine of the last 12.

Fittingly, this marked the first time the same two men faced off in the title matches on the clay at Roland-Garros and the grass at the All England Club in the same year since Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal did it in 2006, 2007 and 2008. It hadn't happened for more than a half-century before that trilogy.

Sinner has participated in each of the last four major finals, a stretch that began with a triumph at the U.S. Open last September and was followed by another at the Australian Open this January.

Wearing the same tape job and white arm sleeve to protect his right elbow that he has been using since falling in the opening game of his fourth-round win on Monday, Sinner never showed any issues, just as he had not while eliminating 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic in the semifinals.

Carlos Alcaraz Sends One-Word Message on Future at Wimbledon After Loss originally appeared on Athlon Sports.

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner delivered another Grand Slam classic on Sunday, but this time, the outcome flipped. Sinner, World No. 1, fought back after losing the first set to beat the defending champion 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 and claim his maiden Wimbledon title. The win marked Sinner's fourth Grand Slam title and second of the year after winning the Australian Open in January. Meanwhile, Alcaraz saw his 24-match win streak and perfect 5-0 Grand Slam final record come to an end.

Despite the loss, Alcaraz remained composed and optimistic. When asked during ESPN's post-match interview if he saw himself returning to Wimbledon to fight for another title, his answer was clear and confident: “Absolutely.”

That one word, backed by a smile, drew a massive cheer from the crowd, a reminder of how beloved he is at the All England Club.

In his on-court speech, Alcaraz graciously praised his rival and friend. “First of all, I just have to congratulate Jannik once again,” he said. “It's a really well-deserved trophy. Unbelievable two weeks here in London for you.”

He acknowledged the strength of their rivalry and how it pushes him. “We have a great rivalry on the court that made me improve every day. So, thank you very much and congratulations.”

Despite the sting of defeat, Alcaraz assured fans of his love for Wimbledon. “Wimbledon is one of the most beautiful tournaments, if not the most beautiful. I love playing here. I feel at home,” he said.

With that attitude, Alcaraz made one thing clear that he'll be back. And as he walked off the grass, fans knew Sunday wasn't a farewell, just a pause in what's shaping up to be an epic rivalry.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=australian+open+tennis","How much prize money did Jannik Sinner win at Wimbledon 2025?","https://en.as.com/other_sports/how-much-prize-money-did-janick-sinner-win-at-wimbledon-2025-n/","Sun, 13 Jul 2025 18:23:22 GMT","

Wimbledon has the highest winner's prize money of the four Grand Slam tournaments.

Italian Jannik Sinner is the 2025 men's Wimbledon champion, beating Spain's Carlos Alcaraz in four sets (4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4)

For his efforts, he takes home a winner's check for £3,000,000, roughly $4,000,000. That's the largest champion's payday of any Grand Slam in 2025, with the next closest being the US Open, which will hand out $3.6 million to its singles winner this fall.

The French Open paid $2.8 million to winner Alcaraz, and  Sinner collected $2.26 million for his victory over Alexander Zverev in the Australian Open final back in January. 

Runner-up Alcaraz earns £1.5 million (about $2 million).

Prize money at all four Grand Slams has been equal for men and women since 2007, when Wimbledon became the last of the majors to adopt parity. Iga Swiatek picked up the winner's check for winning the Wimbledon Women's singles title yesterday. 

✨ 2018 - Girls' Singles Champion✨ 2025 - Ladies' Singles ChampionSeven years on, @iga_swiatek is a #Wimbledon champion again 🏆 pic.twitter.com/uf2x6Hk4MP

The total prize fund at Wimbledon 2025 is a record £53,500,000—around $72 million.

The total prize pot at Wimbledon in 1968, the first year of the Open Era, was £26,150, around $63,000. The men's champion, Rod Laver, picked up $4,800 (£2,000) and the women's winner, Billie Jean King, won $1,800 (£750).

While the women's trophy at Wimbledon is known as the Venus Rosewater Dish, the men's trophy is simply called the Gentlemen's Singles Trophy. The original trophies were the Field Cup (1877-1883) and the Challenge Cup (1884-1886), both of which ended up in William Renshaw's trophy cabinet as he got to keep them both after after twice winning the Gentlemen's Single title three times in succession.

In 1887, Wimbledon bought the current trophy for 100 guineas (105 pounds sterling, worth around $510 back then, some $17,000 today). The club decided they didn't want to have to pay for more trophies so changed the rules to say that the new trophy would never become the property of the winner.

The cup is made of silver gilt and stands 18 inches tall with a diameter of 7.5 inches. It bears the inscription ‘The All England Lawn Tennis Club Single Handed Championship of the World'. 

The design is classic, with two handles. At the base of each are two heads with a winged helmet and flowers on the edges. The most characteristic feature is the pineapple that crowns the trophy. One theory for this fruity addition comes from the custom of the time. British sailors adorned the entrances of their houses with a pineapple to announce their return. The pineapple was also a symbol of welcome, hospitality and recognition. King Charles II of England also posed with this fruit in a portrait representing the privilege of the powerful.

On Sunday, wtatennis.com caught up with Iga Swiatek during a whirlwind, hard-working and mostly sleepless period since becoming the Wimbledon champion.

Iga Swiatek needed less than an hour to defeat Amanda Anisimova 6-0, 6-0 in Saturday's Wimbledon final. It was only the second time in the Open Era that a women's Grand Slam champion did not lose a single game.

And then the real work began:

For nearly three hours, Swiatek dutifully made the rounds. It opened with a packed press conference in English, then Polish, followed by television interviews with, among many others, ESPN, Tennis Channel, BBC Sport, Wimbledon TV, Prime Germany, Eurosport, Wowow, Ziggo, Tencent. She visited with the Tennis Podcast and sat down for separate roundtables with British and international writers.

Eventually, Swiatek and her team made the short journey up the hill to IMG House for a sprawling, tapas-style dinner with family and friends. They talked, replaying the fortnight's memorable moments, enjoyed some good music and eventually got to bed. Swiatek said she might have slept for 90 minutes, more of a nap, before rising early Sunday for more media obligations.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

“I just finished a photo shoot on Centre Court,” Swiatek told wtatennis.com on Sunday. “Going out there without any stress anymore, just full pleasure, no more work -- I could just really appreciate it even more.”

Wearing a white t-shirt and salmon-colored shorts, she was speaking from the nail bar, just off the player lawn, receiving a rather becoming shade of pink.

Here's more of what Swiatek said:

You used the word surreal yesterday … So, 20 hours after winning the title, does it feel real yet?

It does, actually. I think the more time I have, the more I appreciate it. Obviously, yesterday there were a lot of emotions, but now I can reflect on everything that has happened. It's just amazing.

A post shared by Wimbledon (@wimbledon)

What were some of the specific adjustments to your usual game that your coach Wim Fissette was suggesting on grass?

Overall, we worked a lot on my forehand and the serve. I think the serve, from the beginning when we started working together, was the main key. We already did that a little bit and it worked at the Australian Open. … On grass, we knew it was going to be crucial. These two things, obviously, and the movement, not sliding as much as on other surfaces.

How difficult was it for you to, against your nature, add more risk by being more aggressive on the grass?

I was really going for it. I just needed to be brave with my decisions on the court. I think the years before I tried to play more of my clay-court game. I'd still spin the ball as much as possible, which didn't really do a lot because the effect was it just bounced higher, and opponents were playing from the top. So, yeah, this year I decided that I'm just going to use my intuition more, just react to what the grass brings me. I played more flat, and I think this was the best decision. I was more aggressive in the first points of the rally and that puts a lot of pressure on my opponents.

You finished the tournament with three bagels, won your last 20 games in a row -- where did that come from?

[Laughing] I just did my job, you know? I wasn't really counting. Honestly, in the last match I tried not to focus on the score. The main goal was to just keep working, not really taking anything for granted. When you're leading that way, it's easy to take your foot off the gas pedal. I just really focused on every point.

You're one of three women to win your first six Grand Slam finals -- what qualities in your game and your mind made that possible?

I think the first Grand Slam final that I played [2020 Roland Garros], it was a bit of a different feeling. I felt like an underdog, I played freely without any pressure. Then later on, in 2022 Roland Garros, I really felt like I needed to prove to myself that I could do it again. I remember I was really confident with my game and my tennis. That was something that I leaned on. The [2022] US Open, I've got to say, for sure, that was a tough one. I remember starting the match well [against Ons Jabeur] and the momentum kind of followed. So yesterday, because of the fact that grass was never my favorite surface, I felt like I needed to enjoy every minute and appreciate that I was playing the final. That really helped me to treat this final as any other match -- and not this huge thing.

A post shared by Iga Świątek (@iga.swiatek)

How does winning this title that you never thought you'd win change your view of what is possible in your career? 

Honestly, I don't know yet. You never know what's going to happen in the future, but for sure this title surprised me. I've got to say that winning Wimbledon was last on my bucket list, because I just thought it was going to be the hardest one, the most tricky one. It means for me I should always believe, because if I could adjust my game to grass, I think anything is possible.

The set scores the biggest streaming week for a soundtrack in over three years.

	Keith Caulfield



	The KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack climbs 3-2 on the Billboard 200 chart dated July 19 — a new peak — in its third week on the list. The set earned 75,000 equivalent album units (up 21%) in the United States in the tracking week ending July 10, according to Luminate. It's the first soundtrack to debut in the top 10 on the Billboard 200 and then see unit increases in its second and third weeks since the Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2: Awesome Mix Vol. 2 album in 2017.


	In the 2020s, only four soundtracks have reached the top two on the Billboard 200: KPop Demon Hunters, Wicked (which debuted and peaked at No. 2 in 2024), Barbie (also No. 2 debut and peak, in 2023) and Encanto (nine weeks at No. 1 in 2022).

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new July 19, 2025-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard's website on July 15

	











	Of the KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack's 75,000 units earned in its third week, SEA units comprise 70,000 (up 24%, equaling 96.33 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs — it holds at No. 2 on Top Streaming Albums), album sales comprise 4,000 (down 6% — it rises 21-9 on Top Album Sales) and TEA units comprise 1,000 (up 6%). (The album continues to only be available to purchase as a digital download album. A CD edition of the album is due in August, while a vinyl edition is slated for an October release.)


	As the KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack racked up 96.33 million streams for its songs in its third week, it scores the biggest streaming week for a soundtrack in more three years. The last soundtrack to post a bigger streaming figure was Encanto, on the March 12, 2022-dated chart, when it rang up 101.16 million streams for its songs in its eighth week at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.


KPop Demon Hunters premiered on June 20 in a limited theatrical release in the U.S., and on Netflix, alongside its soundtrack release. In the tracking week ending July 6, KPop Demon Hunters held at No. 2 in its third week on Netflix's Top 10 Movies in United States chart.

Love looks good on Jennifer Aniston. Known for guarding her privacy, the actress is quietly stepping into a new chapter and is happy. Aniston has a new man in her life — and sources say it's going well. The “Friends” alum, 56, is dating Jim Curtis, an author and life coach who specializes in hypnotherapy, multiple insiders confirm to People.  

“[They are] casually dating and having fun,” one insider shared. “They've been seeing each other for a few months now. They were introduced by a friend and started out as friends.”

This comes two days after US Weekly confirmed: “They've been hanging out a lot, but very much on the DL at her home in L.A.,” the source shares. “It's very Zen, and she has always been very much into that. They're a good match.”

A post shared by Jim Curtis (@jimcurtis1)

Jim Curtis is best known as a co-author of the wellness book Shift and a speaker in the mental health and coaching space. He describes himself on Instagram as someone whose mission is to help people “heal and thrive by upgrading your ‘I AM.'”

His background appears to align with Aniston's longtime interest in personal growth and holistic wellness. “He's very different from anyone she's dated before,” the insider told People.

Aniston was reportedly already familiar with Curtis's work before they met. “Jen had read his book and was familiar with his work. She's really into self-help and wellness,” the source added.

Aniston and Curtis were recently photographed enjoying time together on a yacht in Mallorca with friends, including Jason Bateman and Amanda Anka. 

In one photo obtained by Daily Mail, Curtis appeared to rub Aniston's shoulders. In another, they were spotted embracing — and possibly sharing a kiss. Although they haven't officially confirmed their romance, the two follow each other on Instagram, and fans noticed Curtis' book featured in a May photo carousel Aniston shared on social media.

While Aniston has remained private about her love life since her split from Justin Theroux in 2018, those close to her say this connection feels healthy and natural.

“She's been happy on her own, but she's also open to sharing her life with someone, as long as it feels right,” the insider explained. According to a report published in People on July 13, “Jen's in a very good place right now. She's grounded, fulfilled, and very happy.”

A post shared by Jennifer Aniston (@jenniferaniston)

Aniston admitted that juggling career and self-care remains a challenge. “This was a really intensive few years of work,” she told People in June. “I'm a bit of a workaholic, so I'm forcing myself to try to take some time to travel and not work.”

Despite prioritizing downtime, Aniston has a packed slate. She's producing a 9 to 5 reboot with Diablo Cody. As per Variety, she is also developing a TV adaptation of Jennette McCurdy's memoir, “I'm Glad My Mom Died”.

She'll also return to screens on September 17 when “The Morning Show” premieres its fourth season on Apple TV+.

							By 

	Peter Wade



	A memo reveals the federal government is planning to deport immigrants to countries where they hold no citizenship, with as little as six hours' notice and without any guarantees that they'll be protected from torture or persecution when they get there.


	In the memo, obtained by The Washington Post, Todd M. Lyons, the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detailed plans for deportations following a Supreme Court decision that cleared a path for rapidly deporting immigrants to places to which they have no prior ties.


	If the plans are implemented, many more immigrants may soon find themselves sent to countries where they know no one and do not speak the language — and they will have little to no opportunity to legally challenge their removal before it takes place.


	Lyons wrote that the Supreme Court's ruling in June allowed immigration officials to “immediately” begin deporting immigrants to “alternative” countries, a term used to describe a country where the deportee is not a citizen. This policy will apply to immigrants who have final removal orders but whom a judge has ruled cannot be sent back to their home country because it would put them in danger. It will also apply to immigrants from countries with whom the U.S. does not have strong relations, like Cuba or China.

	











	How much notice an immigrant gets, the memo said, depends on where they are being sent. If the U.S. has received “diplomatic assurances” that immigrants sent to a particular country will be safe, and the State Department “believes those assurances to be credible,” then immigrants will be deported there without any prior notice. 

	











	If the immigrant is being sent to a place where the government has not secured such assurances, they could be deported there with hours' notice. According to the memo, “in exigent circumstances” immigration officers could give immigrants as little as six hours' notice that they were being deported somewhere they have no protections against prosecution or torture. In other cases, immigrants will get 24 hours' notice.

	Immigration officers will not ask each immigrant if they have concerns about being sent to another country, but immigrants who do express a fear of being sent to a third country will be screened within approximately 24 hours to see if they are eligible for humanitarian protection according to federal law and the Convention Against Torture, a United Nations convention that Congress ratified in 1994 that protects immigrants from being sent to a country where they could be subject to torture.


	“It puts thousands of lives at risk of persecution and torture,” Trina Realmuto, executive director of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, told The Post.

	All of this is part of the administration's plans for mass deportations. Although Trump promised during the campaign to deport criminals — “the worst of the worst” — recent ICE data reveals that 72 percent of immigration detainees have zero criminal convictions. The government appears to be moving full steam ahead on deportations even though public opinion has recently pivoted, with one poll showing more Americans oppose than support Trump's immigration policies by a 27-point margin.


	Already, the Trump administration has been deporting immigrants to third countries, and it seems those numbers will only increase after the Supreme Court's ruling. Hundreds of Venezuelans are being detained at CECOT, a notorious prison in El Salvador known for inhumane and torturous conditions. Eight men from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Sudan, and Vietnam have been sent to war-torn South Sudan. The administration also illegally deported Salvadoran immigrant, Kilmar Abrego García, to his home country in violation of a judge's order. Abrego, who said he was tortured while in El Salvador, returned to the U.S. in June because the Supreme Court ordered the administration to bring him back. However, the government has recently considered sending him to a third country before he is able to stand trial on criminal charges.
