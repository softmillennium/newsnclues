                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Donald Trump – and other western leaders – are taking their time to catch up with reality, it is obvious that Vladimir Putin has no apparent desire to halt the war in Ukraine. The past six months have been dominated by the erroneous assumption that it would be possible for Trump to negotiate a ceasefire, even an armistice. But Putin has shown no desire to stop attacking. A fresh Russian ground offensive is emerging towards Velykyi Burluk, 50 miles east of Kharkiv, and for now is making some rare gains: three miles in 10 days. More significantly, the cynical bombing of Ukraine's cities by missile and drone is only intensifying, straining Kyiv's air defences and leading to more civilian casualties. It will be soon possible for Russia to attack with 1,000 drones in a night, Ukraine believes. In a paper written last month, Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian defence minister, said “an acceptable armistice may never formally arrive” and that Kyiv should formulate “a revised theory of victory” – which accepts that the Kremlin considers itself engaged in a forever war against its smaller neighbour. The former minister describes the new approach as “strategic neutralisation”, a permanent and dynamic military effort to ensure that Russia's forces cannot advance and that Moscow becomes “operationally incapable of disrupting key aspects of Ukrainian strategic, political, economic, and social life”. It accepts that Ukraine cannot retake territories already occupied by Moscow, or attack again into Russia, as happened into Kursk oblast last summer, and instead pursues an active defence. Ukraine, which began the war without a navy, had managed to box in the Russian Black Sea fleet by mid-2023 by successfully sinking and threatening to sink warships with remotely piloted sea drones. Kyiv was able to unilaterally reopen a corridor for grain shipments from Odesa and nearby areas in 2023 without having to negotiate a special exemption for such traffic with Russia. Russia has struggled to gain territory inside Ukraine during 2025, though it has collapsed the Kursk pocket, and its forces incurred casualty rates (killed and wounded) of about 1,100 a day in June – showing that Kyiv can roughly hold the line largely with the help of £300-£370 ($400-$500) first-person view (FPV) drones that it can manufacture in bulk. The already slow rate of Russian advance suggests this approach may be possible, though an important question is what will happen once the last of the US military aid approved by former president Joe Biden tails off. Weapons deliveries were halted at the end of last month amid fears US stockpiles were low (perhaps at 25% of the desired levels), though Trump has partially relented, sending a symbolic 10 Patriot missiles last week. The US president, finally acknowledging that Putin is stalling, has promised a “major announcement” on Monday, which may involve extra sanctions on Russia and allowing European countries to buy more weapons for Kyiv. It would make strategic sense if whatever is offered comes with the recognition that Putin is not serious about peace – and gives Ukraine what it needs to neutralise the aggressor.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump has announced he will open millions of acres of National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska up to oil and gas companies. Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! It's called the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, but despite its industrial-sounding name, the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, or NPR-A, is much more than a fuel depot. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. The Trump administration announced a plan on June 17, 2025, to open nearly 82 percent of this fragile landscape to oil and gas development, including some of its most ecologically sensitive areas. I am an ecologist, and I have been studying sensitive ecosystems and the species that depend on them for over 20 years. The Bureau of Land Management is responsible for overseeing the reserve and identifying and protecting areas with important ecological or cultural values – aptly named “special areas.” The Trump administration now plans to expand the amount of land available for drilling in the NPR-A from about 11.7 million acres to more than 18.5 million acres – including parts of those “special areas” – as part of its effort to increase U.S. oil drilling and reduce regulations on the industry. The reserve is a sanctuary for many Arctic wildlife, including caribou populations that have experienced sharp global declines in recent years. The reserve's open tundra provides critical calving, foraging, migratory and winter habitat for three of the four caribou herds on Alaska's North Slope. These herds undertake some of the longest overland migrations on Earth. Infrastructure such as roads and industrial activity can disrupt their movement, further harming the populations' health. The NPR-A is also globally significant for migratory birds. Situated at the northern end of five major flyways, birds come here from all corners of the Earth, including all 50 states. An estimated 72% of Arctic Coastal Plain shorebirds – over 4.5 million birds – nest in the reserve. Expanding oil and gas development in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska could threaten these birds by disrupting their habitat and adding noise to the landscape. Many other species also depend on intact ecosystems there. Polar bears build dens in the area, making it critical for cub survival. Wolverines, which follow caribou herds, also rely on large, connected expanses of undisturbed habitat for their dens and food. A large stretch of the Colville River is currently protected as a special area, but the Trump administration's proposed plan will remove those protections. The Teshekpuk Lake special area, critical habitat for caribou and migrating birds, would also lose protection. Indigenous communities in the Arctic, particularly the Iñupiat people, also depend on these lands, waters and wildlife for subsistence hunting and fishing. Their livelihoods, food security, cultural identity and spiritual practices are deeply intertwined with the health of this ecosystem. The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska is vast, and drilling won't occur across all of it. But oil and gas operations pose far-reaching risks that extend well beyond the drill sites. That can alter water flow and the timing of ice melt. It can also disrupt reproduction and migration routes for wildlife that rely on large, connected habitats. That can upset the normal pattern of meltwater, making it harder for shore birds to nest. ConocoPhillips' Willow drilling project, approved by the Biden administration in 2023 on the eastern side of the reserve, provides some insight into the potential impact: An initial project plan, later scaled back, included up to 575 miles (925 kilometers) of ice roads for construction, an air strip, more than 300 miles (nearly 485 kilometers) of new pipeline, a processing facility, a gravel mine and barge transportation, in addition to five drilling sites. Many animals will try to steer clear of noise, light and human activity. Research has shown that caribou mothers with new calves avoid infrastructure and that this impact does not lessen over time of exposure.

Outrage continues to grow against U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem over her response to the deadly floods that ravaged Texas last week. According to a Friday report from The New York Times, more than two-thirds of phone calls to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) from flood victims went unanswered after Noem allowed hundreds of contractors to be laid off on July 5, just a day after the nightmare storm. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. On July 5, as floodwaters were starting to recede, FEMA received 3,027 calls from disaster survivors and answered 3,018, or roughly 99.7 percent, the documents show. Noem, who has said she wants to eliminate FEMA entirely, described it as a way of limiting “waste, fraud, and abuse.” Under this policy, Noem allowed other critical parts of the flood response to wait for days as well. Earlier this week, multiple officials within FEMA told CNN that she waited more than 72 hours to authorize the deployment of search and rescue teams and aerial imaging. Following The Times' piece, DHS put out a statement claiming that “NO ONE was left without assistance, and every call was responded to urgently.” “When a natural disaster strikes, phone calls surge, and wait times can subsequently increase,” DHS said. “Despite this expected influx, FEMA's disaster call center responded to every caller swiftly and efficiently, ensuring no one was left without assistance. No call center operators were laid off or fired.” One official wrote in a July 8 email to colleagues: “We still do not have a decision, waiver, or signature from the DHS Secretary.” Democratic lawmakers were already calling for investigations into Noem's response to the floods before Friday. Following The Times‘ revelations, outrage has reached a greater fever pitch. Others pointed out that Noem has often sought to justify abolishing FEMA by characterizing it as slow and ineffectual. “So that when it fails this summer, she can say, ‘Oh, see, we told you — FEMA doesn't work.

Her book “Over the Influence: Why Social Media Is Toxic for Women and Girls — And How We Can Take It Back” was published in 2024 by Alcove Press. But new research suggests social media use has a significant effect on interactions with children — even when adults aren't looking at their screens. Mothers who were in the habit of spending more time on social media talked much less to their kids when they played with them than did moms who spent less time on social networks, and that difference carried over when they weren't using their devices, according to a study to be presented Tuesday at the Digital Media and Developing Minds International Scientific Congress in Washington, DC. While past research has focused on how kids are affected when parents or guardians are on their screens, this study looked at the impact of cell phone use on parent-child interactions even when parents were offline, said Liz Robinson, a doctoral student at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa and lead author of the study. Mothers who used social media extensively spoke 29% less to their kids while playing with them — without their phones — compared with the moms whose social media use was low. Moms in the low-use category used social media an average of 21 minutes per day, while moms in the high-use category used social media an average of 169 minutes per day. When kids use screens, parents worry about the wrong thing, new study suggests Other uses of screens, including checking email or the weather, weren't associated with talking less to kids, according to the study of 65 toddlers ages 2 through 5 years old and their mothers in Alabama. Although Robinson's research has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a journal, it doesn't surprise me. “Often our minds wander to activities that are more pleasurable naturally, and we know social media is that experience for most people,” said Kris Perry, executive director of Children and Screens: Institute of Digital Media and Child Development, a nonprofit to help kids lead healthy digital lives and the organizer of the Congress. Perry, who was not involved in the research, pointed out that social networks show us tailored content that is intensely interesting to us, so “it makes you want to experience it longer.” Whatever the reason, kids need their parents to be mentally present when they play. Learning language is “a major feature of optimal child development” and it's “dependent on children expressing and receiving language from birth through (age) 18,” Perry said. Interacting with adults is also one of the ways children learn what to prioritize. “Kids are acutely aware of where a parent is looking,” Robinson said, “and they learn what's important. So, when our gaze is constantly going towards a device, towards a smartphone, well, we're communicating to our children what's important in that moment, too.” That's why parents should make a conscious effort to be mentally present when interacting with their kids. Robinson recommended that parents set aside certain times of the day to give their kids undivided attention. That's advice I also give when I speak to parent groups and at schools about how to handle kids' social media use. “None of us can give our kids undivided attention all the time, but it can be helpful to think on a smaller scale,” Robinson said. That focused time goes a long way from the child's perspective.” When we're with our kids, we can remind ourselves “there is nowhere but here,   and there is no time but now in your child's mind,” Robinson said. Nearly half of teens say social media is bad for youth mental health, report finds “Reduce the amount of time you're on social media to prevent the likelihood that you would even inadvertently speak less” to your child, Perry said. And, of course, using social media less could also free up more time for parents to spend playing with their kids. Robinson said the biggest limitation of the research is that it's correlational — the authors couldn't establish whether social media was making parents more passive or whether more passive parents were using social media more. In addition, the study couldn't account for factors such as parents' mental health, income and education. I'd also love to see this study replicated with fathers, who should also be taking responsibility for playing with their kids and using social media responsibly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>French maritime enthusiasts are battling to save a replica of an 18th-century warship that became a symbol of the country's historic relationship with America. The copy of L'Hermione, a three-mast, 32-gun frigate that carried the Marquis de Lafayette across the Atlantic to announce France's support for American independence from Great Britain in the revolutionary war, has been in dry dock at Anglet, near Bayonne, since its oak hull was found to be riddled with fungus four years ago. Campaigners have raised €5m (£4.3m) to replace part of the rotted structure but say they need another €5m to make the vessel seaworthy again. Despite launching an appeal two years ago, the funds have not been found. A fresh plea for the remaining funds comes as relations between France and the US enter a stormy period after Donald Trump's threat to impose a 30% tariff on goods from the European Union. It has been three years in dry dock and its 1,200 tonnes of wood needs to be in sea water and not dry. We're hoping that if someone comes forward with the funds, we could restart work to repair the hull in September, with a view to sailing again in 2027.” The replica of L'Hermione, which took 17 years to build and cost €26m, was launched in 2015 and sailed to New York where it was greeted by an enthusiastic crowd. L'Hermione – nicknamed the “Ship of Liberty” – spent two years battling the British naval blockade before returning to France. In 1793, she ran aground off western France and sank. Unlike the original, the replica has modern navigation equipment and electric motors for manoeuvring in and out of ports. It was also fitted with showers and toilets, as opposed to a plank of wood with holes in it near the prow that the original crew would have used. A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day “What we know about these fungi is that they existed in the 18th century, but back then it took six months to build a ship, and if one didn't come back or rotted, they just built another. Obviously, we cannot do that,” Beau said. “We want to build a ship that lasts longer than they did at the time.” The association has issued a new international appeal for funds, saying it is “now or never” to save the ship.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia is actively increasing its influence across African countries, using propaganda networks such as the Russian state information agency TASS and state-owned news outlet RT, Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) said on July 13. As of July 13, the channel, widely acknowledged as a Kremlin propaganda machine, is broadcast in more than 40 African countries in six languages, according to HUR's statement on social media. “Russian propaganda is a global threat that works for one purpose — the aggressor's territorial, resource and cultural expansion,” said HUR spokesperson Andrii Yusov in a statement. RT had also implemented educational programs for local journalists, training over a thousand media professionals according to Russian standards in 2024, according to HUR. In June 2025, full-time training began in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, and plans are underway to scale up similar programs to other countries. TASS also plans to develop its networks by opening correspondent bureaus in Ethiopia, Senegal, Algeria, Congo, and other African countries. Last year, the U.S. claimed that RT was collaborating with Russian intelligence to target countries globally amid a heavy-handed crackdown on the Kremlin's disinformation campaigns. Tech giant Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, banned Russian state-run media outlets like RT and Rossiya Segodnya from its sites last year over “foreign interference activity,” which didn't significantly impact its influence, according to experts. According to Bloomberg, Interpol in Botswana launched an investigation for possible involvement with human trafficking in 2025 into a work-study program 'Alabuga start,' which sent African women to work in Russia, most likely on the military production.

By the end of the year, Russia Today plans to launch broadcasting in Amharic for an audience in Ethiopia, HUR said.

The alleged Russian agents were killed during a shootout in an SBU special operation on July 13 in Kyiv Oblast, according to the agency. The report estimated that North Korea could have provided Russia with around 28,000 containers containing weapons and artillery shells to date. Deadly attacks on civilians were reported in Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Sumy, and Kherson oblasts, according to regional authorities.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Photo taken from a drone on Aug. 20, 2023 shows the Motherland monument in Kyiv, with the Ukrainian trident, or "tryzub," being installed on a shield in the statue's left hand. Editor's note: This article originated as a winning story idea in a vote by members of the Kyiv Independent's community. The trident, known in Ukrainian as tryzub, is instantly recognizable as the central element of Ukraine's modern coat of arms. But beyond its official role, the tryzub has taken on profound symbolic meaning in recent years amid Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine — one for which some Ukrainians have been killed or tortured simply for displaying. Reports from occupied territories describe Russian forces strip-searching and targeting civilians for patriotic tattoos, particularly those featuring the Ukrainian flag or the tryzub. Ukrainian soldiers returning from Russian captivity have recounted beatings and torture specifically targeting those who had tryzub tattoos. In contested towns near the front, where many locals have fled or been forced into hiding, graffiti of the tryzub signals the presence — and continued fight — of Ukrainian troops defending their homeland. The trident has been a symbol of power in numerous ancient cultures. In Ukraine, the symbol's history stretches back millennia. Archaeological evidence shows that the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture, which thrived in the 4th-3rd millennia BC in parts of modern-day western Ukraine, Moldova, and northeastern Romania, often used trident-like imagery on their pottery, which for them symbolized air, water, and earth. In the 10th century, seals bearing tridents were used by envoys of Prince Ihor in treaties with the Byzantine Empire. The coins of Prince Volodymyr the Great featured his portrait and a trident — his symbol of power. Over time, various princes of the Rurik dynasty modified the trident to reflect their own identities, resulting in over 200 known variations. Archaeologists have discovered these versions on coins, seals, jewelry, bricks, and murals dating from the 10th to 12th centuries. As Ukraine's medieval landscape changed, the trident fell out of official use. The new republic adopted the tryzub as a national symbol and printed it on its currency — "karbovanets" — in a design by Ukrainian artist Heorhii Narbut. Within two years, the Soviet Red Army occupied Ukraine, ushering in decades of repression. Under Soviet rule, Ukrainian national symbols were banned, patriotism was criminalized, cultural leaders were persecuted or executed, and millions perished during man-made famines in the 1920s–1930s — events collectively known as the Holodomor. Throughout this era, the tryzub was forbidden and labeled a nationalist threat. After Ukraine declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, the tryzub entered a new era of significance. Many theories have emerged, though none are officially confirmed. Some theories suggest it is a mystical sign of protection or a symbol of dominion over the three realms: heaven, earth, and the underworld. This imagery may stem from ancient Slavic pagan mythology, where the falcon represented a deity named Raroh. Falcons have remained a recurring motif in Ukrainian heraldry and folklore. The official color scheme — a golden trident on a blue field — aligns with Ukraine's national colors, which date back to the Kyivan Rus era. Natalia Yermak is a staff writer for the Kyiv Independent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Conflicts over Epstein, Iran airstrikes and immigration have engulfed the president's supporters but he still keeps his movement in check Since Mr Trump returned to the White House in January, his support base has been engulfed by rows on everything from Jeffrey Epstein to launching airstrikes on Iran. Last month, Nato chief Mark Rutte described Mr Trump as a “daddy” who “has to sometimes use strong language” to keep his team in check. Or maybe Mr Trump's instincts stem from his time as a real estate developer in New York City. Either way, Maga is woven together by a strange mix of personality and ideology, and many GOP strategists doubt it can survive when Mr Trump finally exits the political stage. Asked what held the movement together, Dave Carney, a veteran Republican operative who worked on George H W Bush and Bob Dole's presidential campaigns, said simply: “president Trump.” There were early signs of trouble when Mr Trump decided to accept a $400 million luxury jet gifted from Qatar to serve as Air Force One, something which united moderates and the Maga faithful in condemnation. Taking a plane from a country accused of sponsoring extremist groups that include Hamas and Hezbollah, and which Mr Trump had labelled “funders of terrorism” a few years ago, proved too much for some to swallow. But in May she called the jet a “stain” on the Trump administration, declaring: “We cannot accept a $400 million ‘gift' from jihadists in suits.” Conservative radio host Mark Levin agreed, while Ben Shapiro, the co-founder of the Daily Wire and a prominent Maga voice, accused Mr Trump of abandoning his “America First” movement. He held off on direct criticisms of allies and even seems to have launched a charm offensive, calling Ms Loomer shortly afterwards, who apologised for “jumping to conclusions”. Mr Trump knows how to pick his battles, and unite his restless base against a common enemy rather than letting them turn against themselves. Many prominent Maga voices, scarred by military quagmires in Iraq and Afghanistan, were sceptical when he launched air strikes on Iran's nuclear sites last month using “bunker-busting bombs”. And Steve Bannon, Mr Trump's former White House chief strategist, warned the strikes would not have been what “a lot of Maga wanted to hear”. Mr Trump held off and instead picked a fight with someone outside Maga – Thomas Massie, a Republican congressman who hails more from the party's libertarian tradition. In a 300-word diatribe on his Truth Social account, the president labelled the Kentucky congressman “not Maga” and a “simple-minded grandstander”, declaring he planned to campaign against him in next year's primaries. And the Right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, when Mr Trump suggested Iran should undergo regime change, insisted he was talking about a “bottom-up revolution” rather than decapitating its leadership. Attorney general Pam Bondi, meanwhile, claimed in February that his “client list” was on her desk, “ready to review”. But this month the FBI and justice department concluded, in a memo seen by Axios, there was no client list and Epstein – rather than being silenced by the “deep state” of shadowy figures controlling the government – killed himself in a Manhattan jail cell. “Pam Bondi fed a monster,” said Matthew Bartlett, a Republican operative who worked for the first Trump administration in the State Department. “And now there's a chance that the monster eats her.” On immigration, the administration has been dragged in opposite directions by the demands of hawkish Maga voices while Big Tech and farmers worry about their workforce. It burst to the fore in December in a row between Mr Bannon and Elon Musk, then a chief ally of Mr Trump's, over H1-B visas for highly-skilled immigrants. There was so much bad blood between the two men that Mr Bannon threatened to “rip his f—ing face off”. Mr Trump sided with Mr Musk at the time but has also embarked on a mass deportation drive while aggressively stamping out illegal immigration. Another factor in Mr Trump's favour is that the Democrats, having lost the White House, Senate, and House of Representatives in November, are in such disarray they aren't threatening to erode his base of support. The president “is one lucky motherf----r”, said Mr Carney. Mr Bannon claims there are three pillars of Maga: restricting free trade, limiting immigration and ending the “forever wars”. Danielle Vinson, a professor of politics at Furman University in South Carolina, said the movement was not “ideologically consistent” or “monolithic” on issues. “Not everyone in Maga cares about all these issues equally.</p>
