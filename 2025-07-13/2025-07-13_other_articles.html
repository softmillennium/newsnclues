                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But transporting enough industrial material to create livable spaces would be incredibly challenging and expensive. Researchers at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) think there's a better way, through biology. The experiments are a first step toward designing sustainable habitats in space that won't require bringing materials from Earth. ‚ÄúIf you have a habitat that is composed of bioplastic, and it grows algae within it, that algae could produce more bioplastic,‚Äù explained Wordsworth. ‚ÄúSo you start to have a closed-loop system that can sustain itself and even grow through time.‚Äù The algae was kept under a Mars-like 600 Pascals of atmospheric pressure ‚Äì over 100 times lower than Earth's ‚Äî and in a carbon dioxide-rich environment, as opposed to mostly nitrogen and oxygen like on Earth. The concept the researchers demonstrated is closer to how organisms grow naturally on Earth, and it contrasts with an industrial approach using materials that are costly to manufacture and recycle. Wordsworth's team previously demonstrated a type of local Martian terraforming using sheets of silica aerogels that mimic the Earth's greenhouse warming effect to allow for biological growth. Next, Wordsworth said the researchers want to demonstrate that their habitats also work in vacuum conditions, which would be relevant for lunar or deep-space applications. His team also has plans to design a working closed-loop system for habitat production. ‚ÄúThe concept of biomaterial habitats is fundamentally interesting and can support humans living in space,‚Äù Wordsworth said.

      Time: July 12, 2025 at 5:41 PM
    


      Location: Springfield, Missouri, USA
    


      While running in the park yesterday, I observed 12  black objects on the horizon moving horizontally at a consistent speed, similar to drones. As they passed overhead, they abruptly stopped and ascended vertically into the clouds, one by one, with no apparent pattern. There were no lights or sounds, and I couldn't identify them, even when zooming in with my camera. I'm sharing this to seek feedback and insights on what I may have seen. One or two drones isn't anything weird, but twelve‚Ä¶seems excessive. What would someone achieve with twelve that it can't with one? Why collect weather reports using this method? It all strikes me as odd.

Signing up is free, and your data will never be shared. In humanity's eternal quest to find life beyond Earth, we may finally have a telescope that can spot not just planets‚Äîbut oceans. It shapes our landscapes, carves canyons, forms clouds, and pulses through every living cell. But while we've found thousands of exoplanets orbiting distant stars‚Äîsome even within the so-called ‚ÄúGoldilocks zone‚Äù where temperatures might allow for liquid water‚Äîone critical detail has eluded us: proof. NASA's proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) may soon be able to answer that question. But liquids, with their smooth, mirror-like texture, reflect light in a way called specular reflection. On Earth, this is why a body of water can look dark and flat from one angle, but shimmer like a mirror from another. When the Sun hits it just right, that glint is unmistakable. ‚ÄúSuch planets are the ideal places for life-as-we-know-it to arise and evolve.‚Äù ‚ÄúEarth's Core Is Acting Up‚Äù: NASA Links Planet-Wide Disturbance to Mysterious Energy Surge Emerging From Deep Within the Mantle The beauty of the method lies in time‚Äîspecifically, how a planet's brightness changes over time as it spins and moves through different phases of illumination. On a rotating planet like Earth, different features come into view with each turn. That glint, carefully teased from the surrounding noise, could reveal a surface ocean. At crescent phases, when a planet is backlit by its star, water-rich surfaces tend to polarize light in unique, detectable ways. In other words, oceans don't just shine‚Äîthey whisper their presence through the alignment of light waves. Detecting it requires not just powerful optics, but stability and patience. The HWO will need to record high-precision, time-resolved measurements over long periods. ‚ÄúSpace Needs Nuclear Now‚Äù: This New Global Race to Harness Atomic Power Beyond Earth Is Accelerating Faster Than Expected Earth has taught us much, but it's also revealed the complications. Our own atmosphere is often cloaked in cloud cover‚Äîso thick, in fact, that any attempt to map our oceans from a light-year away would be muddled by ever-changing clouds. The HWO's team knows this and is building models to work around it. Cloud-free regions can still reveal surface features, and by observing over time, the telescope may be able to average out the impact of variable weather systems. That kind of stability is achievable, but photometric precision‚Äîmeasuring tiny changes in brightness‚Äîremains the telescope's biggest challenge. Four or more separate measurements per planetary rotation will likely be needed. ‚ÄúNASA Sounds the Alarm‚Äù: Sudden Planet-Wide Disturbance Linked to Mysterious Subterranean Energy Surge Now Spreading Without Warning Many potentially habitable exoplanets orbit red dwarf stars, and many of those planets are tidally locked‚Äîmeaning one side always faces the star in unending daylight, while the other remains in perpetual night. If the planet has a thick atmosphere or large oceans, heat could circulate efficiently. For tidally locked worlds, specular reflection might actually be easier to detect. Over time, this stability could help astronomers isolate the signal from noise. A mirror that never turns still shines, if you know when to look. It would prove that conditions for life exist beyond Earth in a tangible, observable way. NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory is still in the proposal stage. Could this discovery change our understanding of life in the universe? News, investigations, and analysis ‚Äî our top stories every morning to start your day right. Gabriel Cruz has been a journalist at Sustainability-Times.com for five years. Wow, this is like something out of a sci-fi movie! Is the HWO already funded, or are we still waiting on that?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The story of a group of children who are kidnapped by a mysterious organization for seemingly malevolent purposes, King's novel is a hybrid of his own Firestarter and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Yet like its source, it's a saga that's short on real sparks, treading such well-worn supernatural territory that even the best efforts of stars Ben Barnes and Mary Louise Parker aren't enough to make it more than a passable entry in the ever-burgeoning King-to-screen catalogue. That's not to be, since one evening Jake is snatched from his bed, and when he awakens, he's in a facsimile of his room that exists in a cold gray building. Emerging into a hallway that's covered in strange elementary school-style posters, Jake meets Kalisha (Simone Miller), who explains that he's now a resident of The Institute, whose pre-adult residents are all either TK (telekinetic) or TP (telepathic). Given that objects have a funny habit of moving around Jake when he's upset, this isn't altogether stunning news to the kid, and he's soon welcomed into a group that includes trusting George (Arien So), nervous Iris (Birva Pandya), and rebellious Nicky (Fionn Laird). As Jake learns, the Institute is run by cunning head honcho Ms. Sigsby (Parker), her ruthless chief of security Stackhouse (Julian Richings), and rational Dr. Hendricks (Robert Joy), who with the assistance of sadistic orderly Tony (Jason Diaz) conducts tests on the kids that are designed to instigate and enhance their extraordinary powers‚Äîand, in the best case scenario, reveal them to be PCs (precogs) who can see the future. From the outset, he's skeptical about everything sold by Ms. Sigsby, whom Parker embodies with a superficial positivity that reeks of deception, not to mention derangement‚Äîthe latter of which is underscored by an early scene in which, upon returning home from work, she soothes herself by burning her leg with a red-hot wire hanger. Strange, sinister things are afoot at the Institute, and Cavell's series doles out hints about the organization's true motives at an enticing pace. Those revelations are at once horrible and complex, as well as thematically related to the recent ordeal plaguing former cop Tim Jamieson (Barnes). Arriving in small-town Maine with few belongings and no overt purpose, Tim successfully gets a job as the police department's ‚Äúnight knocker,‚Äù whose job it is to nocturnally patrol the enclave's streets. During the course of his duties, he meets officer Wendy (Hannah Galway), to whom he slowly grows closer, and local homeless crank Annie (Mary Walsh), whose intriguing conspiracy theories involve the Institute and psychic phenomena. Tim and Jake's paths are destined to cross, but The Institute is most captivating when focusing on the latter's plight, which involves bizarre experiments known as ‚ÄúShots for Dots‚Äù that make subjects disturbingly sick and weak. Instead of just a one-note boogeyman nightmare, the show complicates matters by giving its villains a potentially altruistic reason for their monstrousness. While the moral questions raised by their conduct (and motivations) are ultimately discarded in a way that suggests no one involved really cared about them, they nonetheless add a tantalizing layer to the otherwise straightforward material. Freeman is competent, if lacking the charisma required to elicit real engagement with his suffering. The same goes for Viggo Hanvelt as Avery, the newest and youngest Institute victim, whose abilities are so great that they afford Luke and company a chance to break out of the Institute. Their functional turns are a burden the series can't totally overcome, and the visually unimaginative direction by Jack Bender, Brad Turner, and Jeff Renfroe doesn't do them any favor‚Äîand, at times, seems to actively work against them. As with the Lumineers' morose credit-sequence cover of Tears for Fears' ‚ÄúShout,‚Äù the flat action is gloomy to a fault. Stackhouse and Tony are psychos that we've seen before, Tim is the sort of good-hearted hero that King has favored since Salem's Lot, and the plot weaves together its strands in a fashion that will be intensely familiar to the writer's constant readers. This isn't to knock those conventions (which remain sturdy and entertaining) so much as to wish that the narrative at hand were more animated and surprising. It's also, by design, an efficiently structured and thankfully self-contained affair, all the way to a finale that leaves little wiggle room for any (unnecessary) follow-up. It may be a middle-of-the-road tale from the Master of Horror, but that's still better than most.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The spirit of the Old Wild West will never die as long as there are towns like Pioche in Nevada, I can tell you! This is a little part of Americana that outdid even the likes of the iconic Tombstone in building up a reputation for lawlessness and gunslingers. We made our way there after spending a night in Vegas, heading off along the Great Basin Highway for a 585-mile trip that would take four days. Setting off, our elderly driver, Earl, advised: ‚ÄúBuckle up, you are in for some ride,‚Äù and he wasn't wrong as we set off across the Mojave Desert. This once prosperous and thriving silver mining town gained its deadly reputation when the word spread in the 1800s that none of the first 72 people to die there passed away from natural causes. A visit to this town with its nice friendly community makes it hard to believe that it was once one of the roughest and toughest mining towns in the Old West - attracting thousands of fortune seekers who believed they would hit a rich vein of silver. This ghost town in Lincoln County - and believe me there are ghosts aplenty here attracting supernatural hunters from all over the world -  was one of the highlights of our road trip along the Great Basin Highway. Having been a fan of the great Western movies since my younger days, I was drawn to exploring the little town. And there I found the Overland Hotel and Saloon, which on the Travel Channel's Ghost Adventures was deemed to have provided some of the most successful interactions with spirits. So pro tip, if you want to stay there but don't want any interactions with the spirits, avoid room 10, where others have reported doors mysteriously slamming and being awakened from a deep sleep by something supernatural. As a reporter who covers courts, I was fascinated by the Million Dollar Courthouse where many of those caught ended up. Boothill Cemetery also exists to this day with some fascinating headstones - including one stating that the occupant of the grave was shot in an argument over a dog. If it's phenomena of a different kind you want, we swapped ghosts for aliens. The mysterious Area 51 is synonymous with tales of UFO's, and vehicles stopping for no reason on the Extraterrestrial Highway. We even stopped under the sign to see if our presence could attract even the smallest of spaceships, but alas it was not to be. It gets its name from the way the sandstone formations combine to give an image of a valley on fire. When you stand and gaze at so many different shapes and sizes of rock formations and realise you are looking at 150 million years in time with the maze of canyons, domes, ridges and towers carved from sand deposited back when dinosaurs walked the earth, it is truly awesome. As we joined the queue to gain entry I was very taken with the sign which said ‚ÄúHeat warning. And seeing as it was late May, we were very lucky that the heat was not overwhelming, meaning we could spending hours there. This is thanks to spectacular slot canyons, spires, and other erosional features. It is truly nature's beauty in its very rawest form. An interesting fact about the Joshua trees, apart from the U2 connection, was that Mormon preachers used them as a navigational aid to find their way back home. GET THERE: I flew with Aer Lingus to Las Vegas, who operate a seasonal service three times weekly from October to May with prices starting at ‚Ç¨450 return STAY THERE: Stay in Prospector Hotel and Gambling Hall in Ely, a really unique and very Wild West hotel for ‚Ç¨112 for two sharing a room. But the Historic Silver Cafe in Pioche provided good food and great service. Then we went to the Great Basin National Park which stretches from California's Sierra Nevada to Utah's Wasatch Mountains. They say ‚Äúhalf the park is after dark‚Äù, the reason being that this is designated an International Dark Sky Park by DarkSky, and has its own amphitheatre for looking at the most amazing star-filled skies. I was just blown away by the sight of so many stars against the very black backdrop and could never have imagined the sheer beauty and magnificence I was viewing. The ancient Bristlecone pine groves throughout are believed to be almost 5,000 years old. And you just can't leave the park without a visit to the Lehman Caves, with marble roofs and limestone formations. This is Nevada's largest cave system, but remember you must book in advance as visits require guides. There was so much crammed into our trip, like the scenic drive up Wheeler Peak, or popping into towns like Ely, home to railroad museums and beautiful murals.
