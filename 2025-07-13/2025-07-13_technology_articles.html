Japan's Mizuki Co. is now crowdfunding a monitor to match its attractive X68000 Z Super and X68000 Z XVI miniature retro reprint PCs. What can a company do to create an era appropriate (late 90s) CRT-like monitor in 2025? Mizuki has decided to crowdfund the manufacture of a “4:3 LCD curved acrylic structure reproduces the atmosphere of a classic CRT” (machine translation). CRT enthusiasts may feel disappointed by this seemingly low-spec LCD-based offering. These lovingly recreated systems with matching keyboards and mice are now also being distributed worldwide via Indiegogo. However, that didn't properly match the scale of the new retro mini X68000 Z Super and X68000 Z XVI systems, so it was prompted to design and deliver this 8-inch model. For appropriate physical scaling, the new monitor packs an 8-inch display in its appealing black chassis, positionable upon a rotating pedestal stand. Weighing in at 1.5kg, the monitor is powered by USB Type-C delivered 5V/3A, and will connect up with your mini PC via HDMI. Something questionable that caught our eye was that Mizuki intends to use a “curved acrylic structure [which] reproduces the atmosphere of a classic CRT.” That doesn't sound like the nicest idea for a usable display. It raises the question of whether there will be a bulbous acrylic sheet in front of the LCD, or both acrylic and LCD will be somehow curved like a modern curved monitor. CRTs have become highly sought after by members of the retro community, and others, for several great inherent qualities. First and foremost, the use of CRTs would be authentic in this case. Typically, CRTs come with exceedingly low input lag, and don't have motion-blur issues. Users may also prefer seeing genuine CRT features like scanlines, phosphor glow, and CRT dithering - to provide a well-rounded retro experience. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Some CRT-like effects can be emulated or replicated on LCDs. However, we see that for utmost authenticity, very high spec PC displays are required for tools like Blur Busters' authentic CRT simulator shader to work as intended – with a 240 Hz+ OLED recommended for the best experience. You are probably paying largely for the 'look and feel' rather than performance or quality in monitor terms. This monitor began its crowdfunding journey in Japan on Friday, and the project will continue for another 18 days on the Kibidango platform (linked top). That means we might see it come west (or rather, worldwide) via Indiegogo, in due course. Mark Tyson is a news editor at Tom's Hardware.

Intel this month officially began to cut down its workforce in the U.S. and other countries, thus revealing actual numbers of positions to be cut. The Oregonian reports that the company will cut as many as 2,392 positions in Oregon and around 4,000 positions across its American operations, including Arizona, California, and Texas. Intel began reducing staff earlier in the week but confirmed the larger number by Friday evening through a filing with Oregon state authorities. Intel's Oregon operations have already seen 3,000 jobs lost over the past year through earlier buyouts and dismissals. This time around, Intel does not offer voluntarily retirement or buyouts, it indeed lays off personnel in Aloha (192) and Hillsboro (2,200). Although Intel officially says that it is trying to get rid of mid-level managers to flatten the organization and focus on engineers, the list of positions that Intel is cutting is led by module equipment technicians (325), module development engineers (302), module engineers (126), and process integration development engineers (88). In fact, based on the Oregon WARN filing, a total of 190 employees with 'Manager' in their job titles (8% of personnel being laid off) were included among those laid off by Intel. These comprised various software, hardware, and operational management roles across the affected sites. Earlier this month, it was reported that Intel began to cut-down its workforce in Israel. Those affected included mid-level managers (e.g., team leaders), first-line supervisors, and technicians from the Remote Operations Center (ROC). According to a media report, the supervisors oversee shift operations and sit one or two tiers above production workers, so their roles are phased out as part of the company's intention to flatten the organization. Their roles are being automated as part of a global move to cut manual oversight in chip production. This decentralized process has led to ongoing job losses across the company, with marketing functions being outsourced to Accenture and the automotive division completely shut down.

Nvidia announced Smooth Motion back in January, as part of its initial RTX 50-series launch. Much like AMD's Fluid Motion Frames, Nvidia's Smooth Motion claims to double your frame rate by putting one AI-generated frame in between two real ones. This is a driver-level solution so it works in any game, regardless of it being supported or not in any particular software. However, Smooth Motion was limited to 50-series cards, a space where it's likely not needed as much. Thankfully, a new driver update has just revealed that it is making its way down to the RTX 40 GPUs, at last. The GeForce 590.26 Preview Driver finally allows users to enable Smooth Motion on their RTX 40-series GPU. As the name suggests, this "preview" is not a stable, public release, but rather a sort of beta intended for developers or enthusiasts to test out the upcoming driver ahead of time. As such, Macer installed it on their computer running an RTX 4090, and through Nvidia Profile Inspector, were able to toggle Smooth Motion. Please note that it didn't appear in the Nvidia app UI directly. WoW doesn't natively support DLSS, so this was a long-overdue update, and others have reported similar gains across a multitude of different games as well. Once installed, you'll need Nvidia Profile Inspector from GitHub which is fairly easy to install and use as well. We didn't get a chance to try it out on our systems, but it's safe to assume that this solution won't be as good as native DLSS. It also won't actually upscale the game's resolution (from a lower internal one). Now, your old games where upscaling tech was never realistically going to reach, can finally enjoy increased frame rates, sometimes with barely any noticeable dip in quality, and without investing in third-party software, such as Lossless Scaling, since your GPU now possesses driver-level chops to achieve the same goal.

There is a wide belief that artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to greatly increase productivity, which may also lead to widespread job displacement. This could happen sooner rather than later, if humanity loses its ability to innovate, indicated Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, in an interview with CNN. "If the world runs out of ideas, then productivity gains translates to job loss," said Jensen Huang in an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria. Huang had been asked about comments made by Dario Amodei, who suggested AI would cause mass employment disruptions. Last month, Amodei told Axios that the rise of artificial intelligence might wipe out half of all entry-level office positions and push national unemployment as high as 20% within five years. A century ago, there were complaints about cars based on the internal combustion engine (ICE) leaving those involved in servicing horses unemployed. Years later, the horse guys were servicing ICE cars and earning much more. A 2024 study from Adecco Group found that 41% of corporate leaders expect AI to reduce staffing at thousands of firms over the next half-decade. Surveys also show a shift in how work is performed. A 2024 joint survey by Duke University and Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta and Richmond found that over half of large American firms intend to use AI to take over routine tasks like invoice processing and supplier payments. Huang said all occupations will feel the effects of AI in some form. While certain roles will disappear, he expects many others to be introduced, so the fears about dramatically high unemployment rates are unsubstantiated for now. The head of Nvidia noted that even his own role has evolved due to AI, though he remains active in it. He called AI the most accessible technology advancement yet, capable of helping even those with limited technical skills. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. He argued that with the right ideas, technology can unlock entirely new areas of growth and benefit society as a whole. The CEO of Nvidia expressed hope that increased efficiency across industries will ultimately improve living standards, but he cautioned that this outcome is not guaranteed unless innovation continues. Nvidia, which briefly reached a $4 trillion market capitalization earlier this month, plays a central role in the ongoing AI boom as its data center GPUs are used for both AI training and inference by companies like Amazon Web Services, Google, and Microsoft.

It's one of the top duels this year. Alcaraz defeated Fritz, while Sinner convincingly eliminated Djokovic in the semi-finals. Sinner and Alcaraz, two of the world's top players, are meeting once again to gauge their strengths. If you don't want to miss this heart-pounding clash, here's how to stream the 2025 Wimbledon men's final on a free channel. You go to BBC iPlayer (link: https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer), sign up (it's 100% free) or sign in, and enjoy the match when it starts. Moreover, it's in English and offers Full HD coverage of all Wimbledon matches. Some people also use 9Now (link: https://www.9now.com.au/live/), an Australian platform. It requires an account, which costs nothing to make. This account lets you stream Sinner vs Alcaraz live for free. If you're abroad, there's a reliable solution to unblock them and watch the match. Many internet users believe VPNs are ideal options for unblocking BBC iPlayer and 9Now abroad. They often mention NordVPN, which is like Apple in the VPN world—the most popular and beloved option. It also has unlimited bandwidth and some of the best streaming speeds. However, its primary purpose is to change the user's online location. Geo-restricted channels detect the user's IP and block or permit their access. Many would argue that NordVPN is a paid service, and they'd be right. However, people often use its 30-day money-back guarantee to get a refund. This means they can watch Sinner vs Alcaraz on a free channel of their choice, and when the match ends, get a full refund the same day. However, some people stick with the VPN and use it for cheaper online sports streams. This means you can be in Asia or Africa and still use a VPN to watch Sinner vs Alcaraz on a free channel. Many other channels and platforms broadcast this match if you don't want to bother with a VPN. These three are exclusive to the USA, with hefty price tags and no refund policies. People abroad can use a VPN to watch Hulu, Sling TV, or fuboTV, albeit not sign up, as all three require US-based credit cards. Canadians can't watch Sinner vs Alcaraz live for free, but they can use TSN Plus if they don't mind subscribing. More importantly, TSN Plus is Canada-exclusive, so users abroad are unwelcome, unless they use a VPN. According to the H2H results, Carlos Alcaraz is a favorite. Interestingly, Alcaraz has beaten Sinner five times in a row, from 2024 to 2025. As you know, H2H statistics rarely give us the whole picture. We're discussing two magnificent, young talents likely at their apex. Regardless of your favorite, we know this Wimbledon final will be worth watching.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Artificial intelligence promises a future of unprecedented productivity and wealth, but for Senator Bernie Sanders, the crucial question isn't if the technology will change the world, but who will benefit from that change. As a lifelong champion for workers' rights, Sanders sees the rapid advancement of AI not just as a technological revolution, but as the next major battleground in the fight against corporate greed and inequality. In a conversation with Gizmodo, the Vermont senator, who revealed he had just spoken with one of the world's leading AI experts, laid out his fears that the technology will be used to suppress wages, break unions, and further enrich the billionaire class. He also shared his concerns about AI's impact on our collective mental health and discussed the “doomsday scenario” that has some top minds in the industry worried that humanity could lose control of its own creation. Gizmodo: Senator, you've long fought for worker dignity. In an economy increasingly shaped by AI, what do you believe should be the new definition of meaningful work? Sen. Sanders: Well, that is a very good question, and I don't know that I can give you an intelligent answer to it right now, but this is what I will say. What I think is being lost in the discussion over AI is what we have seen over the last 50 years: a huge increase in worker productivity. In fact, workers today, in real inflation-accounted-for wages, are earning less, and I fear very much that almost all the new benefits of worker productivity will go to the people on top at the expense of working people. So, the first point to be made: Technology and AI is neither good nor bad. That to me is the most important issue. I want workers to benefit from this new technology, not just the people on top. And AI is going to change all that, and we want to make sure that this creates a better, wealthier future for ordinary people, not just the people on top. Gizmodo: In terms of protection, what protections are needed for American workers to avoid being left behind in this transition? Sen. Sanders: I think we have got to make it clear in some formulation or another, and some of the unions are beginning to negotiate for this. That if worker productivity, if you, the job you are doing right now becomes more productive with AI, I want the benefits to accrue to you. It could mean a shorter work week, a 32-hour work week, which is what we're fighting for, with no loss of pay. Again, the main point is workers have got to benefit from increased productivity, not just CEOs. Right now, that is not the case, so that is what we have got to change. Gizmodo: If a CEO says, “I've automated these tasks and I need fewer workers,” what should the response be? Look, we have got to see that this technology benefits workers rather than just CEOs. So if a company develops AI that allows workers to be more productive, what we would like to see is a shorter work week with no loss in pay. The other things that I worry about, which goes beyond economics and the potential of massive job loss, are two very important issues: mental health and the well-being of human beings. Gizmodo: What do you mean by that, Senator? If you spend your entire day interacting with a chatbot rather than talking to friends or family, what happens to you? We know that in America right now, a lot of young people are having a hard time interacting with other human beings because they spend so much time on the internet. And there are people out there, literally, people in the technology world, who are saying, “Look, if you can't make any friends, if you're very lonely, go to a chatbot and you can develop a friend right there.” I'm not sure that this is good for human beings. Gizmodo: There's a sense that people are lost, that AI is erasing our identity, our role in society… In this context, the system is working well. Unfortunately, human beings are going to get lost in that development. That has got to be the driving force. Gizmodo: Have you spoken to tech CEOs or experts about this? I won't mention his name, but I've just gotten off the phone with one of the leading experts in the world on artificial intelligence, two hours ago. Somebody I talked to yesterday, not so much. Number one: What impact will AI have on the economy? Some people say there will be massive job losses. Other people say not so much, new jobs will be created. It will be like every other technological revolution. I happen to believe this is not like the Industrial Revolution. I think this could be a lot more severe. Second point: This is not science fiction. There are very, very knowledgeable people—and I just talked to one today—who worry very much that human beings will not be able to control the technology, and that artificial intelligence will in fact dominate our society. We will not be able to control it. It may be able to control us. That's kind of the doomsday scenario—and there is some concern about that among very knowledgeable people in the industry. We're seeing, all over the world, democracy itself being threatened. So I think this is not a great moment for humanity. I would hope, however—there are ups and downs—that we can turn this around. And among many other things, use the benefits of artificial intelligence and robotics to improve human life. To make sure we can wipe out poverty. But ordinary people must control the future. Gizmodo: One final question: Do you believe AI could in any fashion be used to strengthen unions and worker rights, or is it inherently a threat to organized labor? Sen. Sanders: I think at this moment it is more of a threat. In other words, what employers will say is: “Look, I want you to take a cut in pay. Or I want you to pay more for healthcare. We've got robots that can replace you. We've got artificial intelligence that can replace you. Take a cut or we replace you as human workers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That ignominy goes to Audi, with an embarrassing 269 problems reported per 100 vehicles. Power Initial Quality Study (labelled as a “key finding”, no less) concerned not annoyance with the lack of physical buttons, nor, amazingly, intrusive bongs from speed-warning systems, but a marked increase in “cup-holder frustration”. “While it seemed like manufacturers had cup holders figured out … manufacturers are struggling to keep up with being able to accommodate all the different shapes and sizes [of containers] that are increasingly available,” says the report. So it seems that despite the auto industry's obsession with software-defined vehicles, many purchasers would forego any number of digital doohickeys, so long as there was enough room in their new cars for multiple Big Gulps. Paying through the nose for a fancy new car stuffed with tech—ADAS, ambient lighting, back-groping seats, dog modes—doesn't stop auto buyers from complaining about insufficiently expandable beverage bays. The cylindrical voids of space—or, in some cars, flip-out trays, door spaces, fancy holsters, or hinged pockets—are still too small, gripe many of those surveyed. Most likely gargantuan Stanley cups, giant Yeti Gallon Ramblers and similar such bladder-busters, the spilt contents of which could drench a desert into bloom. Even though center console real estate in today's cars is at a premium—especially now that ever-bigger touchscreens have become seemingly essential in every self-respecting digital cockpit—America's (and increasingly the Middle East and Australia's) big-drink culture dictates that automakers not scrimp on cup storage. That it remains just as vital today must rankle with auto software engineers, but it doesn't surprise Chris Fischer, Nissan's go-to engineer for cup holders. “That cup holders work well is important to customer satisfaction,” Fischer tells WIRED. Working from Nissan's North American technical center in Farmington Hills, Michigan, Fischer is the company's senior manager of vehicle performance development, and, along with a team of “cabin utility” engineers, he has toiled to improve in-car beverage storage since 2015, when poor cup holder performance adversely impacted Nissan's J.D. “If they're mad about a touchpoint every day, it'll sour their desire to want this vehicle again.” “Touchpoints are critically important,” agrees Dick Powell, cofounder of London-headquartered design and innovation company Seymourpowell. Seymourpowell, founded in 1984, has worked on car interior designs, including cup holders, with several automakers over the years, and Powell confirms to WIRED that auto buyers often base their final purchase decisions on “little things” rather than the specification sheets that auto makers might think customers obsess over. “It's not top speed, power, four-wheel drive capabilities, or any of these things, it's the little touchpoints that really knock you out,” says Powell. Fischer stresses that Nissan's cabin design team sweat every detail, from seat comfort to storage, ensuring each in-car interaction feels just right. “We start super early in the car's design process when everything is still a sketch,” says Fischer. “We work hard to fit large Hydro Flask-size bottles in the doors, making sure even the largest bottles fit with ease,” says Fischer. But how does an espresso cup stay securely grasped in the same holder as a grande? Fischer says this is achieved with spring-loaded plastic tabs that adjust to varying diameters. Fischer pays keen attention to the monthly info drop from J.D. If space were no issue, we'd add another couple in the center console.” The company's Ascent SUV features a market-leading 19 cup and bottle holders (that's nearly three for every human it can carry)—several of which are cleverly concealed—and, if Facebook love is anything to go by, such liquid storage largesse is what attracts many consumers to this particular model. However, the first cup-holder patent was granted to a Texas inventor 30 or so years prior, in 1953. Burnard W. Byford's “automobile seat article holder” design had been filed four years earlier, in 1949. It consisted of a hinged tray that could be folded down from the rear seat of a car, intended for use at rest by passengers rather than the driver. “I am aware,” he continued, “that curb-service attendants supply detachable door trays for use at roadside restaurants.” (Indeed, in 1934, he had patented such an external tray.) Undaunted, he predicted, “there is a definite need for a suitable holder such as may be laid or placed upon the seat adjacent to the user.” The year before Byford filed his patent, Citroën introduced the 2CV, which, despite its diminutive Gallic footprint, had a door pocket designed wide enough to swallow a wine bottle. Of course, whether shallow or deep, not everyone puts cups in their cup holders. Some fill them instead with coins, phones, keys and other odds and ends; when not spreading stickiness from juice boxes, children often place toys in theirs; Tishoo makes a cylindrical box of tissues entirely designed for cup-holder deployment; and Keep Technologies sells a cup-shaped cellular-connected alarm-and-camera gizmo that supposedly turns a center console cup holder into a sensor-laden “security guard” complete with siren and flashing lights. However, as the average American spends about 50 minutes commuting by car each day, there's time for drinks to lose or gain heat, automakers started fitting warming and chilling cup holders. “You'd be amazed how much technology goes into producing today's car seats, center consoles and, yes, even cup holders,” says Paris-based Edouard Da Silva, vice president of the cockpit of the future division at auto interiors maker Forvia, which supplies cabin essentials—from massaging chairs through to heat-controlling cup holders—to many of the world's leading car makers, including the increasingly dominating Chinese brands. Open cups and cans, whose liquids slosh from side to side in moving vehicles, easily shed their contents; hence, the in-car need for plastic lids on takeaway cups and straws on vacuum tumblers. A no-spill solution was invented 11 years ago by Maksim Ghyvoronsky of Seattle. His Maksimatic cup holder of 2014 featured a self-leveling design that prevented drinks from spilling. Yet despite the apparent need for such a clever design, Ghyvoronsky failed to raise enough crowdfunding for his product at the time, and 10 years later, he came up short again. Not even Matikon of Germany, a leading car interiors manufacturer, which makes for Audi through to Xpeng, but which declined to comment for this article. Ghyvoronsky's tilting cup holder would have allowed the open carry of liquids in cars—or even on motorbikes, and for which there are a variety of gyroscopic holders on Walmart, Amazon and Temu—but perhaps his design failed because some people still prefer to suck from a teat? “What was the key element of safety when you were a child? That's apparent not real safety, says Steven Kyffin, a former dean of design and pro vice-chancellor at Northumbria University in the UK. “Should we really be designing cars to facilitate food and drink while driving?” he asks. Instead, he advises WIRED, “automotive interiors should encourage attentiveness, not multitasking.” They transform cars “from tools of transport into comfortable, private zones, which enable seamless changes in context and role.” And those who design cup holders “must factor in not merely the practical ergonomics of driving but also all the physical, emotional, and psychological aspects of such a change in role, particularly reach-and-glance time.” The design and placement of automotive cup holders could be set to change soon, with auto suppliers such as Forvia and others working on commercializing what were previously concept car cabins. Still, at least Lexus has solved the Stanley cup in-car quandary once and for all.
