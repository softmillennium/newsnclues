                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner delivered another Grand Slam classic on Sunday, but this time, the outcome flipped. 1, fought back after losing the first set to beat the defending champion 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 and claim his maiden Wimbledon title. Meanwhile, Alcaraz saw his 24-match win streak and perfect 5-0 Grand Slam final record come to an end. Despite the loss, Alcaraz remained composed and optimistic. When asked during ESPN's post-match interview if he saw himself returning to Wimbledon to fight for another title, his answer was clear and confident: “Absolutely.” “First of all, I just have to congratulate Jannik once again,” he said. Unbelievable two weeks here in London for you.” He acknowledged the strength of their rivalry and how it pushes him. “We have a great rivalry on the court that made me improve every day. And as he walked off the grass, fans knew Sunday wasn't a farewell, just a pause in what's shaping up to be an epic rivalry.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many people expected we'd get a second straight Grand Slam final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, and that's exactly what we got at Wimbledon. This time, it was Sinner who came out on top to capture his first career Wimbledon title. It's hard to imagine someone besides Sinner or Alcaraz winning the U.S. Open, and the odds reflect exactly that. The two have already faced each other in back-to-back Grand Slam finals, and it's certainly likely we'll see a trilogy match at the U.S. Open. Behind the top two names is Novak Djokovic at +700, who is in a tier of his own behind Sinner and Alcaraz but well ahead of everyone else in the field. Djokovic has won the U.S. Open four times in his career, including in 2023, which is his most recent grand slam victory. He's in the final stretch of his career at 38 years old, but he's hoping for at least one more major victory. The U.S. Open is set to begin on August 24.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LONDON (AP) — Italy's Jannik Sinner defeated two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 on Sunday (july 13) to win his first Wimbledon championship and reverse the result of their epic French Open final five weeks ago. 1-ranked Sinner earned his fourth Grand Slam title overall, moving him one away from No. “We have an amazing relationship off the court, and on the court we push each other to play our best.” The victory allowed Sinner, 23, to end several streaks for Alcaraz, a 22-year-old Spaniard. Alcaraz had won the past five head-to-head matches between the pair, most recently across five sets and nearly 5 1/2 hours at Roland-Garros on June 8. Sinner took a two-set lead in that one, then held a trio of match points, but couldn't close the deal. “I had a very tough loss in Paris,” Sinner admitted. In addition to ending that piece of perfection, Sinner asserted himself in a match that featured moments of terrific play by both men, but also the occasional lapses. He had won 20 matches in a row at the All England Club, including victories against Novak Djokovic in the 2023 and 2024 finals. The last man to beat Alcaraz at Wimbledon? So this served as a bookend win for Sinner, who proved what he kept telling anyone who asked: No, there would be no carryover from his heartbreak in Paris. Hard to imagine, though, that that collapse wasn't on his mind at least a little on Sunday, especially when he faced two break points while serving at 4-3, 15-40 in the fourth set. But he calmly took the next four points to hold there, and soon was serving out the win. When it ended, Sinner put both hands on his white hat. After embracing Alcaraz at the net, Sinner crouched on court with his head bowed, then pounded his right palm on the grass. Yes, Sinner put the French Open behind him in the best way possible and demonstrated that his matchups with Alcaraz could delight tennis fans for years to come. It hadn't happened for more than a half-century before that trilogy. Sinner has participated in each of the last four major finals, a stretch that began with a triumph at the U.S. Open last September and was followed by another at the Australian Open this January. Wearing the same tape job and white arm sleeve to protect his right elbow that he has been using since falling in the opening game of his fourth-round win on Monday, Sinner never showed any issues, just as he had not while eliminating 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic in the semifinals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner ends the hopes of Carlos Alcaraz from winning a third straight Wimbledon title with four-set win; The US Open is live on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, streaming service NOW and the Sky Sports app from August 24 World No 1 Jannik Sinner dethroned two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz to seal his maiden Wimbledon title with a stylish four-set win. Sinner ended a five-match losing streak to Alcaraz, winning 4-6 6-4 6-4 6-4, just 35 days after losing an epic French Open title to the Spaniard. Sinner, who was on the brink of defeat against Grigor Dimitrov in the fourth round until his pectoral muscle injury changed the course of tennis history, celebrated by thrusting both arms aloft, puts their rivalry back on a knife edge, with the 23-year-old now trailing Alcaraz only by five Grand Slam titles to four and putting an end to a five-match losing streak against the Spaniard. It is also Sinner's first major title away from his favoured hard courts, while Alcaraz suffered a first major final defeat, unable to find the same magic that had brought him back from the brink on the clay. Soon that was four, with Alcaraz winning surely one of the best set-winning rallies seen on Centre Court: Sinner's 118mph second serve was returned with interest, Alcaraz angled a forehand out wide, his rival thumped a forehand into the corner only for the Spaniard to somehow conjure a backhand winner. He stood with his finger pointed to his head as the crowd rose to acclaim another piece of tennis wizardry. In four of the 22-year-old's run of victories against Sinner, he had lost the first set, so this was a big statement, but Alcaraz then threw in a poor game to start the second. Sinner, who normally disguises his emotions as well as an Alcaraz drop shot, let out a loud shout of 'Let's go' when he saved a break point in the next game, the Italian determined to hold on to his advantage this time. He was forced to delay his serve at a crucial moment two games later when a champagne cork flew from the stands and nearly hit him, prompting boos from the crowd and a rebuke from British umpire Alison Hughes. If Sinner did have Paris in his mind then serving for the set at 5-4 would have been a moment to tighten up but instead he produced a series of greatest hits, chasing down an Alcaraz drop shot, drilling a forehand winner down the line to bring up set point and then crunching another winner cross court. First player to beat Jannik Sinner in a Grand Slam final: Carlos Alcaraz First player to beat Carlos Alcaraz in a Grand Slam final: Jannik Sinner Sinner missed two chances for an immediate break at the start of the third set following a pair of Alcaraz double faults but the match was starting to feel marginally on his racket. And this time the serve was all Sinner needed to open up a potentially decisive advantage, with the Italian then moving a step closer by breaking again to lead 2-1 in the fourth set. Alcaraz survived a couple of close service games and the crowd willed him to turn it around, roaring as Sinner coughed up two break points at 4-3. Not this time, though, said the Italian as he responded with four points in a row.

Sinner has won all of his Big Titles in the past two years, having earned his first in August 2023 at Toronto. During that period he has claimed four Grand Slam championships, four ATP Masters 1000 trophies and a title at the Nitto ATP Finals (2024).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tennis star Nick Kyrgios has had his say about world number one Jannik Sinner reaching the Wimbledon final just months after serving a doping ban. Wimbledon finalist Sinner failed two doping tests in March 2024 but accepted a deal with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) despite protesting his innocence. According to BBC Sport, discussions between the Italian's lawyer and legal representatives for WADA in February 2025 led to an agreement that the player would serve a three-month ban after testing positive for the banned anabolic steroid clostebol but subsequently being cleared of wrongdoing by an independent tribunal. Wimbledon final opponent Carlos Alcaraz defeated Sinner in the final at Roland Garros in June and his success in SW19 this month has tempted critics back into the open. Kyrgios – a divisive character in his own right and never one to hide his opinion in any case – made his feelings clear on Sinner's doping ban deal and not for the first time. "Do I think it's a good look for the sport that [Iga] Swiatek [who served a one-month suspension for an inadvertent positive test last year] and Sinner are in the final at Wimbledon after serving a ban?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2 Carlos Alcaraz a three-peat at Wimbledon, winning the latest edition of tennis' best rivalry in four sets – and avenging his loss to Alcaraz at the French Open. After dropping the opening set, Sinner took control of the match behind his overpowering serve to win his fourth career Grand Slam title, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4. Two-time defending champion Alcaraz of Spain was no match for the Italian's serve, which only seemed to get better as the match progressed. "I had a very tough loss in Paris, but at the end of the day it doesn't really matter how you win or you lose the important tournaments, you have to understand what you did wrong, try to work on that. That's exactly what we did," Sinner said after the match. "We tried to accept the loss and just kept working and this is for sure one of the reasons why I hold this trophy right here." For Sinner, it was his first Wimbledon title and his first Grand Slam victory on anything other than a hard court – after he won the 2024 and 2025 Australian Open and 2024 U.S. Open. "We would never have thought we would be in this position back in the days when I was young," Sinner said he discussed with his coaches before the match. "This was only a dream of the dream because it was so far away where I'm from. "I'm just living my dream, so it's amazing." Look back as USA TODAY followed all the action from Centre Court. A brilliant backhand service return down the line gave Sinner an early service break in the fourth set at 2-1. And he never let Alcaraz have an opening to break back. Could sweet revenge be in the cards for Jannik Sinner? Looking to reverse the outcome of their classic French Open final, Sinner took the third set against Alcaraz with a powerful array of shotmaking. On his third break point of the set, Sinner came through with the winner he needed – helping him take control of the match with a two sets to one lead. With the score even at 4-all and Alcaraz serving, Sinner crushed a forehand winner to put himself in position for the break. He capitalized when Alcaraz slipped on a deep baseline return, putting away the easy backhand volley into the open court. Sinner then locked down the set with a couple powerful overhead shots and a service winner to close out the set 6-4. Sinner did not have an ace in the first two sets, but he powered in six during the third. These two tennis titans could be headed for second consecutive instant classic in a Grand Slam final. Sinner bounced back to record a service break in the opening game and – unlike in the opening set – he didn't let Alcaraz come back. He closed it out with some great athleticism to win the final point on a cross-court stunner. Carlos Alcaraz rallied from an early deficit to win the final four games and take the opening set against Jannik Sinner. After both players held serve their first two times, Sinner recorded the match's first service break in the fifth game, winning the final four points with some aggressive returns. But Alcaraz battled back to even the set at four games apiece thanks to a pair of unforced errors by Sinner on his serve. Alcaraz broke Sinner once more to take the set, as Sinner double-faulted at deuce and Alcaraz hit an amazing return that just barely cleared the net for the clinching point. There's a slight delay, but we're now just moments away from the start of the gentlemen's singles final at Wimbledon. There's a royal presence in the audience as well. 2 seed Carlos Alcaraz is scheduled for Sunday, July 13 at 11 a.m. ESPN is televising the 2025 Wimbledon men's final between No. You can live stream the match between No. 2 seed Carlos Alcaraz on the ESPN app, Disney+, ESPN+  and Fubo, which carries the ESPN family of networks and is offering a free trial. 2 seed Carlos Alcaraz was favored to beat No. 1 seed Jannik Sinner on Friday night, according to BetMGM, the odds have flipped as the match has drawn closer. Wimbledon 2025 marks the fifth Grand Slam final for Sinner. This is Carlos Alcaraz's sixth Grand Slam singles final. Wimbledon 2025 marks the 13th meeting between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. Their most recent meeting was a five-set thriller in the final of the French Open last month, when Alcaraz rallied from two sets down to win Roland Garros crown. The duo has met four times total in Grand Slam tournaments. Carlos Alcaraz has won 21 ATP Tour singles titles since turning pro in 2018. Jannik Sinner has won 19 ATP Tour singles titles since turning pro in 2018. He won the Wimbledon championship eight times during his storied career, with his first victory coming in 2003 and last in 2017. That included a run of five consecutive titles at the tournament from 2003-07. A total of 9 men have won Wimbledon at least four times. The Australian and U.S. Open are played on hard court and the French Open is played on red clay. Wimbledon generally produces faster tennis and more volleys than the other majors, and balls do not bounce nearly as high. The surface can also be slippery at times, especially compared to hardcourts. "You have to be more focused on the footwork here," Carlos Alcaraz told The Athletic after winning his second Wimbledon men's singles championship in 2024. It is the 103rd time that the Grand Slam event has been held on Church Road, a streak that dates back to 1922. The Grand Slam event hasn't always been held at the All England Club on Church Road, however. From 1877 through 1921, the Wimbledon Championships were held at the former All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club location on Worple Road in London.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LONDON -- Jannik Sinner defeated two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 on Sunday to win his first Wimbledon championship and reverse the result of their epic French Open final five weeks ago. 1-ranked Sinner earned his fourth Grand Slam title overall, moving him one away from No. Alcaraz had won the past five head-to-head matches between the pair, most recently across five sets and nearly 5 1/2 hours at Roland-Garros on June 8. Sinner took a two-set lead in that one, then held a trio of match points, but couldn't close the deal. In addition to ending that piece of perfection, Sinner asserted himself in a match that featured moments of terrific play by both men, but also the occasional lapses. He had won 20 matches in a row at the All England Club, including victories against Novak Djokovic in the 2023 and 2024 finals. So this served as a bookend win for Sinner, who proved what he kept telling anyone who asked: No, there would be no carryover from his heartbreak in Paris. Hard to imagine, though, that that collapse wasn't on his mind at least a little on Sunday, especially when he faced two break points while serving at 4-3, 15-40 in the fourth set. When it ended, Sinner put both hands on his white hat. After embracing Alcaraz at the net, Sinner crouched on court with his head bowed, then pounded his right palm on the grass. Yes, Sinner put the French Open behind him in the best way possible and demonstrated that his matchups with Alcaraz could delight tennis fans for years to come. It hadn't happened for more than a half-century before that trilogy. Sinner has participated in each of the last four major finals, a stretch that began with a triumph at the U.S. Open last September and was followed by another at the Australian Open this January. Wearing the same tape job and white arm sleeve to protect his right elbow that he has been using since falling in the opening game of his fourth-round win on Monday, Sinner never showed any issues, just as he had not while eliminating 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic in the semifinals.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Clay-court tennis resumes after Wimbledon with two ATP 250s in Europe. One of those is the Nordea Open in Bastad, which features two main draw matches and three qualifying matches on the opening day. 18-year-old William Rejchtman Vinciguerra hasn't played on the ATP Tour. The closest he has been to this stage was when he lost in qualifying in this tournament last season. But the Dutchman has won two main draw matches in his last five tournaments and is currently outside the centurion club. Still, he has a winnable opening match where he will be heavily favored to progress against a relatively inexperienced teenager. Just two spots separate Gaubas and Monteiro in the rankings. Monteiro defeated the Lithuanian in a tight two-setter when they met at the Bad Waltersdorf Challenger last season. Consistency is usually Monteiro's biggest problem, but his depth and power can be overwhelming when firing on all cylinders. The Swede picked up a high-quality opening win against Viktor Durasovic to move within one win of the main draw. But this will be a huge challenge against the high-flying Austrian who has Top 100 ambitions and could well achieve that milestone this week. Both Darderi and Collignon have accomplished resumes competing on clay. But it is the Italian who has enjoyed a steadier rise on the ATP Tour this season, winning his second title in Marrakech and posting 16 wins from 27 matches on clay. Collignon won the Monza Challenger in April and reached two additional quarterfinals in his subsequent four tournaments on the dirt. Darderi hasn't played since Wimbledon, but that won't be an issue, and he should settle quickly. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Sunday, wtatennis.com caught up with Iga Swiatek during a whirlwind, hard-working and mostly sleepless period since becoming the Wimbledon champion. Iga Swiatek needed less than an hour to defeat Amanda Anisimova 6-0, 6-0 in Saturday's Wimbledon final. It was only the second time in the Open Era that a women's Grand Slam champion did not lose a single game. For nearly three hours, Swiatek dutifully made the rounds. It opened with a packed press conference in English, then Polish, followed by television interviews with, among many others, ESPN, Tennis Channel, BBC Sport, Wimbledon TV, Prime Germany, Eurosport, Wowow, Ziggo, Tencent. She visited with the Tennis Podcast and sat down for separate roundtables with British and international writers. Eventually, Swiatek and her team made the short journey up the hill to IMG House for a sprawling, tapas-style dinner with family and friends. They talked, replaying the fortnight's memorable moments, enjoyed some good music and eventually got to bed. Swiatek said she might have slept for 90 minutes, more of a nap, before rising early Sunday for more media obligations. “Going out there without any stress anymore, just full pleasure, no more work -- I could just really appreciate it even more.” Wearing a white t-shirt and salmon-colored shorts, she was speaking from the nail bar, just off the player lawn, receiving a rather becoming shade of pink. Obviously, yesterday there were a lot of emotions, but now I can reflect on everything that has happened. What were some of the specific adjustments to your usual game that your coach Wim Fissette was suggesting on grass? Overall, we worked a lot on my forehand and the serve. We already did that a little bit and it worked at the Australian Open. … On grass, we knew it was going to be crucial. How difficult was it for you to, against your nature, add more risk by being more aggressive on the grass? I just needed to be brave with my decisions on the court. I'd still spin the ball as much as possible, which didn't really do a lot because the effect was it just bounced higher, and opponents were playing from the top. So, yeah, this year I decided that I'm just going to use my intuition more, just react to what the grass brings me. I was more aggressive in the first points of the rally and that puts a lot of pressure on my opponents. You finished the tournament with three bagels, won your last 20 games in a row -- where did that come from? [Laughing] I just did my job, you know? The main goal was to just keep working, not really taking anything for granted. When you're leading that way, it's easy to take your foot off the gas pedal. I think the first Grand Slam final that I played [2020 Roland Garros], it was a bit of a different feeling. The [2022] US Open, I've got to say, for sure, that was a tough one. So yesterday, because of the fact that grass was never my favorite surface, I felt like I needed to enjoy every minute and appreciate that I was playing the final. How does winning this title that you never thought you'd win change your view of what is possible in your career? You never know what's going to happen in the future, but for sure this title surprised me. I've got to say that winning Wimbledon was last on my bucket list, because I just thought it was going to be the hardest one, the most tricky one.

That was despite being interrupted by a fan in the stands popping open a champagne bottle as Sinner was getting ready to serve out the game at 2-1 up. The cork landed at Sinner's feet, causing Alcaraz to raise both hands and shake his head in frustration. Sinner lost the following point but went on to hold for a 3-1 lead. Alcaraz, a 22-year-old from Spain, defeated Sinner, a 22-year-old from Italy, in five sets spread over 5 hours, 29 minutes in Paris on June 8, coming back from a two-set deficit and saving three match points along the way. He also carries a career-best 24-match winning streak into Sunday and has beaten Sinner five times in a row. Sinner owns three major trophies and is playing in his fourth consecutive Slam final — but first at the All England Club. Sinner is wearing the tape and arm sleeve to protect his right elbow that he has been using since falling in the opening game of his fourth-round win on Monday. After eliminating 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic in the semifinals, Sinner said he didn't think his elbow would be an issue on Sunday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stephanie Petit is a Royals Editor, Writer and Reporter at PEOPLE. Kate Middleton is back at Wimbledon for the final day of competition, and she brought her family! This time, Prince William joined his wife at the sporting event with their two eldest children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte. King Felipe of Spain was also spotted at the event, likely to support fellow countryman Alcaraz. Prince George, who turns 12 on July 22, and Princess Charlotte, 10, have both attended Wimbledon twice before. However, their 7-year-old brother, Prince Louis, has yet to make his Wimbledon debut. Although the Royal Box at Centre Court is typically off-limits to kids given the high demand for a spot and limited 74 seats, exceptions are made for royal children. Prince George first attended Wimbledon 2022 alongside his parents, who are regulars at the sporting event, where Kate regularly awards trophies to Wimbledon winners as the patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. as Carlos Alcaraz won the men's singles final against Djokovic. Although Prince George missed last year's tennis tournament, he's no stranger to the sports stands. He often joins dad Prince William at soccer games, including a father-son outing on April 15 to cheer on Aston Villa. Sign up for our free Royals newsletter to get the latest updates on Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle and more! There were a few notable exceptions, however: doctors advised against her attending in 2013 when she was "heavily pregnant" with Prince George, and Wimbledon was canceled in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Prince William, 43, also had a special reason for attending Wimbledon this year. Notpla, an organization that makes biodegradable packaging from seaweed and won one of the Prince of Wales' Earthshot Prizes, partnered with Wimbledon for both the food packaging and a spoon made from seaweed. "You put on a sort of brave face, stoicism through treatment. Treatment's done, then it's like, 'I can crack on, get back to normal,' " she said during a July 2 visit to Colchester Hospital. "But the reality is you go through hard times." The family outing comes just one day after it was revealed that senior aides for Prince Harry and King Charles met privately in London on Wednesday, July 9 — a small but significant sign that efforts to mend the royal rift may finally be underway. A distance remains between the King's sons, whose relationship has been strained since Harry and Meghan Markle's 2020 step back from royal duties.</p>

It was noisier than ever before and expert lip reader Jeremy Freeman analysed her stunned response. Moments earlier she shook hands with former Wimbledon champion Martina Navratilova, 68, before greeting tennis legend Billie Jean King, 81, who curtsied to her. Speaking to Anisimova, Jeremy had her saying: “You should be so proud, well done, and enjoy yourself.” Kate, 43, later engaged in conversation with the winner Swiatek backstage and she reportedly advised her: “Ensure that you have some downtime.” Earlier in the conversation, she said: “Wonderful, extraordinary achievement, very well done. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. After becoming the first Polish woman to win at Wimbledon, Siatek told the crowd: “First of all I want to congratulate Amanda for an amazing two weeks no matter what happened today. I hope we're going to play many more finals here and at other tournaments. Kate is the patron of the All England Lawn Tennis Club and she has been present on Centre Court for many years since marrying Prince William back in 2011.</p>

Sinner took a two-set lead in that one, then held a trio of match points, but couldn't close the deal. In addition to ending that piece of perfection, Sinner asserted himself in a match that featured moments of terrific play by both men, but also the occasional lapses. He had won 20 matches in a row at the All England Club, including victories against Novak Djokovic in the 2023 and 2024 finals. So this served as a bookend win for Sinner, who proved what he kept telling anyone who asked: No, there would be no carryover from his heartbreak in Paris. Hard to imagine, though, that that collapse wasn't on his mind at least a little on Sunday, especially when he faced two break points while serving at 4-3, 15-40 in the fourth set. When it ended, Sinner put both hands on his white hat. After embracing Alcaraz at the net, Sinner crouched on court with his head bowed, then pounded his right palm on the grass.

It hadn't happened for more than a half-century before that trilogy. Sinner has participated in each of the last four major finals, a stretch that began with a triumph at the U.S. Open last September and was followed by another at the Australian Open this January. Wearing the same tape job and white arm sleeve to protect his right elbow that he has been using since falling in the opening game of his fourth-round win on Monday, Sinner never showed any issues, just as he had not while eliminating 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic in the semifinals.</p>

In the co-main event, Shakur Stevenson remained undefeated and defended his WBC lightweight title with a dominant performance, beating William Zepeda by unanimous decision. Berlanga had boasted that he would have an easy night. But it sure got tough in the fourth round, when Sheeraz dropped him flat on his back.

But he was often powerless to stop the flurries that were coming back at him from Stevenson's hand speed that is up at the top of boxing. Tickets weren't sold then and just a few hundred people were able to see it, creating an atmosphere where the scene was impressive but the sounds were almost non-existent, leaving fighters to say it felt like a sparring session. This time, seats were sold and many were occupied well into the second deck of the 14,000-seat stadium, which had its retractable roof closed to create comfortable conditions on a humid day.

The fans saw good action early in a brilliant performance from Stevenson, who has been criticized at times for a style that that seems too dependent on avoiding pain and not dishing it out. Zepeda did trap Stevenson in a corner to score with some shots in the third round, bringing his Mexican fans out of their seats, but many other times Stevenson's quick head movement allowed him to dodge potential trouble. There was a title change in the previous fight, when Subriel Matias (23-2) edged Alberto Puello (24-1) by majority decision to take the WBC's 140-pound belt. Before that, Cuban David Morrell (12-1) got up from a fifth-round knockdown to rally late and edge Imam Khataev (10-1) by split decision in a light heavyweight bout.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pat Rafter, the Australian tennis star famed for his iconic ponytail and once crowned 'Sexiest Athlete Alive' nearly 30 years ago, has since traded in that look. His off-court appeal was just as strong, with his long hair, stubbled beard, and chiseled physique earning him the title of the world's most attractive sportsman by People magazine. In recent times, Rafter's public outings have been sparse. Post-match, while signing autographs, he revealed a slicked-back hairstyle under his cap, a far cry from his once shoulder-length locks. Reflecting on his career in 2017, he said: "I was at a time where there weren't a lot of players around,". You would have just gone, 'There's another good tennis player from Australia.' Pat Rafter experienced two gut-wrenching defeats at Wimbledon, with the 2000 men's final against Pete Sampras being particularly tough as he admits to "choking" during the second set tie-break. The following year saw yet another tough loss for Rafter, this time to Goran Ivanisevic. After hanging up his racket in 2003, he embraced family life with ex-model Lara Feltham, marrying her in 2004, and they have two kids together, Joshua and India, who are now grown up and can reflect humorously on their father's history. Before settling down, Rafter had his share of dates with various Dutch models in the 90s, until he found lasting love with their mother, quipping, "You know what, it is exhausting being this good-looking."
