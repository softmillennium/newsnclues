The Club World Cup final arrives Sunday with global significance and continental firsts at stake.

For the first time, two clubs from the same continent — Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain — will meet in the title match, marking the first major international men's final between teams from England and France. It is a product of both performance and policy, with expanded entry granting Europe multiple spots, and wealth helping shape the field.

PSG, who have already swept Ligue 1, the Coupe de France and the Champions League, enter as overwhelming favorites. They have won four straight knockout matches by a combined score of 12-0, including a 4-0 demolition of Real Madrid in the semifinals.

Chelsea, under Enzo Maresca, have defied expectations and leaned on depth, defense and a red-hot João Pedro to reach the final.

Sunday's match will decide more than a trophy — it will offer a snapshot of modern football's economic divide, a clash of the two biggest spenders in the sport, and a battle between a finished product and a team still under construction.

Sunday, July 13

PSG vs. Chelsea (3 p.m. ET, TNT/DAZN/Univision)

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump arrived at the FIFA Club World Cup final in MetLife Stadium Sunday to thunderous applause, getting a preview of the even grander soccer tournament the US is set to host next year. FIFA Club World Cup is a global contest between club teams — not to be confused with the FIFA World Cup, which is the world's premier soccer competition between national teams. Trump did not have any other major events on his schedule for Sunday other than observing the FIFA Club World Cup final and traveling. The president's visit to the FIFA Club World Cup final comes on the one-year anniversary of his brush with death in Butler, Pa., when a would-be assassin's bullet came within a quarter inch of killing him. Trump did not have any announced plans to mark that harrowing date, though he did sit for an interview with his daughter-in-law, Lara, which aired on Fox News Saturday night, in which he reflected on the assassination attempt. “Well, it was unforgettable,” the president reflected during an interview on Fox News' “My View.” “I didn't know exactly what was going on. People were screaming, and I got down quickly, fortunately, because I think they shot eight bullets.” Throughout his second term, Trump has frequented blockbuster sporting events such as Super Bowl LIX and UFC fights, but Sunday marked his first foray of the year at a major FIFA game. Trump has long been a sports fan, and during his second term, he has upped his attendance to major competitions, particularly the UFC, amid his friendly rapport with its CEO, Dana White. Earlier this month, Trump unveiled plans to host a UFC fight at the White House within the next year as part of the festivities to herald America's 250th birthday. Trump's sports outings have become the top source of his public domestic travel, thus far in his second term, per a Newsweek tally.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump arrived Sunday at MetLife Stadium for the Club World Cup final between Chelsea and PSG. The chopper arrived at Teterboro Airport after Trump and first lady Melania Trump traveled from their golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey for the inaugural championship match of the newly-expanded tournament in East Rutherford. In video from the White House's Rapid Response account, Trump could be seen stepping down from the helicopter before getting inside a motorcade. Trump's son, Donald Jr., and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, were also seen headed to the game. The outing falls on the first anniversary of the assassination attempt he survived in Butler, Pennsylvania last year, and significant security measures were put in place for his arrival. As detailed in The Athletic, secret service officials worked with organizers to put together a travel route to the venue, and it was believed he would be behind a pane of bulletproof glass at the game. Trump was seen watching the game with FIFA president Gianni Infantino, while New York Jets' and incoming Crystal Palace owner Woody Johnson was also spotted nearby. Reporting from before the game also suggested Trump would sit with PSG and Chelsea officials, as well as Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the emir of Qatar and previous owner of the Boeing 747-8 jet Trump controversially accepted as a gift. Trump is also expected to conduct some business at the game, as his Middle East Special Envoy Steve Witkoff told reporters that he would meet with senior Qatari officials on the sidelines to discuss a ceasefire in Gaza. 'When you do the threat and risk assessment, you cover anything that could go wrong: if they were at a mass gathering, what if the stage collapsed?' Nigel Thomas, a former British Special Air Service (SAS) soldier and founder of security training firm, Blue Mountain Group, told The Athletic. The World Cup Final next summer will also be hosted at MetLife Stadium. The president has enjoyed a friendly relationship with Infantino, and FIFA actually opened up a new office in Manhattan's Trump Tower this week. Since he took office for a second time this year, Trump has visited several sporting events - including the Super Bowl in New Orleans. While Trump has yet to attend a Club World Cup match ahead of the final, Vice President J.D. And the strict security measures were certainly felt in that case. 'We were checked by strict security,' Dortmund head coach Niko Kovac told assembled reporters.' Sunday's final will see reigning Champions League winners PSG face English giants Chelsea, who were last crowned winners of Europe in 2021. PSG have gotten past a gauntlet of opponents this summer to reach the championship match, beating the likes of Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid along the way. Their win over Los Blancos was particularly emphatic, as they beat the Spanish giants 4-0 on Wednesday in front of a packed MetLife crowd.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — The FIFA Club World Cup concludes Sunday with Champions League winner Paris Saint-Germain facing English Premier League side Chelsea FC in the final. Meanwhile, Chelsea could raise some hardware of its own with an big upset after finishing fourth in the Premier League last season. President Donald Trump is in attendance for the Club World Cup final at MetLife Stadium. Here's everything you need to know about the PSG vs. Chelsea match today, and stay tuned for live updates from USA TODAY Sports: Although PSG has had a handful of chances, Chelsea was the first team to put their opponents on their heels. Fortunately for PSG fans, the Blue missed a few shots and were not able to take advantage of their opportunities. The match is available to live stream for free on DAZN. PSG 3, Chelsea 1: Chelsea's Cole Palmer makes a statement with a chilling goal to open the scoring, but PSG's quality will overwhelm in this one. Ousmane Dembélé, Désiré Doué and Fabián Ruiz score in this match as PSG makes history winning the Club World Cup title. First lady Melania Trump is also accompanying her husband. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, retired NFL quarterback Tom Brady, and media magnate Rupert Murdoch have also been spotted in Trump's suite. The odds may be stacked in PSG's favor, but Chelsea knows anything can happen in a one-off match like this Club World Cup final. “Everyone has them down as strong favorites,” said Chelsea captain Reece James, the only player remaining from Chelsea's Champions League title in 2020-21, playing in this Club World Cup. “I don't really care, to be honest. There's only one trophy left for Paris Saint-Germain to raise this season. Can PSG cap their historic year with another title? Added coach Luis Enrique: “Best season in my career? Trump and FIFA president Gianni Infantino have built a close relationship, showcased after several visits made by Infantino to the White House in the last year. FIFA also opened a new office inside Trump Tower this week during the Club World Cup. Infantino further explained his connection with Trump derives from needing government support from the United States to run the Club World Cup this summer and the World Cup next summer, which will be co-hosted with Canada and Mexico. Major League Soccer commissioner Don Garber believes the FIFA Club World Cup has been an “absolute terrific success,” and has set the stage for an exciting World Cup 2026 next summer. “I think it did what it was intended to do – to launch something new, take some risk, show some courage, and then set the stage for 2026, which will be another example of soccer and football at its very best. The FIFA World Cup begins in Mexico on June 11, 2026, and the final will be at MetLife Stadium on July 19, 2026. Deen writes, "Chelsea's Cole Palmer makes a statement with a chilling goal to open the scoring, but PSG's quality will overwhelm in this one. Ousmane Dembélé, Désiré Doué and Fabián Ruiz score in this match as PSG makes history winning the Club World Cup title." Leboff writes, "Since the end of May, PSG has defeated Inter Milan, Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid by a combined score of 15-0. There are just too many ways that PSG can win this match, and it's hard to see this train coming off the tracks after months of domination." Cormack writes, "This PSG team can get at you in so many ways, and while the Blues will offer collective coherence, they, too, are bound to suffer like many before them. We're talking about a potentially all-time great team here, and they'll want to rubber stamp their supremacy by securing their first-ever Club World Cup trophy. Richman writes, "Surely PSG will have too much for Chelsea when it comes to the crunch. There was a significant security presence around the stadium before the Club World Cup final, with nearly 100 people representing multiple law enforcement agencies and stadium security personnel greeting fans as they entered the gates. The security perimeter, established several hundred feet outside the stadium entrances, featured 15-feet high chained fences on top of concrete bases with entry paths for fans to enter. Fans proceeded to walk through a winded line separated by metal barricades until they reached the front, where they walked through metal detectors and got their tickets scanned. If they had any bags, they were asked to check their items into a locker for the duration of the match. After entering, fans were able to pick up black and gold Club World Cup squared towels as a keepsake. They also found a clear spot to pose for photos and videos in front of the stadium to commemorate the occasion. One woman said it took “two seconds” to enter. “We didn't even know who was playing. We bought tickets before it was announced, and we just wanted to be part of the festivities,” Rosa added. Our team of savvy editors independently handpicks all recommendations.

USMNT star Josh Sargent continues to attract Premier League interest, but Norwich's £20 million ($27m) asking price is putting suitors off.

That could be considered a fair price for a man that has hit 44 goals through 98 Championship appearances for the Canaries. He is also tied to a contract through to 2028, meaning those at Carrow Road are under no pressure to sell.

Sargent has seen a step up into the top-flight of English football speculated on for some time, having joined Norwich when they were competing at that level, but no deal has been done and there remains little substance to the speculation.

In the present, Everton, Leeds and Roma are among those to have been credited with interest. Italian giants are said to have turned their attention elsewhere, while teams in England are reluctant to meet Norwich's demands.

Alan Nixon has said via Patreon that Burnley are among those to have asked questions of Sargent, but consider him to be overpriced. The Clarets are, like Leeds, in the market for more firepower after securing promotion into the Premier League.

It is claimed Burnley remain the most likely to reach a compromise as they mull over their options, but more discussions regarding USMNT striker Sargent are expected to take place before the next transfer deadline passes on September 1.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If Chelsea are capable of thrashing a team like PSG, the Premier League is going to be ultra-competitive this season. Liverpool are reigning champions and have added Florian Wirtz, Manchester City have comprehensively reloaded, Arsenal look to finally be signing a striker, Newcastle are making significant investments, and now you throw the presumptive world champions into the mix. And that's before considering whether clubs like Manchester United and Tottenham can return to the domestic levels they expect to be at. They are doing to UEFA Champions League winners PSG what the French champions did to Real Madrid here on Wednesday. An extraordinary first half comes to an end and Chelsea are 3-0 up against the European champions in the Club World Cup final! PSG are usually the team going in at half-time with a commanding lead, yet they have it all to do in the second half. Cole Palmer has been excellent with two goals as well as an assist for Joao Pedro who got his third Chelsea goal on just his second start. A collective gasp from every Chelsea fan inside MetLife Stadium as Joao Neves ghosted into the penalty area and made first contact with a well-angled cross. Another key contribution in this first half from the Chelsea goalkeeper. The fourth official has shown us that there will be six more minutes of this first half. That third goal makes it feel like PSG need to pull one back in this period of stoppage time. I'm not sure even the most optimistic Chelsea fan was expecting this! Palmer had so much space again and he drove towards the PSG penalty area under no pressure from the European champions. Lucas Beraldo made a pretty weak attempt to step onto the England midfielder and that allowed him to thread a lovely ball into Joao Pedro. Another superb finish and, if anyone was in any doubt, Chelsea are in total control of this Club World Cup final. A third goal in this dream first half for Chelsea — they have been brilliant! Another Chelsea yellow card, the first for a mistimed challenge. Gusto is the reluctant recipient and becomes the third player in blue to be walking a disciplinary tightrope in this final after Neto and Caicedo. In a really strong Chelsea performance, Sanchez has one of the stand-out performers. It was greeted, as you can imagine, by huge cheers from the Chelsea fans behind his goal. Teams often try to exploit Hakimi's advanced runs by countering down his flank, but Chelsea have found space on the opposite side. Left-back Nuno Mendes has also committed high upfield, with Vitinha legging back in hopes of slowing Palmer's progression toward the box. More petulant Chelsea behaviour that the referee is not happy with. He looked straight over at the referee with his hands raised in apology but Faghani's mind was already made up. Maresca won't be happy that two of his players are walking a tightrope for two pieces of rather childish behaviour. Alireza Faghani has gone to his pocket for the first time in this game. Pretty silly from the Chelsea winger who now has an hour up against Hakimi having had his card marked. Gusto dominated him for the first goal and he was completely missing in action when Palmer broke away down Chelsea's right for the second. The main praise of Mendes and Achraf Hakimi is usually that they attack so well while also having a defensive influence, but they have not had an impact so far. Another of those beautifully placed shots into the bottom corner from Palmer and Chelsea are 2-0 up. This has been a staggeringly good start to this Club World Cup final by those Chelsea players — they are completely outplaying the European champions. Mendes has not started well for PSG and his vacated left-hand side allowed James to clip a pass over the top for Palmer to chase. Vitinha was the recovering defender but his half-hearted attempt to stop Chelsea's talisman only opened up space for him in the penalty area. And I don't think Palmer's finish can just be glossed over.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lamine Yamal is expected to take the No.10 shirt at Barcelona that Lionel Messi once filled, but “one more season” of 19 is being mooted. The teenage wonderkid has been cleared to sign a lucrative new contract in Catalunya after celebrating his 18th birthday. Eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi cemented his legacy in that shirt, with Yamal treading a similar path after graduating from the same La Masia academy system. He has been dropping hints at taking a new squad number, with Guillem Balague saying in his column for BBC Sport: “He has posted pictures of himself one day with the number 19 jersey he currently wears - as a young Messi also did - followed by a homage to some previous wearers of the 10. Messi, of course, Diego Maradona, Ronaldinho, Rivaldo, Romario, Hristo Stoichkov, Juan Roman Riquelme, Pep Guardiola and Laszlo Kubala.” It is, however, being claimed that Yamal could delay a huge career call. Balague added: “Speculation around Barcelona's number 10 shirt has followed him for months. Out of respect, he did not entertain conversations about it while Ansu Fati, the previous wearer, was still at the club, but he has since moved to Monaco. "Barcelona have not announced anything officially, although there has been a dramatic surge in sales of said shirt. He has worn 19 since 2024, with that number also being taken with Spain, but is considered to be a natural fit for the iconic No.10 jersey.</p>
