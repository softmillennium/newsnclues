                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The missing WCM is coming under scrutiny in the wake of the tragedy that has killed more than 120 people because they are the meteorologist responsible for interacting with emergency managers and public officials to ensure they know how to handle a severe weather event, should one occur. Much of their work takes place before extreme weather hits, with tabletop simulations, relationship building exercises and other activities designed to foster close working relationships between weather forecasters, emergency managers and local leaders. It is “hard to tell how much of an impact” the WCM's absence had that night, since the office had five staff members on duty, compared to the typical staffing level of two at that time of night, and they were communicating with emergency managers as the flood threat ramped up, the NOAA official told CNN. They noted the approximately three hours of warning lead time provided to many communities along the Guadalupe River, starting when the first flash flood warning was issued at 1:14 a.m. CT on July 4. “You can do a lot in three hours,” the official said, referring to taking flood safety measures. The NWS had about 4,400 staff members in January and this has fallen to about 3,700 as of this past week, according to the NOAA official. Some NWS offices are now so poorly staffed, they are no longer operating 24/7 and are not launching weather balloons — a vital source of weather data — at their typical cadence of twice a day. The NWS did recently receive an exemption to the federal hiring freeze to bring on about 125 meteorologists, but it won't make up for all the employees lost through early retirements, firings and other DOGE-related cuts. While it appears these cuts did not degrade the Weather Service's response in Texas, experts are still concerned as the peak of hurricane season is looming. The agency has not yet begun to hire those 125 roles and this season is expected to be another above-average one. Brian LaMarre, a former meteorologist-in-charge at the NWS' Tampa office, who also served as a WCM in Lubbock, Texas, earlier in his career, told CNN any mistakes that led to so many lost lives in this disaster were made once the warnings left the NWS forecast office in New Braunfels, Texas. In his view, they were not a result of the missing WCM position. “Hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, wildfires, whatever it is when we issue a warning, we could get several hours (of lead time), just like San Antonio did. “It became a dissemination challenge for people that didn't have a phone in their hand, or weren't woken up by a siren, which they don't have on the river,” LaMarre added. Much of the WCM's role is to work with the emergency management community and public officials well in advance of any severe weather, to conduct exercises and establish communications channels, for example. It's unclear if those activities stopped once Yura left in April. That is not enough time for local emergency managers to forget all of their extreme weather knowledge or miss many vital trainings, LaMarre stated. Plus, he said, others in the forecast office who aspired to serve as WCM would likely have taken over some of Yura's responsibilities. For its part, NOAA touted the accuracy of its forecasts and noted its flash flood warnings were sent via tone alerts to cell phones in the areas affected, as well as to NOAA weather radios. “The National Weather Service's Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) in Austin/San Antonio and San Angelo, TX had additional staff on duty during the catastrophic flooding event in Texas's Hill Country during the July 4 holiday weekend,” Cei said in a statement. All forecasts and warnings were issued in a timely manner.” “Additionally, these offices were able to provide decision support services to local partners, including those in the emergency management community,” she said. “The NWS remains dedicated to our mission to serve the American public through our forecasts and decision support services.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israeli airstrikes in Gaza have killed at least 17 people, including six children at a water collection point, according to local health officials. At least 31 Palestinians were fatally shot on their way to an aid distribution site in the Gaza Strip on Saturday, Palestinian hospital officials and witnesses said. The Israeli military said it had fired warning shots toward people it said were behaving suspiciously to prevent them from approaching. A Palestinian boy mourns over the body of his 12-year-old friend, Abdullah Ahmed, who was killed in an Israeli strike that targeted a drinking water distribution point, at Al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat, central Gaza Strip, Sunday, July 13, 2025. Relatives carry the body of 13-year-old Seraje Ebrahim, killed in an Israeli strike on a drinking water distribution point, for burial outside Al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat, central Gaza Strip, Sunday, July 13, 2025. Mourners carry the bodies of Palestinian-American Sayfollah Musallet, 20, and Mohammed al-Shalabi during their funeral in the West Bank village of Al-Mazraa a-Sharqiya on Sunday, July 13, 2025. According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, Musallet was killed in an attack by Israeli settlers and al-Shalabi was shot in the chest. Destroyed buildings in the Gaza Strip are seen from a southern Israel location on Sunday, July 13, 2025. DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip killed at least 30 people on Sunday, including six children at a water collection point, while the Palestinian death toll passed 58,000 after 21 months of war, local health officials said. Israel and Hamas appeared no closer to a breakthrough in indirect talks meant to pause the war and free some Israeli hostages after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Washington visit last week. Israel says it will end the war only once Hamas surrenders, disarms and goes into exile, something it refuses to do. Funerals were held there Sunday for two Palestinians, including Palestinian-American Sayfollah Musallet, killed by Israeli settlers, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. In central Gaza, officials at Al-Awda Hospital said it received 10 bodies after an Israeli strike on a water collection point in nearby Nuseirat. Ramadan Nassar, a witness who lives in the area, told The Associated Press that around 20 children and 14 adults had been lined up to get water. He said Palestinians walk some 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) to fetch water from the area. The Israeli military said it was targeting a militant but a technical error made its munitions fall “dozens of meters from the target.” “There is no safe place,” resident Raafat Fanouna said as some people went over the rubble with sticks and bare hands. Separately, health officials said an Israeli strike hit a group of citizens walking in the street on Sunday afternoon in central Gaza City, killing 11 people and injuring around 30 others. Dr. Ahmed Qandil, who specializes in general surgery, was among those killed, Gaza's Health Ministry said. A ministry spokesperson, Zaher al-Wahidi, told the AP that Qandil had been on his way to Al-Ahli Arab Baptist Hospital. In the central town of Zawaida, an Israeli strike on a home killed nine, including two women and three children, officials at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital said. Israel's military said it was unaware of the strike on the home, but said it hit more than 150 targets over the past 24 hours, including what it called weapons storage facilities, missile launchers and sniping posts. Israel blames Hamas for civilian casualties because the militant group operates out of populated areas. The ministry, under Gaza's Hamas-run government, doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count. Israel's Energy Minister Eli Cohen told right-wing Channel 14 that his ministry will not help rebuild infrastructure in Gaza. “Gaza should remain an island of ruins to the next decades,” he said. The Palestinian Health Ministry said Musallet, from Florida, had been beaten by Israeli settlers. Diana Halum, a cousin, said the attack occurred on his family's land. Israel's military has said Palestinians hurled rocks at Israelis in the area on Friday, lightly wounding two people and setting off a larger confrontation. Palestinians and rights groups have long accused the military of ignoring settler violence. Their bodies were carried through the streets on Sunday as mourners waved Palestinian flags and chanted, “God is great.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump‘s border czar clarified that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers cannot briefly detain suspected illegal immigrants based on physical appearance alone. “Let me be clear: Physical description can't be the sole factor to give you reasonable suspicion,” Tom Homan told CNN on Sunday. Homan earlier this week told Fox News that ICE and other federal officials, including Border Patrol officers, do not need “probable cause to walk up to somebody, briefly detain them, and question them.” But on Sunday, Homan underscored that those comments had been “taken out of context” and reiterated that “physical description cannot be the sole reason to detain and question somebody” or give rise to reasonable suspicion. “It's a myriad of factors,” he said on CNN. But I can tell you this: Every ICE officer goes through Fourth Amendment training every six months and reminded what their authorities are for arrest, detention, and questioning. The issue of possible racial profiling has been in the political spotlight this week after a Los Angeles-area federal judge on Friday ordered that the Trump administration stop conducting raids in which federal officers are allegedly arresting possible illegal immigrants without reasonable suspicion and instead detaining them based on their race, accents, and occupation, in violation of the Fourth Amendment, in addition to not providing them with immediate access to lawyers. On Sunday, Homan added that he “looked forward” to the Justice Department litigating California Central District Court Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong's order, expressing confidence that the Trump administration would win on appeal. In the same interview with CNN, Homan also expressed sadness after a farm worker in California, 57-year-old Jaime Alanis, died on Saturday following a 30-foot fall from a roof during an ICE raid at the cannabis facility where he worked. I mean, no one wants to see people die.” At the same time, Homan defended the ICE officers, contending “they were doing the job” serving criminal arrest warrants as part of an investigation into alleged child trafficking and labor at Glass House Farms facilities in Camarillo and Carpinteria.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hopes had been high for the latest negotiations but after days of negotiations the two sides accused each other of blocking an agreement while on the ground there has been no let-up in Israel's military campaign, which resumed when the last ceasefire collapsed in March. That was before the Israeli airstrike Sunday killed six children and four others at a water distribution point in central Gaza, according to Al-Awda Hospital. Video from the chaotic scene showed multiple casualties including children amid buckets and water carriers. Also in central Gaza on Sunday, at least 12 people were killed and more than 40 injured when an Israeli airstrike targeted a crowded junction, according to Dr. Mohammed Abu Salmiya, Director of Al-Shifa Medical Complex central Gaza City. The dead included a prominent doctor, Ahmad Qandeel, described by the health ministry as “one of Gaza's most respected medical professionals.” Sunday's heavy toll followed several deadly incidents Saturday. The ministry said 27 were killed and many more injured when Israeli troops opened fire on people trying to obtain aid from a distribution site near southern Rafah run by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). GHF denied the claim, saying “there were no incidents at or in the immediate vicinity of our sites” on Saturday. Twenty-five were declared dead on arrival and six more died after being admitted – the largest number of fatalities since the hospital began operations in May 2024, according to the ICRC. Nearly 800 Palestinians were killed while trying to access aid in Gaza between late May and July 7, according to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), when the GHF began operating. Salmiya told CNN that 40 injured people had been admitted. Geolocated video showed at least one child among the victims. The Israel Defense Forces said Sunday it had destroyed weapons and tunnels used by Hamas in northern Gaza and the air force had carried out attacks on more than 150 targets across the Gaza Strip, including “booby-trapped buildings, weapons depots, anti-tank missile and sniper positions.” The spike in casualties in Gaza comes as talks on agreeing a new ceasefire deal and hostage continue in Doha, with optimism having faded that an agreement can be quickly reached. US President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff said Tuesday he was hopeful of a deal by the end of the week. “We had four issues, and now we're down to one after two days of proximity talks,” Witkoff said. The same day Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed Gaza at length at the White House. “We got to get that solved,” Trump said. But despite days of proximity talks in Doha between Israel and Hamas, significant gaps remain between the warring parties. The detailed maps were left to negotiations between Israel and Hamas, and that appears to be the main sticking point. But an Israeli political source told CNN Saturday that “Israel has shown willingness to be flexible in the negotiations” and that “Hamas remains obstinate, sticking to positions that prevent the mediators from advancing an agreement.” Related article Battered but not beaten, Hamas embraces guerilla tactics with deadly force Ben Gvir and finance minister Bezalel Smotrich – the far-right members of Netanyahu's government – have both been vocal critics of any deal with Hamas, instead calling for Israel to cut off aid to Gaza and escalate its war until the militant group is destroyed. Recent opinion surveys in Israel suggest overwhelming approval for a deal that would end the war and return all the hostages, living and dead. Hamas is demanding a pathway to an indefinite cessation of hostilities, with the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.</p>

A bald eagle flies over the Mississippi River toward Wisconsin from Lake City, Minn., prime territory for the newly official U.S. national bird, on Wednesday, July 9, 2025. PRAIRIE ISLAND INDIAN COMMUNITY, Minn. (AP) — Some Native Americans traditionally bestow bald eagle feathers at ceremonies to mark achievements, such as graduations, and as a form of reverence for the bird they hold sacred as a messenger to the Creator. This year, many are doing so with elevated pride and hope. Maybe when the nation looks at the eagle that way, maybe there will be less division,” said Jim Thunder Hawk. This wide, unruffled stretch of water framed by wooded bluffs is prime bald eagle territory. “If you grew up in the United States, eagles were a part of your everyday life,” said Tiffany Ploehn, who as the center's avian care director supervises its four resident bald eagles. A bald eagle, its wings and talons spread wide, has graced the Great Seal of the United States since 1782, and appears on passport covers, the $1 bill, military insignia, and myriad different images in pop culture. Several Minnesota legislators sponsored a bill to remedy that and then-President Joe Biden's signature made it official in December. For many Native Americans, the soaring eagle represents far more; it delivers their prayers to the Creator and even intercedes on their behalf. “My grandma told me that we honor eagles because they saved the Ojibwe people when the Creator wanted to turn on them. The eagle, he can fly high, so he went to speak with the Creator to make things right,” said Sadie Erickson, who is Ojibwe and Mdewakanton Sioux. Erickson and a dozen other high school graduates received a bald eagle feather at an early July celebration by the riverbank at Prairie Island. Thunder Hawk said a prayer in the Dakota language urging the high school graduates and graduates receiving higher education degrees to “always remember who you are and where you come from.” Then they lined up and a relative tied a feather — traditionally on the left side, the heart's side — as tribal members sang and drummed to celebrate them. “It just feels like I went through a new step of life,” said Jayvionna Buck. Growing up on Prairie Island, she recalled her mother excitedly pointing out every eagle. But it's just a special occurrence for us to see,” Buck said. Some Native Americans honor the eagle by taking it as their ceremonial name. In many Native cultures, killing an eagle is “blasphemous,” he said. Historically, Sioux warriors would lure an eagle with rabbit or other food, pluck a few feathers and release it, said Thunder Hawk, who grew up in South Dakota. Today, there's a nationwide program that legally distributes eagle feathers and parts exclusively to tribal members, though it's very backlogged. U.S. wildlife and tribal officials worry that killings and illegal trafficking of eagles for their feathers is on the rise, especially in the West. In Minnesota, eagles are most often harmed by road accidents and eating poison – results of shrinking wildlife habitat that brings them in closer contact with humans, said Lori Arent, interim director of the University of Minnesota's Raptor Center. The center treats about 200 injured bald eagles each year. Of those they can save, most are eventually released back into the wild. Permanently disabled birds that lose an eye or whose wings are too badly fractured to fly are cared for there or at other educational institutions like the Wabasha eagle center. The official designation could help more Americans understand how their behaviors inadvertently harm eagles, Arent said. Fishing or hunting with tackles and ammunition containing lead exposes the eagles eating those fish or deer remains to fatal metal poisoning. It's what leads him to offer sage or dried red willow bark every time he spots one as a “thank you for allowing me to see you and for you to hear my prayers and my thoughts.” “I feel like that kind of shows that we're strong and united as a country,” she said by the Mississippi, her new feather nestled in her hair.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The last time Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) threatened to withhold Democratic votes and force a government shutdown, it ended in a bitter internal feud that, at one point, seemed it might cost him his job. Now, just four months later, Schumer may be headed down a similar path that could spark more Democratic fury. As he tries to stop Republicans from approving a $9.4 billion batch of President Donald Trump's spending cuts, GOP senators see Schumer's threat that Democrats will retaliate by not funding the government this fall as a bluff. Republicans are placing early bets that this latest shutdown talk will lead to the same conclusion: Schumer caving. Democrats see Republicans as the ones picking a funding feud by trying to roll back money Congress has already appropriated for foreign aid programs and public broadcasting. That kind of poisons the well a bit here,” said Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ), a battleground state Democrat also known for his work across the aisle. Still, Schumer remains under immense pressure to show his frustrated base that Democrats are doing whatever they can to combat Trump after blinking first in the prior shutdown showdown and on the heels of Republicans passing the president's marquee One Big Beautiful Bill Act. “It's absurd to expect Democrats to play along with funding the government if Republicans are just going to renege on a bipartisan agreement by concocting rescissions packages behind doors without the customary 60 votes required in the appropriations process,” Schumer said in recent Senate floor remarks. In March, Schumer and nine other Democrats gave Republicans the votes they needed to fund the government out of fear that GOP leaders could have allowed a shutdown to carry on indefinitely. But that didn't stop a Democratic revolt, including demands for Schumer to step down as leader and renewed calls for a more liberal primary challenger in 2028. While many Democrats are behind his latest strategy, there's at least some angst in the party over using a maneuver Schumer has consistently blasted Republicans in the past for threatening. “I refuse to ever vote for anything that would shut the government down. No matter which side may have begun what has quickly descended into another Capitol Hill blame game, Congress has until Oct. 1 to achieve one of two scenarios: pass the annual budget or some sort of funding measure, or face a government shutdown. Schumer has never been a strong supporter of the appropriations process,” Collins said, citing his decision to advance one large bill rather than individual funding bills when he was the majority leader. When the Washington Examiner asked Collins whether she could continue effectively crafting the annual budget despite escalating tensions, Collins pointed to her panel's latest meeting. Lawmakers promised to revisit the subject at a later date.</p>

Former U.K. Defense Ministry official Nick Pope tells Fox News Digital that the declassification of federal secrets and other documents is of very high interest to the American people. Declassified documents revealing a United States military aircraft was previously struck by an unknown flying object is raising eyebrows as experts point to other unexplainable sightings suggesting otherworldly technology flying within the country's airspace. The incident occurred in January 2023, after an unidentified object collided with the left side of an F-16 Viper jet participating in training exercises near Gila Benda, Arizona, an Air Force spokesperson confirmed to Fox News Digital. An initial investigation determined no damage was done to the near $70 million jet, with officials ruling against a possible bird strike. The incident was the first of four encounters with unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) that were reported a day later, according to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) documents obtained by the War Zone. "According to military personnel I've personally met with, there were objects 200 miles off the East Coast that were extensively loitering and had no visible means of propulsion," James Fox, a director specializing in films about UFO activity, told Fox News Digital. The concerning collision comes as the Department of Defense reported 757 incidents involving UAPs from May 1, 2023, to June 1, 2024, according to an unclassified document released by the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office. Of those encounters, 708 occurred in the air, with only 49 instances marked as "case closed" by officials. Additionally, the department received 18 reports regarding UAP incidents near nuclear infrastructure, launch sites and weapons, according to the report. "None of these resolved cases substantiated advanced foreign adversarial capabilities or breakthrough aerospace technologies," the report states. The sightings of UAPs near military sites are nothing new, according to Fox. "There are reports dating back to the 1930s and 1940s," Fox said. "Where you had mysterious, glowing, and orb-like objects that emitted very bright light that could just fly rings around the military planes from World War II." Fox pointed to the sheer advanced technology showcased within these sightings, such as aircraft that do not emit a heat signature or have the ability to fly stationary in high wind conditions. "This has been well-documented for decades," Fox said. Of the 2023 to 2024 reports, 708 occurred in the air, with only 49 instances marked as "case closed" by officials, according to Pentagon documents. In 2020, the Department of Defense established an Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF) to further research and investigate the various UAPs spotted throughout American skies. "The mission of the task force is to detect, analyze and catalog UAPs that could potentially pose a threat to U.S. national security," the department said in a statement. Fox also cited officials' use of updated technology to pinpoint the location and characteristics of UAPs possibly contributing to the influx in reports over recent years. "They've adjusted the frequency on particular radars to pick up smaller objects that maybe have been here all along," Fox said, adding, "it's a global phenomenon exhibiting the technology that's just lightyears ahead from anything we have. Has there been a successful effort in reverse engineering? [If not], then it falls into the category that many would say is non-human intelligence." While a vast majority of UAPs spotted by officials are quickly identified, Fox insists there are a select few that have origins unknown to even the highest of government authorities and do not match the technology owned by the country's adversaries. "A small percentage of these objects display a technology that's just light-years beyond anything that we or anybody else on the planet has," Fox said. "Which would imply, once you do the process of elimination, if it isn't Russia or China, and if it's not us, what's left?" Fox also attributes overall public skepticism regarding UAPs to the U.S. government remaining tight-lipped about its findings over the years. However, officials have continued to work toward transparency with the American public, with a congressional hearing on UFOs occurring for the first time in decades in 2022 and continuing to take place on the floors of Congress. "The primary reason for secrecy is that it's difficult for any governing body to admit that there are structured craft of unknown origin whizzing around with impunity," Fox said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rookie pitcher Jacob Misiorowski has only played five MLB games. But in that short time, the Milwaukee Brewers starlet has produced such impressive performances that he was named a National League All-Star on Friday, an honor he achieved after the fewest MLB games ever. The 23-year-old was named as a replacement for the Chicago Cubs' Matthew Boyd, who will be inactive since he is expected to start on Saturday against the New York Yankees ahead of Tuesday's All-Star Game. Wielding a fastball that has reached speeds as high as 103 mph (166 kph), Misiorowski has long been tipped for All Star honors – the only surprise, perhaps, is just how quickly he achieved that. He only began his MLB career last month, with a streak of 11 no-hit innings, more than any other starter has managed at the start of their career since baseball's modern era began in 1900. On his five starts for Milwaukee, he has gone 4-1 with a 2.81 ERA. Related article Milwaukee Brewers rookie Jacob Misiorowski breaks 125-year-old record with six perfect innings against Minnesota Twins Still, Misiorowski said the call-up left him “speechless,” per MLB. Brewers manager Pat Murphy told him just three minutes before he lined up for the national anthem ahead of their 8-3 win over the Washington Nationals on Friday but told him to keep it a secret. “I honestly have no words guys,” he said. It's an honor and, you know, there's a lot of older guys around that have been around for a lot longer than I have so I just wanted to say thank you for all the help you guys have given me to get through these couple of weeks I've been here, it's been huge.” Misiorowski's selection comes just a year after the Pittsburgh Pirates' Paul Skenes made history by earning All-Star honors 11 games into his MLB career. Elsewhere, Seattle Mariners slugger Cal Raleigh took his season total of home runs to 38, breaking the American League record and putting him just one shy of Barry Bonds' MLB record for the most homers hit before the All-Star break.</p>

Fox News' Chanley Painter reports on a growing rift between FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino and Attorney General Pam Bondi over the handling of the Epstein file release. FBI Director Kash Patel on Saturday squashed rumors of a rift inside the Trump administration's law-and-order team, just hours before the president himself defended Attorney General Pam Bondi amid Jeffrey Epstein probe backlash. The criticism came after the FBI and Department of Justice on Sunday released a memo shutting down theories about an alleged Epstein client list, finding a tell-all document exposing his associates did not exist. 2, Deputy Director Dan Bongino, was considering resigning if Bondi stayed on as head of the Department of Justice, which oversees the FBI. There were unconfirmed reports that Patel might step down as well, but he shot that down with a social media post Saturday, saying "conspiracy theories" about a potential resignation over Bondi's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files "just aren't true." "The conspiracy theories just aren't true, never have been," Patel wrote. "It's an honor to serve the President of the United States @realDonaldTrump — and I'll continue to do so for as long as he calls on me." Trump supporters posted videos to social media Saturday afternoon charring MAGA hats in protest. "What's going on with my ‘boys' and, in some cases, ‘gals?' They're all going after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is doing a FANTASTIC JOB," Trump wrote. "We're on one Team, MAGA, and I don't like what's happening." "They created the Epstein Files, just like they created the FAKE Hillary Clinton/Christopher Steele Dossier that they used on me, and now my so-called ‘friends' are playing right into their hands," Trump wrote. "Why didn't these Radical Left Lunatics release the Epstein Files? If there was ANYTHING in there that could have hurt the MAGA Movement, why didn't they use it?" Jeffrey Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Little St. John. "Let's keep it that way, and not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about," Trump wrote. Rumors about a change in leadership were triggered by Patel's apparent X biography change, where his title as FBI Director was removed to only read, "Fmr Chief of Staff @DeptofDefense." Multiple sources told Fox News Digital Bongino and Bondi butted heads at a White House meeting Wednesday, with Bongino accusing Bondi of a "lack of transparency from the start" in the Epstein files probe. The former Secret Service agent-turned FBI official allegedly raised his voice at Trump's White House chief of staff before storming out, and has since been weighing resignation over the episode, insiders said. Bondi and Patel, however, have presented a united front. Sources close to Bondi claim she has "no intention of stepping down" and the pair are in constant communication. BG Group Demolition crews tear down the Palm Beach home of late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in Palm Beach, Fla. April 20, 2021. "Any attempt to sow division within this team is baseless and distracts from the real progress being made," White House Deputy Press Secretary Harrison Fields told Fox News Digital, emphasizing that Trump's law-and-order lineup is working "seamlessly and with unity." "This work is being carried out seamlessly and with unity. Any attempt to sow division within this team is baseless and distracts from the real progress being made in restoring public safety and pursuing justice for all." The FBI did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. Fox News' David Spunt, Amanda Macias, Jake Gibson, Ashley Oliver and Brie Stimson contributed to this report.
