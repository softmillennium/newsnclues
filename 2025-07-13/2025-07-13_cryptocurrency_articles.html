                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pump.fun's long-anticipated public token sale concluded in a mere 12 minutes, and investors snapped up the full 12.5% of its 1 trillion‑token supply in a quick move. The event raised a total of $500 million from the sale of 125 billion PUMP tokens priced at $0.004, which accounts for 12.5% of the total 1 trillion token supply. The Pump.fun ICO has officially become one of the most explosive token launches of the year after raising $500 million and closing out its sale in just 12 minutes. The Solana-based memecoin launchpad stunned the crypto community this Saturday with an explosive public token sale offering that distributed 125 billion PUMP tokens, which amounts to about 12.5% of the total 1 trillion supply at $0.004 apiece. This complete sale brings the PUMP tokens to a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $4 billion. Investors participated in the ICO by buying directly on the Pump.fun official token website or any of the project's multiple centralized exchanges, which include Bybit, KuCoin, Bitget, Kraken, Gate.io, and MEXC. According to a dashboard on the official website, $448.5 million worth of PUMP tokens were purchased on the website, $5 million worth were purchased on Gate, $30 million worth were purchased on Kraken, and $16.5 million worth of tokens were purchased on KuCoin. Buyers can expect PUMP tokens to be distributed within the next 48 to 72 hours, but transfers will be temporarily disabled during this window. Transfers will be enabled immediately after the distribution is complete. Nonetheless, pre-market activity suggests strong bullish sentiment. The earliest that PUMP could become tradable and accessible for US and UK users is Monday, July 14. Supporters celebrated the event, but not everyone was impressed. One trader reportedly opened a huge short position on Hyperliquid on $PUMP using 2x leverage with $8 million in USDC. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins Coinbase has made a significant move by updating its X account profile to feature a Pudgy Penguins NFT. This change is part of a broader trend in the cryptocurrency market where symbolic engagements often lead to surges in interest and trading activity. The market cap for PENGU also saw volatility, fluctuating between $968 million and $1.85 billion. This social media exchange highlights the strategic branding efforts within the crypto markets, where high-profile endorsements can significantly impact investor sentiment and related assets. Trading activity for Pudgy Penguins NFTs saw a substantial increase, with NFT volume rising by 690% in just 24 hours. This surge in activity suggests both retail and potential institutional engagement, as shifts in investor sentiment often follow such high-profile endorsements. The economic implications of this move are far-reaching, with the potential for long-term growth tied to regulatory developments. Past rallies driven by branding and regulatory interactions suggest that if the ETF gains approval, PENGU could see further gains. These insights underscore the potential ripple effects of large platform actions across the crypto ecosystem, influencing future economic and regulatory dynamics.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum has finally touched the $3,000 price level once again after spending weeks trading in a narrow range beneath $2,800. According to technical analyst Merlijn The Trader, Ethereum's next destination after breaking past $3,000 is already in sight. Bull Flag Breakout Points To Measured Move For Ethereum Ethereum went through an interesting rally last week alongside Bitcoin's push to new all-time highs. However, this Ethereum price rally, which saw it touch $3,000 again, wasn't based on momentum spillover from Bitcoin alone. According to data from SoSoValue, US-based Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a combined $907.99 million in inflows last week, their best week since the products launched in July 2024. Thursday, July 10, alone was highlighted by inflows of $383.10 million, making it the largest single-day inflow for any Ethereum ETF in 2025 so far. In a post shared on the social media platform X, crypto analyst Merlijn pointed to a confirmed bull flag breakout on Ethereum's daily candlestick timeframe chart. The breakout eventually saw Ethereum entering into a tight flag-like consolidation that spanned between May and June, until the most recent breakout above $2,700. This measured move places the next technical level of price interest at $3,834. According to data from on-chain analytics platform Santiment, Ethereum's price action has been dancing around the $3,000 mark since Friday, crossing it multiple times intraday. During this back and forth, 124.13 million ETH out of the 155.04 million total supply crossed into profitability, which represents 79.96% of all tokens. The same data shows Ethereum is just 13 million coins away from matching the total supply in profit at its previous all-time high of profitability recorded in December 2024. This shift toward a profit-heavy network state tends to encourage holding behavior and long-term conviction, which could translate into reduced sell pressure in the coming week. This, in turn, could see Ethereum close a daily candle above $3,000 and move toward the $3,834 price target during the new week.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to CoinDesk Data price information, at 2:20 p.m. UTC on Sunday, the bitcoin BTC$118,758.40 price set a new all-time high of $119, 308, up 1.4% in the past 24-hour period. For example, in a recent interview on CNBC, Fundstrat Capital CIO Thomas Lee said that the demand versus supply imbalance for BTC meant that its price could easily reach anywhere from $150,000 to $250,000 by the end of this year. Meanwhile, on the same day, XLM got as high $0.4815 (at 3:20 p.m. UTC), but currently it is trading at $0.4578, up 22% in the past 24 hours. XLM's performance, although highly impressive, was not a huge shock since on Saturday, it surged 6% to $0.3880, making it the top performer by percent change among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap. As for HBAR, its intraday high of $0.2516 was reached at 3:10 p.m. UTC, but it is currently trading at around $0.2439, up 27% in the past 24 hours, which makes it right now today's top percentage gainer among the top 20 cryptocurrencies. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital noted on X that HBAR's recent 62% surge aligns closely with its 2021 price cycle, suggesting the token could be setting up for a similar breakout pattern. The pseudonymous analyst also pointed out that a modest 2.5% dip in bitcoin's market dominance has already fueled strong rallies across many altcoins. He noted that if such a small decline can trigger outsized altcoin moves, a more substantial drop in dominance — into double-digit territory —could significantly accelerate capital rotation into the altcoin market.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Once the third most populous city in the country, its citizens have long struggled against robber barons, anti-communist witch hunts, private sector looting, and racist housing laws. Now, Outlier reports, the city is doing battle against a $93 million crypto real estate scheme. The city recently announced a massive lawsuit filed against RealToken, a cryptocurrency business that's snapping up hundreds of subsidized housing units to "tokenize" on the blockchain. Once purchased by RealToken, the property is sold to international crypto speculators in tiny increments, a scheme known as "fractional ownership." The exploitative scheme was first uncovered by Outlier, which reported that RealToken properties are plagued by squalid conditions, unresponsive property managers, and arbitrary evictions. Detroit announced the lawsuit after a five-month joint investigation spanning three municipal agencies. "These defendants have profited from our communities while ignoring their most basic legal obligations as landlords and property owners. Though RealToken claims it has no direct interaction with the properties it gobbles up on the blockchain — and therefore had no idea about the state of its properties — Motown isn't hearing it. "The City of Detroit has sent numerous correction orders, emergency correction orders, blight violations and fair warning letters directly to Real Token, which have gone largely unheaded." "Furthermore," the city continues, "RealToken refused to authorize payment for 'even the most basic repairs' with its former property maintenance company, thereby maximizing profits over health, safety, and welfare of Detroit residents." It's a major lawsuit for low-income Detroiters who've become embroiled in the crypto scheme, and a major test for the swelling blockchain real estate industry more broadly. Similar blockchain schemes include companies like Foreclosure Token, which "aims to provide a secure and transparent platform for investors to participate in the distressed real estate market" by offering clients tokenized shares "in foreclosure properties and tax liens." Detroit's press release notes that this is believed to be the "first lawsuit of its kind targeting a blockchain-based property investment platform for nuisance-related violations at scale." "This is not innovation," Detroit councilmember Angela Whitfield Calloway told Outlier.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The sports industry today faces major challenges in transparency, security, and fan loyalty. The global sports market moves billions of dollars annually, traditionally relying on centralized databases vulnerable to fraud. All ticket sales and resales are recorded on a public ledger, eliminating scalping through smart contracts with preset limits. Every sponsorship deal and player transfer is traceable in detail — from contract clauses to payment terms — reducing the risk of disputes. Digital collectibles like fan tokens and NFTs carry immutable metadata certifying their origin, making them impossible to counterfeit. As a result, clubs, sponsors, and fans can verify every transaction with full confidence in its integrity. Fans vote on key decisions (kit designs, marketing campaigns), directly influencing club life. They gain access to exclusive content, VIP experiences, and special promotions, strengthening their sense of belonging. They can trade digital rewards, which fluctuate in value based on demand, creating new income opportunities. Despite its advantages, adopting blockchain in sports comes with three core obstacles: Regulation and privacy: Legal frameworks are needed to balance transparency with personal data protection. FC Barcelona enabled fans to vote on a mural design for the team's locker room, strengthening emotional ties with supporters. UFC allowed fans to help decide fighter bonus payouts, increasing audience involvement. Formula 1 adopted blockchain systems to validate real-time telemetry, improving the reliability of data for teams and commentators. On the other hand, LaLiga, in partnership with CoinW, is decentralizing access to performance statistics, setting a new standard for federations seeking to optimize their processes. Tokenized athlete contracts allowing fans to invest in their idols' future success. Anti-doping systems on blockchain, ensuring immutable records of every test and result. Decentralized leagues managed by the community, where fans take part in both sporting and financial decisions.

Since crypto passed the hype torch to generative AI at the launch of OpenAI's ChatGTP in November 2022, crypto developers have been scrambling to hitch their rickety wagon to the AI rocket ship—searching for the holy grail that would see AI companies somehow adopt blockchain technology. Coinbase's partnership with Perplexity follows a deal between crypto-powered prediction platform Polymarket and Elon Musk's xAI last month. “While we continue to view Coinbase as a ‘Best of Breed' crypto exchange and remain positive on the sector, we believe valuation has outstripped near-term fundamentals following the stock's ~150% rally since its April lows, which we view as overdone,” analyst Mike Colonnese wrote in a note to clients seen by Coindesk. Despite some fears the latest bitcoin price and crypto market might be overdone, bullish bitcoin price predictions are still rolling in. "We expect bitcoin to top $200,000 by the end of year, I think we're going substantially higher from here," Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan told Yahoo Finance, pointing to the friendly bitcoin and crypto policies coming out of the Trump administration and the huge bitcoin buying being done by bitcoin treasury companies and bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thousands of savers face the grim prospect of losing their investments after administrators uncovered a 2 million pounds ($2.7 million) shortfall at Ziglu, a British cryptocurrency fintech that collapsed earlier this year. The company, which suspended withdrawals in May, was placed into special administration last week amid mounting concerns over its financial management, according to a Sunday report from The Telegraph. Ziglu attracted around 20,000 customers with promises of high-interest returns, particularly through its “Boost” product, which offered yields up to 6%. Launched in 2021 during a period of low interest rates, Boost became popular due to its higher returns. Following the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) intervention in May, withdrawals were frozen, leaving savers locked out of their money for weeks. At a recent High Court insolvency hearing, directors were accused of mismanaging funds, with evidence suggesting that money from Boost savers was diverted to cover general cash flow issues before the company applied for special administration in June, per The Telegraph. The report said that around 4,000 customers had their Boost investments frozen, totaling approximately $3.6 million. Ziglu, founded by former Starling Bank co-founder Mark Hipperson, described its mission as “empowering everyone to benefit from the new world of digital money, easily, safely and affordably”. The company was once valued at $170 million and attracted a deal with US fintech giant Robinhood in 2022, which later fell through amid crypto market turmoil. Ziglu's administrators, RSM, will now seek buyers for the company.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This sharp rise comes as global stock markets decline, driven by trade and tariff tensions sparked by US President Donald Trump's tariff notices to over 20 countries. “ The milestone comes amid growing allocations into bitcoin from institutional & corporate treasuries. Strategy Inc & GameStop Corp, have joined the ranks, announcing board‑approved Bitcoin purchases. Sugandha Sachdeva- Founder-SS WealthStreet, believes that Bitcoin is increasingly earning the moniker “digital gold” because, like the yellow metal, it tends to attract capital whenever traditional risk assets wobble. Risk appetite faltered, but Bitcoin after an initial dip to $74,420 rebounded sharply, surging to a record $112,000 in May and still hovering near $111,150. “ With the US dollar retreating against major currencies, investors have migrated toward scarce, non-yielding stores of value. Further, Bitcoin's fixed 21 million-coin supply shields it from the kind of balance-sheet expansion that debases fiat currencies an attribute that resonates as global sovereign debt scales fresh highs. However, the key difference is that central banks continue to diversify into gold, reinforcing its safe-haven pedigree. By contrast, official adoption of Bitcoin remains tentative, suggesting sovereign demand could be a future, rather than current, driver of flows,” Sachdeva said. The post-tariff rally underscores that Bitcoin, despite its higher volatility, is starting to mirror gold's role as a refuge when policy shocks rattle conventional markets. As long as debt overhangs grow and the dollar stays soft, the search for debasement-resistant assets should keep Bitcoin in demand alongside bullion, she added.

In a new interview with CNBC Television, Fold CEO Will Reeves says that the top crypto asset by market cap's recent new all-time high was due to a combination of high institutional demand and low supply. “This is what happens when massive demand meets the finite supply of Bitcoin. And what we're seeing right now is the supply shock in motion. So I'd certainly say what we are seeing is the fundamentals of Bitcoin in play… And so what we are seeing today is the continued march of Bitcoin dominating this entire market… Ultimately, what we've seen is something that can't be reversed.” Bitcoin is trading for $117,613 at time of writing, a sideways move on the day. Meanwhile, Bitcoin dominance, which measures how much of the total crypto market cap belongs to BTC, stands at 64.58%.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Solana-based meme coin launchpad, Pump.fun, has concluded the initial coin offering (ICO) for its native cryptocurrency, PUMP. Although the platform completed the public sale in 12 minutes, there are some controversies surrounding it. When announcing the ICO on July 9, Pump.fun said its native token will have a maximum supply of one trillion. The remaining 15%, accounting for 150 billion PUMP, will be offloaded in a public sale. Users who participated in the public sale will receive their assets within the next 48-72 hours. However, they will not be tradable or transferable till the distribution phase is over. All ICO participants will be able to sell or transfer their PUMP allocations on the first day they become tradable. “We'd like to thank everyone who participated in the sale, whether on pump fun or on one of the participating exchanges, and we look forward to the very bright future of pump fun and the wider Solana ecosystem,” the platform stated. It is worth mentioning that Pump.fun faced a few challenges in the days leading up to the ICO. On July 8, the crypto exchange Gate.io abruptly removed its pre-market listing for PUMP and returned funds to all presale participants. The exchange eventually revealed that its decision stemmed from a discussion it had with the Pump.fun team. Mandy Williams is a full-time reporter at CryptoPotato.
