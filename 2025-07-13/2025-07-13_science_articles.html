                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Milky Way could have many more satellite galaxies than scientists have previously been able to predict or observe, according to new research. Cosmologists at Durham University, UK, used a new technique combining the highest-resolution supercomputer simulations that exist, alongside novel mathematical modelling, predicting the existence of missing "orphan" galaxies. Their findings suggest that there should be 80 or perhaps up to 100 more satellite galaxies surrounding our home galaxy, orbiting at close distances. Most galaxies in the Universe are low-mass dwarf galaxies, the majority of which are satellites orbiting around a more massive galaxy, such as our Milky Way. According to LCDM theory, many more Milky Way companion galaxies should exist than cosmological simulations have so far produced, or astronomers have been able to see. Using their new technique, the Durham researchers were able to track the abundance, distribution, and properties of these Milky Way orphan galaxies - showing that many more Milky Way satellites should exist and be observable today. It is hoped that new advances in telescopes and instruments like the Rubin Observatory LSST camera (which recently saw its first light), will give astronomers the ability to detect these very faint objects, bringing them into our view for the first time. Lead researcher Dr Isabel Santos-Santos, in the Institute for Computational Cosmology, Department of Physics, Durham University, said: "We know the Milky Way has some 60 confirmed companion satellite galaxies, but we think there should be dozens more of these faint galaxies orbiting around the Milky Way at close distances. "One day soon we may be able to see these 'missing' galaxies, which would be hugely exciting and could tell us more about how the Universe came to be as we see it today." The Durham researchers say that even the best existing cosmological simulations (which include gas and star formation, in addition to dark matter) do not have the resolution needed to study galaxies as faint as those astronomers are starting to discover close to the Milky Way. This leads to the artificial disruption of some halos, leaving galaxies "orphaned." The Durham researchers combined cosmological supercomputer simulations with analytical models to overcome these numerical issues. Their results showed that halos of dark matter, which may host a satellite galaxy, have been orbiting around the central Milky Way halo for most of the age of the Universe, leading to the stripping of their dark matter and stellar mass, and rendering them extremely small and faint. As a result, the research predicts that the total number of satellite galaxies - of any brightness - likely to exist around the Milky Way is around 80 or potentially up to 100 more than currently known. The research puts particular emphasis on the approximately 30 newly discovered tiny Milky Way satellite candidates that are extremely faint and small. Scientists are unclear if these are dwarf galaxies embedded in a dark matter halo, or globular clusters, collections of self-gravitating stars. The Durham researchers argue that these objects could be a subset of the faint population of satellite galaxies they predict should exist. Using the laws of physics, solved using a large supercomputer, and mathematical modelling we can make precise predictions that astronomers, equipped with new, powerful telescopes, can test. The Royal Astronomical Society's (RAS) National Astronomy Meeting 2025 (NAM 2025) is being held at Durham University from 7-11 July. Almost a thousand of the world's top astronomers and space scientists will attend NAM which sees researchers present the latest cutting-edge space research alongside outreach events involving schools, artists, industry and the public.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Research often points to exercise as a good way to boost mental health, but a recent study from the University of Georgia suggests that it's not just physical movement that affects mental health. It's how, where and why you exercise that makes the difference. "Historically, physical activity research has focused on how long someone exercises for or how many calories were burned," said Patrick O'Connor, co-author of the study and a professor in the Mary Frances Early College of Education's Department of Kinesiology. "The 'dose' of exercise has been the dominant way researchers have tried to understand how physical activity might influence mental health, while often ignoring whether those minutes were spent exercising with a friend or as part of a game." While research shows that leisure-time physical activity -- like going for a run, taking a yoga class or biking for fun -- correlates with better mental health outcomes, these benefits may vary significantly depending on the environment and circumstances surrounding the activity, according to the researchers. To analyze these factors, the researchers reviewed three types of studies. These included large-scale epidemiological studies that examined health patterns in populations, randomized controlled trials where some groups received exercise treatments and others did not, and a much smaller but growing set of investigations into contextual factors. Multiple studies found that people who engage in regular leisure-time physical activity tend to report lower levels of depression and anxiety. Anecdotes such as these show how context matters even when people are performing a similar exercise dose." Numerous randomized controlled trials also showed that adopting regular exercise routines boosted mental health, especially for individuals with existing mental health disorders. However, these studies were typically based on small, short-term and homogenous samples, so the results likely aren't generalizable to larger, more diverse groups. "The average effects on mental health are small across all the randomized controlled studies of exercise, and that's partly because most of the studies focused on people who were not depressed or anxious -- you do get bigger effects in those studies," added O'Connor. "We're communicating to scientists that larger- and longer-term controlled studies are needed to make a compelling case whether exercise does, or does not, truly impact mental health." The same physical activity can feel very different depending on who the activity was done with, as well as where, when and how. Context can range from peer dynamics and instructor style to external conditions like weather or time of day.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Using tirzepatide and menopause hormone therapy at the same time leads to increased weight loss in postmenopausal women with overweight or obesity compared to use of tirzepatide treatment alone, according to a study presented at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif. To confirm the hypothesis that concurrent menopause hormone therapy enhances the effectiveness of tirzepatide for weight loss in postmenopausal women, researchers conducted a real-world study using the electronic medical records of 120 postmenopausal women over a median duration of 18 months. In addition, a higher percentage of menopause hormone therapy users (45%) also achieved at least 20% total body weight loss, compared to 18% of menopause hormone therapy non-users. "The information garnered through this new study provides important insights to develop more effective and personalized weight management interventions to reduce a postmenopausal woman's risk of overweight and obesity-related health complications," said Maria Daniela Hurtado Andrade, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of medicine and consultant for the Division of Endocrinology at the Mayo Clinic. "This study underscores the urgent need for further research to better understand how obesity medications and menopause hormone therapy work together.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Although age and testosterone levels have long been considered an impetus for men's declining sexual health, our research indicates that these changes more closely correlate with modest increases in blood sugar and other metabolic changes," said Michael Zitzmann, M.D., Ph.D., professor and doctor of medicine at University Hospital in Muenster, Germany. "This means that men can take steps to preserve or revive their reproductive health with lifestyle choices and appropriate medical interventions." Findings indicated that over time hormone levels and semen parameters stayed largely within normal ranges. However, sperm movement and erectile function declined in men with minimally elevated blood sugar levels that were below the 6.5% HbA1c diabetes threshold. "We're hopeful that the information gleaned from this study will help doctors and their patients formulate effective male sexual health maintenance plans," Zitzmann added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The anti-obesity medication tirzepatide, marketed as Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for obesity, reduced obesity-associated breast cancer growth in a mouse model, according to a study being presented at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif. "Obesity is a significant risk factor for breast cancer, and while it is very preliminary data, our studies in mice suggest that these new anti-obesity drugs may be a way to reduce obesity-associated breast cancer risk or improve outcomes," said study author Amanda Kucinskas, B.S., a Ph.D. candidate in the labs of Drs. Erin Giles and Kanakadurga Singer at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Mich. Existing research has shown that having obesity can lead to worse breast cancer outcomes compared to those who do not have obesity, and weight loss can improve outcomes. However, there are many challenges with traditional weight loss methods. The researchers sought to learn whether or not tirzepatide would reduce obesity-associated breast cancer growth. "While these are very preliminary results, they suggest that this new anti-obesity drug may also have a beneficial impact on breast cancer outcomes," Kucinskas said.
