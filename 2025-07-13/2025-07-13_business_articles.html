                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Sunday that whether the Trump administration has the authority to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is "being looked into." "But certainly, if there's cause, he does," Hassett said on ABC News' "This Week" of Trump's authority to remove Powell before his term is up next spring. President Donald Trump has said that he does not want to fire Powell, but Hassett's comments suggest the White House is still considering — and potentially moving towards — the possibility. Top Trump administration officials have escalated their criticisms of Powell in recent days, in particular by targeting the Federal Reserve's $2.5 billion renovation project, which Hassett said has gone over budget by $700 million. Taxpayers are not paying for the renovations. The Fed is self-funded through interest it makes on securities held by the institution and through fees charged banks. Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought last week accused Powell of having "grossly mismanaged the Fed," and said he would seek an investigation into the ongoing project to renovate the Fed's headquarters. Vought's remarks suggested that the Trump administration may be laying the groundwork to find a cause to remove Powell — a frequent target of the Trump administration — before his term is up. In an escalation, Vought sent a list of questions to Powell last week demanding answers about the renovation project. "I think that whether the president decides to push down that road or not is going to depend a lot on the answers that we get to the questions that Russ Vought sent to the Fed," he said. "No new VIP dining rooms are being constructed as part of the project," the FAQs page on the website states, directly responding to one of Vought's questions. While Trump suggested as recently as Friday that he does not want to fire Powell, he has said in recent weeks that he has a few people in mind for the post for when Powell's term expires next May. Hassett is reportedly a top contender to replace Powell. One other possible contender is former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, according to The Wall Street Journal. Warsh was on Fox News' "Mornings with Maria" on Sunday, appearing to subtly pitch himself for the position. "It's lost, lost its way in supervision, it's lost its way in monetary policy, and all this big money on big, fancy buildings is just another indication," he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The business has come a long way from collecting cans, bottles, plastic, newspaper and other consumer disposables, otherwise destined for landfills, to recreate all sorts of new products. Most recently, spent EV batteries, wind turbines and solar panels are fostering a burgeoning recycling niche. The e-waste recycling opportunity isn't limited to rare earth elements. Any electronics that can't be wholly refurbished and resold, or cannibalized for replacement parts needed to keep existing electronics up and running, can berecycled to strip out gold, silver, copper, nickel, steel, aluminum, lithium, cobalt and other metals vital to manufacturers in various industries. But increasingly, recyclers are extracting rare-earth elements, such as neodymium, praseodymium, terbium and dysprosium, which are critical in making everything from fighter jets to power tools. "Recycling [of e-waste] hasn't been taken too seriously until recently" as a meaningful source of supply, said Kunal Sinha, global head of recycling at Swiss-based Glencore, a major miner, producer and marketer of metals and minerals — and, to a much lesser but growing degree, an e-waste recycler. "A lot of people are still sleeping at the wheel and don't realize how big this can be," Sinha said. Traditionally, U.S. manufacturers purchase essential metals and rare earths from domestic and foreign producers — an inordinate number based in China — that fabricate mined raw materials, or through commodities traders. But with those supply chains now disrupted by unpredictable tariffs, trade policies and geopolitics, the market for recycled e-waste is gaining importance as a way to feed the insatiable electrification of everything. "So there's a great opportunity to actually have the tariffs be an impetus for greater recycling in this country for goods that we don't have, but are buying from other countries." Although recycling contributes only around $200 million to Glencore's total EBITDA of nearly $14 billion, the strategic attention and time the business gets from leadership "is much more than that percentage," Sinha said. "We believe that a lot of mining is necessary to get to all the copper, gold and other metals that are needed, but we also recognize that recycling is going to play a huge role," he said. The facility processes mostly mined copper concentrates, though 15% of its feedstock is recyclable materials, such as e-waste that Glencore's global network of 100-plus suppliers collect and sort. The smelted copper is refined into fresh slabs that are sold to manufacturers and traders. The same facility also produces refined gold, silver, platinum and palladium recovered from recycling feeds. The importance of copper to OEMs' supply chains was magnified in early July, when prices hit an all-time high after President Trump said he would impose a 50% tariff on imports of the metal. The U.S. imports just under half of its copper, and the tariff hike — like other new Trump trade policies — is intended to boost domestic production. It takes around three decades for a new mine in the U.S. to move from discovery to production, which makes recycled copper look all the more attractive, especially as demand keeps rising. According to estimates by energy-data firm Wood Mackenzie, 45% of demand will be met with recycled copper by 2050, up from about a third today. Foreign recycling companies have begun investing in the U.S.-based facilities. Last year, another German firm, Aurubis, started construction on an $800-million multi-metal recycling facility in Augusta, Georgia. In 2022, a record 62 million metric tons of e-waste were produced globally, up 82% from 2010, according to the most recent estimates from the United Nations' International Telecommunications Union and research arm UNITAR. That number is projected to reach 82 million metric tons by 2030. Yet only about 15-20% of it is properly recycled, a figure that illustrates the untapped market for e-waste retrievables. "We're definitely seeing a bit of an influx of [e-waste] coming into our warehouses," said Full Circle Electronics CEO Dave Daily, adding, "I think that is due to some early refresh cycles." That's a reference to businesses and consumers choosing to get ahead of the customary three-year time frame for purchasing new electronics, and discarding old stuff, in anticipation of tariff-related price increases. Daily also is witnessing increased demand among downstream recyclers for e-waste Full Circle Electronics can't refurbish and sell at wholesale. Recyclers harvest those items for metals and rare earths, which continue to go up in price on commodities markets, before reentering the supply chain as core raw materials. Even before the Trump administration's efforts to revitalize American manufacturing by reworking trade deals, and recent changes in tax credits key to the industry in Trump's tax and spending bill, entrepreneurs have been launching e-waste recycling startups and developing technologies to process them for domestic OEMs. In response to that imbalance, "There seems to be a trend of nationalizing e-waste, because people suddenly realize that we have the same metals [they've] been looking for" from overseas sources, he said. "People have been rethinking the global supply chain, that they're too long and need to be more localized." Several startups tend to focus on a particular type of e-waste. Lately, rare earths have garnered tremendous attention, not just because they're in high demand by U.S. electronics manufacturers but also to lessen dependence on China, which dominates mining, processing and refining of the materials. In the production of rare-earth magnets — used in EVs, drones, consumer electronics, medical devices, wind turbines, military weapons and other products — China commands roughly 90% of the global supply chain. In April, China restricted exports of seven rare earths and related magnets in retaliation for U.S. tariffs, a move that forced Ford to shut down factories because of magnet shortages. China, in mid-June, issued temporary six-month licenses to certain major U.S. automaker suppliers and select firms. Exports are flowing again, but with delays and still well below peak levels. Before this past week's Trump administration deal, the Biden administration awarded $45 million in funding to MP Materials and the nation's lone rare earths mine, in Mountain Pass, California. The project, owned by Australia's Dateline Resources, will potentially become America's second rare earth mine after Mountain Pass. Meanwhile, several recycling startups are extracting rare earths from e-waste. In April, hard drive manufacturer Western Digital announced a collaboration with Microsoft, Critical Materials Recycling and PedalPoint Recycling to pull rare earths, as well as copper, gold, aluminum and steel, from end-of-life drives. Canadian-based Cyclic Materials invented a process that recovers rare-earths and other metals from EV motors, wind turbines, MRI machines and data-center e-scrap. The company is investing more than $20 million to build its first U.S.-based facility in Mesa, Arizona. Late last year, Glencore signed a multiyear agreement with Cyclic to provide recycled copper for its smelting and refining operations. Another hot feedstock for e-waste recyclers is end-of-life lithium-ion batteries, a source of not only lithium but also copper, cobalt, nickel, manganese and aluminum. It's too soon to know how that might impact battery recyclers — including Ascend Elements, American Battery Technology, Cirba Solutions and Redwood Materials — who themselves qualify for the 45X and other tax credits. They might actually be aided by other provisions in the budget bill that benefit a domestic supply chain of critical minerals as a way to undercut China's dominance of the global market. Nonetheless, that looming uncertainty should be a warning sign for e-waste recyclers, said Sinha. "Be careful not to build a recycling company on the back of one tax credit," he said, "because it can be short-lived." Investing in recyclers can be precarious, too, Sinha said. While he's happy to see recycling getting its due as a meaningful source of supply, he cautions people to be careful when investing in this space. Startups may have developed new technologies, but lack good enough business fundamentals. The Toronto-based startup had broken ground on a new facility in Rochester, New York, but ran into financial difficulties and filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in May, prompting Glencore to submit a "stalking horse" credit bid of at least $40 million for the stalled project and other assets. Even so, "the current environment will lead to more startups and investments" in e-waste recycling, Sinha said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

Emergency crews in central Texas suspended their search for victims of recent catastrophic flooding as another night of heavy rain touched off new flash flood warnings. 

The Kerr County Sheriff's Office ordered volunteers, equipment and vehicles to vacate the area around Guadalupe River as water is expected to rise, it said on its Facebook page. Highway 39 in the area has been closed to all vehicles except residents and emergency personnel. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Optimism about the strong growth opportunities presented by the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom has been tempered by tariff-related distractions and macroeconomic challenges. Against this uncertain backdrop, investors looking for consistent income can add attractive dividend-paying stocks to their portfolios, and studying top Wall Street analysts can offer useful insights into picking the right dividend payers. Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance In a research note on the third-quarter update on RBC Capital's Top 30 Global Ideas for 2025, analyst Scott Hanold reiterated a buy rating on ConocoPhillips with a price target forecast of $115. The analyst expects COP to outperform its large-cap exploration and production peers. The analyst believes that ConocoPhillips is well-positioned to generate competitive free cash flow (FCF) through various commodity price cycles. Hanold highlighted that the company has a global and diversified asset base, which gives it spending flexibility to deliver industry-leading shareholder returns through economic and commodity price cycles. Moreover, Hanold expects ConocoPhillips' vast position in the Permian basin to enable greater FCF generation, while providing asset diversity and development flexibility. He noted that the company has a low break-even point of below $40/bbl (WTI), where it can fund its production maintenance capital and dividends. The analyst also noted COP's solid balance sheet, which allows it to enhance shareholder value. 12 among more than 9,800 analysts tracked by TipRanks. See ConocoPhillips Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks. U.S. Bancorp (USB) is another stock that is a part of RBC Capital's list of Top 30 Global Ideas for 2025. It is the parent company of the U.S. Bank and offers customers financial services through a diversified mix of businesses, including consumer banking, commercial banking and wealth management, among others. RBC analyst Gerard Cassidy reaffirmed a buy rating on USB stock with a 12-month price target of $50. He highlighted several positives supporting his bullish stance, including the bank's new leadership. Cassidy noted that Gunjan Kedia, who succeeded Andy Cecere as the CEO of U.S. Bancorp in April 2025, has reiterated the company's financial goals, including a target of delivering more than 200 basis points of operating leverage. Cassidy also highlighted that USB has consistently been one of the best-performing banks in the U.S., as reflected in an attractive compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in shareholder return generated over the past 20 years. That growth is mainly driven by the bank's focus on increasing its tangible book value and dividends per share. Notably, U.S. Bancorp has consistently returned as much as 80% of its earnings every year through stock buybacks and dividends. Cassidy also cited USB's strong asset quality and underwriting skills. The long-time analyst  believes that "following general underperformance over the last two years, USB is at an inflection point in 2025 where headwinds are becoming tailwinds." 24 among more than 9,800 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Finally, dividend-paying technology company HP (HPQ) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.2894 per share last month, payable on October 1, the fourth dividend in the company's fiscal year 2025. Despite tariffs and other ongoing challenges, Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated a buy rating on HPQ stock with a price target of $29. Following an investor webinar with HP's chief enterprise officer Ernest Nicolas, the analyst highlighted key takeaways supporting his bullish stance. Daryanani noted that HP is successfully diversifying and is on track to achieve its target of manufacturing 90% of all U.S.-bound products outside China. Much of the manufacturing will remain in Asia and take place in countries such as Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia, along with some planned in Mexico. The analyst added that HP is attempting to close the gap with rivals by adopting a multi-site approach to manufacturing and optimizing its supply chain. HP expects the "tariff environment to remain fluid," but management believes the company is now better equipped to face tariff-related challenges, Daryanani said. HP also remains focused on generating $2 billion in gross annual run-rate savings from its Future Ready cost savings plan, the analyst said. The plan includes various initiatives, including internal artificial intelligence tools that could drive productivity and efficiencies. 174 among more than 9,800 analysts tracked by TipRanks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week, we put a big question to BI readers: Can millennial dads really have it all? Many fathers told us they're feeling burned out trying to excel at work and be fully present at home. As a dad of two young kids, I do my best to be an active, present, and equal parenting partner. But I also see, every day, just how much of the heavy lifting my wife does. What's your take on the millennial dad paradox? Is true balance possible—or just a myth we're still chasing? But first: Side hustle tips from the pros. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Kathleen Elkins is the kind of journalist who preaches what she covers. She's been writing for years about real estate investing, e-commerce entrepreneurs, and side hustles. She has taken this coverage and put it to practical use: Last year, she started her own business selling pickleball paddles online. Kathleen recently profiled an exclusive group of Amazon sellers making seven figures in annual revenue. (No, she's not a member — maybe one day!) I sat down with Kathleen to learn more about these entrepreneurs and how they achieved their success. How did you find out about this niche community of thriving Amazon sellers? A previous source who I keep in touch with is super ingrained in the Amazon seller community and suggested I talk to one of the cofounders of Million Dollar Sellers. She put us in touch, we set up an intro call, and I pretty immediately knew that I wanted to proceed with a story about the community and how one gets into the exclusive club. What is it like to be a member of this club? How does one get into it, and what are the benefits? He knows how difficult and lonely it can feel at times to sell to faceless customers, and the in-person events help him get fired up and gain positive momentum. After writing about e-commerce entrepreneurs for years, I decided to give it a go myself, mostly out of curiosity: Can anyone — including a journalist with some savings and a couple of free hours after work — make money selling things online? Turns out, a lot of time and effort. I'll leave you with two takeaways: One, I'm going to have to spend money on Amazon ads. Two, keep talking to people in the e-commerce space who know what they're doing and get curious. As Eugene told me, "It's all about putting yourself in a room with people that are smarter than you." For months, mass DOGE layoffs were stalled as a legal battle between the White House and advocacy groups played out. Most used words like "fear," "uncertainty," "disheartening," and "bleak" to describe the mood within their agencies. "I can't see any of this ending well." When the Sequoia Capital partner called NYC mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani an "Islamist," it made national news and prompted two open letters. Instead of an apology or deleted tweet, however, Maguire only doubled down on his comments. Top investors have learned they can be loud, bold, and polarizing, and it won't impact their ability to secure deals. Though the financial industry isn't the obvious target of Trump's immigration crackdown, its effects are still being felt across hiring, travel, and dealmaking. Lawyers, executives, and business leaders told BI how Trump's border policy is changing their daily lives, from amending the language they use at the border to scrutinizing immigration compliance in M&A deals. The search and cloud giant keeps salary data confidential. However, publicly available work visa data filed with the US Labor Department offers a glimpse of how much it pays certain roles. Google has hired thousands of software engineers through this process. The BI Today team: Steve Russolillo, chief news editor, in New York. Amanda Yen, associate editor, in New York.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Marc Benioff said that while artificial intelligence is drastically reshaping Salesforce, it doesn't mean that it will wipe out white-collar workers. "That isn't how I see AI," Benioff, Salesforce's CEO, told Atlantic CEO Nicholas Thompson during a recent onstage interview at the 2025 AI for Good Global Summit. But in the AI I have, it's not going to be some huge mass layoff of white-collar workers, it is a radical augmentation of the workforce." Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who was not mentioned directly during Benioff's appearance, has said AI may eliminate half of entry-level, white-collar jobs within the next five years. People need to get past this type of general "fear," Benioff said. So, I think we need to somehow shed the fear of what that all means." For his own company, Benioff says he's paused Salesforce's hiring of engineers, lawyers, and customer service agents for the year so the company can "let AI productivity really take hold." "Right now, for engineering organization, because of the incredible productivity opportunity, for AI in engineering this year, let's take some time to actually incorporate that in so we're not focused on hiring another thousand, 2,000, 3,000 engineers," he said. That's likely because, in his view, we're on the edge of "a radical explosion in small and medium businesses." "You're just going to see a lot more SMBs and a lot more general business and mid-market business, because their capabilities are radically amplified by the AI," he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese arrived in Shanghai on Saturday for a six-day visit to three Chinese cities where regional security tensions and economic ties are likely to dominate talks. Albanese's second visit to China, where he will meet President Xi Jinping, comes after Canberra stepped up screening of Chinese investment in critical minerals and as U.S. President Donald Trump rattles the global economy with sweeping import tariffs. Here is a timeline of relations between Australia and China over recent years: Dec. 5, 2017 - Australia, concerned about Chinese influence, announces a ban on foreign political donations to prevent external interference in its politics. Aug. 23, 2018 - Australia bans Huawei Technologies from supplying equipment for its planned 5G broadband network, citing national security regulations. China's then ambassador to Australia says that in response to the call, the Chinese public would boycott Australian wine, beef and tourism. June 9, 2020 - China urges students going overseas to think carefully before choosing Australia, citing racist incidents, threatening a $27.5 billion market for educating foreign students. August 2020 - Australian citizen Cheng Lei, a business anchor for Chinese state television in Beijing, is detained. Nov 27, 2020 - China announces temporary anti-dumping tariffs on Australian wine. Shipments of Australian live lobsters, timber and barley are also blocked or restricted around this time. China's embassy lists 14 grievances with Australia, including the blocking of 10 Chinese investments on national security grounds. May 22, 2022 - Australia's Labor Party, led by Albanese, wins the general election ending almost a decade of conservative rule. Jan. 3, 2023 - China allows three government-backed utilities and its top steelmaker to resume coal imports from Australia. Oct. 11, 2023 - China releases Australian journalist Cheng Lei after three years in a Beijing prison on national security charges. Oct. 22, 2023 - China agrees to review dumping tariffs of 218% on Australian wine. Nov. 6-7, 2023 - Visiting Beijing, Albanese tells Xi and Premier Li Qiang that a strong relationship between the two countries was "beneficial into the future". Xi says stable bilateral ties served each other's interests and both countries should expand their cooperation. Jan. 18, 2024 - Australia rejects comments by China's ambassador seeking to deflect blame from China's navy for the injury of Australian military divers in an incident near Japan in November. March 29, 2024 - China lifts tariffs on Australian wine, triggering a surge in imports. Dec. 12, 2024 - Australia strikes rugby league funding deal with Papua New Guinea that is contingent on its Pacific Islands neighbour rejecting security or policing ties with China. Feb. 21, 2025 - Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong raises concerns with Chinese counterpart over inadequate notice given by the Chinese navy of a live-fire exercise in international waters between Australia and New Zealand that forced airlines to divert flights. May 3, 2025 - Albanese's Labor government is re-elected for a second term in national elections. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Earnings season always seems to roll around with alarming frequency. The newsroom approaches each quarter with a nervous energy, but this summer it feels especially heightened. Recent market records in both the U.S. and Europe, alongside an unpredictable economic environment, paint a complicated picture for the second half. It all kicks off on Tuesday with America's banking behemoths, as attention switches from the White House back to Wall Street. But U.S. President Donald Trump's policies still loom large, with Goldman Sachs predicting that, this quarter, U.S. earnings will start to show the impact of the tariffs. Earnings-per-share growth is also set to come under pressure, with Goldman suggesting, "the consensus estimate among analysts sees S&P 500 companies' earnings-per-share growth decelerating to 4% this quarter relative to the same quarter last year — down from 12% in the first quarter." With the banks set to dominate next week — JPMorgan, Citi, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America are all reporting within just two days — maybe Europe can provide some optimism. As reported by CNBC's Jenni Reid, European banks just recorded their best first half since 1997. Gains were driven by strong investment banking returns — something their U.S. counterparts are also likely to capitalize on — as well as stock rallies based on both deal speculation and actual M&A. As someone who grew up in Cape Town, seeing this year's G20 meetings take place in South Africa makes me pine for the sunshine of the Southern hemisphere. Next week's meeting in Durban between finance ministers and central bank governors comes at an interesting time for the country. An Oval Office meeting between South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and Trump went spectacularly wrong back in May, when the latter, flanked by his South African (now former) right-hand man Elon Musk, made false claims of a "white genocide." South Africa is also subject to a new 30% tariff rate, the only country in sub-Saharan Africa to be singled out in the latest round of announcements. It does not bode well for the G20 Leaders meeting, due to be held in Gauteng on Nov. 22-23. It remains to be seen if Trump will attend. In May, South Africa's golfing greats — who traveled to the White House with Ramaphosa — failed to win over Trump. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>
