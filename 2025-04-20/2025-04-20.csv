Pope Francis gave the traditional Easter blessing on Sunday, appearing from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica in front of delighted crowds after a brief meeting with Vice President JD Vance in what marks his highest-profile appearance yet since being discharged from hospital.
    


            The 88-year-old pontiff has not led the main Holy Week and Easter services but has made brief appearances over the Easter weekend, including spending 30 minutes at a prison in Rome on Thursday and a visit to St. Peter's Basilica on Saturday evening.
    


            Francis, who spent 38 days in hospital with double pneumonia where he came close to death, is unable to speak for long periods due to his respiratory difficulties and is undergoing physiotherapy to help regain his voice. The pope also has difficulty raising his arms.
    


            But on Easter Sunday he was able to offer the “Urbi et Orbi” blessing to the “City [of Rome] and to the World” while an aide read his address. Only the pope can offer this blessing which includes the offer of an indulgence, a remission for the effect of sins.
    


            His voice sounded weak but he appeared without the nasal canula he has been wearing to receive oxygen as he said “Brothers and Sisters, Happy Easter.”
    


            He later greeted cheering crowds in St. Peter's Square from the popemobile, the first time he has done so since his hospitalization.
    


            Before giving the blessing, the pope had a brief private meeting with Vice President Vance, a devout Catholic, which “provided an opportunity to exchange Easter greetings” according to the Vatican.
    


            The vice president also met with senior Vatican officials on Saturday for talks following sharp criticism by the Pope of the Trump administration's immigration policy.
    


            The Vatican said that during the meeting an “exchange of opinions” took place concerning migrants, refugees, and prisoners.
    


            Vance's office later released its own readout, which stated that the vice president and Cardinal Pietro Parolin discussed “their shared religious faith, Catholicism in the United States, the plight of persecuted Christian communities around the world, and President Trump's commitment to restoring world peace.”

            Just before he was hospitalized in mid-February, Francis issued a rebuke of the Trump administration's immigration policy and refuted the vice president's use of a theological concept, the “ordo amoris” (“order of love” or “order of charity”), to defend the administration's approach.
    


            Since his discharge from hospital last month the pope has been making surprise appearances and has shown a determination to resume his duties. Doctors have advised him to avoid large crowds during his two months recovery period.
    


            The Vatican also released the text of the Pope's Easter Sunday message where Francis appealed for an end to conflicts across the world, particularly in Gaza. He lamented the “death and destruction” taking place which had created “a dramatic and deplorable humanitarian situation.”
    


            Francis said: “I appeal to the warring parties: call a ceasefire, release the hostages and come to the aid of a starving people that aspires to a future of peace!”

            DHL Express, a division of Germany's Deutsche Post, said it would suspend global business-to-consumer shipments worth over $800 to individuals in the United States from April 21, as US customs regulatory changes have lengthened clearance.
    


            The notice on the company website was not dated, but its metadata showed it was compiled on Saturday.
    


            DHL blamed the halt on new US customs rules which require formal entry processing on all shipments worth over $800. The minimum had been $2,500 until a change on April 5.
    


            DHL said business-to-business shipments would not be suspended but could face delays. Shipments under $800 to either businesses or consumers were not affected by the changes.
    


            The move is a temporary measure, the company said in its statement.
    


            DHL said last week in response to Reuters questions that it would continue to process shipments from Hong Kong to the United States “in accordance with the applicable customs rules and regulations” and would “work with our customers to help them understand and adapt to the changes that are planned for May 2.”
    


            That came after Hongkong Post said last week it had suspended mail services for goods sent by sea to the United States, accusing the US of “bullying” after Washington canceled tariff-free trade provisions for packages from China and Hong Kong.

Israel is considering a “limited strike” on Iran's nuclear facilities in the coming months, despite Washington's refusal to support military action, Reuters reported on Saturday, citing sources familiar with the matter. The deliberations come as the second round of US-Iran negotiations have concluded in Rome, with expert-level talks expected to continue on April 26 in Oman.

According to Reuters, Israeli officials are weighing a “limited strike” that would require minimal US support – unlike the larger and prolonged bombing campaign previously under consideration.

West Jerusalem reportedly presented Washington with several strike options, “including some with late spring and summer timelines.” A senior Israeli official told the outlet that no final decision had been made.

On Wednesday, The New York Times reported that US President Donald Trump had rejected an Israeli proposal for “extensive” strikes, opting instead to pursue diplomacy.

“I'm not in a rush to do it, because I think that Iran has a chance to have a great country and to live happily without death, and I'd like to see that. That's my first option,” Trump told reporters on Thursday.

A senior Iranian security official told Reuters that Tehran had “intelligence from reliable sources that Israel is planning a major attack on Iran's nuclear sites.”

Iranian officials have previously vowed to retaliate against any form of aggression.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Saturday that the talks in Rome “were held in a constructive environment.” A US official told CBS News that the sides had “made very good progress.”

Trump abandoned the 2015 UN-backed nuclear deal during his first term in office, accusing Iran of secretly violating the agreement. He reimposed sanctions on Tehran and, in February, formally renewed his “maximum pressure” campaign. Iran has denied any wrongdoing but has since rolled back its commitments under the deal, increasing uranium enrichment.

MOSCOW, April 20. /TASS/. The European Union is openly willing to resume the European Nazi ideology, Russian Foreign Ministry Sergey Lavrov said commenting on threats to leaders of countries over the Victory Day visit to Russia.

""There is no such a word to describe this notion. It is, indeed, I'm not ironical now, incomprehensible how the European Union is openly willing to resume the European Nazi ideology,"" he said in an interview with VGTRK journalist Pavel Zarubin who posted it on his Telegram channel.

The European Union's intention to establish a coalition on sending troops to Ukraine demonstrates a superiority intention, the minister said as he warned against using such a language when speaking with Moscow.

""The coalition of apparently those wishing this very feeling of their own superiority, own ability to decide as they want, without listening to and absolutely ignoring other views.

President's attack on universities echoes efforts by Reagan and McCarthy – but experts say ‘we're seeing much worse'

The showdown between Donald Trump and Harvard University may have exploded into life this week, but the battle represents just the latest step in what has been a decades-long war waged by the right wing on American academia.

It's a fight by conservatives that dates back to Ronald Reagan, the hitherto spiritual leader of the Republican party, all the way to McCarthyism and beyond, experts say, as the rightwing scraps to seize more control in a manner that is “part of a standard playbook of authoritarianism”.

Trump reacted furiously this week after the president of Harvard University, the US's oldest, richest and most prestigious college, refused to acquiesce to demands that would have given the government control over whom it hired and admitted, and what it taught.

But the anger wasn't just that Harvard had refused to roll over. It was that the move represented, for the time being, a step back for the Trump administration in what some believe is part of a wider attempt to overhaul US democracy at large.

“It's as dangerous as anything I've ever experienced in my lifetime,” said Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors.

“They're attempting to undermine and destabilize and ultimately control higher education. And at one level, it's an assault on higher education, at another level, it could be seen as prevalent to a full-on assault on democracy. So I think this is a threat to the future of the United States of America, and because of this country's role in the world, a threat to the entirety of the globe at this moment.”

The government said on Monday it planned to freeze $2.2bn in grants and $60m in multi-year contract value to Harvard, hours after Alan Garber, the university president, said Harvard would not accept a series of demands made by the Trump administration. The demands included appointing a White House-approved external body to “to audit the student body, faculty, staff, and leadership for viewpoint diversity”, and that Harvard “immediately shutter all diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs”.

Garber said the government's edicts “represent direct governmental regulation” of the school's independence and constitutional rights.

“No government – regardless of which party is in power – should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,” Garber wrote in an open letter, which was hailed by the left and by college professors concerned at the capitulation of other schools.

Yet, as evidenced by Trump's emotional post on Wednesday, the government's assault on universities is unlikely to stop anytime soon, particularly if he is to emulate the kind of strongman leaders, such as the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, he has praised in the past.

“[People in the Trump administration] have read their history, and they know that authoritarian regimes often target higher education as an independent sector and society, and aim to undermine it because of its role in creating an educated populace that could stand up to all forms of authoritarian rule,” Wolfson said.

“And so this is part of a standard playbook of authoritarianism: to attack and to attempt to control or destroy higher education.”

The move against universities has echoes of the efforts by the Wisconsin senator Joseph McCarthy in the middle of the 20th century to root out people he accused of being communists and Marxists. And like McCarthy, Trump's efforts – led by a group of loyalists including the White House deputy chief of staff and head of policy, Stephen Miller – go beyond just universities. Trump has targeted some of the biggest law firms in the US with executive orders, prompting many to cave and pledge hundreds of millions of dollars of pro bono work to causes backed by the Trump administration.

“The Trump administration is following the playbook of totalitarian dictatorships elsewhere in the world. It is trying to use the force of law to intimidate independent civic society organizations, so that opposition to its policies is impossible,” said Steven Pinker, a psychology professor at Harvard and co-chair of the university's Council on Academic Freedom.

“This new incarnation of the American right wing, with complete fealty to a single man, and an unprecedented attempt to disable civic society institutions like law firms and universities, is quite extraordinary.”

The Trump administration has framed its move on Harvard and other colleges as an effort to crackdown on antisemitism, following protests against Israel's war on Gaza, and as a move against alleged civil rights violations on campus. Few outside of the rightwing sphere see that as a good faith argument.

“As a Jewish faculty member, I'm sensitive to antisemitism on campus, and it does exist and it should be combated. But the claim that Harvard is a bastion of antisemitism is just wild hyperbole. Three of our last four presidents who've served longer than a year have been Jewish. The fourth was married to a Jewish professor,” Pinker said.

Harvard has found itself in the Trump administration's crosshairs because of its status as the best known of America's universities, one of the eight esteemed Ivy League schools. Thousands of influential figures across politics, media and business attended Harvard's grand campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts; many of those who didn't go to Harvard still tend to take an interest in its affairs.

“We've got between 4,000 and 5,000 higher education institutions in the US. The Ivys always make headlines. The major cultural commentators in this country are obsessed with the Ivys, and have been for a long time. These are things that sell papers, they get a lot of clicks and a lot of attention,” said Lauren Lassabe Shepherd, a historian of US colleges and universities and author of Resistance from the Right: Conservatives and the Campus Wars.

“The other thing, too, is what happens at your regional state public flagship university often follows from the trends that are set at the Ivys. Not only do they generate a lot of headlines, they are influential in that way.”

Just as Harvard's existence predates the founding of the US, rightwing antipathy towards universities has been brewing for a long time. When Ronald Reagan was running for governor of California in 1966, he used anger towards anti-Vietnam student protesters for political gain: one of his main campaign strands was a promise to “clean up the mess at Berkeley” – the state's flagship university.

Reagan's tactics bear echoes of Trump's. Ray Colvig, UC Berkeley's chief public information officer at the time, told the university's news service years later that Reagan “wanted to establish a special process to select faculty in several disciplines”.

“In other words, he wanted to set a political standard for appointing faculty members. This idea was widely opposed, and it went away,” Colvig said.

Reagan wasn't the first to take on the universities. Shepherd said efforts to set up rival, conservative universities, date back to the 1920s, while McCarthy's war on higher education came later. Ellen Schrecker, a historian and author of No Ivory Tower: McCarthyism and the Universities, wrote in the Nation recently that the Trump administration's efforts were “worse than McCarthy”, and Shepherd said Trump's attacks were “much more accelerated” than the communist-paranoid senator's tactics.

“McCarthyism, in the 1940s and 50s, the idea was to identify specific professors, hardly ever students, always faculty, and have them fired. Today, we're seeing much worse than that. These are attacks on entire programs and departments. So entire departments like Black studies or DEI initiatives. It's also not just relegated to the professors. We're seeing students with their visas revoked being literally plucked off the streets,” Shepherd said.

Trump hasn't just targeted Harvard. Columbia caved to a series of demands from the Trump administration in March, as a pre-condition for restoring $400m in federal funding, while the White House has announced funding freezes to other schools including Brown, Northwestern, Princeton and Cornell.

Harvard taking a stand is one of the first signs of a fight back – even if it came after it was reported in March that the leaders of the university's center for Middle Eastern studies were forced out, a move seen by critics as an attempt to appease Trump – and academics and others hope it could begin a resistance. It is likely to require a group effort to avoid the right wing's goal for higher education in the US: universities that are in effect government-controlled, and where freedom of speech and thought is restricted.

“The right don't want students to hear about the legacy to slavery. They don't want them to hear about structural inequalities,” Shepherd said.

“They don't want to hear why billionaires are bad. They don't want to hear, from the sciences, about climate change. They want a nice, friendly experience where the most students ever get to debate is the differences in Aristotle and Plato.

“They don't want the actual debates that we see unfolding on campuses today.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Don Pettit became septuagenarian hurtling towards Earth after seven-month mission at International Space Station

Cake, gifts and a low-key family celebration may be how many senior citizens celebrate their 70th birthday.

But Nasa's oldest serving astronaut, Don Pettit, became a septuagenarian while hurtling towards Earth in a spacecraft to wrap up a seven-month mission onboard the International Space Station (ISS).

A Soyuz capsule carrying the American and two Russian cosmonauts landed in Kazakhstan on Sunday, Pettit's birthday.

“Today at 0420 Moscow time (0120 GMT), the Soyuz MS-26 landing craft with Alexei Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and Donald (Don) Pettit aboard landed near the Kazakh town of Zhezkazgan,” Russia's space agency Roscosmos said.

Spending 220 days in space, Pettit, Ovchinin and Vagner orbited the Earth 3,520 times and completed a journey of 93.3m miles over the course of their mission.

It was the fourth spaceflight for Pettit, who has logged more than 18 months in orbit during his 29-year career.

The trio touched down in a remote area south-east of Zhezkazgan in Kazakhstan at 6.20am (0120 GMT) after undocking from the space station just over three hours earlier.

Nasa images of the landing showed the small capsule parachuting down to Earth with the sunrise as a backdrop. The astronauts gave thumbs-up gestures as rescuers carried them from the spacecraft to an inflatable medical tent.

Nasa said in a statement that Pettit was “doing well and in the range of what is expected for him following return to Earth”.

He was then set to fly to the Kazakh city of Karaganda before boarding a Nasa plane to the agency's Johnson Space Center in Texas.

The astronauts spent their time on the ISS researching areas such as water sanitisation technology, plant growth under various conditions and fire behaviour in microgravity, Nasa said.

The trio's seven-month trip was just short of the nine months that the Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams unexpectedly spent on the orbital lab after the spacecraft they were testing suffered technical issues and was deemed unfit to fly them back to Earth.

Space is one of the final areas of US-Russia cooperation amid an almost complete breakdown in relations between Moscow and Washington over the Ukraine conflict.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Ukraine reports drone and artillery strikes over Easter weekend, while Moscow also claims ceasefire breaches by Kyiv

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has dismissed Vladimir Putin's Easter ceasefire as a fake “PR” exercise and said Russian troops had continued their drone and artillery attacks across many parts of the frontline.

Citing a report from Ukraine's commander-in-chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, Zelenskyy said Russia was still using heavy weapons and since 10am on Sunday an increase in Russian shelling had been observed, he said.

The Russian army had even doubled its use of kamikaze drones, he added, saying that there were 26 assaults between midnight on Saturday and noon on Sunday. The 30-hour truce – announced by Putin on Friday – is due to end at midnight on Monday.

“We are documenting every Russian violation of its self-declared commitment to a full ceasefire for the Easter period and are prepared to provide the necessary information to our partners,” Zelenskyy wrote on social media.

“In practice, either Putin does not have full control over his army, or the situation proves that in Russia they have no intention of making a genuine move toward ending the war, and are only interested in favourable PR coverage.”

He continued: “The Russian army is attempting to create the general impression of a ceasefire, while in some areas still continuing isolated attempts to advance.”

Video footage from the battlefield appeared to confirm the Ukrainian president's claim that the east of the country was under Russian fire. White puffs of smoke could be seen above the village of Uspenivka, in the Pokrovsk area of Donetsk oblast.

The Russians also reportedly attacked an evacuation convoy in the village of Zoria, near the city of Kostiantynivka. At least two civilians and a rescue worker from the Proliksa aid agency were hurt when Russian drones targeted their cars.

“For us, it's just another day of war – with shelling from various types of weapons and even one attempt to assault our positions,” Denys Bobkov, the spokesperson for Ukraine's 37th separate marine brigade, told the Guardian, in a message from the front.

Bobkov said that by 2pm on Sunday his brigade had recorded 16 drone attacks and two artillery strikes. It is fighting near the village of Novopavlivka, south-west of Pokrovsk and on the administrative border between Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts.

The 66th brigade, based in the city of Lyman, also reported infantry attacks and attempts to repair damaged crossings. “The Russians are using the so-called ‘lull' to improve their tactical position – to regroup in order to deliver another blow,” it said.

In Moscow, Russia's defence ministry claimed Ukraine had broken the ceasefire more than 1,000 times. It said there had been more than 900 drone strikes, with damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties. It did not give further details.

After a bloody week, during which Russia killed 35 people in a missile attack in the centre of Sumy, Ukrainian cities were relatively clam on Sunday. Worshippers gathered at St Volodymyr's cathedral in Kyiv, where priests blessed their Easter baskets with Holy water.

“They've already broken their promise. Unfortunately, we cannot trust Russia today,” Olga Grachova, 38, who works in marketing, told the news agency Agence France-Presse.

The truce's apparent failure comes as the US has signalled it is losing patience with both sides. On Friday, Donald Trump said he was ready to walk away from his attempt to broker a peace settlement, declaring: “We want to get it done.”

“Now if for some reason one of the two parties makes it very difficult, we're just going to say: ‘You're foolish. You're fools. You're horrible people' – and we're going to just take a pass,” he said. The US president denied claims that Putin was “playing” him.

The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, met European leaders in Paris last week to discuss how to end the war. Leaks suggest the White House is pushing for a Kremlin-friendly deal that would freeze the conflict along the existing 1000km-long frontline.

Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, has suggested that Crimea and four other Ukrainian provinces could be given to Russia. The US is considering recognising Crimea as Russian and offering Moscow other incentives such as sanctions relief, Bloomberg reported.

The Kremlin has not responded to Zelenskyy's offer on Friday to extend the Easter truce. It insists its original war goals must be achieved. They include the removal of Zelenskyy as Ukraine's president, as well as the country's “demilitarisation” and a guarantee of its non-Nato “neutral” status.

Since their disastrous meeting in February in the Oval Office, Zelenskyy has been seeking to improve relations with Washington. Last month, Ukraine accepted a 30-day US ceasefire proposal and is poised to sign an agreement on Thursday giving the US access to its minerals.

There are hints, however, that Zelenskyy is growing frustrated at the White House's pro-Putin rhetoric. Trump has piled pressure on Ukraine – in effect cutting off military aid and temporarily pausing intelligence sharing – while taking no corresponding measures against Russia.

On Sunday, Zelenskyy appeared to take a swipe at Fox News. The rightwing US TV network broadcast live coverage of Putin attending an Orthodox Easter service in Moscow together with Russia's patriarch, while incorrectly labelling Kyiv as part of Russia.

“Instead of broadcasting religious service from Moscow, the focus should be on pressuring Moscow to genuinely commit to a full ceasefire and to maintain it for at least 30 days after Easter – to give diplomacy a real chance,” Zelenskyy wrote on X.

Ukraine's foreign ministry said it had asked Fox News for an explanation. “If this was a mistake rather than a deliberate political statement, there should be an apology and an investigation into who made the mistake,” a ministry spokesperson said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Kremlin's most prized spies were sent in to Czechoslovakia to whip up the 1960s reform protests in a move then replicated across the eastern bloc

During the spring of 1968, as revolutionary sentiment began to grow in communist Czechoslovakia, a group of friendly foreigners began arriving in Prague, on flights from Helsinki and East Berlin, or by car from West Germany.

Among them were 11 western European men, a Swiss woman named Maria Weber and a Lebanese carpet dealer called Oganes Sarajian. They were all supporters of what would become known as the Prague Spring, an ultimately doomed attempt to build a more liberal and free ­version of socialism and escape from Moscow's suffocating embrace. Many of the visitors sought to get close to the movement's leading lights, offering support in the battle to reform communist rule.

But these visitors were not what they seemed. They were spies from the KGB's “illegals” programme – Soviet citizens who spent years ­training to be able to pose convincingly as westerners. Previously, illegals had been used to burrow into western ­societies and ferret out secrets for Moscow. But now the KGB was terrified that the Prague movement could end Soviet influence in the country, and decided for the first time to deploy its most prized spies inside the eastern bloc, in a mission called Operation Progress. To this day, Russia's intelligence ­services have never admitted it took place.

Unpublished documents about the mission, along with interviews with participants, shed new light on how Moscow used its spies to keep tabs on reformers in Prague: informing on its leaders, planting fake evidence, and in one case ­getting a man who planned a dramatic self-immolation as protest committed to a psychiatric institution before he could carry out the deed.

The Prague Spring, which was ­ultimately crushed by a massive Soviet invasion in August 1968, was a reflection of a huge desire for change in Czechoslovak society. The reform movement was supported by local Communist party leader Alexander Dubček, who coined the term ­“socialism with a human face”, but it was also a grassroots movement, as Prague became the most buzzing city in the eastern bloc.

“Blue jeans and long hair are ­everywhere,” wrote one American correspondent at the time. Students from western Europe travelled to Prague, where they sang songs, strummed guitars and smoked joints with their new friends.

The openness terrified the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and his KGB chief, Yuri Andropov, but in the ­openness Andropov also saw an opportunity for his spies to infiltrate. They could easily pass through the liberal Czechoslovak border regime with their fake western passports.

Five of the new arrivals were told to visit restaurants, museums, ­galleries and hotels and find ­opposition-minded Czechs. If ­necessary they could pay for useful political information, gently hinting that the money might be coming from western intelligence.

Some were tasked with befriending Czech newspaper editors and ­goading them into printing anti-Soviet statements to further escalate tensions. Others buried a fake cache of American weapons to “prove” that the reform movement was backed by the United States.

In 1969, as the Soviet Union continued to crack down on the reform movement post-invasion, more illegals were able to infiltrate. One, Yuri Linov, travelled to Prague posing as Austrian businessman Karl-Bernd Motl. Before long he was socialising in bars with student leaders and progressive journalists from state ­television, he recalled. In the nights he drank “a river of cheap red wine” with the protesters; in the mornings he wrote up reports about their plans and passed them over to his handler.

The spies were handled on the ground by Dmitry Vetrov, a lumbering giant of a man in his early 50s, who brushed off any doubts the KGB spies might have had about informing on idealistic young people who simply wanted to reform communism.

Vetrov admonished Linov and other illegals for thinking too much. He liked to recall an operation he had apparently taken part in, to ­neutralise a dissident in Berlin, in which he went in disguised as a removals man, knocked the target unconscious, then rolled him up in a carpet and sent him back to the Soviet Union. “Carpet. Plane. Siberia,” he repeated, to emphasise that he believed the ­dissidents in Czechoslovakia should be treated the same way.

Among Linov's new circle of friends was Jan Křížek, a tall, hard-drinking 25-year-old with a mop of unkempt blond hair. Křížek was obsessed with Jan Palach, a student who had killed himself by self-immolation and become a hero of the resistance. He told Linov he planned to set himself on fire on 21 August to mark the first anniversary of the Soviet invasion.

“Palach is a Czech hero now, ­everyone knows his name, and soon everyone will know Křížek too,” he boasted. Linov reported the plans to Vetrov, who later told him Křížek had been detained and committed to a psychiatric institution.

Operation Progress was first revealed in 1999, when the ­historian Christopher Andrew released a book based on copies of KGB files made by the dissident archivist Vasily Mitrokhin, who defected to Britain in 1992. But Mitrokhin's original files, now open to the public in Cambridge, contain many more revelations, about the Prague Spring and the later use of illegals in the Soviet bloc.

Andropov was so pleased with how Operation Progress had helped the Soviets manage dissent in Prague that he expanded it to cover the whole socialist bloc, where short-term ­missions continued for the next two decades.

In Hungary, the KGB was obsessed with supposed “Zionist” influence among the party and intellectual elite. In Yugoslavia, illegals ­travelled to Kosovo to investigate tension between Serbs and Albanians. In Poland, they took an interest in the Catholic church, attempting to get close to several influential religious figures, including the circle of Karol Wojtyła, archbishop of Kraków, who would later become Pope John Paul II.

Eventually, the KGB even began using illegals inside the Soviet Union, posing as western ­provocateurs to test the loyalty of suspected dissidents.

Russia has used illegals since the earliest days of Soviet power a ­century ago, and continues to infiltrate them into the west today.

Vladimir Putin has spoken on numerous occasions about their great achievements over the decades, but there is no place in this narrative for their work against dissidents inside the Soviet bloc.

Instead, they are portrayed as heroic warriors, uncovering secrets in the west to help the motherland.

“Illegals are built in a particular way, with strong morals and a firm character,” said Putin in 2017. “We are proud of them.”

11:45 JST, April 20, 2025

TOKYO (AP) — World champion Alysa Liu produced a flawless routine in the women's free skate as the United States won its sixth gold medal at the figure skating World Team Trophy on Saturday.

Skating to “MacArthur Park” by Donna Summer, the 19-year-old Liu landed seven triple jumps for a personal-best score of 150.97 points. Teammate Amber Glenn was second with 148.93.

Japan's Kaori Sakamoto was third with 145.00.

The United States finished the three-day competition with 126 points, 16 ahead of Japan. Italy was third with 86 points to claim its first ever medal in the event.

“We are just beaming. I'm so insanely proud of my team and everyone,” U.S. skater Jason Brown said. “It's been such an incredible season, and to end it here has been so special.”

Liu's previous best free skate score was 148.39 only last month at the world championships in Boston.

“I was a little bit happier after my free skate at worlds but I'll take this one,” Liu said. “I only ran it one time before coming here, so I wasn't expecting that. And I'm happy I could put out a good enough score for my team.”

Glenn also posted a personal best, which featured a triple axel.

“It's been consistent in practice, and I even did it in shows here in Japan,” Glenn said. “It's something I feel I'm able to do when I'm in the right place and I was today.”

The U.S. has medaled at every biennial World Team Trophy since its inception in 2009 and has won six of the nine competitions.

Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara won the pairs free skate as the host nation cut the Americans' lead to 11 points, but the dominant performances by Glenn and Liu clinched gold for the U.S.

The U.S. headed into the final day with a 15-point lead over Japan after victories in the men's and ice dance competitions on Friday.

Two-time world champion Ilia Malinin won the men's free skate to solidify the overall lead for the Americans. Malinin landed four quads in his program to “I'm Not a Vampire,” scoring 183.88 points.

Ice dance world champions Madison Chock and Evan Bates won the free dance segment. The three-time world ice dance champions received 12 points after a season's best score of 133.51

The World Team Trophy features the top six figure skating teams. France was fourth, followed by Canada and Georgia.

Ukraine's Foreign Ministry has called out Fox News for labeling Kyiv a ""Russian city"" during its news broadcast.

During its coverage of Easter services on April 20, Fox News aired footage of religious services from around the world, including the service Russian President Vladimir Putin attended in Moscow. 

Simultaneously, the right-wing news network broadcast live images from Easter religious services in Kyiv, misidentifying the Ukrainian capital as a Russian city. The error reportedly remained on screen for 20 minutes. 

""If this was a mistake rather than a deliberate political statement, there should be an apology and an investigation into who made the mistake,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, on April 20.

Although he didn't mention them by name, President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared to also criticize Fox News at the end of a statement on April 20 in which he reported multiple Russian ceasefire violations across the front line since an Easter ceasefire was declared. 

""Instead of broadcasting religious service from Moscow, the focus should be on pressuring Moscow to genuinely commit to a full ceasefire,"" Zelensky wrote.

China's imports of Russian coal in March rose by 6% year-on-year after falling over the previous year, data from Beijing's General Administration of Customs showed on April 20.

China had been decreasing coal imports from Russia despite a steady growth in domestic demand, turning instead to Australian and Mongolian suppliers, it was reported in January.

Russia's coal exports to China were reported to have dropped by almost 7% in 2024 compared to 2023.

The development was another blow to the Russian coal industry, which was already facing multibillion-dollar losses and mass bankruptcies.

But the latest data showed March imports were up 6% year-on-year to 7.33 million metric tons.

Warnings that Russia's coal industry was beginning to nosedive appeared in the second half of 2024, when AC TEK, a Russian state analytical center under the Energy Ministry, published a dire assessment.

Western sanctions, insufficient transport infrastructure to the east, and Chinese tariffs levied on Russian coal were contributing to the industry's setback.

Kemerovo Oblast, or Kuzbass, which accounts for 60% of Russia's hard coal production and 80% of its coking coal, was hit the hardest.

Financial troubles have forced eight coal companies in the region to halt operations, leaving hundreds of miners without pay for months, according to Kemerovo Governor Ilya Seredyuk said at the time.

""Falling prices on world markets, problems with logistics, a shortage of personnel, and a high key rate — along with Western sanctions — have created a serious challenge for the coal industry,"" Seredyuk said.

Despite growing economic ties between Moscow and Beijing, Western sanctions have presented an increasingly serious obstacle to Russian-Chinese trade relations.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Russian forces during the so-called Easter ceasefire targeted a Ukrainian volunteer's vehicle with three (first person-view) FPV drones while he was evacuating civilians in Donetsk Oblast, Ukrainska Pravda reported on April 20.

Volunteer Yevhen Tkachov was evacuating civilians from the village of Zoria, located to the south of Kramatorsk, when they were targeted by the first drone some 50 meters from the Donetsk Highway.

""I turned on the emergency lights, got out of the car, and started waving my arms to show that I was a civilian,"" Tkachov told Ukrainska Pravda. 

""Despite that, the drone struck just half a meter from my car. I motioned for the two cars behind me to go ahead, but I couldn't drive myself anymore because my car wouldn't start (after being damaged by the drone strike)."" 

Tkachov and two civilians who had been in the vehicle with him reportedly took cover in nearby bushes as a second FPV drone circled overhead and struck just meters away, leaving one of the civilians wounded by shrapnel.

A third drone then destroyed their car before they were rescued by a chaplain. 

Russia's Easter ceasefire was supposed to come into effect at 6 pm on April 19 and last until midnight on April 21, with Russian President Vladimir Putin claiming it would ""test Ukraine's sincerity in pursuing peace talks.""

Since then, multiple ceasefire violations have been reported across the front line, while at least one person was killed and four others injured in Kherson Oblast.

""We are documenting every Russian violation of its self-declared commitment to a full ceasefire for the Easter period and are prepared to provide the necessary information to our partners,"" Zelensky said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, on April 20.

A simple sign leads visitors to the somewhat hidden entrance to the Sterkfontein Caves. The site of early human fossils, not far from Johannesburg in South Africa, has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1999. In addition to archaeological artifacts, evidence of the upright gait of Australopithecus afarensis has also been found here.

Stairways lead visitors fairly comfortably into the dark and damp caves, but they still need a bit of courage and fitness. Visitors may have to crawl through narrow, dark tunnels or crouch to get through some tight spots.

Tour guide Keneth Mawete ducks his way through the entrance. The name ""Sterkfontein"" means ""strong spring"" in Afrikaans. Tourists are guided through the cave system from this point onward.

This replica shows what representatives of the Australopithecus afarensis, which lived in what is now Sterkfontein, might have looked like. ""Lucy,"" seen here, was discovered in Hadar, Ethiopia, in 1974 and is around 3.2 million years old. Her name comes from the Beatles song ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,"" which was playing at the researchers' camp when the skeleton was found.

The caves are also known as the ""cradle of humankind,"" as this region has provided some of the oldest evidence for the existence of the ancestors of modern humans. This includes ""Little Foot,"" an almost complete skeleton of an early hominid estimated to be more than 3 million years old — a sensation in paleoanthropology.

A reproduction of the Australopithecus prometheus ""Little Foot"" can be viewed at the museum at the visitor center in Krugersdorp. The excavation took 15 years, as the bones were embedded in very hard dolomite rock and had to be very carefully uncovered by hand in the narrow and difficult-to-access cave structure.

The entire cave system is more than 47 kilometers (29 miles) long; visitors can only enter a small, secure area. No major accidents have been documented to date, but there have been situations during excavations in which geologists or palaeoanthropologists have been trapped or needed safety ropes to escape.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'dw.com'}","world"

Moscow's forces will pause hostilities in Ukraine over Easter, Russian leader Vladimir Putin has said, adding that the Kremlin ""assumed"" Kyiv will follow suit. Ukraine says Putin's word cannot be trusted. 



For the latest updates on the proposed ""Easter truce"" in Ukraine, read  our live blog here.

Russian President Vladimir Putin declared an Easter truce in Ukraine, the Kremlin press service reported on Saturday, over three years after Moscow launched a full-scale offensive on the neighboring country.

The unilateral break in fighting is scheduled to last from Saturday evening until midnight on Sunday local time.

""During a meeting in the Kremlin, the commander-in-chief heard a report by Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff of the Russian armed forces, on the situation on the line of contact and said that the Russian side stops all hostilities from 1800 [1500 GMT] on April 19 to 0000 on April 21,"" the Kremlin's official Telegram channel said.

Putin said Russia ""assumed"" that Ukraine would follow suit. He also warned Russian troops should be ready to repel possible ""provocations by the enemy.""

According to the statement on Telegram, Putin said the truce would show how sincere Kyiv was in its willingness to ""participate in the process of peace talks aimed at eliminating the root causes of the Ukrainian crisis.""

However, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said ""Putin's word cannot be trusted."" Sybiha added that Kyiv stands by the earlier deal for a 30-day truce which was pitched by the US last month. Moscow had rejected the US suggestion. 

The Russian Defense Ministry said it had instructed all group commanders in Ukraine on the ceasefire.

It said in a statement that Moscow's troops would adhere to the truce provided it is ""mutually respected"" by Ukraine.

DW's Kyiv correspondent Nick Connolly also said there was considerable skepticism in Ukraine regarding Putin's announcement.

""No celebrations here yet; no one believes this is real. Currently, Russian drones still attacking Kyiv region 30 mins before Putin's ceasefire,"" he said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also questioned the veracity of the announcement, writing on X, formerly Twitter, that Russian drones in the skies over Ukraine showed Moscow's true attitude to Easter and people's lives.

""As for yet another attempt by Putin to play with human lives — at this moment, air raid alerts are spreading across Ukraine,"" Zelenskyy said. ""At 17:15, Russian attack drones were detected in our skies. Ukrainian air defense and aviation have already begun working to protect us. Shahed drones in our skies reveal Putin's true attitude toward Easter and towards human life.""

The ceasefire offer by Russia comes as US President Donald Trump's administration has said it is prepared to abandon truce negotiations in Ukraine in the coming days. 

Russian political scientist Ekaterina Schulmann posted on Telegram that the offer could make the US ""get rid of the feeling that nothing is happening at all"" when it comes to Ukraine.

Meanwhile on Saturday, Russia and Ukraine are reported to have taken part in an exchange of prisoners of war. 

The Russian Defense Ministry said it had received 246 Russian soldiers from Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russia said it handed over 246 Ukrainian prisoners to Ukraine.

Russia also said it handed over 31 wounded prisoners of war to Ukraine, with Ukraine then handing over 15 wounded Russian prisoners to Russia. 

Zelenskyy, for his part, confirmed that 277 Ukrainian ""warriors"" had returned home after being taken prisoner by Russia.

In addition, Russia's top general Valery Gerasimov said that the Russian military had taken back 99% of the Kursk region from Ukraine.

Ukraine did not respond to Gerasimov's comment. Ukraine launched an incursion into Kursk in August in hopes that it could be used as land swaps with Russia during negotiations.

Curt Lind didn't know it, but he was already dead.

The 82-year-old was ambushed by a hooded figure lying in wait outside his trailer park who repeatedly slashed his throat, CCTV footage seen by The Telegraph reveals.

Amazingly, Lind remained on his feet as his assailant fled. The collar of his jacket, which had been torn off during the frenzied knife attack and trailed limply from his hand, was visibly soaked through with blood.

He staggered away, perhaps trying to seek help from a neighbour, before collapsing face-first in the middle of the road.

He didn't move again until the authorities in Vallejo, California collected his body later that day.

The man charged with his murder was Maximilian Snyder, a 22-year-old former computer science student. He has pleaded not guilty.

Prosecutors have linked him to the Zizians, a “death cult” of transgender vegans, which once operated on Lind's land before allegedly trying to kill him following a dispute over rent.

The group scattered after what the authorities characterised as the first murder attempt of Lind. At least two of them appear to have faked their own deaths, and they have since been linked to a string of murders across the US.

But as recently as November 2022, the members of the so-called cult were living in Lind's trailer park in Vallejo.

The sprawling compound, located at the end of a cul-de-sac in the south-west corner of the city, is a jumble of iron and steel. Boats, cars, trucks, lawnmowers and shipping containers, many of them rusted, are scattered behind the chainlink fence and padlocked gates.

Locals called it the “fruit stand” because of the strange characters it attracted. Back then, Lind was also living on the lot in a caravan.

He met the Zizians in early 2020 while the tug boat they were living on was docked at a harbour south of San Francisco, and offered to rent out his land to them.

They made a strange pairing – a former ship worker and talented machinist, then in his seventies, and a group of 20-somethings, most of them transgender vegans, who had attended elite universities. But they formed a sort of bond, and Lind would recall taking one of them to buy their first bra.

“Curt was open to different people's ways of life,” said Jon Jenkins, who knew Lind for 20 years, recalling his friend speaking up for the group just months before they allegedly tried to kill him.

The Zizians are an offshoot from the “rationalist” intellectual movement in San Francisco's Bay Area, which started taking root among its community of tech bros and computer geeks in the early 2010s.

The group took its name from its leader Ziz, real name Jack LaSota, who in labyrinthine blog posts would formulate a philosophy about the brain's two hemispheres – which can be good or evil, male or female, and “often desire to kill each other”.

LaSota, who was born a man before transitioning, would dress up in long black “Sith” robes, after the Star Wars villains. “The Sith do what they want deep down,” he explained in one post. “They remove all obstructions.”

Anna Salamon, who founded a rationalist group in the Bay Area, later said she was “viscerally afraid of LaSota in a way I've never been viscerally afraid of anybody” and realised the group of young people she brought together could be radicalised by his violent ideology.

“We didn't know this at the time, but in hindsight we were creating conditions for a cult,” she told NBC News.

After moving onto converted trucks on Lind's land, the purported members were regarded with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion by neighbours. They were gaunt, pale, would never talk to or in front of strangers, and on several occasions were spotted walking around naked.

Trust is hard to find in that corner of Vallejo, where locals recall at least three bodies being dumped along the streets in recent years in cases not linked to the Zizians. Many repeat a warning not to hang around until it gets dark.

“The police don't respond to anything. It's kind of a lawless town,” claimed Kevin Lum, a shaven-headed mechanic who works at one of the many garages that line the road.

The city went bankrupt a few years ago, and though it has clawed its way back to solvency, holes remain in vital services – including law enforcement, as police openly admit.

It might be just a half-hour drive from Napa Valley's famous wine region, and the Napa River is a short walk from Lind's trailer park, but Vallejo is a very different place. As dusk falls, sex workers wait on every corner of one of its main thoroughfares, Sonoma Boulevard.

Lind later said his relationship with the Zizians soured when they stopped paying rent as the Covid pandemic hit, and he was reportedly forced to go to court to get some $60,000 he was owed.

In November 2022, prosecutors said he was called out of his caravan by Suri Dao, one of the members of the “death cult”, who told him there was a water leak in their truck. On the way out, he grabbed a small handgun he had recently started carrying – similar to a derringer, according to neighbour Greg Frizzie.

Other members of the group were waiting for Lind to appear, and when he bent down to turn off the water valve they allegedly attacked him with kitchen knives and impaled him with a ninja sword.

Groping blindly for his gun, Lind fired into the group, killing Emma Borhanian, a former Google employee, and wounding Alexander Leatham, a former maths student at the University of California.

“He said he got up, he couldn't see, but he could see silhouettes of people,” Mr Frizzie said. “So he just started shooting.”

Leatham – who is said to have wielded the sword – and Dao were arrested and charged with attempted murder. Both have pleaded not guilty.

But others were allowed to leave the scene and scattered, including LaSota and another member called Gwen Danielson, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Neither have been charged with any wrongdoing in connection with the incident.

Lind spent weeks in hospital, and was left blind in one eye with a scar on his neck from where the group members had allegedly tried to behead him. Photos of the 82-year-old from then on show him with his right eye permanently closed.

Mr Jenkins, known by locals as “Big Jon”, started acting as a kind of bodyguard for his friend and took to carrying a gun.

He also helped Lind clear out the Zizian's living quarters, where he uncovered traces of the secretive group's lifestyle. A hole had been dug through one of the trucks, about 8ft deep, while nearby were “boxes and boxes” of lye, a powerful alkaline.

Jack LaSota had previously told a Zizian associate that lye could be used to dispose of bodies, according to Wired.

Needles and vials were left lying around the truck – possibly for administering estrogen, which the Zizians apparently believed led to clearer thinking, according to people connected to the group.

And that wasn't all.

“They saved their pee. Probably 25, 30 bottles of it. And they wrote big letters on it – pee,” Mr Jenkins said, wheezing with laughter.

For a long time, that was the only trace of the Zizians in Vallejo as its membership splintered.

LaSota was reported to have faked his own death in a boating accident in August 2022, and an obituary was published in his hometown paper. Danielson was also thought to be dead, but her father recently told the New York Post she was in hiding from her former fellow alleged cult members.

Then in January of this year, Mr Jenkins noticed that black flowers, with wire stems and fabric petals, had been attached to the gates of Lind's compound. Seemingly, it was placed there to mourn Borhanian, the dead Zizian.

“We were just like – ‘Curt. You shouldn't be around here, you know?'” Mr Jenkins recalled.

“When we first saw the flowers, he thought, well, maybe one of our friends was pulling a little joke on us. But then it was nobody we knew, and then that sort of got kind of scary.”

Then a figure started hanging around the area. Nobody knew who he was, but according to descriptions he was about 5ft 10, and wore a Covid mask, woollen hat and hood even though it was warm for that time of year.

Mr Frizzie found the stranger sitting on his wall, and then walking down his side of the pavement, which is adjacent to Lind's property.

“You're new here, right?” he said to the man, who up close he claims turned out to be a “skinny Asian dude”.

The only response was a “f---ing weird stare”.

Mr Frizzie carried on: “If you're living at the ‘fruit stand' down the end of the street, you are not allowed to walk on my property. You're not allowed to sit on my wall, on my side of the street.”

The stranger headed over the road to a church at the opposite end of the cul-de-sac, and resumed his silent vigil.

Mr Frizzie, who lives in Idaho but occasionally stays at a caravan on his Vallejo property for work, headed out to meet his wife, who stayed in a hotel a few towns over “because she knows how crazy it is down here”.

He was about a 15-minute drive away the next day when he got a call from Mr Jenkins, a family friend: “Something happened to Curt – we need your video, we need your camera. The cops are here.”

He pulled over and watched the footage from cameras installed outside his house, which he claims showed the man he knew for more than 30 years being chased and murdered by that same hooded figure.

Mr Frizzie watched the two-minute video on his phone again quietly while talking to The Telegraph. “Such a good guy,” he said of Lind, finally. “I learnt a lot from him.”

Authorities believe the man in that footage is Snyder, a former computer science student at Oxford University with ties to the Zizians.

He pleaded not guilty to Lind's murder in a Vallejo courtroom in March, humming a tune under his breath as the hearing began. He wore a striped prison jumpsuit, and his black hair was long and tied in pigtails.

Three days after Mr Snyder was said to have murdered Lind in California, his girlfriend, Teresa Youngblut, a member of the Zizians, allegedly shot and killed a border guard in Vermont called David Maland.

Her companion, known alternately as Felix or Ophelia Bauckholt, died in the shoot-out that followed.

The death of Maland, whom friends called “Chris”, seems to have intensified the nationwide manhunt for alleged members of the cult.

Pennsylvania police said the gun used by Youngblut had been bought by a person of interest in another killing: Michelle Jacqueline Zajko, whom prosecutors have also linked to the Zizians. Her parents, Richard and Rita Zajko, were shot and killed on New Year's Eve in 2022.

She was questioned in connection with their deaths but not charged.

Adding to the web of intrigue, LaSota was arrested in a Philadelphia hotel room the following month and charged with obstructing a homicide investigation, by officers who had obtained a warrant to seize Ms Zajko's gun. Otherwise, he is not alleged to have any involvement in the deaths.

In February this year, police arrested LaSota alongside Zajko when they parked their box trucks on the land of a man in Frostburg, Maryland.

The pair, whom authorities said were dressed in black and wore gun belts containing ammunition, have pleaded not guilty to multiple charges including trespass, obstructing and hindering, and possession of a handgun.

Jessica Taylor, who attended rationalist events in the Bay Area but was not part of the Zizians, said she had attempted to warn Bauckholt away from the “death cult”.

She told The Telegraph her suspicions had been raised after meeting LaSota and his “strange” account of a suicide by a trans woman called Maia Pasek. Later, a second person linked to the Zizians killed themselves: Jay Winterford, known in online circles as “Fluttershy”.

LaSota has never been charged or accused of wrongdoing by the authorities in connection with these deaths.

Multiple trials later this year could shed light on the inner workings of the group. None of the Zizians have been found guilty of murder in court.

            Democrats' panic over what they stand for and whether they can credibly compete beyond the bluest states is already erupting in the rush to recruit Senate candidates across the country for next year — a desperate effort to dig out from years of losses that have them far from power at a moment they need it most.
    


            Will Democrats, indeed, compete everywhere in 2026? Will leaders allocate money even in tough races, or will they consolidate conservatively around their best bets? How will they handle what could be candidates who range from being aligned with Bernie Sanders to occasionally voting with Donald Trump?
    


            Even this early out from the 2026 elections, these questions are all playing out against the toughest set of Senate races Democrats have faced in decades.
    


            “On its face, the Senate map does not look great, but if this is a wave election, Democrats can compete in places they normally can't,” said Jaime Harrison, who before his recently completed term as Democratic National Committee chair ran for Senate in South Carolina in 2020. “The goal has to be: recruit a Democrat for every damn seat.”
    


            Harrison failed in his attempt to turn a red state blue. While he raised $130 million, he still lost to Sen. Lindsey Graham by 15 points.
    


            But hopes of a major backlash to Trump, fed by internal poll numbers that operatives say show his popularity dropping, has Harrison and two dozen other Democratic operatives and candidates across the country who spoke with CNN arguing that next year's elections could be more in line with the Democratic wave of 2006.

            Democrats have three incumbent senators who announced they won't run again next year and anticipate at least one more will follow. They also have to defend a senator in Georgia, where Republicans keep running strong. Their most obvious opportunities to put Republicans on defense are in Maine and North Carolina, the two states that have crushed Democrats' dreams of winning Senate races cycle after cycle.
    


            And even if they manage to win those three races, that won't be enough to get them the majority.
    


            That leaves operatives looking beyond prime Democratic territory in states such as Alaska and even Kentucky and Mississippi, or nursing fantasies of revivals in once-competitive states like Ohio, where local leaders are waiting for Sherrod Brown to decide whether he'll try a comeback from his 2024 loss to run for the state's other Senate seat, or go for governor instead.
    


            And across the country, voters have doubts about what Democrats even stand for. “That's a question I'm getting a lot,” said Wiley Nickel, a former congressman now running for Senate in North Carolina — even as many Democrats push for former Gov. Roy Cooper to enter the race against Sen. Thom Tillis.
    


            More than on ideology, voters are pushing Democratic candidates on what they're doing to push back against Trump and whether they'd support Chuck Schumer to remain the party's Senate leader.
    


            While strategists draft preliminary plans to blast Trump on the economy and thrash Republicans as rolling over for him no matter what, Schumer and fellow New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, chair of the Senate Democrats' campaign arm, have been feeling out the strength of prospective candidates and working with local leaders to find more.
    


            But the Senate leadership is not alone in recruitment efforts. Abdul El-Sayed, who last week launched his campaign for the Democratic primary for the open Senate seat in Michigan with the immediate endorsement of Sanders, is just one of the prospective candidates around the country whom the progressive icon has encouraged into running. Smaller groups of operatives and activists are forming quiet partnerships to boost their own candidates, eager to blow past whatever decisions come out of Washington.
    


            Comparing what he's hearing from voters to the cynicism that takes root in chronic pain patients he has worked with, El-Sayed told CNN, “It's the morass of, ‘Everything kind of sucks,' and our job is to take it down to its key elements.”
    


            “For too many voters in Michigan who narrowly elected Donald Trump, they didn't know what the Democratic Party stands for,” said Mallory McMorrow, a Michigan state senator also running in the primary for the US Senate seat.

Bernie Sanders' message of resistance finds fresh life as Democratic Party searches for direction



            Morrow said her campaign is about “success, safety and sanity” rather than the status quo.
    


            “This is a huge opportunity for us to write a new Democratic Party and really put a stake in the ground, show through our race this is what the new party can look like and sound like and act like,” she said.
    


            The stakes in the Senate are much higher than just winning the majority. For those who see checking Trump's power as an emergency for the republic, every Democratic seat makes a huge difference: Even narrowing the GOP's 53-47 margin would amplify the pressure on the few remaining Republicans willing to buck the president.
    


            One measure of how sparse the Democratic bench is in states where they need to compete next year: Only a few House members are in the mix for Senate runs. New Hampshire Rep. Chris Pappas has already launched his campaign, though Rep. Haley Stevens is expected to join the open race in Michigan and Rep. Angie Craig is in the middle of a swing of town halls in her state's Republican districts as she readies a campaign for the open seat in Minnesota.
    


            All three are in more reliably Democratic states, but Pappas said being a lifelong Democrat does not mean he is at all satisfied with how the party got to where it is.
    


            “We have to recognize that in order to confront the damage that the administration is causing, in order to win elections and stop what the administration is doing right now, we need a coalition of folks that are able to step forward, run and win,” he told CNN. “The Democratic Party was flat-footed at the beginning of the Trump presidency. This is a moment where we need to be thinking about how to make a difference, using every tool we have to hold Republicans accountable and trying to establish some guardrails.”
    


            In Georgia, Sen. Jon Ossoff has started building his campaign around an approach he believes worked well for him in the past — talking common sense over chaos, railing against Trump's authoritarian impulses and blasting corruption. When he spoke out against cuts to the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it was not to defend the diversity, equity and inclusion programs that Trump targeted, but to point to possible effects on public health.
    


            He's also raised $11 million already and has had thousands at his rallies in a state that Trump won again last year. He hopes that some of what he's built can be a model for others looking to flip seats in traditionally red states.
    


            Some prospects are emerging.
    


            In South Carolina, Annie Andrews — a pediatrician who lost a 2022 House race against Rep. Nancy Mace — has been having conversations about taking on Graham this time, convinced that the demographics in the state are shifting to make him vulnerable. In Alaska, Democrats are urging Mary Peltola — who flipped the statewide House seat in 2022 but lost it in 2024 despite running double digits ahead of the presidential ticket — to jump in against Dan Sullivan, hoping the state's ranked-choice voting system could give her an edge. In Mississippi, District Attorney Scott Colom — whose nomination by Joe Biden to be a district court judge was blocked by Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith — has been gearing up for a likely run now against her.

            In Maine, a former Capitol Hill chief of staff who worked at the Democratic group End Citizens United has told multiple people he will soon launch a campaign, but most eyes remain on Rep. Jared Golden, the four-term congressman whose most recent break with his party was being the sole House Democrat to vote for Trump's budget bill. He's still weighing what to run, leaving Maine Democrats thinking of 77-year-old Gov. Janet Mills as their possible backup.
    


            In Nebraska, Dan Osborn — the local labor leader and industrial machinist who attracted significant Democratic interest and money for his 2024 Senate run as an independent — is nearing another run. Across the Missouri River, Nathan Sage last week launched a likeminded but still Democratic campaign against Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst.
    


            “This is shaping up to be an incredibly interesting election cycle where anything's possible,” said South Carolina's Andrews, who said she expects to make a final decision about running within weeks. “I know it's an uphill battle — but the moment we find ourselves in, we have to run everywhere and do what we can to get this country back on track.”
    


            In Texas, after 2018 and 2024 races that fizzled despite national buzz, Democrats are trying to decide whether a GOP primary could get their hopes up for 2026. Within minutes of the race kicking off, state Attorney General Ken Paxton and Sen. John Cornyn were attacking each other as unfit for office and failing to serve Texans.
    


            Former Rep. Colin Allred, the Democratic nominee last year, has been having conversations and attending events around the state as he seriously considers launching another campaign, and he expects to make a final decision by the summer.
    


            “I don't care anymore about the DC game of proving to people that we can do this, or we can't do that,” Allred told CNN. “This is a time of crisis — and that's where I think it's been where people are feeling that we need to do something.”
    


            National Senate campaign operatives are in the early stages of deciding where they will focus, but they acknowledge that in most places, much of that will be candidate-driven, since winning will require overperforming in regards to how voters think about Democrats. In some cases, they say, that will mean pushing the most famous Democrat they can find to run, but in others it will be hunting for an unknown unicorn who can talk about shared values rather than partisanship.
    


            “Better candidates, stronger campaigns, a winning message, and a building midterm backlash against Republicans driven by their threats to Social Security and Medicaid are going to power Senate Democrats into the majority this cycle,” Gillibrand said in a statement provided to CNN. “Republicans have more seats to defend — and they're doing it in a bad political environment.”

Democratic retirements create fresh challenge for hopes of winning back the Senate



            But for all the history of midterm elections tending to go against the party that controls the White House, the Democrats gearing up for these races know they're going to need more than a bad political environment — even in Kentucky, the one race where a Republican incumbent isn't running for another term, as former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell retires in a state that has a two-term Democratic governor but not much other recent history of supporting the party.
    


            “Somebody has to stand up, and I've done it my entire life,” said Pam Stevenson, an Air Force colonel and the minority leader of the state House who's hoping to do better in her 2026 Senate campaign than in her 2023 race for attorney general. “It's not too early. Especially if you've got to raise $25 million. It's never too early to start giving people hope.”
    


            In Kansas, which also has a Democratic governor but hasn't had a Democratic senator for decades, state party chair Jeanna Repass told CNN on Friday that while she's already been part of several interviews with prospective opponents to Sen. Roger Marshall, she still is not sure who will run.
    


            But with new organizing already underway in rural parts of the state, Repass predicted there's enough energy that there will even be a primary.
    


            “Being a Democrat in a red state, if you don't lead with optimism,” she said, “you're done from the get-go.”

Follow:


            As the pressure grows on congressional Republicans to identify cuts in Medicaid, they are crashing into a familiar problem: The changes that could save the most money would impose heavy costs on many of their own voters.
    


            Several key House Republicans have signaled in recent days that they may try to cut Medicaid spending by rolling back the expansion in eligibility for the working poor included in the Affordable Care Act approved under President Barack Obama.
    


            That option may be attractive to Republicans partly because the states that have most aggressively used that authority to expand eligibility mostly lean Democratic. Most House districts where more people than the national average receive health coverage through the Medicaid expansion are also held by Democrats, according to an exclusive new CNN analysis of data from KFF, a non-partisan health care think tank.
    


            But GOP constituencies would hardly be immune if Congress rescinds the expansion. Nearly three dozen House Republicans also represent districts where the number of people receiving coverage through that Medicaid expansion exceeds the national district average of about 61,600, the analysis found. And nearly two dozen GOP senators likewise represent states with a substantial population of enrollees covered through the ACA's Medicaid expansion.
    


            “It's really a similar pattern that we've seen with the Affordable Care Act generally – that it's become so embedded in the health care system and the lives of people across the country that it becomes very hard to take it away,” said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF.
    


            Answers on whether the expansion is too entrenched for congressional Republicans to uproot could begin arriving as soon as May 7, when the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which holds jurisdiction over Medicaid, is expected to start marking up the GOP's massive budget “reconciliation” plan.
    


            For all the controversy around both President Donald Trump's assaults on civil liberties and his tariff moves, it's likely that the most politically consequential decision congressional Republicans face this year is how to balance spending and tax cuts in the budget package they are formulating.
    


            With Trump ruling out cuts in Social Security or Medicare benefits, Medicaid represents by far the largest pot of money available for the reductions that conservative budget hawks are demanding. The House budget resolution has instructed the Energy and Commerce Committee to find $880 billion in savings over the next decade; the Congressional Budget Office recently calculated that even if the committee completely zeroed out the other programs in its purview, it still could not reach that number without cutting Medicaid.
    


            Republicans have long viewed Medicaid, which now provides health coverage for about 83 million lower-income Americans, as a more vulnerable target than Medicare, which serves seniors; GOP attempts to cut Medicaid and convert it into a block grant were central to the 1990s budget showdowns between President Bill Clinton and then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The bill House Republicans passed in 2017 to repeal the Affordable Care Act included major cutbacks in Medicaid, including a variation on the Gingrich-era block grant proposal.
    


            But both the Medicaid population and the GOP electoral coalition have evolved in ways that complicate the party's choices. The ACA expanded eligibility for Medicaid to far more working poor people. Previously, single childless adults were not eligible for the program at any income level; the ACA allowed states to cover those making up to 138% of the federal poverty level ($15,650 for an individual and about $21,000 for a married couple in 2025). The ACA also allowed states to raise the eligibility level for parents of young children to 138% of the poverty level; many states, particularly in the South, had cut off eligibility for parents at far lower levels before.
    


            To encourage states to broaden coverage, the ACA committed Washington to funding 90% of the cost of the expansion population, much more than it pays states for other people covered through Medicaid (generally one-half to three-quarters, depending on the state). All but 10 states have now expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA, covering more than 20 million people in all.
    


            Even as the ACA expanded Medicaid eligibility up the income ladder to more working poor families, Republicans extended their electoral reach down the income and educational ladder through the political realignment accelerated under Trump. The result, as I wrote recently with CNN senior producer Edward Wu, is that 64 House Republicans now represent districts in which the share of Medicaid recipients exceeds the average for all districts. Far more Republicans than Democrats also represent districts with greater than average prevalence of major health problems including diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure – a reflection of the GOP's growing consolidation of lower-education, lower-income, often rural House districts.
    


            These shifts clearly have made congressional Republicans more uneasy about cutting Medicaid than in the 1990s, or even in 2017. But the Medicaid expansion population has remained a tempting target for them.
    


            For one thing, the expansion is tied to the ACA, or Obamacare, which many Republicans, from Trump on down, still disparage. The expansion population, which includes people above the poverty line, is also more susceptible to the traditional argument Republicans have wielded against social welfare programs: that they reward the “undeserving poor” who should be paying their own way.
    


            In recent weeks, multiple House Republicans have subtly, but tellingly, distinguished between Medicaid's traditional enrollees – very low-income parents, people with disabilities, impoverished seniors – and those added under the ACA expansion. House Speaker Mike Johnson has repeatedly called for revoking Medicaid eligibility for “able-bodied workers, for example, young men … who should never be on the program at all.”
    


            Even a dozen House Republicans from swing districts who wrote Johnson last week expressing caution about Medicaid reductions made a similar distinction: while they would oppose cuts hurting “vulnerable populations,” they also said they want to “fix flaws in the program that divert resources away from children, seniors, individuals with disabilities, and pregnant women — those who the program was intended to help.” (Emphasis added.)
    


The most specific proposal for reversing the Medicaid expansion has come from Paragon Health Institute, a conservative health care think tank. Paragon has proposed to phase out the enhanced federal assistance for the expansion population over a decade, reducing it to the same reimbursement Washington offers for other recipients. “We're 15 years post the ACA and I think the question for policy makers is: under what rationale should we paying more for childless adults than kids, pregnant women and people with disabilities on the program?” Brian Blase, the institute's president and a health policy adviser to Trump during his first term, said in a recent interview.
    


            Paragon projects that about 3 million people would lose health care coverage from the shift. That's largely because it anticipates that most of those removed from Medicaid would qualify for federal subsidies to buy private health insurance through the ACA marketplaces.
    


            But the Urban Institute, a center-left think tank, has projected that nearly 11 million people would lose health coverage if Congress revokes the enhanced Medicaid funding for the working poor. If states tried to maintain the current eligibility levels with their own funds, the Urban Institute found, it would require them to increase their Medicaid spending by about 25% annually, a virtual impossibility.
    


            Meanwhile, it would become much harder for people kicked off Medicaid to obtain coverage instead through the Obamacare exchanges if Republicans allow the enhanced ACA subsidies approved under President Joe Biden to expire this year, as they have signaled is likely. “If people in the expansion population lose coverage, they may be eligible on paper for the marketplace but many of them would not be able to afford it,” especially if the enhanced subsidies expire, said Allison Orris, director of Medicaid policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal group.
    


            The new analysis of the KFF data by Wu, the senior CNN producer, suggests Republicans are right in their instinct that ending the expansion would rattle more windows in Democratic than GOP-leaning areas.
    


            Ninety-eight Democrats represent districts where more people than the average are covered through the expansion, the analysis found. So many congressional Democrats represent big expansion populations , largely because the states that have added the most people through the expansion tend to be places where Democrats are highly competitive, including blue states California, New York, Illinois, Oregon and Virginia, as well as purple battlegrounds like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Arizona, which are all in the top 10. Democrats, in fact, hold 46 more House seats than Republicans in the states that have expanded Medicaid eligibility, Wu calculated.
    


            Conversely, Republicans in Congress are less exposed, largely because the 10 states that have refused to expand Medicaid – headlined by Texas, Florida and Georgia – all lean red, with the exception of Wisconsin (where the GOP-controlled legislature has long blocked expansion). Nearly 40% of House Republicans represent just those 10 states.
    


            Even so, the number of House Republicans from expansion states with large numbers of residents – and health care providers – who have come to rely on the new coverage still far exceeds the number of defections that would sink any budget plan. Thirty-two House Republicans also hold seats with an above-average number of expansion beneficiaries; 14 of them represent districts with 80,000 or more Medicaid expansion enrollees. And while the total number of expansion enrollees is greatest in Democratic-held districts (about 12.6 million), the 6.8 million in GOP seats still constitute a very large number of potential voters. Likewise, 22 Republican senators have been elected from the 29 states that have covered at least 100,000 people under the expansion, according to the KFF data.
    


            Another factor could make Republicans hesitate about unwinding the expansion: its importance to health care systems in reliably red rural areas. In an interview, North Carolina Medicaid Director Jay Ludlam  , for instance, pointed out that rural residents make up twice as big a share of the state's Medicaid expansion population as they do of the overall population. Experts say that dynamic, which is evident in other states too, is primarily because workers in rural places are less likely to receive health insurance from their employers.
    


            Through the expansion, Ludlam said, “We have seen individuals get medicines for heart disease, diabetes, for treatment of seizures – chronic diseases that would go otherwise untreated.” If people lose that coverage, he continued, “initially what you would start to see is an uptick in emergency room visits, which is an incredibly expensive way to provide health care,” with “eventually some of those chronic diseases beginning to have a really adverse impact on the health of many people.”
    


            The best example of how all these pressures converge may be Speaker Johnson's own state of Louisiana. As a lower-income, heavily rural state, Louisiana has been among the greatest beneficiaries of the Medicaid expansion. The state expanded eligibility under Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in 2016 and his Republican successor, Gov. Jeff Landry, has not sought to repeal it.
    


            According to Kaiser, Louisiana has signed up nearly 800,000 people for the expansion, more than all but four other (and much larger) states. Johnson and fellow Louisiana GOP Reps. Julia Letlow, Clay Higgins and Steve Scalise each have more than 100,000 district residents receiving Medicaid through the expansion, which places all of them among the top eight of all House Republicans.
    


            Jan Moller, executive director of Invest in Louisiana, an advocacy group for low-income families, says the Medicaid expansion has also provided a financial lifeline for the state's health care providers.
    


            While rural hospitals are struggling in many states, he notes, none have closed in Louisiana since the expansion. “If you drive around Louisiana,” he added, “you will see a lot of clinics … where they didn't exist 10 to 15 years ago.” Revoking expansion funding, Moller said, “would be devastating for Louisiana's budget, and it would seriously threaten health care access for the 1 in 3 Lousianians who depend on Medicaid.”
    


            Even people with private insurance or Medicare would be hurt, Moller added, if reduced Medicaid revenue forces hospitals and other providers to close, particularly in rural areas with fewer alternatives. That could be a common problem in many states, Orris said. “Pulling as much money out of the health care system as they are talking about … will hurt everyone in a community,” she said.
    


            If congressional Republicans can't find the votes to directly reverse the expansion, they have signaled they may seek to truncate it by imposing a work requirement on Medicaid recipients. (Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley, for instance, has said he will not support cuts in benefits, but would back a work requirement.) Surveys have found about two-thirds of people on Medicaid already work full- or part-time, and almost all the rest would likely be exempt from any mandate because of factors such as a disability or caring for a family member.
    


            But when Arkansas and New Hampshire experimented with work requirements in Trump's first term, large numbers of people were still thrown off the program for failing to meet the paperwork requirements to document their work. The same could happen with a federal mandate. It would be a bitter irony if a work requirement becomes a vehicle to erase the Medicaid expansion's historic gains in extending health coverage to the working poor – in red places as well as blue.

NEW YORK (AP) — Opponents of President Donald Trump's administration took to the streets of communities large and small across the U.S. on Saturday, decrying what they see as threats to the nation's democratic ideals.

The disparate events ranged from a march through midtown Manhattan and a rally in front of the White House to a demonstration at a Massachusetts commemoration of “the shot heard 'round the world” on April 19, 1775, marking the start of the Revolutionary War 250 years ago. 

Thomas Bassford was among the demonstrators at the reenactment of the Battles of Lexington and Concord outside Boston. The 80-year-old retired mason from Maine said he believes Americans are under attack from their own government and need to stand up against it. 

“This is a very perilous time in America for liberty,” said Bassford, who was with his partner, daughter and two grandsons. “I wanted the boys to learn about the origins of this country and that sometimes we have to fight for freedom.”

In Denver, hundreds of protesters gathered at the Colorado State Capitol with banners expressing solidarity with immigrants and telling the Trump administration: “Hands Off!” People waved U.S. flags, some of them held upside down to signal distress.

Thousands of people also marched through downtown Portland, Oregon, while in San Francisco, hundreds spelled out the words “Impeach & Remove” on a sandy beach along the Pacific Ocean, also with an inverted U.S. flag. People walked through downtown Anchorage, Alaska, with handmade signs listing reasons why they were demonstrating, including one that one that read: “No sign is BIG enough to list ALL of the reasons I'm here!”

Elsewhere protests were planned outside Tesla car dealerships against billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk and his role in downsizing the federal government. Others organized more community service-oriented events such as food drives, teach-ins and volunteering at local shelters.

The protests come just two weeks after similar nationwide demonstrations. 

Organizers say they oppose what they call Trump's civil rights violations and constitutional violations, including efforts to deport scores of immigrants and to scale back the federal government by firing thousands of government workers and effectively shuttering entire agencies.

Some of the events drew on the spirit of the Revolutionary War, calling for “no kings” and resistance to tyranny. 

In Anchorage, a colonial reenactor in colonial garb held up a “No Kings” sign while the person next to him hoisted cardboard that read in part: “The Feudal Age is OVER.”

Boston resident George Bryant, who was among those at the Concord protest, said he is concerned that the president is creating a “police state.” He held a sign saying, “Trump fascist regime must go now!” 

“He's defying the courts. He's kidnapping students. He's eviscerating the checks and balances,” Bryant said. “This is fascism.”

In Washington, Bob Fasick, a 76-year-old retired federal employee from Springfield, Virginia, said he came out to the rally near the White House out of concern over threats to constitutionally protected due process rights, Social Security and other federal safety-net programs.

The Trump administration, among other things, has moved to shutter Social Security Administration field offices, cut funding for government health programs and scale back protections for transgender people.

“I cannot sit still knowing that if I don't do anything and everybody doesn't do something to change this, that the world that we collectively are leaving for the little children, for our neighbors is simply not one that I would want to live,” Fasick said.

In Columbia, South Carolina, several hundred people protested at the statehouse holding signs with slogans such as “Fight Fiercely, Harvard, Fight.” 

And in Manhattan, protesters rallied against continued deportations of immigrants as they marched from the New York Public Library north toward Central Park and past Trump Tower.

“No fear, no hate, no ICE in our state,” they chanted to a steady drumbeat, referring to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Marshall Green said he is most concerned that Trump invoked the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798 by claiming the country is at war with Venezuelan gangs linked to the South American nation's government, even though a recent U.S. intelligence assessment found no coordination between them. 

“Congress should be stepping up and saying no, we are not at war. You cannot use that,” said the 61-year-old from Morristown, New Jersey. “You cannot deport people without due process, and everyone in this country has the right to due process no matter what.”

Meanwhile Melinda Charles, of Connecticut, said she worries about “executive overreach,” citing clashes with the federal courts, Harvard University and other elite colleges.

“We're supposed to have three equal branches of government,” she said, “and to have the executive branch become so strong, I mean it's just unbelievable.”

Russell Westbrook may not be his triple-double machine, MVP self anymore, but on Saturday night, he turned back the clock.

Westbrook hit a key 3-pointer late in regulation and made the game-saving play with 10 seconds left in overtime when he forced a turnover to give the Denver Nuggets a 112-110 win in Game 1 of the first round of the playoffs against his former Los Angeles Clippers.

Westbrook has done just about everything there is to do for a Hall of Fame resume – the 36-year-old is a nine-time All-Star, MVP, two-time scoring champ, three-time assist leader, and averaged a triple-double four times.

Except win a title.

But, his mentality, and self-proclaimed job description, could help him check off that final box.

""My job is to, excuse my language, f--k s--t up,"" he said after the contest.

""That's who he is,"" MVP contender Nikola Jokic said after watching Westbrook hit an uncontested corner 3-pointer to give Denver a two-point lead late in regulation and then knocking the inbounds pass away from — and off of — former teammate James Harden with 9.6 seconds left in overtime to help seal Denver's win over the Los Angeles Clippers.

PACERS RACE PAST BUCKS, 117-98, TO TAKE 1-0 LEAD IN FIRST-ROUND PLAYOFF SERIES

""Russ is Russ,"" interim coach David Adelman said after improving to 4-0. ""Defensively, he's absolutely incredible. He was playing free safety out there. I thought a lot of the reasons why the turnovers happened, even if it wasn't him forcing it, (was) just the way he was roaming around and impacting the game.

""And then offensively ... he attacked,"" Adelman said. ""We maybe could have pulled it out and executed. But that's what Russ does. I don't think he's going to change after 17 years. If he sees somebody in front of him 1-on-1, he's going to attack. And then he made an enormous 3.""

Jokic scored 29 points and finished one rebound shy of a triple-double. Aaron Gordon added 25 points and Jamal Murray 21 as the Nuggets overcame a 15-point first-half deficit to power past the hottest team entering the playoffs.

The No. 5 seed Clippers' loss was their first since March 30 at Cleveland. They rolled into the playoffs having won 18 of 21, including their last eight.

A fully automated warehouse system is changing the way we shop for groceries.

Imagine a grocery store where your entire order is picked, packed and ready for delivery in just five minutes without a single human hand touching your food. 

This is exactly what's happening inside Ocado's revolutionary Hive, a fully automated warehouse system that's changing the way we shop for groceries.

At the core of Ocado's Customer Fulfilment Centres, or CFCs, is The Hive, a massive 3D grid filled with thousands of grocery products. 

STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS — SIGN UP FOR KURT'S THE CYBERGUY REPORT NOW

Picture fleets of robots or ""bots"" zipping around at speeds up to about 9 miles per hour, all coordinated by an AI-powered ""air traffic control"" system that talks to each bot ten times every second. These bots work together to pick and transport items, which are then packed by robotic arms with incredible precision and speed.

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

FOUR-LEGGED HYDROGEN-POWERED ROBOT YOU CAN ACTUALLY RIDE

The magic behind the Hive is Ocado's smart platform, which combines artificial intelligence, robotics and automation to tackle the unique challenges of online grocery shopping. Factors like tight profit margins, the wide variety of items customers order and the need to handle products at different temperatures all make online groceries a tough nut to crack. But Ocado has been developing this technology for over 20 years, and it shows.

Thanks to this platform, a 50-item grocery order can be picked and packed in just five minutes, six times faster than traditional methods. The robotic arms don't just blindly pack items. They use advanced computer vision and deep learning to make smart decisions on the fly, packing groceries densely and safely even without knowing what's coming next. 

And behind the scenes, Ocado uses digital twin technology, essentially a virtual replica of the warehouse, to simulate and optimize everything from customer demand to delivery routes. This means it can innovate quickly and reduce risks before making changes in the real world.

SMARTER DAIRY FARMS WHERE ROBOTS MILK THE COWS

The speed and scale of the Hive are truly game-changing. Orders that used to take over an hour to pick manually are now done in minutes, and many orders can be processed at the same time. Plus, Ocado's warehouses can offer up to 78% more products than a typical supermarket, giving customers a much wider selection tailored to their preferences. 

The system also helps reduce food waste dramatically. Ocado's waste rate is just a tiny fraction of the industry average, thanks to smart forecasting and precise inventory management.

Another big advantage is flexibility. The Hive's modular design means retailers can scale their operations up or down depending on their needs. Whether it's a huge warehouse serving an entire region or a smaller fulfillment center closer to customers for faster delivery, the technology adapts.

HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET 

Groceries picked and packed by an AI robot  (Ocado)

If you live in an area served by Kroger's delivery network in the U.S., you can order groceries through the Kroger website or app. Behind the scenes, your order is picked and packed by hundreds of AI-driven robots at a fulfillment center known as the Hive. Then, a Kroger associate delivers your groceries straight to your door, often in less time than a traditional delivery. This system is the result of a partnership between Ocado and Kroger, bringing advanced automation to American grocery delivery.

IS THIS ROBOT AFTER OUR HOSPITALITY, RETAIL AND HEALTHCARE JOBS?

What's exciting is that Ocado's innovations don't stop at grocery shopping. The same robotics, AI and automation principles are being explored for other uses, like vertical farming, assisted living, car parking and even airport baggage handling. The Hive is paving the way for smarter, more automated logistics across many industries.

Cybercriminals are sending fake meeting invitations that seem legitimate.

Cybercriminals are constantly finding new ways to steal your data. As people become more aware of common threats like phishing links, fake websites, fraudulent emails and impersonation scams, attackers are becoming more creative in their approach.

One of the newer methods they are using involves targeting USB flash drives. It may seem surprising that they would focus on something as simple as a flash drive, but the data it holds can be valuable. 

Plus, flash drives can be used to spread malware to other devices.

USB drives are ubiquitous in workplaces, especially in environments with air-gapped systems or restricted internet access, such as those in government and energy sectors. This makes them an easy target for data theft and malware propagation. Often, these drives store sensitive files that are not available on networked systems. 

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

When infected, USB drives can spread malware not just within a single organization but also across multiple entities if shared. These attacks don't rely on network vulnerabilities, allowing them to bypass traditional security tools. 

USB Flash drive plugged into a laptop  (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)

200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH 

As reported by Kaspersky's Securelist, a cybersecurity research platform, hackers are using USB drives to spread malware in ways that can easily bypass traditional security systems. One group, known as GOFFEE, kicks off its attacks with targeted phishing emails. These emails often carry infected RAR files or Office documents with harmful macros. Once opened, they install sneaky programs like PowerModul and PowerTaskel on the victim's system.

These tools don't just sit around. They lay the groundwork for more attacks. PowerModul, in particular, plays a big role. It's a PowerShell script introduced in 2024 that talks to a command-and-control (C2) server. From there, it can download and run other tools, including two especially dangerous ones, FlashFileGrabber and USB Worm.

FlashFileGrabber is made to steal data from USB drives. It can either save stolen files locally or send them back to the hacker's server. Then there's USB Worm, which infects any USB drive it finds with PowerModul, turning that drive into a tool for spreading malware to other systems.

What makes this method effective is that USB drives are often shared between people and offices. That physical movement allows the malware to spread even without an internet connection. The malware hides original files on the USB and replaces them with malicious scripts disguised as normal-looking shortcuts. When someone clicks one of these, they unknowingly trigger the infection.

Illustration of a hacker at work  (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)

MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT

1. Don't plug in unknown USB drives: It might sound obvious, but this is one of the most common ways malware spreads. If you find a USB drive lying around or someone gives you one you weren't expecting, avoid plugging it into your system. Attackers often rely on human curiosity to get the malware onto your machine.

2. Be extra cautious with email attachments: GOFFEE's campaigns often begin with phishing emails carrying malicious RAR files or Office documents with macros. Always double-check the sender's address and never open unexpected attachments, especially if they ask you to ""enable macros"" or come from unknown contacts. When in doubt, confirm through a different channel.

3. Avoid clicking on suspicious links and use strong antivirus software: Many attacks like GOFFEE's start with emails that look legitimate but contain malicious links. These links might lead you to fake login pages or silently download malware that sets the stage for USB-targeting tools like PowerModul.

The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.

4. Scan USB drives before use: The USB Worm infects USB drives by hiding original files and planting malicious scripts disguised as shortcuts, which trigger PowerModul when clicked. FlashFileGrabber also steals files silently from USBs, often going unnoticed. Always scan USB drives with updated antivirus software before opening any files. Use a reputable security tool to check for hidden scripts, unusual shortcuts or unexpected executables. If files appear renamed or hidden, don't click them until verified safe. 

DATA REMOVAL DOES WHAT VPNS DON'T: HERE'S WHY YOU NEED BOTH 

Cybercriminals thrive where convenience meets oversight. However, it's worth considering why USBs remain such a soft target. They're not just storage but a cultural artifact of workplaces, especially in high-stakes sectors like energy or government, where offline data transfer feels safer than the cloud. But that trust is a blind spot. Attackers like GOFFEE don't need zero days because they can exploit human habits such as sharing drives, skipping scans and clicking without thinking.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Hitler's Terrible Tariffs","https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/04/nazi-germany-tariffs-trade/682521/","Sun, 20 Apr 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

By seeking to “liberate” Germans from a globalized world order, the Nazi government sent the national economy careening backwards—and drove up the price of eggs 600 percent.

From almost the moment Adolf Hitler took office as chancellor of Germany, tariffs were at the top of his government's economic agenda. The agricultural sector's demands for higher tariffs “must be met,” Hitler's economic minister, Alfred Hugenberg, declared on Wednesday, February 1, 1933, just over 48 hours into Hitler's chancellorship, “while at the same time preventing harm to industry.” Foreign Minister Konstantin von Neurath was concerned about lumber imports from Austria and a 200-million-Reichsmark trade deal with Russia. With several trade agreements about to expire, Hitler's finance minister, Count Johann Ludwig Graf Schwerin von Krosigk, insisted that “immediate decisions” needed to be made. Hitler told his cabinet he had only one priority—to avoid “unacceptable unrest” in advance of the March 5 Reichstag elections, which he saw as key to his hold on power.

Hitler had what one might call a diffident, occasionally felonious disregard for financial matters. He owed 400,000 reichsmarks in back taxes. His understanding of economics was primitive. “You have inflation only if you want it,” Hitler once said. “Inflation is a lack of discipline. I will see to it that prices remain stable. I have my S.A. for that.” (The S.A., or Brownshirts, were the original paramilitary organization associated with the Nazi Party.) Hitler held Jews responsible for most of Germany's financial woes.

Hitler relied on Gottfried Feder, the National Socialist Party's long-serving chief economist, to develop the specifics of an economic program. Feder had helped concoct the strange brew of socialism and fanatical nationalism in the original 25-point program of this putative “workers' party.” In May 1932, Feder outlined what would become the first Nazi economic plan, in a 32-page position paper designed for ready implementation were Hitler to suddenly find himself in power. High on Feder's agenda for a Hitler economy were tariffs.

“National Socialism demands that the needs of German workers no longer be supplied by Soviet slaves, Chinese coolies, and Negroes,” Feder wrote. Germany needed German workers and farmers producing German goods for German consumers. Feder saw “import restrictions” as key to returning the German economy to the Germans. “National Socialism opposes the liberal world economy, as well as the Marxist world economy,” Feder wrote. Our fellow Germans must “be protected from foreign competition.”

Even though Hitler's own foreign minister, Konstantin von Neurath, was concerned that the strategy would spark a trade war, and could drive up the price of imported eggs by 600 percent, Feder's tariffs fit into Hitler's larger vision for “liberating” the German people from the shackles of a globalized world order.

The crash of 1929 had plunged Germany, along with much of the rest of the world, into an abyss. Markets collapsed. Factories were idled. Unemployment soared. In the early 1930s, one out of three German workers was unemployed. But Hitler had inherited a recovering economy: In December 1932, the German Institute for Economic Research reported that the crisis had been “significantly overcome”; by the time Hitler was appointed chancellor, in January 1933, the economy was on the mend.

Thus Hitler's main economic task as chancellor was not to mess things up. The German stock market had rallied on news of his coming to power. “The Boerse recovered today from its weakness when it learned of Adolf Hitler's appointment, an outright boom extending over the greater part of stocks,” The New York Times reported.

But rumors of potential tariffs and the abrogation of international agreements, along with Hitler's challenges to the constitutional order, sent alarm bells clanging. The conservative Centre Party warned Hitler against “unconstitutional, economically harmful, socially reactionary and currency endangering experiments.” Eduard Hamm, a former economics minister who served on the board of the German Industry and Trade Association, dispatched a stern letter to the new chancellor instructing him on the “legal, economic and psychological prerequisites for building capital.” The free-market system, Hamm reminded Hitler, was based on trust, the rule of law, and adherence to contractual obligations.

Hamm went on to explain that even though Germany imported more agricultural products than it exported to its European neighbors, these countries provided markets for German industrial production. (At the time, Germany imported on average 1.5 billion reichsmarks annually in agricultural products, while exporting an average 5.5 billion reichsmarks in industrial and manufactured goods.) “The maintenance of export relations to these countries is a mandatory requirement,” Hamm wrote. If one were to “strangle” trade through tariffs, it would endanger German industrial production—which, in turn, would inflict severe self-harm on the German economy, and lead to increased unemployment. “Exporting German goods provides three million workers with jobs,” Hamm wrote. The last thing Germany's recovering but still-fragile economy needed was a trade war. Hamm urged Hitler to exercise “greatest caution” in his tariff policies.

But Hitler made no effort to reassure the markets, insisting that the tariffs were necessary and that he needed time to fix the ruined country his predecessors had left him. “Within four years the German farmer must be saved from destitution,” Hitler said in his first national radio address as chancellor. “Within four years unemployment must be completely overcome.” Hitler provided scant details as to how this was to be accomplished. By this point, he had broken even with the tariff cheerleader Feder, and had abandoned most of the action items for developing a nationalist and socialist economy. These items had included increased taxation of the wealthy; state supervision of large corporations; and the prohibition of “new department stores, low-priced shops, and chain stores.”

As chancellor, Hitler left his own plans for the German economy intentionally vague. His chief priority, as he told his ministers, was to secure an outright majority in the March 5 Reichstag elections. Hitler calculated that he needed between 18 million and 19 million votes. “There is no economic program that could meet with the approval of such a large mass of voters,” Hitler told party leaders.

But although the average voter may not have cared about the details of the Hitler economy, the markets did. The initial surge in stocks that greeted Hitler's appointment halted then dipped and flattened amid the political and economic uncertainty of Hitler's chaotic first weeks as chancellor. The German Industry and Trade Association issued a public warning on tariffs. “Germany has the largest export surplus of all major trading countries,” the association reported. “This situation calls for double caution in trade policy measures that could lead to countermeasures.”

Hans Joachim von Rohr, who worked at the Reich's nutrition ministry, went on national radio to explain the logic of Hitler's tariff strategy. “The products that Germany lacks must be made more expensive; then farmers will produce them in sufficient quantities,” Rohr explained. “And if foreign competition is kept at bay by tariffs and the like, city residents will prefer domestic production.” Rohr offered lard—“Schmalz”—as an example.

If Germany raised the import duty on Schmalz, a staple of the German diet, the German farmer would be motivated by the price increase to raise “three-hundred-pound pigs,” the main source of lard, instead of the more common “two-hundred-pound pigs,” the major source of bacon. The problem, as one critic observed, was that bacon was more lucrative than lard, even as “lard pigs” consumed more feed than “bacon pigs.” Switching from bacon pigs to lard pigs, this critic calculated, would ultimately drive the pig farmer into bankruptcy. He noted further that the international trading system had been in place for 200 years and proved itself beneficial to all parties. Hitler's proposed “national economy,” with its self-defeating tariff policies, would plunge the country into a “severe crisis” that could cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. And that was even before any damage wreaked by retaliatory tariffs.

The Hitler tariffs, announced on Friday, February 10, 1933, stunned observers. “The dimension of the tariff increases have in fact exceeded all expectations,” the Vossische Zeitung wrote disapprovingly, proclaiming the moment a “fork in the road” for the German economy. It appeared that Europe's largest and most industrialized nation would suddenly be returning “to the furrow and the plow.” The New York Times saw this for what it was: “a trade war” against its European neighbors.

The primary targets of the Hitler tariffs—the Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands—were outraged by the sudden suspension of favored-nation trading status on virtually all agricultural products, as well as on textiles, with tariffs in some cases rising 500 percent. With its livestock essentially banished from the German market, Denmark, for example, was facing substantial losses. Farmers panicked. The Danes and Swedes threatened “retaliatory measures,” as did the Dutch, who warned the Germans that the countermeasures would be felt as “palpable blows” to German industrial exports. That proved to be true.

Read: Worse than Signalgate

“Our exports have shrunk significantly,” Foreign Minister Neurath informed Hitler in one cabinet meeting, “and our relations to our neighboring countries are threatening to deteriorate.” Neurath noted that informal contacts with Dutch interlocutors had been “bruskly broken off.” Trade relations with Sweden and Denmark were similarly strained, as were those with France and Yugoslavia. Finance Minister Krosigk anticipated that the agricultural sector would require an additional 100 million reichsmarks in deficit spending.

Hitler launched his trade war on the second Friday of his chancellorship. That evening, he appeared in the Berlin Sportpalast, the city's largest venue, for a rally in front of thousands of jubilant followers. It was his first public appearance as chancellor, and it served as a victory lap. Hitler dispensed with the dark suit he wore in cabinet meetings in favor of his brown storm-trooper uniform with a bright-red swastika armband.

In his address, Hitler declared that the entire country needed to be rebuilt after years of mismanagement by previous governments. He spoke of the “sheer madness” of international obligations imposed by the Treaty of Versailles, of the need to restore “life, liberty, and happiness” to the German people, of the need for “cleansing” the bureaucracy, public life, culture, the population, “every aspect of our life.” His tariff regime, he implied, would help restore the pride and honor of German self-reliance.

“Never believe in help from abroad, never on help from outside our own nation, our own people,” Hitler said. “The future of the German people is to be found in our own selves.”

Hitler did not refer specifically to the trade war he had launched that afternoon, just as he did not mention the rearmament plans he had discussed with his cabinet the previous day. “Billions of reichsmarks are needed for rearmament,” Hitler had told his ministers in that meeting. “The future of Germany depends solely and exclusively on the rebuilding of the army.” Hitler's trade war with his neighbors would prove to be but a prelude to his shooting war with the world.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Some Canadian stores are labeling US imports with a T for 'tariffs' — and buyers are snapping up alternatives","https://www.businessinsider.com/canadian-stores-labeling-american-imports-consumers-responding-patriotism-trump-tariffs-2025-4","Sun, 20 Apr 2025 02:32:00 GMT","

Some Canadian retailers aren't playing nice about US imports anymore. They've escalated from simply labeling products made in Canada to singling out American-made products with a warning label ""T"" for ""tariffs.""

Loblaw Companies Ltd., which operates about 2,400 stores across Canada, announced on March 10 that it planned to roll out the 'T' label on US-imported goods that may have been subject to a tariff-related price increase. As the warning labels have been slowly rolled out over the last month, shoppers have noticed and are buying accordingly.

An April 17 Leger poll found that 76% of Canadians have increased their purchases of locally made and sourced goods in recent weeks, representing the highest number of respondents looking to buy Canadian goods since the market research firm began tracking the behavior in mid-February.

Business Insider previously reported that Canadians have seen a surge in patriotism since President Donald Trump, in mid-March, made comments about making the 158-year-old nation the 51st US state — and that patriotism is reflected in the grocery aisle.

""All the grocery stores now have Canadian and American labelled produce — and the Canadian produce is always gone,"" Vancouver-based shopper Isabella Zavarise told BI.

It's not just a preference for Canadian-made goods; it's an active avoidance of US imports, Zavarise said. And the preference isn't about saving money — quite the opposite: ""Everyone I know is shopping local despite how expensive it is,"" she added.

The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported that small grocery stores, in particular, are seeing price increases related to the tariffs being exchanged between the US and Canada, and the country's consumer price index rose 2.3% year over year in March, following an increase of 2.6% in February.

Prices of American imports have skyrocketed — 100ml of Tropicana orange juice is listed for $13.99 at Metro stores, another Canadian chain — but even locally-made goods have seen increases, the outlet reported.

The US and its Northern neighbor have been locked in an escalating trade dispute over Trump's aggressive trade strategy, which, as of March 13, levied tariffs of 25% on many Canadian consumer goods and 10% on energy product imports from Canada.

Canada announced 25% counter-tariffs on US goods in response.

Representatives for Loblaw and Metro did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Step inside one of SF's oldest hacker houses, where founders have slept in tents and closets while raising $2 billion in VC funding","https://www.businessinsider.com/san-francisco-oldest-hacker-house-startups-2025-4","Sun, 20 Apr 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

As other San Francisco hacker houses lure young founders with promises of glitzy megamansions and catered food, one of the city's oldest houses, Mission Control, remains proudly no-frills.

""It is not the Four Seasons,"" resident Conor Brennan-Burke said. ""We select for people who have grit.""

Brennan-Burke was giving me a tour of Mission Control on a recent afternoon. When I first heard the name, I pictured something sleek and futuristic. That was quickly dispelled when my Uber dropped me off on a noisy street in the Mission District and I walked up to an entrance sandwiched between an abandoned storefront and a graffiti mural.

When I walked inside and slipped off my shoes, as everyone is required to do, I met Lisa Shmulyan, who has lived here since 2020. As frequently happens, all 10 bedrooms were occupied, but Shmulyan was so eager for a spot that she lived in a tent in the living room for a month before a room opened up.

""There was someone living in the closet, someone else on the patio in a shed,"" she said. ""But it didn't matter. You're surrounded by people doing incredible things. That energy is hard to find anywhere else.""​

Mission Control was founded by a group of former Thiel fellows in 2013. Since then, other houses like Chez JJ and Negev have disbanded as newer entrants offering far more accoutrements, like AGI House and HFO Residency, have soaked up more buzz.

Mission Control endures, in spite of or perhaps because it operates as a commune. Everything from the furniture to the event schedule is decided by vote.

""It's lasted 12 years without a board and without a manager,"" Brennan-Burke said. ""It's been passed down peer-to-peer, generation to generation.""

He estimates that during that time, residents have raised over $2 billion and created companies worth more than $200 billion.

Alums include Kashish Gupta, Tejas Manohar, and Josh Curl, the cofounders of Hightouch, an AI marketing company which recently raised $80 million at a $1.2 billion valuation. They all met in the house.

""Josh lived in the closet for six months, and now he's the CEO of a unicorn,"" Brennan-Burke said.

Marty Kausus, cofounder and CEO of a16z and General Catalyst-backed b2b support platform Pylon, also lived here, along with ScaleAI co-founder and Passes CEO Lucy Guo.

Mission Control recently expanded, opening a ""Satellite"" on the same block for shorter-term stays that can also serve as a trial period to determine if someone is a good fit.

Residents of the main house are raising their own venture fund, Mission Street Capital, to back other residents and alums, and VCs from famous firms like Sequoia and Andreessen Horowitz recently paid visits.

Cost is certainly part of the appeal; rent for one of the 10 bedrooms is around $1600, around half of what it would typically cost to rent a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco. But many residents have chosen to stay even after raising their Series A funding round.

""I think ultimately the reason that people stay, even though maybe they could live in a nicer place, is just a really strong community,"" said Shmulyan. ""This is a house where people are doing their life's work, and doing it side by side with each other.""

When I walked upstairs, a dozen current and former residents were bunched together in the living room, sipping Diet Cokes and coding on their MacBooks.

COVID proved people can work from anywhere, but far from making hacker houses like this one obsolete, the residents here said the pandemic made them more in demand than ever, especially as the outside world has become more unstable.

""It's a natural human instinct to find connections when there's confusion and crisis,"" said Chase Changhee Seon, who came to Mission Control from Seoul to start an events and community platform. ""Even in this world of tech and AI, you cannot replace human connections.""

At first glance, the 6400-square-foot interior somewhat resembles a frat house, with a random bench press no one seems to use in the hallway and mismatched furniture that has seen better days.

But there are key differences. There are no TVs, and everything from the kitchen to the bathrooms is immaculately clean thanks to cleaners who come every week. And almost no one in the house drinks any alcohol.

""It's not a party house,"" Brennan-Burke said. ""We drink tea, build stuff, and hang out.""

There is no cold application to get into Mission Control. You have to know someone in the house who is willing to advocate for you, and even then, the odds are long, with less than 3% of prospects making it through the extensive interview process.

When I met residents, I was surprised to learn how many are not currently working on any startup, and the interview criteria reflect that. Who you are and whether you seem like you will vibe with the other inhabitants matter much more than the particulars of what you are building.

""People have moved here with nothing,"" Brennan-Burke said. ""They had no idea, no cofounder. Just ambition. That's what we select for.""

One thing that gets a major red flag: Being an influencer.

""People don't come here for clout,"" Schulyan said. ""They come here to build. It only works when you filter for authenticity.""

Before I left, I met Jessica Gerwin, who was selected to move into Mission Control last year after becoming known in San Francisco's startup scene for hosting lively dinner parties. She is now building Socrates Lab, an AI agent startup. She says such a massive understanding would have seemed fanciful in the Los Angeles apartment she was living in before, but now she is putting in 80-hour workdays at Mission Control to see it come to fruition.

""You have to be somewhat delusional to want to change the world in the ways that founders do, and so there's something special about surrounding yourself with other people who don't bat an eye when you're trying to do the same thing,"" Gerwin said. ""Everyone here will be at my wedding and my IPO.""

Many U.S. companies have expressed concern, or even anger, about the wide-ranging tariffs recently announced by President Donald Trump, which economists say threaten to increase their companies' costs and result in higher prices for consumers.

The tariffs, and the back-and-forth nature of their rollout, has spurred ""panic-buying"" of a wide range of products that could face price surges in the coming months, according to a Reuters report on Wednesday that cited U.S. Commerce Department data.

The CEO of Back Market, an online marketplace for used and refurbished tech devices, says he's witnessed the sales jump firsthand. Back Market saw its sales triple over a single week in the wake of Trump's tariffs announcements, says Thibaud Hug de Larauze.

""Maybe some people rushed into [replacing their smartphones or computers] earlier, because they were afraid it's going to cost so much more weeks from now,"" Hug de Larauze, who also co-founded the company, says.

Most smartphones and computers are manufactured in China, which currently faces a 145% total tariff rate on goods imported to the United States. Trump issued a temporary exemption for those products on April 11, but subsequently announced plans to introduce specific tariffs targeting electronics that could take effect as soon as May.

Hug de Larauze's takeaway from Back Market's boom week: More Americans could start opting for used or refurbished devices, if Trump's tariffs raise prices on new electronics for the foreseeable future. ""This is a big opportunity to change the way American people consume this stuff, because the incentive has never been as high to avoid those tariffs,"" he says.

Some analysts agree with Hug de Larauze's observation. Prolonged tariffs could cause a ""huge uptick"" in short-term sales of used and refurbished devices, especially smartphones, says Dan Ives, Wedbush Securities global head of technology research.

Companies like Apple might need to increase their prices by hundreds of dollars per product — if not more — depending on the eventual electronics-specific tariffs, other analysts estimate.

Currently, enough Americans prioritize replacing their devices with brand-new ones that Back Market only sells about one-third of its stock in the U.S., says Hug de Larauze.

That ratio could flip once tariffs are implemented, he says: ""What I'm expecting with the tariffs is that this is going to change [to] two-thirds being sold to U.S. customers, because there's incentives, definitely, to save money when you already need a product.""

Of course, the timeline is unpredictable. Trump's impending electronics tariffs could last for days, weeks or months — or never take effect at all.

Long-term, Ives suspects that the typical American consumer might settle for a used or refurbished device for now, but return to buying new tech once their wallets allow it.

""We believe 80% to 90% of consumers like buying a new smartphone [and] buying behavior is hard to change,"" Ives says.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia on Sunday of creating a false appearance of honoring an Easter ceasefire, saying Moscow continued to launch attacks overnight after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a unilateral temporary truce in Ukraine.

""As of Easter morning, we can say that the Russian army is trying to create a general impression of a ceasefire, but in some places, it does not abandon individual attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine,"" Zelenskyy said in a post on X.

Despite Putin's declaration of an Easter ceasefire on Saturday, Zelenskyy said Ukrainian forces had recorded 59 instances of Russian shelling and five assaults by units across various areas along the front line, as well as ""dozens"" of drone strikes.

Zelenskyy emphasized that Russia must fully adhere to the ceasefire conditions and reiterated Ukraine's offer to extend the truce for 30 days, starting Sunday midnight.

He said the proposal ""remains on the table"" and that ""we will act in accordance with the actual situation on the ground.""

Late on Saturday, Russia-installed officials in the partially occupied Ukrainian region of Kherson said Ukrainian forces continued their attacks.

""Ukrainian troops continue to strike peaceful cities in the Kherson region, violating the Easter truce,"" Moscow-appointed governor Vladimir Saldo wrote on his Telegram channel.

Just hours after the Russian president announced the ceasefire, he attended an Easter service late Saturday at Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Saviour led by Patriarch Kirill, head of the Russian Orthodox Church and a vocal supporter of Putin and the war in Ukraine.

Putin announced the temporary ceasefire, citing humanitarian reasons. According to the Kremlin, the ceasefire will last from 6 p.m. Moscow time (1500 GMT) on Saturday to midnight (2100 GMT) following Easter Sunday.

Putin offered no details on how the ceasefire would be monitored or whether it would cover airstrikes or ongoing ground battles that rage around the clock.

His ceasefire announcement came after U.S. President Donald Trump said Friday negotiations between Ukraine and Russia are ""coming to a head"" and insisted that neither side is ""playing"" him in his push to end the grinding three-year war.

In a recent social media post, Strategy founder Michael Saylor stated that Bitcoin has no counterparty risk.

""No company. No country. No creditor. No currency. No competitor. No culture. Not even chaos,"" he said.

This echoes the point that Saylor made during his appearance on CNBC in late 2024. He stated that the leading cryptocurrency was suitable for those investors who did not want to be a counterparty to ""a country, a currency, a city, a company, a commodity, or a culture.""

Being exposed to counterparty risks means that the other party might fail to fulfill its obligations. Meanwhile, Bitcoin acts as self-sovereign money that is not dependent on the particular policy of a corporation or government.

Ironically, even though Bitcoin tends to be perceived as a risky cryptocurrency, it is all about people actually trying to avoid counterparty risks, according to Saylor. Such investors, according to the billionaire, do not want to guess whether Picasso paintings, Manhattan real estate, or the Nvidia stock will be more expensive 10 years from now.

Saylor has repeatedly stressed that he is 100% Bitcoin-only to the point where he would not even recommend the Apple (APPL) stock. ""I would not recommend a security because there is a counterparty to a security,"" Saylor told the PBD podcast five months ago. ""It's not because I am not in favor of your business…I think you have to stay in your lane. I am not going to give you a recommendation on diet or politics, or any particular investment…"" he stressed.

ByBilly Bambrough,

 Senior Contributor. 

Bitcoin and crypto prices are treading water after U.S. president Donald Trump's trade war sparked market chaos that's threatening to spiral into a full-blown “U.S. dollar confidence crisis.”

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can ""uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!""

The bitcoin price has plummeted from its January peak of almost $110,000 per bitcoin, dropping along with the stock market, as crypto hurtles toward a $19 trillion “tipping point.”

Now, as billionaire Ray Dalio warns the U.S. is teetering on the verge of a financial crisis and recession that could be worse than 2008, the White House has confirmed Trump is exploring whether he can fire Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell—something that could trigger an “apocalyptic scenario"" for markets.

“The president and his team will continue to study that matter,” Kevin Hassett, Trump's economic adviser, told reporters at the White House when asked if firing the Fed chair was an option and if Trump has the authority to remove Powell.

This week, Trump posted to his Truth Social account that “Powell's termination cannot come fast enough” after Powell reiterated his intention to keep interest rates on hold due to uncertainty over Trump's tariff trade war.

Last month, influential Democratic Party senator Elizabeth Warren said Trump could try to fire Powell, ominously warning, “nobody is safe.”

“It would be a huge, huge shock,” Bilal Hafeez, chief executive of investment research company Macro Hive, told The Telegraph newspaper. “Overall, it would almost be like an apocalyptic scenario for the market.”

Trump's barrage of global trade tariffs have blown up the established order of international trade, fuelling market uncertainty and driving investors out of risk assets such as bitcoin and crypto.

The bitcoin price has diverged from gold, which has rocketed to all-time highs as traders flee to the traditional safe haven, though some have predicted bitcoin will ultimately benefit and begin trading as “digital gold.”

“Powell continues to sit on the fence with the ‘we'll wait and see' approach because he still believes tariffs will lead to higher inflation,” bitcoin and crypto investor Lark Davis wrote in his Wealth Mastery newsletter.

""Only time will tell but firing Powell risks bringing even more uncertainty to markets. However, intervention of some kind will be needed at some point, whether it's rate cuts, quantitative easing or Trump softens. Or a mix. It's a matter of when, not if.”","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Best-selling author Robert Kiyosaki says Bitcoin (BTC) will benefit in a massive way from an impending economic cataclysm.

In a post on the social media platform X, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author says the USA may be headed for a “greater depression” that will put millions into poverty.

However, Kiyosaki also says that there will be a few who decide to accumulate gold, silver and BTC, and they will come out of the economic collapse as the “new rich.”

Kiyosaki lays out massive, ten-year price predictions for Bitcoin and the precious metals.

“If a poor person bought a few ounces of gold or silver, or 1/2 of a Bitcoin…. I predict they may become the new rich….once this Depression is over.

I strongly believe, by 2035, that one Bitcoin will be over $1 million. Gold will be $30,000 and silver $3,000 a coin.

It will be the easiest money you ever made.

Those who wait in fear….may be the biggest losers.

This coming Great Depression will cause millions to be poor….and a few who take action, may enjoy great wealth and freedom.

The giant crash I predicted….the crash that is occurring now….may be the opportunity of your lifetime….to achieve great wealth and more importantly….financial freedom.

Please don't waste this giant crash.”

At time of writing, BTC is trading at $85,496.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Best Crypto Presales to Buy During the Ethereum Dip","https://bitcoinist.com/best-crypto-presales-now-that-ethereums-in-buy-zone/","Sun, 20 Apr 2025 10:51:48 GMT","

Ethereum ($ETH) just slipped into what analysts are calling a historic buy zone. Its price dipped below a key level that's acted as support during some of the market's biggest rebounds.

At the same time, Solana ($SOL) is standing strong around the $139 mark, outperforming most other major altcoins. Quiet accumulation is happening under the radar, and smart money is clearly paying attention.

When Ethereum is showing potential for a bounce and Solana is holding its ground, it usually means one thing: the altcoin market is about to get interesting.

So let's talk about three of the best crypto presales with explosive potential as Ethereum starts climbing again.

Ethereum's current dip isn't your typical market weakness. It's happening in a price range that's historically triggered large rebounds. These are the accumulation zones where long-term investors quietly load up, betting on the next breakout.

According to top crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Ethereum is now trading in the same zone that previously marked five major price bottoms – making it a potential launchpad for a rally.



That kind of signal doesn't come often, and it's turning heads across the market.

Meanwhile, Solana's strength during this dip is catching attention. It's not just holding the line – it's actually outperforming. That kind of resilience during a market lull often signals leadership in the next rally.

And when the two biggest smart contract platforms start showing momentum, top altcoins tend to follow fast.

Best Wallet Token ($BEST) isn't just another utility token – it's the key to unlocking a smarter, safer, and more rewarding crypto experience.

Launched exclusively through the Best Wallet app, $BEST is designed to power a rapidly growing ecosystem that's already challenging outdated tools like MetaMask.

Token holders enjoy reduced transaction fees, higher staking rewards, early access to new crypto projects, and even exclusive bonuses through Best Wallet's iGaming partnerships – think free spins, lootboxes, and top-tier deposit perks.

You also get governance rights, meaning $BEST holders have a real say in how the ecosystem evolves. Best Wallet itself is growing fast, with a over 60K followers-strong community on X and consistent 50% month-on-month user growth.

Its standout feature, ‘Upcoming Tokens,' gives $BEST users secure, in-app access to vetted presales – no more scammy mirror sites.



Right now, you can buy $BEST for $0.0248, with over $11.7M raised in its presale, $BEST is gaining serious momentum.

As Ethereum rebounds and infrastructure becomes more critical, $BEST stands out as a utility-packed token at the heart of one of crypto's most ambitious wallet platforms.

SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is shaking up the creator economy with a bold, AI-powered vision for Web3. ​​Right now, you can buy the token for $0.0552, with over $205K raised in presale – early numbers that hint at big upside as the platform gains traction.



Some forecasts even suggest the $SUBBD price could reach up to $0.3 in 2025 and as high as $2.50 by 2030, reflecting strong long-term potential.

At its core, $SUBBD is a token build on a platform that lets creators ditch the middlemen and take control of their income.

Whether it's art, videos, blogs, or spicy behind-the-scenes content, $SUBBD gives creators the tools to tokenize their work, engage directly with fans, and monetize like never before.

Fans can even generate their own AI-enhanced photos or videos inspired by their favorite influencers – with creator approval. It's like if OnlyFans, Patreon, and Midjourney had a very productive baby.

With over 250M combined followers across its brand network, $SUBBD already has the reach to go big.

And it's backed by fast, borderless crypto payments and smart staking perks – subscribers and creators both benefit from holding and using $SUBBD.

As $ETH rebounds and content ownership goes crypto, $SUBBD could become a breakout star.

Qubetics ($TICS) is redefining what a Layer 1 blockchain can be. Rather than operating in isolation, it serves as a unifying platform that connects major networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.

This approach addresses the fragmentation in the blockchain space, enabling seamless asset and data transfers across ecosystems.



At the heart of Qubetics is the $TICS token, currently in presale at $0.17298392, with over $16M raised so far.

$TICS powers transactions, staking, and governance within the network, ensuring efficient and secure interactions across the platform.

Qubetics offers a suite of integrated tools designed for both users and developers. The Qubetics Wallet provides a non-custodial, multi-chain experience, allowing users to manage assets across various blockchains.

Security and privacy are also central to Qubetics' mission. The platform includes a decentralized VPN service, enhancing user privacy and protection.

Qubetics also focuses on real-world asset tokenization, opening up new opportunities for investment and on-chain asset management.

With its wide-reaching utility and strong infrastructure focus, Qubetics is well-positioned to ride the next wave of adoption.

With Ethereum dipping into a prime buy zone and Solana showing surprising strength, the stage is set for a potential altcoin breakout. This is the kind of moment where early positioning can make all the difference.

Whether it's infrastructure with $BEST, creator monetization with $SUBBD, or cross-chain privacy with $TICS, these tokens each ride a different wave of the recovery narrative. If the rally kicks off, they won't stay under the radar for long.

Ethereum is currently trading at a critical resistance level as bulls attempt to regain momentum and push for a fresh high. The broader market remains under pressure as global uncertainty escalates, largely fueled by ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China. Last week, US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day tariff pause on all countries except China, intensifying concerns about an extended trade conflict that could destabilize global financial markets.

In this high-stakes environment, Ethereum's price action is drawing close attention from investors and analysts. Top crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared that historically, the best Ethereum buying opportunities have emerged when the price drops below the lower MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Price Band—a level that signals potential undervaluation. Notably, ETH is now trading precisely in that zone.

This alignment between technical conditions and macroeconomic instability suggests that Ethereum could be entering a phase of accumulation, with long-term investors looking to capitalize on discounted prices. However, sustained upward momentum will depend on whether bulls can overcome immediate resistance and whether macro conditions improve. The coming days could prove pivotal for ETH as it tests both technical and psychological thresholds.

Ethereum Dips Into Historical Opportunity Zone

Ethereum is currently trading below key resistance levels after enduring several weeks of selling pressure and weak market performance. Since losing the crucial $2,000 support level, ETH has fallen roughly 21%, a clear indication that bulls have yet to regain control. Broader macroeconomic pressures, especially rising global tensions and uncertain trade conditions between the US and China, have further dampened market sentiment. These conditions have driven many investors to exit riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, leading to elevated volatility and reduced market participation.

Despite this downtrend, some analysts believe Ethereum could be nearing a pivotal turnaround zone. According to Martinez, one of the best historical signals for Ethereum accumulation has been price action dipping below the lower bound of the MVRV Price Band—a metric that compares market value to realized value to assess whether an asset is over- or undervalued. Currently, Ethereum is trading beneath that lower band.

Martinez emphasizes that this positioning has typically preceded strong upside reversals, especially during periods of extreme market pessimism. While short-term volatility may persist, ETH's entry into this zone could present a rare opportunity for long-term investors to accumulate at historically discounted levels—if market conditions stabilize and sentiment shifts.

ETH Stalls In Tight Range

Ethereum is currently trading at $1,610 after nearly a week of low volatility and sideways action. Since last Tuesday, ETH has remained locked in a tight range between $1,550 and $1,630, reflecting the market's uncertainty and hesitation to take a clear directional stance. This narrow trading zone highlights a period of price compression, often a precursor to a larger move in either direction.

For bulls to regain momentum and shift sentiment, Ethereum must reclaim the $1,700 level and push decisively above the $2,000 mark. These levels not only serve as key psychological barriers but also represent critical zones of previous support that have now turned into resistance. A breakout above $2,000 would likely trigger renewed buying interest and set the stage for a potential recovery rally.

However, if bearish pressure builds and the $1,550 floor is breached, Ethereum could quickly test the $1,500 support zone. A breakdown below that level would confirm further downside risk, potentially accelerating sell-offs and deepening the current correction. Until a breakout or breakdown occurs, traders should prepare for more consolidation and volatility as the market awaits a macro or technical catalyst.

Tether, the biggest stablecoin in the cryptocurrency industry, is ‘printing' money as its revenue soars.

TokenTerminal data indicates that Tether (USDT) has generated $1.46 billion this year, a figure that is expected to surpass $1.5 billion within the next few weeks. 

Its revenues are significantly higher than other stablecoins and other large players in the crypto industry like Tron (TRX), Circle, Solana (SOL), and Ethereum (ETH).

Ethereum, which was the most profitable players in the crypto industry for a long time, has made just $157 million this year. Circle, the parent company of USD Coin (USDC), has made $620 million as it prepares for its initial public offering.

Solana has generated $159 million, largely driven by the growth of meme coins within its ecosystem. Tron is the second-largest player in the crypto industry, with its revenue nearing the $1 billion mark.

Tether's growth has continued this year as more people have embraced stablecoins. Data compiled by Visa shows that Tether's monthly volume stands at $266 billion in April. Its total transactions so far this year have exceeded $1.5 trillion. 

Tether's revenue has increased as the market cap of the stablecoin has continued to rise. There are now over $144 billion worth of USDT tokens in circulation, up from $109 billion a year earlier. 

Tether generates its profits by investing its funds primarily in Treasuries, which are often regarded as safe assets. US government bonds have generated higher yields in the past few years as interest rates have remained above average. It has just a handful of employees and operational costs, making it one of the most profitable companies in the world.

Tether's growth has also helped to mint several billionaires. Forbes estimates that Paolo Ardoino, who has a net worth of about $9.5 billion. Giancarlo Devasini, the biggest shareholder in Tether is worth about $22.4 billion, while Jean-Louis van der Velde is valued at $9.5 billion.

Tether has used its windfall to invest in several companies this year. It invested in firms like Fizen, Be Water, Adecoagro, Juventus Football Club, Rumble, Northern Data, Bitdeer Technologies Group, and Blacirock Neurotech.

Veteran trader Peter Brandt believes that risk assets such as the S&P 500, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) will see much lower levels by the end of the year.

Starting with the US stock market, Brandt tells his 792,500 followers on the social media platform X that the S&P 500 looks bearish after breaching support at 5,800 and retesting the level as resistance.

Brandt predicts that the S&P 500 will close the year slightly below 4,500 points.

“The Red Dots are where I think we end the year in 2025.”

As of Friday's close, the S&P 500 is trading at 5,282.

Looking at Bitcoin, Brandt sees BTC dropping to around the $50,000 price zone after violating a parabola that has kept Bitcoin bullish since 2023.

“Not my opinion, but it is what the chart suggests as possible.”

At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $85,280.

Turning to Ethereum, Brandt predicts that ETH will plummet to around $600 by the end of the year.

“ETHUSD”

At time of writing, ETH is worth $1,616.

As for gold, the trader thinks that the precious metal has more room to run to the upside this year. He shares a chart suggesting that gold has broken out of an ascending channel pattern and could hit prices close to $3,600.

An ascending channel indicates that an asset is in an uptrend as it prints higher highs and higher lows. A channel breakout suggests that an asset is in the midst of a strong bull market.

“Gold Finger, the market with the magic touch.”

Gold is worth $3,327 as of Friday's close.

Key Points

Is Bitcoin on the path to $250,000 this year?

In a recent podcast interview with CNBC, Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of both Ethereum and Cardano, suggested that Bitcoin (BTC -1.18%) could hit a price of $250,000 this year. That's an astounding 194% increase from its current price of $85,000.

So what makes Hoskinson so confident that Bitcoin is poised for a major rally in the second half of 2025?

The primary reason for optimism, says Hoskinson, is the growing rate of Bitcoin adoption. As he points out, there are now 659 million crypto users worldwide. That's up 13% on a year-over-year basis. Crypto is a truly global phenomenon, so even if Bitcoin adoption in the United States stalls out due to the slowing of economic growth, there is still demand for it worldwide.

Individual investors are embracing Bitcoin, and so are corporations. Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), the company formerly known as MicroStrategy, is leading the way. As of March 31, it held 528,185 Bitcoins worth nearly $45 billion at today's prices, making it the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world. A growing number of companies are starting to follow in its footsteps, with the goal of boosting their stock market valuations by adding Bitcoin to the balance sheet.

Image source: Getty Images.

And not to be outdone, sovereign governments are also getting into the mix. President Donald Trump, who made Bitcoin part of his platform during the 2024 election, has been looking for new ways that the federal government can integrate crypto into the financial system. The highest-profile move, of course, was the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in March.

Another key catalyst, says Hoskinson, is new crypto legislation in 2025 that will finally lay out the rules of the road for the crypto industry. The first major piece of legislation will be one related to stablecoins, which have grown into a $200 billion industry. The second major piece of legislation is the Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act.

These two new pieces of legislation are important because the U.S. currently does not have any comprehensive framework for crypto, and has been forced to rely on a policy of ""regulation by enforcement"" by the Securities and Exchange Commission. That's in sharp contrast to the rest of the world. The European Union, for example, recently put into place a comprehensive crypto framework called MiCA at the end of 2024.

This new legislation is vital for another important reason: It will theoretically make crypto safe enough for America's biggest corporations. In fact, Hoskinson thinks several of the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech companies could start to get involved with crypto as soon as the new legislation goes into effect.

As Hoskinson sees it, the biggest opportunities for the Magnificent Seven could be in stablecoins, which are pegged 1-to-1 to the U.S. dollar. These ""digital dollars"" could be the key to paying workers in different countries, while enabling faster and more efficient cross-border transactions.

That might sound far-fetched for anyone new to crypto. However, as long as the price of Bitcoin goes up, momentum will build for major tech companies to embrace crypto.

For example, in December, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) shareholders voted on a shareholder proposal calling on the company to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet. While Microsoft ultimately voted ""no"" on the proposal, it now looks like similar shareholder proposals could be on the way for other tech companies.

Hoskinson also has some interesting thoughts on the current tariff uncertainty, and the threat of a looming trade war. He's not nearly as bearish as many analysts are, even going so far as to say that ""the tariff stuff will be a dud."" As he sees it, many of the worst fears of a full-blown trade war are overdone.

Based on his view of the current economic situation, the crypto market will stall out over the next few months, as it awaits action from the Fed and more clarity around tariffs. As soon as the Fed lowers interest rates, it could lead to ""cheap, fast money"" pouring into crypto, thereby pushing up the price of Bitcoin. He's fully expecting a speculative crypto rally by September, which could lead to Bitcoin hitting that $250,000 price target by the end of 2025.

There's obviously a lot to unpack here. There is the storyline that was popular before January 2025, based on the pro-crypto optimism surrounding the Trump White House. There is also the storyline that's always been popular with crypto enthusiasts, based on a vision of the world where everyone owns crypto, and everything runs on blockchain rails. And, layered in on top of that, you have tariff uncertainty and the potential for a global trade war.

It's up to you to decide just how much of an impact each of these key storylines will have on the price of Bitcoin in 2025. Getting from a current price of $85,000 to $250,000 -- an epic 194% increase in price in less than eight months -- is a big ask. But if there's any digital asset in the world that's capable of it, it's Bitcoin.

Ethereum's price action indicates that a major price movement is on the horizon. Ethereum's price continues to consolidate within a descending channel. Analysts predict that a breakout above the lower boundary of the descending channel could lead to further price appreciation.

The $1,600 support level has experienced increased buying pressure. The solid support indicates that a breakout above the upper trendline of the consolidation zone could result in an upward price movement. The market awaits possible confirmation of this breakout because it could push Ethereum to test higher price levels with a $4,000 target.

Analysts predict a positive trend that strengthens the overall bullish sentiment around Ethereum. If Ethereum successfully breaks out above the current consolidation zone and maintains its support level, it could mark the start of a new upward price trend. If the breakout happens, it could pave the way for an Ethereum price surge, with $4,000 in sight.

The current market movement mirrors Ethereum's price action in 2020. Ethereum experienced a major price increase after breaking out from its consolidation zone. Historical data indicates that Ethereum is following a similar pattern, which could trigger an upward price surge.

In 2020, the Ethereum price consolidated around $215 before a decisive breakout to $1,000. Analysts predict that the current Ethereum consolidation phase around $2,100 could trigger a similar price action. The 2020 pattern indicates Ethereum has the potential to reach prices above $4,000, whereas some analysts believe it may surge to $10,000 in the future.

Global liquidity trends have a substantial impact on Ethereum's price performance. Previous market cycles show that Ethereum price maintains an inverse correlation with Bitcoin and global liquidity. Historically, a surge in global liquidity triggers Ethereum's price appreciation relative to Bitcoin, which could indicate another price rise.

The current liquidity patterns indicate that Ethereum could once again surpass Bitcoin as global liquidity stabilizes. The market participants continue to monitor liquidity indicators to detect any reversal in the current downward trend of Ethereum's price against Bitcoin. An increase in market liquidity could trigger a breakout toward Ethereum's price increase to $4,000. As at press time Ethereum price traded at $1,616

 Bitcoin maximalist Samson Mow said that once ""you remove"" unit bias from altcoins, it becomes clear how overvalued altcoins like XRP, Solana, and Ether actually are. 

Jan3 CEO Samson Mow says that Bitcoin dominance hasn't yet exhausted its upside trajectory after analyzing how altcoin prices would stack up against Bitcoin if all were on equal terms of total supply.

His forecast for Bitcoin (BTC) Dominance to rise further comes as the ratio has already exceeded the levels many crypto analysts expected it would reach by late 2024.

“Unit bias is absolutely destroying the uninitiated,” Mow said in an April 19 X post. Mow suggested that unit bias — a psychological method in behavioral economics that suggests that individuals usually like to own a complete unit or stock regardless of its price and size — often causes less experienced investors to assume cheaper whole altcoins are better value than owning part of a Bitcoin.

“You can buy one twenty-one millionth of the BTC supply for ~$85,000,” Mow said. He asked, “What happens if you remove unit bias from alts to calculate the equivalent of 1/21 million?”

He pointed out that Ether (ETH) would be priced at $9,200, XRP (XRP) would be priced at $5,800, and Solana (SOL) would be priced at $3,400 — representing increases of approximately 278,746%, 470%, and 2,328%, respectively, from their prices at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data.

“No way these alts are worth that much,” Mow said. 

Sunny Po, an anonymous Bitcoin proponent, said on Jan. 12 that “Unit bias is a core foundational framework of the normie mind. ‘Cheaper better.'”

Mow said that “most” altcoins take advantage of unit bias by implementing a very high total supply so market participants “can't figure out what they're buying.”

Based on his calculations, Mow said Bitcoin dominance is going “so much higher.” Bitcoin dominance — a metric that reflects Bitcoin's share of the total crypto market capitalization — is often used by traders to gauge when Bitcoin might be nearing a price peak. 

Historically, when Bitcoin Dominance declines, it often signals the start of altcoin season, with capital flowing from Bitcoin into altcoins to find higher returns.

At the time of publication, Bitcoin Dominance is sitting at 63.69%, as per TradingView data.

Several crypto analysts were forecasting Bitcoin Dominance to top out at 60% in late 2024 before the beginning of an altcoin season. 

In August 2024, Into The Cryptoverse founder Benjamin Cowen said “I don't think it is going back up to 70%, my target for Bitcoin dominance has been 60%.”

As the Easter holidays are here and traditional financial markets are closed, investors are seeking lucrative trading opportunities in the crypto market as it remains open 24/7.

In the holidays, major crypto coins may consolidate, but some selected altcoins also gain popularity due to retail momentum and speculative interest during quieter trading periods.

In this Easter Special, we bring you crypto easter eggs with the top 5 altcoins, which may see a surge in trading volume during this vacation.s

Here is a price analysis of the top 5 altcoins, including XRP, Hyperliquid, Solana, Shiba Inu, and TRUMP, that may perform during this holiday period.

XRP is the native token of XRP Ledger, which is currently trading at $2.08 with a market cap of $121.82 billion has seen a surge of around 1.43% in the last 7 days. 

The token's price is currently moving towards a significant resistance level between $2.20 and $2.40, which highlights a bullish market for XRP if momentum continues.

Technical indicators indicate an optimistic outlook for XRP. The Relative Strength Index is around 47.10, which shows a neutral position with chances for upward movement. 

Experts predict that its price during the Easter holiday may range between $2.92 and $4.22. The reason behind this upward trend includes a historical trend that suggests a bullish movement of XRP in April and the upcoming launch of XRP Futures ETFs on April 30.

SOL is the native currency of the Solana blockchain, which is currently trading at $139.60 with a market cap of $72.08 billion. It has seen a price rise of 12.21% within the last 7 days, which marks a bullish movement of SOL. 

Technical indicators further suggest a bullish outlook, with an RSI of 59.16 showing a bullish momentum for the token. Further, the Average Directional Index (ADX) is around 25.50, which also suggests a growing trend.

Analysts predict that the SOL price will range between $140 to $160 during the Easter holiday. The reasons behind this price prediction is due to an increase in institutional interest with the filing of the Solana ETF and a surge in on-chain activity, which bypassed Ethereum in total gas fees collection.

HYPE is the native token of the Hyperliquid Layer-One blockchain, which is currently priced at $18.01 with a market cap of $6.05 billion. Its price has surged by 15% in the last 7 days, which shows a growing interest of investors in the HYPE token.

Technical indicators also suggest bullish price movement with the Relative Strength Index range around 70, which shows increased activity, and ADX has risen from 15 to 19, which also suggests a growing trend.

The Easter price prediction for HYPE token will range around $25 to $30, and a long-term prediction is of $60 within a month. The reasons behind this optimistic prediction is its technological advancements with the launch of HyperEVM and increased activity on Hyperliquid DEX. 

Shiba Inu is a dog-themed memecoin that is currently trading at $0.00001217 with a market cap of $7.17 billion has seen a slight surge of 1.43% in the last 24 hours. Though it is not a significant surge, during this volatility, this surge is also remarkable. 

The technical indicators also provide a bullish outlook with a Relative Strength Index of 51, which suggests a bullish momentum with ADX of around 37.9, which shows a growing interest in Shiba Inu.

Experts predicted that its price may range between $0.00003217 to $0.0000461 during the Easter holiday. This prediction is based on developments like continuous token burn and due to upcoming Shibarium upgrades.

TRUMP is a Solana-based memecoin, which is currently priced $8.49 with a market cap of $1.69 billion. Its price has risen by around 11% in the last 24 hours, which shows the increased demand for the token.

Technical indicators like RSI stand around 76, which shows a strong buying pressure, and ADX at 59 shows a strong upward trend.

Experts predict that its price will range around $10 to $15 and with a massive long-term prediction of $100 by the end of 2025. The reason behind this bullish prediction is due to pro-crypto policies and strategic announcements made by President Trump ever since he assumed office in January this year.

As the Easter Holiday approaches, these 5 altcoins show a remarkable strength and may seen a massive surge during the Easter holidays. However, it is always considered best to do your own research before making any investment related decisions in the cryptocurrency market, due to its high volatility.

Bitcoin dominance in the crypto market is approaching a historic resistance level that has previously triggered major reversals. According to a technical analysis published on TradingView, BTC's market share could collapse to 40% in the coming months, potentially paving the way for a new altcoin season.

The weekly candlestick chart shows that Bitcoin dominance is approaching a critical historic resistance level. 

This phenomenon has happened before, and every time this descending trendline has been reached, a major reversal occurred. 

The technical analysis suggests that history could repeat itself, with a potential drop to 40%, or even 34.9% in the most bearish scenario.

Unlike previous cycles, Bitcoin dominance has followed a different dynamic this time. It has significantly increased since the start of the current cycle, leaving little room for the much-anticipated altcoin season by many investors. 

This phenomenon is partly explained by the growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin, notably through Spot ETFs.

A decrease in Bitcoin dominance would mean the altcoin market outperforms the leading crypto. 

In such a scenario, the first to benefit would likely be established cryptos that have withstood multiple market cycles, commonly known as “DINO” (Dinosaurs In Name Only), notably Ethereum, XRP, Cardano, Chainlink, BNB, and Litecoin.

However, the current context differs significantly from the bullish markets of 2017 and 2021. The market now has thousands of altcoins, compared to just a few hundred in previous cycles. 

Moreover, the presence of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which lock up significant long-term liquidity, could limit the flow magnitude toward altcoins.

Beyond large-cap cryptos, certain specific sectors such as artificial intelligence, tokenized real-world assets (RWA), and decentralized finance (DeFi) could also attract investor attention. 

Nevertheless, even within these categories, a rigorous selection process will be required to identify the most promising projects.

The potential drop in Bitcoin dominance could therefore mark the beginning of a new phase in this market cycle, where altcoins gradually regain their attractiveness to investors.

The arrival of an altcoin season is often tied to Bitcoin's performance. As money flows out of BTC and into altcoins, this triggers a rise in altcoin prices. 

However, this cycle is delayed by factors beyond Bitcoin. One such factor is the recent surge in token generation events (TGEs).

In the past four and a half months, 45 new tokens have launched, with most failing to provide decent returns. Many tokens launched in 2025 failed to sustain growth post-listing, raising the question of whether this trend is driven by bearish macroeconomic conditions or the lack of fundamental value in these tokens. This is turning altcoins into speculative assets driven by momentum.

Talking to BeInCrypto, Vincent Liu, CIO of Kronos Research, shed light on this question.

“Relentless token launches, especially meme coins, diluted liquidity and fragmented investor attention. Simultaneously, macro headwinds like rising interest rates and a global shift to risk-off sentiment throttled speculative capital. Tokens lacking utility, clear roadmaps, or sustainable ecosystems were quickly repriced in line with growing investor skepticism,” Liu explained.

One of the few successful launches with strong ROI has been Solayer (LAYER). Since its February launch, LAYER has posted an 88% rise and is currently trading just under $2.00.

The altcoin season index currently stands at 16, indicating Bitcoin's dominance. Rapid token launches and post-listing failures are contributing to the delay. 

However, Liu noted that niche categories like AI-linked tokens continue to show strong demand despite the broader market conditions.

“While a full-fledged altcoin season hasn't materialized, niche categories like AI-integrated meme coins and emerging tech narratives have shown signs of strength. Many token launches still suffer from inflated valuations and weak fundamentals, diluting capital and stalling broader momentum. Yet AI-linked narratives continue to attract attention not just from crypto natives, but also from traditional finance. Altcoin season isn't gone, it's simply evolving,” Liu said.

Despite the delay, the potential for an altcoin season remains. However, 75% of the top 50 altcoins would need to outperform Bitcoin to signal a true shift, which is not the case at the moment.

Arthur Cheong, founder and CEO of DeFiance Capital, recently raised concerns over TGEs. He highlighted the risk of projects and market makers working together to inflate token prices artificially. This can distort market behavior and undermine investor confidence.

“You don't know whether the price is a result of organic demand and supply or simply due to projects and market makers colluding to fix the price for other objectives. Absolutely bizarre that CEXs are turning a blind eye to this and altcoin markets are becoming more and more like a lemon market where confidence gets lesser,” Cheong tweeted.

Responding to this, Vincent Liu suggested that there needs to be reforms in the way that token launches are approached.  

“…the issue of artificially inflated token prices before launch presents a growing concern. While these short-term surges might attract initial attention, they often undermine long-term investor confidence. To mitigate this, the industry must champion greater transparency around partner agreements, listing criteria, and pre-launch disclosures. Clear communication about a project's structure, roadmap, and market cap expectations is essential to building a sustainable and trustworthy ecosystem,” Liu said.

Liu believes addressing this problem requires collaboration from market makers, centralized exchanges (CEXs), and investors. 

“By conducting thorough research into the fundamentals of new projects, investors can protect themselves from significant losses and identify valuable tokens in the long run,” Liu concluded.

Artificial intelligence has become a powerful force in the finance ecosystem, offering faster, data-driven insights that promise to improve investments, lending, and risk management. From AI advisors that personalize financial strategies for both companies and individuals to highly advanced trading systems that make data-driven decisions in microseconds, the financial AI sector has a lot of room to grow. 

But there's one major problem: bias. 

Despite offering speed, precision, and what seems like objectivity, financial AI systems carry the same bias that the industry has been trying to eliminate for decades. For example, according to Lehigh University, OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo large language models—simulating an AI mortgage advisor or decision system—required certain demographics of applicants to have 120 credit points higher than white applicants to receive the same approval despite having the same income, credit history, and debt levels.

This bias doesn't just affect the traditional financial markets but also the decentralized finance and crypto ecosystems. Take AI-powered market forecasting platforms, for example. Since their data is based on price history, news sentiment, or social trends, these platforms could sometimes overreact to market anomalies—crypto is full of black swan events like the Terra collapse, FTX crash, or large penalties from the regulators.

Consequently, these prediction tools can become over-aggressive or even overweight social trends and chatter, leading to poor signals and predictions.

The limitations and opaque nature of many AI systems prevent them from becoming fully transparent and accountable. Some even call them black boxes since AI models usually have little to no transparency.

Notably, the decisions made by AI tools within the crypto space are not usually explainable—this makes it hard for users to understand how decisions are made. The absence of standardized auditing protocols for AI systems would also result in inconsistent assessments and potential oversight of critical issues.​

Integrating blockchain technology with Explainable AI, or XAI for short, can tackle this issue by providing the immutability and transparency that come with decentralized ledgers—potentially improving the auditing methods as well since the auditors will have complete access to the platform's data and underlying algorithms.

XAI models are already getting increased attention since they ensure the decision-making process is fair and ethical in addition to being efficient. Blockchain technology can complement XAI's fairness by creating immutable records of AI decision-making processes, ensuring that every action is traceable and verifiable. This will promote trust and accountability.

Blockchains operate in a trustless manner. This doesn't mean the technology cannot be trusted, but it suggests that third parties or central authorities won't be needed to confirm any decisions. Decentralization removes the need for a centralized entity to oversee the processes, thanks to the smart contracts that function autonomously. 

When a model changes or outputs a decision, the lack of logs and version control can cause trust issues with most of the AI platforms. Blockchain technology timestamps the records and data on an immutable ledger. 

FICO, a credit scoring company, has used blockchain to log AI model decisions, so regulators can trace how decisions like credit approvals were made. The company received the “Tech of the Future—Blockchain and Tokenisation” award at the Banking Tech Awards in London last year.

Blockchains and decentralized finance protocols have the opportunity to bake fairness, transparency, and accountability into AI models—something traditional financial companies have been struggling with.

Combining XAI with on-chain verification can transform how decisions are made and trusted in the web3 ecosystem. For example, using XAI to explain the voting of decentralized autonomous organizations could help users have a better understanding of the consequences of their choices. A more advanced utility would be using XAI for risk assessment in lending DeFi protocols.

Mixing XAI with blockchain technology could also be a powerful on-chain surveillance and manipulation detection tool. AI is good at analyzing patterns of sandwich attacks, MEV exploitation, or wash trading. This could help in finding market anomalies.

Some web3 projects are already trying to enhance AI transparency. SingularityNET, for instance, focuses on making AI processes auditable. Another platform called Ocean Protocol tracks the origins of the data, ensuring trustworthiness and traceability.

At this point, it's just the beginning of the integration of blockchain and AI. Researchers are now exploring hybrid models that combine blockchain's integrity, XAI's clarity, and bias-detection tools into systems that can monitor and potentially correct themselves.

But technology alone won't fix this. It will also need attention from regulators, scrutiny from users, and humility from the developers building these systems. If the 2008 financial crisis taught us anything, it's that blind trust in complex and centralized tools is dangerous.

Most notably, smart doesn't always mean fair. As the era of mainstream AI surfaces, users must also look for transparency in addition to efficiency.

With blockchain entering a new cycle of regulation, real-world adoption, and decentralized breakthroughs, people across South America are watching this shift with eagle eyes. From São Paulo to Buenos Aires, blockchain developers and digital asset communities are shifting their attention to projects solving real problems—not just adding noise. As crypto tariffs shake markets and China's crackdown backfires, there's an urgent push toward coins delivering utility, not just hype. And five names are being whispered everywhere—from Telegram alpha groups to dev subreddits.

At the top of the list is Qubetics ($TICS)—a project tailor-made to clean up the mess left by outdated systems. While older chains promised change, Qubetics is already delivering it. It's powering real-world asset tokenization, streamlining global finance, and setting new standards for how Web3 should connect people, protocols, and platforms. Let's break down why this, and four other top-tier tokens, are being called the best crypto to join now.

If you're still asking why Qubetics is turning heads, you're already behind. With over 508 million tokens sold, the best crypto presale tally of $16.2 million, and more than 24,900 token holders, Qubetics isn't just gaining traction—it's building the rails for tomorrow's Web3 economy. As the world's first Web3 aggregator, it's connecting dApps, chains, data, and financial tools into one seamless ecosystem. But that's just the surface.

What's shaking up the market is its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. Imagine small manufacturers tokenizing equipment to secure cross-border loans, logistics firms fractionalizing fleet assets for shared ownership, or even independent developers turning digital code into legally recognized collateral. It's not a pitch—it's already in the blueprint. Qubetics lets participants tokenize, verify, and trade real assets on-chain. No middlemen. No geographical delays. Just pure, programmable ownership. 

Right now, Qubetics ($TICS) is cruising through its 30th presale stage, with each token priced at $0.1729. For early movers, the numbers are turning heads. Let's break it down with a $200 investment scenario. At the current price, $200 fetches approximately 1,157 $TICS tokens. Now imagine holding tight until $TICS hits $1—your $200 would flip into $1,157, delivering a 478% ROI. But that's just the beginning. If $TICS reaches $5, your return skyrockets to $5,785. At $6, that same bag becomes $6,942. A $10 target? You're sitting on $11,570. And if Qubetics hits $15, you're staring at a mind-blowing $17,355, an 8,568% return from just $200. 

Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Qubetics is solving real problems with scalable tech, giving early community members a front-row seat to one of the best crypto to join now. This isn't wishful thinking—it's the power of strategic entry during one of the most talked-about Web3 presales of 2025.

Fast, climate-friendly, and built for the next-gen Web3 world, Near Protocol is doing more than just flexing speed—it's changing how people build decentralized apps. Its Nightshade sharding architecture allows for super low fees, and it auto-scales based on network traffic. That means builders don't need to worry about congestion or high gas fees derailing their dApps. 

In Latin America, dev teams are already choosing Near for its ease of use, strong dev community, and clean integration into real-world fintech applications. Whether it's payment rails, digital IDs, or localized DeFi apps, Near is quietly becoming the go-to layer for scalability.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Near Protocol is offering the perfect toolkit for the Web3 future—making it one of the best crypto to join now. It's also partnering with big-name brands and bringing more users into the decentralized space without them even knowing they're on-chain.

You might not have heard of Astra unless you're tapped into alpha circles—but that's exactly what makes it such a wild card. Astra focuses on decentralized compliance, bridging the gap between Web3 and real-world financial regulations. Its mission is bold: make DeFi protocols 100% compliant without giving up decentralization.

It's working with European regulators and integrating on-chain KYC/AML layers without compromising user privacy. That means Astra can power everything from lending platforms to DAOs—giving them the legal green light to expand. With increasing pressure on crypto from state actors, Astra is arriving right on time.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Astra's compliance-first blockchain solves the regulation nightmare—solidifying its place among the best crypto to join now. Astra is gaining momentum as a decentralized AI protocol bridging real-time computation with secure data ownership.

Gaming meets zero gas fees? That's Immutable X. As Web3 gaming shifts from flashy trailers to actual play-to-earn ecosystems, Immutable is becoming the playground of choice for developers and studios alike. Built on top of Ethereum with ZK-rollups, it offers instant trade confirmation, high scalability, and zero gas fees for NFT creation or transfers.

From Latin America to Southeast Asia, gaming economies are booming, and Immutable is the one enabling real ownership. No longer do players need to just spend—they can now own, trade, and profit. Projects like Illuvium and Gods Unchained are already live, and dozens more are coming in 2025. Immutable's marketplace is buzzing, and it's ready for explosive growth.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Because it's owning the Web3 gaming wave, making it one of the best crypto to join now. Immutable X continues to dominate the NFT and gaming layer-2 scene with lightning-fast, gas-free transactions.

While most blockchains parade transparency, Monero marches to the beat of privacy. In countries where financial surveillance is growing, Monero's untraceable transactions are becoming a powerful shield. Its tech ensures every transaction remains confidential by default—hiding the sender, receiver, and the amount. 

Monero isn't flashy, but it's quietly used across industries and geographies that demand financial privacy. And as digital freedom becomes a rallying cry, XMR keeps gaining traction—even as centralized exchanges try to limit its use. When things get turbulent, Monero becomes the escape hatch.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Because it's the privacy-first giant in a world tilting toward surveillance, easily making it one of the best crypto to join now. That's not just innovation—it's survival for people in unstable economic zones. Monero remains the go-to choice for privacy maximalists, offering unmatched anonymity in an era of growing surveillance.

April 2025 isn't just about another cycle of speculation—it's about strategic choices. With tariffs, crackdowns, and regulation storms stirring up chaos, the only way forward is aligning with projects offering real innovation. That's where Qubetics, Near, Astra, Immutable X, and Monero come in—each building solid foundations for different pieces of the decentralized puzzle.

For those watching from Latin America and beyond, the timing couldn't be sharper. With Qubetics still in presale and the others gearing up for game-changing partnerships and updates, this lineup isn't about catching up—it's about getting in early. These five names aren't riding hype—they're setting the new benchmarks for what it means to be part of the best crypto to join now.

ConstitutionDAO But for the Apocalypse: Solana NFT Project Aims to Buy Nuclear Bunker

culture

Remember when ConstitutionDAO tried (and failed) to buy a copy of the U.S. Constitution? Well, now there's a project aiming to do much the same with a nuclear bunker.

The creators of doomsday-themed Solana project Meatbags hope to purchase a nuclear bunker built during the Cold War in Rutland, England. To do this, 100,000 Billionaire Bunker Club NFTs will be offered for sale at $14 a pop in an attempt to raise $1.4 million, with NFT holders forming a decentralized autonomous organization or DAO collective that will vote on what to do with the property.

The site spans 1.4 acres with a nuclear bunker and former reservoir, according to SDL Property Auctions, and was built in 1960 to act as a British Royal Observer Corps (ROC) Cold War monitoring post. This was one of 1,500 underground monitoring posts built across the United Kingdom, during a time of heightened fear of nuclear war. 

Planning permission has already been secured for the site by its current owners to turn it into a luxury home with two floors of “cathedral-type ceilings,” a large glass frontage, and views across the Leicestershire countryside. Meatbags claims to have an estimate on how much these plans will cost, and the team has factored this into the NFT raising price.

The attempt recalls the well-publicized effort from ConstitutionDAO, which formed in late 2021 in an attempt to purchase a copy of the U.S. Constitution at auction.

We're giving Doomsday Preppers around the world a chance to reserve their slice of the Billionaire Bunker Club—a Cold War artifact and the first historic site ever fractionalized into a fully decentralized, community-governed real-world asset on-chain.

— MEATBAGS (@mfmeatbags) April 19, 2025



Despite raising about $47 million to further such aims, the DAO failed to win the auction, losing out to billionaire Citadel CEO Ken Griffin. ConstitutionDAO eventually refunded its participants, which Meatbags has also pledged to do if it can't secure the aforementioned bunker or an alternative site within six months of its bid being rejected.

But other DAO-driven efforts have had more success fulfilling their aims—such as LinksDAO, which purchased the Spey Bay Golf Club in Scotland in 2023 and is overhauling the site.

Robert, the pseudonymous co-founder and CEO of Meatbags creator Dead Bruv, told Decrypt that the team has scoped out a couple of alternatives already, some of which are also in the United Kingdom—but they're open to landing a site elsewhere, too.

“We're confident we'll be able to get our hands on a bunker,” he added.

If the Meatbags collective successfully purchases the property as the result of the upcoming “Buy the Bunker” campaign, it will allow the newly formed DAO to vote on what will be done with the property.

“I guess the idea would be to be able to have people come to the property, stay on it. Either I think it will turn into a tourist attraction, or I think it could also go down the route of being an insane property on Airbnb,” Robert told Decrypt. “Ultimately, it'll come down to what the DAO votes [for].”

Meatbags is a narrative-driven NFT project about doomsday preppers living in a world that is coming to an end, called Surviville, which mirrors real-world concerns like war tensions, global pandemics, and the rise of powerful AI. As such, the community already has its toe in the world of doomsday prepping—so there's a chance the DAO could vote to use the property as a functional bunker if the worst was to happen.

Aside from participating in the DAO, Billionaire Bunker Club holders will also receive an on-chain land deed verifying that they own a share of the bunker, and will be invited to an opening party.

Robert claims to have reached out to the auctioneers via email and said they appear open to the NFT project buying the property. SDL Property Auctions did not respond to Decrypt's request for comment.

The site is currently listed for a guide price of over £650,000 (or about $862,000) plus fees. Meatbags aims to raise $1.4 million so it can also refurbish the place, create wiggle room for negotiating, and pay management, operating, and legal fees incurred throughout the campaign. The DAO will vote on how any remaining funds will be used.

Billionaire Bunker Club NFTs will go on sale on Monday at 8am ET, with users able to purchase using Solana Pay or credit card via the Dead Bruv website. 

ConstitutionDAO fell short of its own goal, and attempting to sell 100,000 NFTs in 2025 at any price might seem like a Herculean task. Even so, the team is confident in its chances to pull this off.

“I'm about as optimistic as you can be when betting on crypto and the apocalypse at the same time,” pseudonymous co-founder and creative director Psychrome told Decrypt.

The price action for XRP and bitcoin (BTC) resembles a tightly compressed spring on the verge of uncoiling with a sudden release of energy.

That's the message from a key volatility indicator called Bollinger Bandwidth. Bollinger Bands are volatility bands set at plus two and minus two standard deviations above and below the 20-period moving average (SMA) of an asset's market price. The bandwidth measures the space between these bands as a percentage of the 20-day moving average.



In the case of XRP, the Bollinger bandwidth has narrowed to its lowest level since October 2024 on the 4-hour chart, where each candle represents price action for a four-hour period. The 4-hour chart interval is quite popular in the 24/7 crypto market, allowing traders to analyze and predict short-term price movements. Bitcoin's 4-hour chart mirrors the Bollinger band width pattern in XRP.

The long-held belief is that a tighter Bollinger band width, reflecting a quiet period in the market, is akin to a compressed spring ready for significant movement. 

During these calm phases, the market accumulates energy that is eventually released once a clear direction is established, often leading to dramatic rallies or sharp price declines. Both XRP and bitcoin surged in November-December following an extended range-bound period that left their bandwidth at levels comparable to those observed today.

That said, tighter bands do not always indicate a bullish volatility explosion; they can also foreshadow a sell-off. For example, the bands tightened in October 2022, signaling a significant move ahead, which materialized on the downside after FTX went bust. 

It remains to be seen whether this latest spring compression will trigger bullish volatility or lead both tokens into a tailspin. The recent hawkish comments from Federal Reserve's Chairman Jerome Powell and selling by some whales favor the latter.

 Despite over $2 million in daily inflation, Dogecoin remains the dominant memecoin as ETF decisions from the SEC approach. 

Dogecoin holders worldwide celebrate “Dogeday” on April 20, as the memecoin's community awaits upcoming deadlines for Dogecoin-related exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications.

Dogeday marks the unofficial holiday of the Dogecoin (DOGE) community. It gained traction in the memecoin community four years ago, in 2021, during International Weed Day on April 20.

Despite its reputation as a joke token, Dogecoin remains the eighth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, currently valued at $23.3 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.

Dogecoin's tokenomics have often been criticized for issuing 14.4 million worth of new DOGE into circulation per day, giving it a daily inflation rate of over $2.16 million.

Dogecoin's staying power “stems from a blend of community-driven enthusiasm, low entry barriers, and speculative appeal,” according to Anndy Lian, author and intergovernmental blockchain expert.

Dogecoin's inflationary tokenomics may also contribute to its retail appeal, Lian told Cointelegraph, adding:

“The retail appeal is amplified by Dogecoin's meme-driven branding, which resonates with younger, internet-savvy investors,” explained Lian.

Memecoins like Dogecoin lack underlying blockchain use cases and typically rally based on social media traction and retail hype alone.

In November 2024, Dogecoin surpassed Porsche's market capitalization, driven by continued social media endorsements by billionaire Elon Musk.

The Dogecoin community is closely watching the US Securities and Exchange Commission as it weighs several DOGE-related ETF applications.

There are four Dogecoin ETF filings awaiting approval: the Bitwise Dogecoin ETF, the Grayscale Dogecoin ETF, the 21Shares Dogecoin ETF and the Osprey Fund Dogecoin ETF.

Grayscale's ETF application is due for a response on May 21 after the SEC delayed its decision on multiple crypto ETF filings.

Bitwise's filing could receive a response on May 18, which marks the end of the SEC's 75-day initial review period after the 19b-4 filing. However, the 240-day review period could enable the regulator to delay the decision until October 2024 for both filings.

The ETF applications from 21Shares and Osprey are still pending review for their initial 19b-4 filings, with no set deadline from the securities regulator.

 The president of CoinFund says that the Bank for International Settlements “mix of fear, arrogance, or ignorance” poses a threat to the entire financial industry. 

The Bank for International Settlements' (BIS) push to isolate crypto markets and its controversial recommendations on DeFi and stablecoins is “dangerous” for the entire financial system, warns the head of a blockchain investment firm.

“Many of their recommendations and conclusions — perhaps due to a mix of fear, arrogance, or ignorance — are completely uninformed and, frankly, dangerous,” CoinFund president Christopher Perkins said in an April 19 X post, referring to the BIS' April 15 report titled “Cryptocurrencies and Decentralized Finance: Functions and Financial Stability Implications.” 

“Crypto is not communism,” Perkins said, pushing back against the BIS' call for a “containment” approach to isolate crypto from traditional finance and the broader economy.

“It's the new internet that provides anyone with a connection access to financial services,” Perkins said. “You cannot control it anymore than you control the internet,” he added.

Perkins warned that a containment approach to crypto would expose the traditional financial system to massive liquidity risks “of unimaginable scale,” especially when the crypto market operates in real-time, 24/7, while traditional financial markets shuts down after trading hours.

The report warned that the number of investors and amount of capital in crypto and DeFi have “reached a critical mass,” with investor protection becoming a “significant concern for regulators.”

Perkins pushed back against the BIS' claim that DeFi presents significant challenges, arguing instead that it represents a “significant improvement” over the “opacity” and imbalances of the traditional financial system.

Responding to the BIS's concern about the anonymity of DeFi developers, Perkins questioned its relevance:

Perkins also critiqued the BIS's concern around stablecoins that it could lead to “macroeconomic instability in countries like Venezuela and Zimbabwe.”

“If there is demand for USD stablecoins and it helps improve the condition of anyone in the developing world, perhaps that is a good thing,” Perkins said.

Perkins wasn't alone in criticizing the controversial report. Lightspark co-founder Christian Catalini also weighed in, posting a series of critiques on X that same day. Catalini summed up the report with the analogy:

“Think: writing parking regulations for a fleet of self‑driving drones — earnest work, two technological leaps behind.”

 Bitcoin maximalist Samson Mow said that once ""you remove"" unit bias from altcoins, it becomes clear how overvalued altcoins like XRP, Solana, and Ether actually are. 

Jan3 CEO Samson Mow says that Bitcoin dominance hasn't yet exhausted its upside trajectory after analyzing how altcoin prices would stack up against Bitcoin if all were on equal terms of total supply.

His forecast for Bitcoin (BTC) Dominance to rise further comes as the ratio has already exceeded the levels many crypto analysts expected it would reach by late 2024.

“Unit bias is absolutely destroying the uninitiated,” Mow said in an April 19 X post. Mow suggested that unit bias — a psychological method in behavioral economics that suggests that individuals usually like to own a complete unit or stock regardless of its price and size — often causes less experienced investors to assume cheaper whole altcoins are better value than owning part of a Bitcoin.

“You can buy one twenty-one millionth of the BTC supply for ~$85,000,” Mow said. He asked, “What happens if you remove unit bias from alts to calculate the equivalent of 1/21 million?”

He pointed out that Ether (ETH) would be priced at $9,200, XRP (XRP) would be priced at $5,800, and Solana (SOL) would be priced at $3,400 — representing increases of approximately 278,746%, 470%, and 2,328%, respectively, from their prices at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data.

“No way these alts are worth that much,” Mow said. 

Sunny Po, an anonymous Bitcoin proponent, said on Jan. 12 that “Unit bias is a core foundational framework of the normie mind. ‘Cheaper better.'”

Mow said that “most” altcoins take advantage of unit bias by implementing a very high total supply so market participants “can't figure out what they're buying.”

Related: XRP: Why it's outperforming altcoins — and what comes next

Based on his calculations, Mow said Bitcoin dominance is going “so much higher.” Bitcoin dominance — a metric that reflects Bitcoin's share of the total crypto market capitalization — is often used by traders to gauge when Bitcoin might be nearing a price peak. 

Historically, when Bitcoin Dominance declines, it often signals the start of altcoin season, with capital flowing from Bitcoin into altcoins to find higher returns.

At the time of publication, Bitcoin Dominance is sitting at 63.69%, as per TradingView data.

Several crypto analysts were forecasting Bitcoin Dominance to top out at 60% in late 2024 before the beginning of an altcoin season. 

In August 2024, Into The Cryptoverse founder Benjamin Cowen said “I don't think it is going back up to 70%, my target for Bitcoin dominance has been 60%.”

 Restaking promised to supercharge Ethereum's ecosystem, but mounting risks and UX woes threaten to fracture the network further. bApps are the answer and can unify the fragmented ecosystem. 

Opinion by: Alon Muroch, founder of SSV Labs

Even though Ethereum remains a leader in terms of total value locked (TVL), things aren't looking great. Network activity is hemorrhaging, and momentum is slipping. Ethereum has become locked in a fight for its future. Without meaningful change, Ethereum risks becoming inaccessible to the builders and users it needs to thrive. Ethereum needs fresh ideas to bolster the ecosystem out of its slump, unify it, and genuinely support innovation.

Enter based applications (bApps), which are any application or service that uses the Ethereum validator set for security. Inspired by the based movement, bApps enable any project to bootstrap directly from the Ethereum layer 1 (L1), enabling interoperable, scalable and cost-effective development.

The recent decline in network activity highlights a deep issue across Ethereum, and it boils down to UX. The race to scale a blockchain isn't just about TVL and transactions per second (TPS). It's about the experience of users and developers who co-create the ecosystem. Ease of development and interoperable developer ecosystems and applications are paramount. Improving the developer experience is crucial for improving user experience, which drives adoption.

Today, builders are presented with two options. The first and more popular one is restaking, which has become the default mechanism for bootstrapping new services by locking up validators' withdrawal keys or large amounts of capital for security. That leaves teams with only one other inconvenient alternative: self-bootstrapping. Building a validator set from scratch is resource-heavy, technically complex and often starts off centralized. Both choices are limiting for builders and don't solve the fragmentation problems we see today in Ethereum.

It is not just builders but validators that are affected by this system. In the current restaking setup, validators who want to earn more yield by supporting new services must restake, lock up their withdrawal keys, and take on additional risk. By locking up withdrawal keys to secure applications with slashable capital, validators are exposed to cascading risks, which, at scale, could affect Ethereum itself — a core departure from Ethereum's founding vision.

bApps provide a third, more accessible option for self-bootstrapping and restaking. Using based security infrastructure drastically lowers entry barriers for any size protocol to build securely and sustainably, all while preserving the traditional network effects of Ethereum. Validators are incentivized to join through risk-free yield opportunities; developers can affordably access security to build; and users benefit from a unified and interoperable ecosystem.

Mission-critical services like rollups, bridges and oracles don't need to reinvent the wheel. They simply plug into an existing, trusted security model. Using Ethereum validators as a primary security base, any out-of-protocol service can inherit the Ethereum L1's decentralization and Sybil resistance. It's also possible to extend this paradigm beyond Ethereum, enabling other L1 validators to secure bApps. This potentially turns bApps into a marketplace for multichain security, dramatically reducing the complexity (and cost) for developers and raising the bar for the entire ecosystem, offering a “based” path forward.

bApps empower validators to earn more with their existing stake. By primarily using the validator principle as non-slashable security, validators can opt into many services through their existing Ethereum validator role without needing to restake or supply extra stakes. This would encourage broader validator participation, especially from smaller or more risk-averse operators, which is excellent considering solo stakers are an important ecosystem pillar.

bApps also revolutionize Ethereum's current bootstrapping ecosystem, which relies heavily on slashable capital. In restaking, one participant's gain may directly correspond to another's loss, creating a zero-sum model. Building a competitive dynamic where participants must add or reallocate resources instead of sharing them, consequently working against new entrants by creating competition for limited attention and resources.

The based economy, conversely, promotes an infinite-sum game, transforming competition for resources into a synergistic environment where new applications, services and participants increase the overall value of the platform. Each new validator increases security for bApps, and each new bApp provides new opportunities for validators. This infinitely scalable model breaks free from the limitations of a zero-sum model, enabling seamless bootstrapping, rewarding innovation and building more secure, inclusive and resilient ecosystems.

For Ethereum to grow, fragmentation has to be addressed. Builders need building blocks, which need to be secure, low-cost, interoperable and scalable. Think about what cloud computing did for Web2. BApps offer just that — by introducing an infinite-sum game, they unlock scalability and provide a safe and affordable way to bootstrap with Ethereum's proof-of-stake network.

If Ethereum is to be the foundation of tomorrow's decentralized world, it must empower the builders of today. The way forward is to solve Ethereum's user and developer experience problem with a based infrastructure. Going based is the clear solution.

 Bitcoin exchange order book liquidity analysis suggests that BTC price action may make a break for lower levels before challenging sellers at $90,000. 

Bitcoin (BTC) tapped 3-day lows into the April 20 weekly close as analysis warned of a fresh liquidity grab next.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD dropping 1.5% to $83,974 on the day before rebounding.

Still broadly less volatile over the weekend, Bitcoin sought to stem the week's downside as doubts appeared over the strength of nearby support.

Investigating the current liquidity setup across exchange order books, popular analyst Mark Cullen was particularly skeptical of $83,000.

“Bitcoin 90k liquidity still calling. BUT, i think the 83k level isn't safe, those lows from last Sunday and Wednesday are likely to get run first,” he summarized on X. 

Cullen and others nonetheless saw a short-term BTC price range between $83,000 and $86,000 staying in place over the Easter holiday weekend.

📈#Bitcoin Range Bound‼️The long easter weekend is likely yo see $BTC play out a range between83k and 86k. With it al ready sweeping the highs of the range late last week, IMO we are going to see liquidity sought from the lows before continuation higher.#Crypto #BTC https://t.co/iNllx4LexJ pic.twitter.com/6zx5gXZx79

“Pretty slow market during this long weekend as expected. I think next week will get interesting as the charts are quite compressed. Any decent good/bad headline could spark a pretty large move I think. Even if its just from positions getting squeezed,” popular trader Daan Crypto Trades continued. 

An accompanying chart showed BTC price action relative to the latest closing point of CME Group's Bitcoin futures, potentially inviting the creation of a “gap” that could provide a short-term price magnet.

Fellow trader Roman meanwhile eyed what could become a return to multimonth lows as part of a bullish inverse head and shoulders reversal pattern.

“If volume is decreasing on the way to 76k, I'll take longs,” he told X followers.

Updating readers on the daily chart, popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital had good news.

Bitcoin, he confirmed, had definitively broken out of a multimonth downtrend without violating it during retests as support.

“Bitcoin hasn't just broken the Downtrend and successfully retested it as support for the first time since Downtrend formation,” he wrote.

As Cointelegraph reported, the fate of the downtrend had been on the radar for weeks, with not everyone agreeing that price had left it behind for good.

The advent of mouse controls on the Nintendo Switch 2 has been a veritable saga. Despite being long rumored, the feature didn't get so much as a mention when Nintendo officially announced the new console in January 2025, only being confirmed in April's full reveal.

With a sensor built into both the left and right Joy-Con 2 controllers, either can be rotated 90 degrees on its Y axis to use as a mouse, while retaining gyroscopic, motion-sensing, and haptic capabilities. It's a smart addition on Nintendo's part, opening up the new hardware for more diverse gaming experiences than consoles typically offer. There's only one problem: They hurt.

Attending the Nintendo Switch 2 Experience in London, I was excited to get my hands on the new console in all its forms, and I was left impressed. In handheld mode, the bigger 7.9-inch screen looks gorgeous thanks to its higher 1080p resolution and use of HDR, almost good enough to forgive the shift back to LCD from OLED.

Played in docked mode, output to 4K TVs, Mario Kart World dazzled, showcasing a richly detailed cartoon world with astonishing verticality—race off the edge of the track in its open world, fall what feels like miles, and there's simply more world to continue karting around.

I was most interested in those new mouse controls, though, so I zeroed in on any games where WIRED could try them out. What I found was a host of titles that positively sparkled with Nintendo's trademark charm. In particular, futuristic wheelchair basketball outing Drag X Drive feels like the new-gen console's answer to ARMS, being a game designed around showing off the underlying tech.

It does a pretty solid job on that front, using both Joy-Con 2s in mouse mode to play. Push one Joy-Con 2 forward and you'll rotate that side's wheel in-game to turn; thrust both forward and you'll race forward. Grab the ball and raise a Joy-Con into the air, and you physically throw the ball to attempt to score. It's intuitive, and the speedy 3-on-3 match format makes this a fun multiplayer outing that's sure to find a niche, but wildly sliding two makeshift mice around a desk also left both my forearms noticeably aching.

Metroid Prime 4: Beyond wasn't as intense, but controls took a little getting used to. The long-awaited sequel to the Wii trilogy uses console-style thumbstick movement controls on the left-hand Joy-Con 2, while the right-hand one can be used more like a PC mouse to govern aiming, firing, and protagonist Samus' Morph Ball transformations. It's a halfway house between joypad and mouse-and-keyboard controls that felt odd, but it gelled pretty quickly, and I took down the demo's boss first time. Again, though, I felt uncomfortable twinges afterward, especially in my right arm.

Other titles including Super Mario Party Jamboree and Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour give some smart demos of the mouse tech—the latter combines the Joy-Con 2's gyroscopic and rumble features with the mouse sensor to test players' sense of where vibration feels strongest along a line, for example—but one of the best uses I discovered was on Square Enix's Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster.

The upgraded RPG packs in two chunky side games dedicated to mouse controls, “Luxencheer Rhythm Catch” and “Ringabel's Panic Cruise!” The former is a beat-matching music game, using both Joy-Con 2s in mouse mode to catch notes as they appear, while the latter sees you piloting a steampunk airship, using the mice to steer, pull levers, and conduct repairs in real time. Both make exceptional uses of the tech, almost feeling like full games in their own right.

Such original approaches to mouse controls could be Nintendo's secret weapon on the Switch 2, and developers are already coming up with more inventive uses for the tech than simply bringing a cursor to console gaming.

Make no mistake, everything I played beautifully captured Nintendo's “play comes first” ethos. The problem was the physical toll that came afterward. Drag X Drive might be the main culprit, but after almost four hours of testing various Switch 2 games with these newfangled mouse controls, my wrists were practically screaming.

I lay the blame solely on the design. When paired with a frame as a single joypad or used as individual, motion-sensing grips, the Joy-Con 2s are as comfortable as their predecessors were on the Switch 1—possibly a little more so, thanks to slightly larger, more substantial thumbsticks. Use them as mice, though, and you're suddenly trying to guide a pair of plastic daggers around, holding the knife's edge.

When you look at some of the best gaming mice around, a common factor tends to be a focus on ergonomics. Some might offer better support than others or have a more natural resting spot for thumbs, but to greater or lesser extents, a good mouse is sculpted to fit the arch of the typical human hand.

In contrast, the Joy-Con 2s in mouse mode offer a thin, flat wedge, simultaneously not giving enough purchase where you need it and digging into your palm where you don't want it. The thinness also means that fingers are cramped too closely together, hovering over each Joy-Con's shoulder buttons and triggers as ersatz left and right mouse buttons but lacking enough clearance to use either properly. I often felt like I was forcing my hand into a raised-claw-like grip, too high and arched, and nowhere to put my ring and little fingers. Ouch.

While the versatility of the Joy-Con 2s is amazing, it's just not comfortable to use them as mice for longer periods of play. So, if Nintendo wants mouse controls on the Switch 2 to be anything more than a gimmick in the long term, it needs to do one thing: release a ""Mouse Pro.”

I don't mean a way to use a regular mouse on Switch 2, either by connecting one to the Switch 2's upper USB-C port or pairing one wirelessly. That might just work for something like Metroid Prime 4, but it would still lack the hardware-specific inputs of the Switch 2, like the new C button that activates in-game chat features. No, for anything using both Joy-Con 2s as mice at once, like those wonderful Bravely Default mini-games, a retail standard mouse—or even two—wouldn't work at all.

Instead, Nintendo needs to cram all the impressive bits of the Joy-Cons—the motion sensing gyroscopes, the satisfying haptic motors, and of course the sensors that enable mouse functions—into actual mouse-shaped mice. Mice that fit into your hands and offer spaced-out, reachable buttons. Mice that don't physically hurt to hold after half an hour of gaming.

Any hypothetical Mouse Pro would need to be two to maintain compatibility with games using both at once. Release a paired bundle—Joy-Mouse L and Joy-Mouse R, anyone?—and Drag X Drive is suddenly viable as a competitive esport.

It's not that far-fetched an idea either—Nintendo has already released a mouse for its consoles before, with the SNES Mouse from 33 years ago. While never a must-have, it was a sleeper hit, with almost 100 games supporting it to varying degrees. That was a basic point-and-click tool, too. A modern update retaining all the features of the Joy-Con 2s, but in a dedicated mouse form, could be even more successful.

There are problems with the idea, though. Specific mice might have limited utility—we still don't know how many Switch 2 games will adopt dual-mouse controls, or how fully. Some games may require shifting between different control styles, with the likes of (the lengthily-titled) Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV putting the Joy-Con 2s through their paces in just about every use-case scenario they're capable of. A ""Mouse Pro"" simply wouldn't be viable for anything that only briefly swaps to mouse controls.

However, a potentially high price might be the toughest hurdle to overcome. The $450 (£389) MSRP for the base Switch 2 console has already been controversial, as have game prices of up to $80 or £75. Some accessories have already jumped in price slightly due to Trump's tariffs, like the Switch 2 Pro Controller jumping from $80 to $85.

The Joy Con 2s themselves now cost $95 (previously $90) a pair, so we'd have to assume a dual pack of ergonomic mice built around the same proprietary technology would likely be even more expensive. If mouse features prove to have minimal presence on Switch 2 games, then a pricey peripheral built around them is a nonstarter.

If that turns out to be the case, I'd settle for some sort of outer brace to clip onto the Joy-Con 2s—a mouse-shaped shell that would make using the controllers as mice more viable. Third-party accessory companies could even step up here.

Whatever happens, if Nintendo wants mouse controls on Switch 2 to ever be more than a curiosity, it needs to do something to take the almost literal sting out of using them. If it doesn't, the feature is likely to go the way of the IR sensor on the original Switch—an interesting idea, soon abandoned.

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

At the beginning of time and the center of every black hole lies a point of infinite density called a singularity. To explore these enigmas, we take what we know about space, time, gravity, and quantum mechanics and apply it to a place where all of those things simply break down. There is, perhaps, nothing in the universe that challenges the imagination more. Physicists still believe that if they can come up with a coherent explanation for what actually happens in and around singularities, something revelatory will emerge, perhaps a new understanding of what space and time are made of.

In the late 1960s, some physicists speculated that singularities might be surrounded by a region of churning chaos, where space and time haphazardly grow and shrink. Charles Misner of the University of Maryland called it a “Mixmaster universe,” after what was then a popular line of kitchen appliances. If an astronaut were to fall into a black hole, “one can imagine it mixing up the astronaut's body parts in the way that a mixmaster or eggbeater mixes up the yolk and white of an egg,” Kip Thorne, a Nobel Prize–winning physicist, later wrote.

Einstein's general theory of relativity, which is used to describe the gravity of black holes, uses a single field equation to explain how space curves and matter moves. But that equation uses a mathematical shorthand called a tensor to hide 16 distinct, intertwined equations. Several scientists, including Misner, had devised useful simplifying assumptions to let them explore scenarios like the Mixmaster universe.

Without those assumptions, Einstein's equation couldn't be solved analytically, and even with them it was too complicated for the numerical simulations of the time. Like the appliance they were named after, these ideas fell out of style. These “dynamics are supposed to be a very general phenomenon in gravity,” said Gerben Oling, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Edinburgh. “But it's something that fell off the map.”

In the last few years, physicists have been revisiting the chaos around singularities with new mathematical tools. Their goals are twofold. One hope is to show that approximations that Misner and others made are valid approximations of Einsteinian gravity. The other is to push closer to singularities in the hope that their extremes will help reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics in a theory of quantum gravity, which has been a goal of physicists for over a century. As Sean Hartnoll of the University of Cambridge put it, “The time is ripe now for these ideas to be fully developed.”

Thorne described the late '60s as a “golden age” for black hole research. The term “black hole” had only just come into widespread use. In September 1969, on a visit to Moscow, Thorne was given a manuscript by Evgeny Lifshitz, a prominent Ukrainian physicist. Together with Vladimir Belinski and Isaak Khalatnikov, Lifschitz had found a new solution to Einstein's equations of gravity near a singularity, using assumptions the three of them had devised. Lifshitz was afraid Soviet censors would delay publication of the result, since it contradicted an earlier proof he had coauthored, so he asked Thorne to share it in the West.

Earlier black hole models assumed perfect symmetries not found in nature, positing, for example, that a star was a perfect sphere before collapsing into a black hole, or that it had no net electrical charge. (These assumptions allowed Einstein's equations to be solved, in the simplest form, by Karl Schwarzschild shortly after Einstein published them.) The solution that Belinski, Khalatnikov, and Lifschitz found, which came to be called the BKL solution after their initials, described what might happen in a messy, more realistic situation where black holes form from irregularly shaped objects. The result was not a smooth stretching of space and time inside, but a roiling sea of space and time stretching and compressing in multiple directions.

Thorne smuggled the paper back to the United States and mailed a copy to Misner, who he knew was thinking along similar lines. It turned out that Misner and the Soviet group had independently alighted on the same ideas using similar assumptions and different techniques. What's more, the BKL group “used it to solve the biggest unsolved problem of that era in mathematical relativity,” Thorne said, concerning the existence of what is known as a “generic” singularity. Belinski, the last surviving member of the BKL trio, recently said in an email that Misner's vivid descriptions in turn helped him to visualize the chaotic situation near the singularities that they both revealed.

Clockwise from top: Isaak Khalatnikov, Vladimir Belinski, and Evgeny Lifshitz discovered chaotic black hole singularities in the late 1960s. At the time, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz were two of the most prominent Soviet physicists, while Belinski was in graduate school.

Understanding some of what they were uncovering requires grasping the ways that general relativity and quantum mechanics are at odds with each other. Notably, relativity posits that spacetime must be continuous: You can look at arbitrarily small distances and never find a gap in it. In quantum mechanics, however, it becomes meaningless to talk about distances smaller than a limit called the Planck length—beyond that, we can't know that there are no gaps in space-time. But the two theories have one commonality. Both are profoundly counterintuitive.

“These patterns may indicate an underlying hidden structure of gravity.”

Relativity holds that two regions of space can be disconnected, meaning that nothing that takes place in one region can have any possible effect on the other. This might simply be because they are far apart—the speed of light is finite, after all. But regions of spacetime can also become disconnected, or decoupled, in the presence of strong gravitational fields, such as those found in and around a black hole. These fields slow down the flow of time so much that interaction becomes impossible. For example, the inside and outside of a black hole are decoupled by a boundary called the event horizon. Because black hole gravity is so strong, anything that takes place within the event horizon can't ever be observed from outside the black hole, according to relativity. (Quantum mechanics introduces additional complications.)

Because strong gravitational fields can cause space to decouple, the BKL group argued that, as you get close to a singularity, the strong gravity causes every point in space to decouple from every other one. This means that each tiny part of space behaves on its own terms, and it makes the math much simpler (though still quite complicated). If decoupling takes place, they showed that the inside of a black hole is a mishmash—rather unlike the smooth stretching of space and time that Schwarzschild's earlier solution suggested. As Hartnoll explained, though the BKL argument wasn't fully rigorous by mathematical standards, until they advanced the idea, nobody had anticipated that decoupling occurs. BKL, he said, were way ahead of their time.

In their account, around each decoupled point, space stretches in a random direction and compresses in the other two perpendicular directions. Then, after a short but random amount of time, it flips, stretching out in one of the previously squished directions and squishing in the other two. This can be thought of like an extremely elongated football that keeps “bouncing” between different orientations.

Sean Hartnoll has been analyzing the chaotic behavior found inside black holes in the hopes of coming up with a quantum theory of gravity.

For decades, physicists and mathematicians have wanted to show that these chaotic dynamics are not an artifact of the simplifying assumption of decoupling, but inherent to black holes. By the early 2000s, exponentially growing computational power and new algorithms made it possible to perform numerical simulations that were consistent with decoupling. Around the same time, Marc Henneaux, Thibault Damour and Hermann Nicolai proved the existence of a number of intricate symmetries near a singularity, without assuming that decoupling must occur. Since then, physicists and mathematicians have been working to establish when chaos appears near a singularity, and figure out what more can be said about singularities themselves.

In 1997, Juan Maldacena, a physicist now at the Institute for Advanced Study, discovered a correspondence, known as AdS/CFT, between two different versions of spacetime: a higher-dimensional spacetime called the bulk and a lower-dimensional spacetime called the boundary. This correspondence is often compared to the way a hologram can make two-dimensional structures appear to be three-dimensional. Also called duality, it means that solutions arrived at in one of two simplified toy universes also apply to the other.

In the early 2000s, Marc Henneaux discovered the existence of intricate symmetries in the chaotic interiors of black holes.

Gravity only appears on the higher-dimensional side of the correspondence, called anti-de Sitter space, or AdS. On the boundary side, there is no gravity. Interactions between particles there are governed only by a version of quantum mechanics called conformal field theory, or CFT. One can use AdS/CFT to pose a complex problem on one side, translate it into a simpler form on the other, and translate a solution back—an extremely powerful tool for physicists seeking to understand gravitational phenomena such as black holes. (Some problems are easier on the AdS side, while others are easier on the CFT side.)

In 2019 Hartnoll, then a professor at Stanford, together with his students, set out to use the correspondence to find out what happens inside an AdS black hole. “The reason we wanted to do this,” Hartnoll said, “is to relate the black hole interior, which isn't well understood, with the region far away, which is well understood.” They found chaos similar to that BKL had earlier discovered. Over the past half-decade, he and his collaborators have continued to use the correspondence to analyze black hole dynamics.

After Hartnoll first found BKL-like chaos in AdS/CFT, others have been trying to figure out what, exactly, causes it to arise. Oling says that Hartnoll's discovery of the Mixmaster in AdS/CFT black holes came as a surprise. Hartnoll's team “discovered that this behavior appears in settings where they would have not expected it,” he said. Together with Juan Pedraza of the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Madrid, Oling has shown that it arises even in a toy AdS/CFT model where the speed of light is set to zero. Oling said that Henneaux, among others, had anticipated that this should happen, but that the proof wasn't a given. “To me, that's not obvious,” Oling said, “because you're really simplifying the theory a lot.” In parallel, mathematicians have been approaching the BKL-like chaos from their own direction by whittling away at the assumptions required to prove that chaos emerges, and checking if it must arise even without the decoupling assumption.

As might be expected, modeling chaotic and unpredictable bounces in spacetime is a challenge. Most recently, Hartnoll and his student Ming Yang tried averaging the many bounces in a black hole. In a preprint they shared on February 4, 2025, they found a pattern using this technique related to abstract mathematical functions called modular forms. This suggests that a known mathematical language can be used to understand the chaos. “These patterns may indicate an underlying hidden structure of gravity,” Hartnoll said. “That may make it easier to formulate a quantum theory of gravity.” Even if the event horizon prevents us from directly observing the chaos inside black holes, knowing it is there and what it means could point the way to a new physics, and toward answers to some of our grandest questions about reality itself.

If you bought a Framework Laptop 13 at its original launch in 2021 (or even later), it required a lot of blind faith. The idea of a laptop you could upgrade yourself was spectacular in theory, but whether Framework could deliver on that promise wouldn't be known for many years.

But here we are, more than four years later, seeing Framework's grand ambitions come to fruition. Framework has launched new Mainboards—the core component of the laptop with the motherboard, CPU, GPU, and other crucial components—with the latest AMD Ryzen AI 300 series chips. That means you can upgrade your old Framework Laptop 13 to bring it into the modern computing era. While the Mainboard upgrade lacks the battery life improvements of some other laptops in 2025, the Framework Laptop 13 remains a wholly unique PC thanks to its incredible repairability.

As always, there are several ways to buy the Framework Laptop 13. The DIY Edition, my review unit, is the cheapest approach. However, many components arrive separated, meaning you have to piece them together. More on that later. If you own a Framework Laptop 13, you can spend even less by purchasing only the Mainboard, with prices between $449 and $999.

This DIY Edition starts at $899 for the base Ryzen AI 5 340, without RAM or storage, though that does include a display, keyboard, and trackpad. That's a bit expensive if you don't already own the storage and memory. Framework charges $80 to add 16 GB of RAM and $69 for 500 GB of storage. Those are solid prices, though you can always save extra cash by shopping around. That's one of the many benefits of the Framework Laptop 13. Compare that to Microsoft, which charges $200 to double your storage on the Surface Laptop 7.

If you don't want to install the components yourself, you can always opt for the “Pre-built” model, which costs an extra $200. But let's be honest: If you're interested in a Framework machine, putting it together is not just more affordable; it's part of the appeal. Installing the components couldn't be simpler.

The design of the Framework Laptop hasn't changed since its original launch. On its own, it's nothing special. It's 0.62 inches thick and 2.9 pounds—about average for a laptop of this type. It is slightly wedge-shaped with a generic silver color. The bezels around the screen aren't as narrow as I'd like, especially along the top and bottom. Most laptops around this price will offer thinner bezels. The thick bezels are there for a reason. Since nearly every aspect of this laptop can be replaced and customized, each element requires an extra degree of engineering. That, after all, is this laptop's calling card.

The Wi-Fi card is preinstalled this go around, but the DIY Edition comes with the Input Cover Kit separately, meaning you'll need to attach the keyboard and trackpad after installing the RAM and SSD. Unlike the new Framework Laptop 12, which the company calls its “easiest product ever to repair,” the Framework Laptop 13 uses the older system of installing the input cover, which involves attaching the keyboard with a ribbon connector.

You can easily replace any other already-installed components, such as the battery or speakers. They're all labeled with QR codes, which link to helpful corresponding videos, making assembly snappy. All the screws are fasteners, meaning you'll never lose an important screw. The only tricky thing about the DIY Edition is installing Windows 11 (or Linux, if you prefer) and the necessary drivers to get it up and running.

The Framework Laptop 13 has a unique Expansion Card system for ports. You get four slots, two on each side, along with the headphone jack. My unit has three USB-C, one USB-A, and one microSD slot. You'll need at least one of those USB-C ports for power, meaning you only have three extra ports available. When you order a DIY Edition, you can choose whichever arrangement you want, including more uncommon options like DisplayPort and Ethernet.

I'd probably opt for two USB-C, one USB-A, and a full-size SD card slot. But if I knew I needed an HDMI, I could always swap that in. That's the beauty of these Expansion Cards, though having one more would be helpful. If more ports are necessary, take a look at the Framework Laptop 16, which offers six Expansion Card slots.

My test unit came equipped with the Ryzen AI 7 350—an 8-core CPU—the middle option between the 12-core Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 and the 6-core Ryzen AI 5 340. It also has a 1-terabyte solid state drive and 16 GB DDR5 RAM. Outside of gaming laptops like the Razer Blade 16, this is my first time testing these new Ryzen AI 300 series chips, as they haven't been available in many laptops. Framework has yet to announce support for Intel's latest Core Ultra Series 2 chips. That may come eventually, but your only option is AMD for now.

A lot has changed in the world of Windows laptops in the past year. Thanks to the pressure from Qualcomm's highly efficient new Snapdragon X chips, Intel and AMD are forced to match the battery life of these new Arm-powered laptops. That's why this is such an important upgrade for the Framework Laptop. Instead of buying an entirely new machine to gain the benefits of longer battery life and on-device AI, you can replace the Mainboard in your Framework Laptop 13 with one of these new AMD chips. The problem is that you can buy a brand new laptop for around $700. That laptop might be one step below the entry-level DIY Edition Framework Laptop, but it's also $200 less, and about the same as just the Ryzen AI 7 350 Mainboard.

The Ryzen AI 7 350 is on par with the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus or Intel Core Ultra 7 256V, give or take. It's slightly behind in single-core performance, as measured by Cinebench R24, and a half-step ahead in multi-core. These processors aren't known for being a powerhouse. Rather, the focus is all on efficiency. Here's where the AMD chip is solidly in last place. Battery life on the Framework Laptop 13 is improved from prior models, but it's not as long as what you get on a Snapdragon X or Core Ultra Series 2 PC.

The light battery test I ran on the Laptop 13 lasted roughly 11 hours, looping a local video at max display brightness. That's eight to 10 hours behind some of the competition, showing how much Intel, Qualcomm, and Apple have raised the bar in the past year. For my typical workload, real-time battery life sank to around 7 and a half hours. That's around the same as on the original Framework Laptop 13 I tested in 2021. If battery life is your main concern, it may be worth waiting to see if Framework introduces an Intel Core Ultra Series 2 Mainboard.

There are some aspects of the laptop you'll always be stuck with, namely, the chassis. Laptop designs that take full advantage of the more efficient chips in the future should result in thinner laptops without losing performance. We're already seeing this in effect with thinner gaming laptops than ever.

But it's also worth noting that some of the other components are somewhat outdated as they are right now. The webcam is a good example. In 2021, when this laptop was first designed, 2-MP webcams at 1080p were a good resolution to expect. Many PCs are moving to 1440p or higher, like the recent M4 MacBook Air. Apple has been upgrading the webcam from 720p in 2020 to 1080p in 2022, and now to 12-MP in 2025. The MacBook Air today costs the same as the MacBook Air from 2020.

The lower-resolution screen in the starting configuration is outdated compared to the competition as well. My unit has a higher-resolution 2,880 x 1,920 IPS panel with a 120-Hz refresh rate, which is more than sharp, fast, and color-accurate enough. The matte finish is great for deflecting glare. But that's in a configuration that costs over $1,500. For that price, many laptops offer even sharper OLED panels with significantly higher contrast, and maybe even a touchscreen.

The good news is that there's a strong chance Framework will offer newer components to reflect the current standard. The company sells webcam modules, speaker upgrades, and display kits for older machines, and there's no reason to expect there won't be newer versions soon. But those upgrades will cost extra, and once again, you're putting your faith in Framework to deliver.

Fortunately, the Framework Laptop 13 is still a great starting place, and it'll be many more years before it feels truly outdated. Today, it's more than just a practical answer to the problem of electronic waste. It's a truly one-of-a-kind laptop.

I'm a big fan of using the right tool for the job in the kitchen. No surprise there, yet I frequently get that FOMO-y feeling that something new or different might be better than what I own.

Several months ago, I looked at a set of carbon steel knives made in Oregon by Steelport. They were beautiful, with their blade patina and sculptural wood handles. I wondered if I was keeping up with the Portlandians, and particularly their bread knives, when I compared it with my inexpensive but high-performing Mercer Culinary Millenia.

The Mercer is America's Test Kitchen's top pick for serrated bread knives, with its snub nose and pointy teeth. The black plastic handle is grippy, chunky, and functional. It immediately replaced its predecessor, a nostalgia-inducing but low-performing stainless number that I got in Paris for cheap because it had a crack in the handle.

Looking at the Steelport 10-inch Bread Knife at my favorite trade show, I daydreamed about how it might work even better than the $25 Mercer. At an astounding 450 bucks … brief pause here as the writer pulls out a calculator and divides 450 by 25 … could it be 18 times better? I will not let that idea waggle around. It was not 18 times better, but I'll let you wonder for a moment if it was maybe a couple.

Leaving price out of it for a moment, high-end bread knives of this quality have a lot going for them. The Steelport is quite handsome, with a burl-wood handle and gray blade that stand out from the less-interesting knives in your block. At 65 on the Rockwell C scale, it is a particularly hard blade. That level of hardness can make the steel a little brittle but allows the blade to be narrow, extremely sharp, and able to hold a ripping edge for a long time. The handle is a little more ""multi-planar"" than most knives, and it is quite comfortable. The top of the blade, known as the spine, is rounded, something you'll appreciate if you're using it for a long time, as it can keep blisters from forming on your index finger; more knives should do this. There's also a finger nook at the blade heel, which can make you feel more slotted into your grip. One difference between the two knives is that the Mercer has pointier serrations compared to the Steelport's more rounded tips; a choppy ocean versus rolling seas, if you will.

I thought this might make a noticeable difference so I started cutting stuff up, buying and making loaves, then tearing into them with one knife then the other over the course of a couple of months. Both of them went through sandwich bread with the greatest of ease, with zero damage to the bread itself, the opposite of the manhandling you'd give the loaf if you went at it with a dull chef's knife. I was needlessly concerned when cutting vertically into delicate croissants and even more so when I cut horizontally through the crispy, laminated goodness like you would do to toast it or to make a croissan'wich, but both blades just sliced through, leaving clean edges and neat corners in their wakes.

Unsurprisingly, they both slipped a little on the thick crust when turning a half boule into slices, but rotating the knife to get it roughly perpendicular to the curved surface for half a stroke until it bit, then going vertical, fixed that easily. The two blades felt so evenly matched that I'd occasionally slice into a bagel or some other loaf with one knife, get distracted for a second, and have no clue which one I had used to make the cut.

One day I had crystallized honey trapped inside a plastic bear dispenser and used the knives to saw the beast in half. Knife abuse is bad, but it's certainly easier with an inexpensive knife.

OK—time for some awkwardness! Is a fancy and expensive bread knife 18 times as good as the top-ranked, 25-dollar competition? Nope. Is it even twice as good? Again, alas, no. I will say more positive stuff on the the slightly more touchy-feely side, however. The Steelport is well designed and handsome, and it feels very good to draw back and forth. The gentle curve of the blade might even give dorks like me an occasional samurai-sword frisson. For those reasons, or at least some of them, you might reach for it a bit more often, or just enjoy staring at it.

One particularly appealing service is Steelport's free sharpening for life, which is done by mailing your blades to them. It's a nice perk a few other manufacturers, including Cutco, offer. (Side note: Say what you want about Cutco knives, but its $145 bread knife, inexplicably sold as a “carver,” is surprisingly excellent. Just have a knife shop lop off its pointy tip.) You can also sharpen your own serrated knife or find a shop that will do it for you.

You might feel better about yourself if you got a Mercer and donated the difference to World Central Kitchen or your local food bank. But if it gives you great pleasure to use a fancy bread knife, and you can afford the price difference, go for it. It works great and looks even better.

With the first week of Meta's antitrust trial behind us, documents shared by the U.S Federal Trade Commission (FTC) offered more insight into Meta's internal struggles to keep Facebook relevant. In emails from 2022, Meta executives mulled different visions for Facebook's future to boost its success, acknowledging that its cultural relevance was decreasing. 

Fast-forward to 2025, and Meta is still grappling with this issue. Mark Zuckerberg said during the company's Q4 earnings call in January that the company wants to restore Facebook's cultural relevance this year with a return to “OG Facebook.” Part of its solution for this problem is the recent launch of a revamped Friends tab. 

In a series of messages from April 2022, which were shared as evidence during the trial, Zuckerberg discussed concerns about Facebook's “Friends” structure and format being outdated as every other major platform focused on “Following.” 

He considered ditching the Friends format and even suggested deleting everyone's Facebook friends and having them start again.

Some of the highlights from Mark Zuckerberg's emails are below.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Raw Garden Sprout Review: A Smooth Disposable Vape Minus the Microplastics","https://gizmodo.com/raw-garden-sprout-review-a-smooth-disposable-vape-minus-the-microplastics-2000590406","Sun, 20 Apr 2025 13:02:38 GMT","

Microplastics: Where aren't they these days? They're in the food we eat, the water we drink, and, um… the weed we smoke? Apparently! At least if you partake in those ubiquitous, disposable vape thingies. One California company thinks it has found a solution, though. The result is the Raw Garden Sprout, the smoothest, most delightful little disposable I've ever tried.

To start with, the Sprout is teeny-tiny. Coming in at just 1.5 x 2.25 in x 0.5 inches (WxHxD) it's the most discreet little vaporizer I've ever seen. We're usually happy when one can fit in your pants pocket: This thing can fit in the little fifth pocket of your Levis. It has three power settings (2 volts, 2.3 volts, and 2.6 volts), and it charges via USB-C. It comes filled with either Raw Garden's Live Sauce or Refined Live Resin, both of which are incredibly pure, and eye-crossingly potent.

Raw Garden Sprout

A tiny disposable vape that makes big clouds.

Pros

Cons

Let's back up.  All of these disposables use a concentrated cannabis oil which is typically stored in a chamber made of a plastic. The most widely used plastic for this application is called PCTG, which is food-safe. When Raw Garden and its manufacturing partner Ispire were developing the device that would become the Sprout they were testing the devices in a heat chamber to make sure they wouldn't leak, but they noticed something weird: The clear plastic that stores the oil was getting cloudy rather quickly, which shouldn't be happening. Repeated tests with both their own product and other products that use PCTG revealed the same thing.

What they concluded was that while PCTG might be food-safe, it wasn't weed-safe. At least not weed-oil-safe. Interestingly, while testing it with different oils, they found that those with a higher amount of terpenes (natural chemicals found in weed that gives different strains their distinct flavors, aromas, and to some extent, effect) got cloudier faster. Because this cloudiness was permanent they determined that it was highly likely that it was being compromised, and that plastic particles were ending up in the oil, which when vaped could end up in consumers' lungs.

So, Raw Garden did something pretty admirable, and scrapped more than $1,000,000 worth of product that was ready to go. It then went back to the drawing board with Ispire and identified an alternate material called PA-12. PA-12 is also a plastic, but it's been used for a long time in the electronics, automotive, and medical industries because it's known for being durable, heat-resistant, and critically here, chemical resistant. Through repeated testing Raw Garden found that PA-12 did not break down, even when filled with pure terpenes and exposed to high-ambient heat (120 degrees F) for a week straight. It also chose to publish this information and refrain from patenting it in the hopes that other makers of disposable vapes would adopt the safer material as well.

Okay, so back to the Sprout itself. To power it on, you just give it five rapid clicks (which will be familiar to anyone who has used a cartridge style vape). It will then light up to show the current heat level selected: blue for low (2.0V), green for medium (2.3V), and red for high (2.6V). To switch between these levels, you just click the button three times. A double-click will preheat the device, which will get you a fuller first hit, but I rarely bothered with this. Raw Garden says low will get you the best flavor and smoothest hit, medium is for “balanced flavor and potency,” while high is the strongest hit, for experienced users.

For this review I tested two units: an indica Live Sauce called PB Souffle with 80.7-percent potency (and 15.9-percent terpenes) for a hearty mix of favor and punch, and a Refined Live Resin hybrid called Strawberry Gas that came in at a staggering 90.7-percent potency, and still tasted good, but tread lightly or don't make any plans, if you know what I mean. Seriously, start with just a small hit or two and then wait a bit, because it's much stronger than you think. I usually kept the power level turned down to green, which was absolutely delicious, and generally so smooth that I wasn't sure if I was getting anything until I exhaled and saw a cloud emerge from my mouth. I usually find disposable and oil-based pens to be pretty chokey, so this was a remarkable experience for me. Medium definitely hit harder, and I did try it at high (in the name of science), and it was definitely more than I wanted. It was smoother than others I've used in the past, but still a bit harsher than I like. I'm trying to keep my lungs pretty in pink.

There are some other innovative features packed into this little thing, which also help it produce an unusually smooth, consistent hit. The Spout features an “anti-clog design” with a unique Overflow Chamber. Most disposables use a post (kind of like a wick) to draw the oil up to the nozzle where it gets heated. The Sprout features a post-less design, which eliminates the primary point of clogging for most vapes. The Overflow Chamber is secondary space within the device where the excess vapor can condense and be trapped away from the main chamber. In most vapes, the excess cloud gets flushed back into the one and only chamber, where it can congeal and not only cause clogging, but also that nasty burnt taste disposable/cartridge vapes are somewhat known for.

There's not a lot to ding this thing on. The biggest knock is that while I love that Raw Garden is trying to keep garbage out of your lungs, it must be noted that no disposable is great for keeping garbage out of landfills. Once this thing is empty, the whole thing goes in the trash, lithium battery and all. Not great. It's a shame that there isn't a way to enjoy the innovations of the Spout while just swapping out a little PA-12 cartridge (or even, better, making a refillable version). Also, there is no label on the Sprout device itself, and they all look exactly the same, no matter what strain is inside it. That means if you lose the box, or have more than one and they get shuffled around in your pocket you'll have no way of knowing what's what.

If I was to nitpick a little more, I'd say that while I love that once the device is on you don't have to press any buttons (you just inhale and it's ready to go), I do wish there was a way to disable the glowing light from coming on with each inhalation. If you were at a dark concert or something and trying to be extra discreet, that might be a giveaway. That said, it's so small that even people with small hands can tuck it away in their palm, but it would be nice to have the option. The last thing is with Raw Garden being a California company, and federal weed-laws being the dumb things that they are, the Spout is only available in California. Sorry, rest of the world.

Ultimately, the Spout is by far the best disposable vape I've ever used, by many miles, and honestly, I wasn't that surprised. When I wrote about the best money-is-no-object-ways-to-get-high a few years ago I talked about Raw Garden. It is a farm-to-lung operation, where it grows, processes, and manufactures everything that it sells, and the people who run it are absolutely obsessed with purity and quality. It is Clean Green Certified (like the weed-industry's organic certification), and it also dedicates a large part of its operation to R&D, where it tests new strains, develops new genetics, and clearly, works on better, safer devices. For a disposable vape, it's the new gold standard.

After a sojourn around the globe for a second volume of international animation, Star Wars: Visions is returning to Japan for another volume of anime-centric adventures. So it's perhaps fitting then, that Lucasfilm just gave us our first look at the latest anthology right out of Star Wars Celebration Japan.

Today in Tokyo, Lucasfilm lifted the lid on the first teaser for Visions Volume 3 to gathered fans at Star Wars Celebration. The latest volume will feature tales created by nine Japanese animation studios, each reflecting their own unique perspective and vision for the galaxy far, far away–including some returning stories, building on episodes from the first volume. Although the trailer has yet to be fully released online, it was shared with fans via the official Star Wars Celebration livestream. Check it out below!

The latest batch of studios working on Visions features a mix of both new talent and those who already worked on episodes for Vision‘s landmark debut season. Returning studios include Kamikaze Douga (Batman Ninja), which developed the incredibly popular short “The Duel” that introduced us to the ex-Sith Ronin; Trigger (Promare, Gridman, Kill La Kill, Dynazenon, and much more), which worked on both “The Twins” and “The Elder;” and Production I.G. (Ghost in the Shell, to say the least), which created “The Ninth Jedi;” and Kinema Citrus (Made in Abyss), which worked on “The Village Bridge.” Three of those shorts will get sequels, “The Duel: Payback”, “The Village Bride: The Lost Ones”, and “The Ninth Jedi: Child of Hope”.

But a roster of new studios are also joining. Kamikaze Douga will work with Anima (.Hack, Sandland) on its sequel, but standalone newcomers include David Production (JoJo's Bizarre Adventure); Wit Studio (Attack on Titan, Spy x Family); Polygon Pictures (Transformers Prime, Tron: Uprising, and best known in Star Wars for support work on Clone Wars and Resistance); and Project Studio Q (an CG house born from Evangelion and Gundam GQuuuuuuX studio Khara after its work on Evangelion 3.0+1.0: Thrice Upon a Time).

Also announced at the panel was a new extended format spin-off for the series, Star Wars Visions Presents, which will return to prior stories and worlds told in the series and expand upon them in a longer format. Presents will see Production I.G.'s Kenji Kamiyama return to direct The Ninth Jedi, which will see the short's protagonist Kara return in an “all-new story”, seemingly separate from the events of the sequel short “Child of Hope”.

Star Wars: Visions returns to Disney+ for Volume 3 on October 29. Star Wars Visions Presents: The Ninth Jedi will stream some time in 2026.

While Star Wars Celebration's main focus might be the film and TV arms of the franchise, Lucasfilm Publishing has built up its own dedicated fan base with its tie-in novels, including the High Republic initiative. After kicking off in January 2021, the era is wrapping up soon with the June release of the final book in its third phase, Charles Soule's Trials of the Jedi.

But what lies ahead for Star Wars readers? Lucasfilm Publishing's Star Wars Celebration panel, “Stories From a Galaxy Far, Far Away” was a good place to start for some answers. The Tokyo panel teased “the latest publishing news from the prequel trilogy to the sequel trilogy and beyond, including news on the grand finale of The High Republic,” with Adam Christopher, Tessa Gratton, Marc Guggenheim, Lydia Kang, Ethan Sacks, Phil Szostak, Alyssa Wong, and Marvel's C.B. Cebulski on hand to make the announcements.

The biggest reveal was something on the more visual side: an Andor art book is coming!

Here's the description from the official press release: “The Art of Star Wars: Andor (The Complete Series) takes fans behind the scenes of the critically acclaimed Disney+ Star Wars series set in the early days of the Rebellion and following Rogue One‘s Cassian Andor as he grows from thief to rebel spy.”

“Interviews conducted by The Art of Star Wars: The Mandalorian author and Lucasfilm creative art manager Phil Szostak with Academy Award-nominated showrunner/head writer Tony Gilroy, Lucasfilm art department ‘visualists,' and key crew and creatives will give an in depth look at every facet of the creative process that brought this unique Star Wars story to the screen. With hundreds of stunning ship and vehicle designs, character studies, weapons, gadgets, storyboards, and so much more, this book is the ultimate visual companion to Andor.”

The bad news is that The Art of Star Wars: Andor will set you back $50, and won't be out until March 2026.

The panel today also included more discussion of the final High Republic book, Trials of the Jedi, mentioned above. Other new titles announced: comics Star Wars: The High Republic – The Battle of Eriadu and Star Wars: The High Republic – The Beacon; the Jecki and Yord-focused Padawan adventure The Acolyte: The Crystal Crown; another art book, Industrial Light & Magic: 50 Years of Innovation; and comics Star Wars: Hyperspace Stories – Codebreaker, for Poe Dameron fans; and new issues of Star Wars: Legacy of Vader; and Star Wars: Jedi Knights.

Last week, ahead of the panel itself, Lucasfilm Publishing dropped some early news about upcoming releases—including Adam Christopher's Star Wars: Master of Evil Darth Vader novel; lavish two-volume art book Doug Chiang: The Cinematic Legacy and the Star Wars Legacy; Halloween-themed Star Wars: I Find Your Lack of Candy Disturbing, featuring art by Jeffrey Brown; and Disney+ behind-the-scenes deep dives The Art of Star Wars: The Acolyte and The Acolyte Visual Guide. Other previously announced releases include an updated new edition of Star Wars: The Blueprints, as well as an updated new edition of Star Wars: Women of the Galaxy.

But that's not all! At another Lucasfilm Publishing panel earlier in the day, “Manga Mania!”, the company also shared what's coming from that arm of the company. That includes a Kickstarter initiative for a two-volume The Art of Star Wars: A New Hope—The Manga; manga adaptations of Star Wars: Thrawn and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order; and aspiring Jedi tale Star Wars: Path of the Lightsaber.

Four days before Donald Trump's inauguration, financial technology startup Ramp published a pitch for how to tackle wasteful government spending. In a 4,000-word blog post titled “The Efficiency Formula,” Ramp's CEO and one of its investors echoed ideas similar to those promoted by Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk: Federal programs were overrun by fraud, and commonsense business techniques could provide a quick fix.

Ramp sells corporate credit cards and artificial intelligence software for businesses to analyze spending. And while the firm appears to have no existing federal contracts, the post implied the government should consider hiring it. Just as Ramp helped businesses manage their budgets, the company “could do the same for a variety of government agencies,” according to the blog and company social media posts.

It didn't take long for Ramp to find a willing audience. Within Trump's first three months in office, its executives scored at least four private meetings with the president's appointees at the General Services Administration, which oversees major federal contracting. Some of the meetings were organized by the nation's top procurement officer, Josh Gruenbaum, commissioner of the Federal Acquisition Service.

GSA is eying Ramp to get a piece of the government's $700 billion internal expense card program, known as SmartPay. In recent weeks, Trump appointees at GSA have been moving quickly to tap Ramp for a charge card pilot program worth up to $25 million, sources told ProPublica, even as Musk's Department of Government Efficiency highlights the multitudes of contracts it has canceled across federal agencies.

Founded six years ago, Ramp is backed by some of the most powerful figures in Silicon Valley. One is Peter Thiel, the billionaire venture capitalist who was one of Trump's earliest supporters in the tech world and who spent millions aiding Vice President JD Vance's Ohio Senate run. Thiel's firm, Founders Fund, has invested in seven separate rounds of funding for Ramp, according to data from PitchBook. Last year, Thiel said there was “no one better positioned” to build products at the intersection of AI and finance.

To date, the company has raised about $2 billion in venture capital, according to startup tracking website Crunchbase, much of it from firms with ties to Trump and Musk. Ramp's other major financial backers include Keith Rabois of Khosla Ventures; Thrive Capital, founded by Joshua Kushner, the brother of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner; and 8VC, a firm run by Musk allies.

The special attention Gruenbaum paid to Ramp raised flags inside and outside the agency. “This goes against all the normal contracting safeguards that are set up to prevent contracts from being awarded based on who you know,” said Scott Amey, the general counsel with the bipartisan Project on Government Oversight. He said career civil servants should lead the process to pick the best choice for taxpayers.

A senior GSA official, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, said the high level attention Ramp received was unusual, especially before a bid had been made public. “You don't want to give this impression that leadership has already decided the winner somehow.”

GSA told ProPublica it “refutes any suggestion of unfair or preferential contracting practices,” with a spokesperson adding that the “credit card reform initiative has been well known to the public in an effort to address waste, fraud, and abuse.”

Ramp did not respond to requests for comment.

Rabois, one of Ramp's earliest investors, is part of an influential group of tech titans known as the “PayPal Mafia.” Leaders of the early payments company include several influential players surrounding the Trump administration, including Musk and Thiel. Rabois and his husband, Jacob Helberg, hosted a fundraiser that pulled in upwards of $1 million for Trump's 2024 campaign, according to media reports. Trump has nominated Helberg for a senior role at the State Department.

Rabois sits on Ramp's board of directors. He has said he had no plans to join the Trump administration, instead telling CNBC: “I have ideas, I can spoon-feed them to the right people.” He told ProPublica his comments to CNBC were about big-picture policy ideas and that he had “no involvement in any government-related initiatives for the company.” Ramp “could be a great choice for any government that wants to improve its efficiencies,” Rabois added.

Helberg said he has no involvement “in anything related to Ramp whatsoever.”

Thrive Capital, Kushner's firm, did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Thiel did not provide a comment. 8VC did not respond to a request for comment, nor did the White House or Musk; previously, Musk has said “I'll recuse myself” if conflict-of-interest issues arise.

Ramp's meetings with Gruenbaum — who comes from private equity firm KKR and has no prior government experience — came at an opportune moment. GSA will decide by year's end whether to extend the SmartPay contract, and preparations are afoot for the next generation of the program. SmartPay has been worth hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for the financial institutions that currently operate it, U.S. Bank and Citibank.

Gruenbaum and acting GSA administrator Stephen Ehikian entered the agency with a strong belief that SmartPay and other government payment programs were rife with fraud or waste, causing huge losses, sources within GSA say — an idea echoed in Ramp's January memo.

Yet both GOP and Democratic budget experts, as well as former GSA officials, describe that view as ill-informed. SmartPay, which provides Visa and Mastercard charge cards to government employees, enables the federal workforce to purchase office supplies and equipment, book travel and pay for gas.

The cards typically are used to fund travel and purchases up to $10,000.

“SmartPay is the lifeblood of the government,” said former GSA commissioner Sonny Hashmi, who oversaw the program. “It's a well-run program that solves real world problems … with exceptional levels of oversight and fraud prevention already baked in.”

Jessica Riedl, a GOP budget expert at the conservative Manhattan Institute think tank, said the notion that there was significant fraud in the charge card technology was far-fetched. She had criticized waste in government credit card programs before the latest SmartPay system was implemented in 2018.

“This was a huge problem about 20-25 years ago,” she said. “In the past 15 years, there have been new controls put into government credit card purchases.”

A 2017 audit of the program by the Government Accountability Office concluded there was “little evidence of potential fraud” in SmartPay small purchases, though it found documentation errors. More recent government audits found some instances where officials did not always use anti-fraud tools.

GSA's new leaders are convinced SmartPay is entirely broken, a view they shared in private meetings, sources said. In February, they put a temporary $1 limit on government cards and severely restricted the number of cardholders, choking off funds to workers in the field.

Chaos ensued across the government, news organizations reported: Staff at the National Institutes of Health were reportedly unable to purchase materials for experiments, Federal Aviation Administration workers worried they would be unable to pay for travel to test systems in the field, and National Park Service employees could not travel to oversee road maintenance projects.

At the time, GSA released a statement saying the limitations were “risk mitigation best practice” and internally began moving to revamp SmartPay.

Ramp's first bite of the SmartPay business could come through a pilot program worth up to $25 million that GSA announced several weeks after agency leadership began meeting with the company.

At the tail end of the Biden administration, GSA had sent out a request for information, or RFI, seeking industry input about how to improve the next iteration of SmartPay. But some industry players who submitted responses said they did not hear back from the government. Instead, GSA started meeting with Ramp.

GSA put out a new RFI for the pilot program on March 20, 2025, leaving it open for less than seven business days.

John Weiler, co-founder of the nonprofit research group the IT Acquisition Advisory Council, said such a short window appeared unusual. “A week is nothing, it gives the impression they had already picked the winner,” said Weiler, who has worked with Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley to investigate IT contracting issues.

Ramp is the clear-cut “favorite,” to secure this work, one source inside GSA and another former official told ProPublica. The winner has not yet been announced.

Procurement experts told ProPublica that consulting with industry leaders before a major overhaul is good practice — but that the fact-finding process must be evenhanded and led by professional contracting officers.

The GSA spokesperson said that “any and all communications with potential vendors, of which there were multiple, has been a part of market research in order to provide the best solution for American taxpayers.” The agency declined to answer questions about whether Ramp had already been chosen internally for SmartPay work.

The pilot program is unique because it uses a special GSA purchasing authority known as commercial solutions opening. This process has been used by the Pentagon to help speed up the acquisition of products for fighters in armed conflict zones. The designation means the chosen contractor can be selected faster and without the same level of controls.

It's not clear how Ramp originally secured private meetings with GSA leaders. Nor is it clear if Ramp will ultimately take over the entire SmartPay contract from Citibank and U.S. Bank. Spokespeople for U.S. Bank and Citibank declined to comment.

It is clear that Ramp has never had a client like the federal government. The only public-sector partner listed on its webpage is a charter school network in Nashville, Tennessee.

Still, even before the RFI was publicly announced, Ramp had begun reaching out to contacts in the payment industry asking about the special bank identification numbers required to process government payments, said an industry source. Such steps, two former GSA officials said, were another sign that Ramp was preparing to work on the program.

Ramp's meetings with GSA come as the agency is poised to take on a more significant role in spending decisions across government. The same day the SmartPay pilot was announced, Trump issued an executive order that seeks to centralize much of government procurement inside of GSA. The DOGE initiative has been effectively headquartered out of the agency — staffers have installed beds and dressers for overnight stays in the building, and Musk's right-hand man Steve Davis is a key adviser to the agency's leadership.

The SmartPay contract negotiation has so far flown under the radar. But changes to the credit card program could further transform daily life for federal employees and fundamentally change how agencies operate. It also represents a giant business opportunity.

“There's a lot of money to be made by a new company coming in here,” said Hashmi, the former GSA official. “But you have to ask: What is the problem that's being solved?”

NNT's drones flew in lightning-resistant cages and hope to, some day, tap and store the power of thunderclouds.

The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) boasts that it has designed the world's first lightning triggering and guidance system that leverages flying drones (via machine translation). After successful trials earlier this year it is hoped that networks of these drones can be installed in cities and key infrastructure as a preventative protection measure.



Lightning damage isn't as rare as many an old adage might suggest, according to the stats shared by NTT. Its PR bulletin says that every year in Japan there is 100B to 200B Yen (up to $1.4B) worth of damage caused by lightning – and then there is the human cost to consider. Meanwhile, conventional lightning rods don't provide as wide coverage as desirable, or might be tricky to install (e.g. wind turbines).

With the above in mind NTT set up an experiment to see if drones can be used to prevent lightning damage. The firm used ground monitoring equipment to judge the danger of lightning in an area. And basically, when thunderclouds approached and electric field fluctuations observed, a drone was sent up to intercept.

These are not kamikaze drones - they are equipped with a lightning-resistant cage. In a test flight on Dec 13, 2024, a drone attached to a ground wire was flown to 300m altitude to approach a suspected thundercloud. NTT says it then observed a massive electrical pulse and claims that it achieved “the world's first successful lightning induction using a drone.”

When the lightning struck the drone, it could continue to fly thanks to the cage protection (though it part melted). It is key that the drone could remain airborne after being zapped, says NTT and before this live trial it had successfully tested them at up to bursts of 150,000 Amps.



NTT intends to continue refining its lightning triggering and guidance drones. To augment the above study and trials it is looking at improving lightning location prediction accuracy. Moreover, there are plans to research and development into storing the lightning energy that is safely diverted.

                                    Xabi Alonso's place in the Real Madrid dugout could be given to Santiago Solari                                

Real Madrid still see Xabi Alonso as their ‘priority' manager target, but have been forced into a race against time, with a report stating departing manager Carlo Ancelotti has been given an ultimatum.

Real will part ways with incumbent boss Ancelotti in the summer. Recent reports have suggested he'll be gone after the Copa del Rey final, win or lose.

That is reinforced by a number of insiders. Firstly, David Ornstein states that the manager is ‘expected' to leave to become the Brazil coach, while Florian Plettenberg reports a departure ‘at latest' by the end of the season is likely.

Both of those insiders and Fabrizio Romano state Bayer Leverkusen boss Alonso is the priority, with Ornstein suggesting there's ‘growing expectation' of that move.

But Romano suggests Real have been forced into a race against time which could see them underprepared for the Club World Cup.

“Ancelotti insists to complete the season with Real Madrid and to try to win titles with Real Madrid, meanwhile, the Brazilian Federation is insisting a lot. For Brazil, the only way is to have Ancelotti available in June, so not at the end of the Club World Cup,” he said.

“What it means for Real Madrid is the coach for the Club World Cup would be Xabi Alonso, who's the clear favourite, or in case they can't make it in time, an internal solution, like Santiago Solari and then Xabi Alonso, but the priority would be to have the new coach.”

Plettenberg has reported Leverkusen are still waiting for Alonso's decision, and are hoping he stays. If he does stay, or if a decision is not reached before the Club World Cup, then as Romano says, Solari might take the dugout for the tournament.

His spell in charge of Real's senior team in 2018/19 was more underwhelming than most other managers who have recently taken charge of the club.

Ancelotti wins 2.25 points per game at Real, Jose Mourinho won 2.43, and Zinedine Zidane 2.3 in his first spell and 2.04 in an underwhelming second.

Solaris's 28 games in charge saw him win two points per game, and he has since moved into a directorial role at the club.

It could be detrimental to Real to not have a top coach in the dugout for the Club World Cup, as the winners are set to receive around €110million (£95m approx).

That money could see Real sign one of their top targets easily in the summer – Florian Wirtz has been mentioned – so they'll want to be in the best position possible come June.

Real are reportedly prioritising a move for Manchester City midfielder Rodri in the summer transfer window.

That will see Arsenal breathe a sigh of relief, as while they are tracking Martin Zubimendi – who apparently wants to go there instead of the Emirates – they might not table a bid for the Gunners' top target.

Meanwhile, Real have reportedly received agreement from Arsenal that they'll be made aware if the Gunners ever decide to sell William Saliba.

It comes after suggestions that Arsenal would let Saliba go if Real gave up two players they don't want to lose – Arda Guler and Endrick.




                        Fabrizio Romano has provided insight into whether the managerial upheaval at Real Madrid could see a move for Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold aborted                    


                        Arsenal can breathe a huge sigh of relief and finalise an advanced €60m signing after Real Madrid turned their attention to a gigantic raid on Man City instead                    


                        Carlo Ancelotti is set to leave his role at Real Madrid before the end of the season and they are now in the market for a new manager                    


                        Madrid have now got Arsenal's word about an unusual and maybe unnecessary step towards getting a deal done for their top centre-back target

Updated on April 19, 2025

As anticipation builds for the expanded 2025 Club World Cup, fans around the globe are marking their calendars for what promises to be a landmark summer in the United States. Featuring 32 of the world's top clubs and $1 billion in prize money, this month-long tournament aims to crown a true champion of world soccer between June 14 and July 13. Hosted across iconic cities from Atlanta to Seattle, the competition is a bold new step for FIFA—and one that many hoped would include a possible romantic reunion between Lionel Messi and his former club, Barcelona.

But that dream may have to wait. Despite growing speculation and a vacancy in the tournament roster, Barcelona has not been invited. And the reason is more complicated than fans might expect.

The revamped Club World Cup is designed to showcase sustained excellence over time, not just one-off flashes of brilliance. While Messi is confirmed to feature with Inter Miami, Barca's absence has drawn particular attention. Their fans had hoped that a gap left by another club might give the Catalans a backdoor into the tournament. Those hopes have been dashed—at least for now.

According to Spanish newspaper Marca, “FIFA has not extended an invitation to the Spanish heavyweights after Mexican side Club Leon were removed from the tournament for violating multi-club ownership rules.”

This situation began when Club Leon, a top Mexican team, was removed from the tournament due to their shared ownership with Pachuca, another participant. The violation of FIFA's multi-club ownership regulations forced Leon out, but their appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has frozen any attempt to replace them until a ruling is made on May 6.

In the meantime, FIFA President Gianni Infantino confirmed that the vacant spot will likely be filled through a playoff between Club America and Los Angeles FC, rather than offering the position outright to a European club like Barcelona.

While fans may argue Barcelona deserves a place based on their current form—leading La Liga, in the Copa del Rey final, and in the Champions League semifinals—FIFA's selection criteria tell a different story.

The European spots for the 2025 Club World Cup were allocated based on UEFA coefficients and performances from 2021 to 2024, not just the current campaign. “Barcelona were eliminated in the Champions League group stages in both the 2021-22 and 2022-23 seasons and didn't perform well in the Europa League either,” explained Diario AS.

Because of this, the Blaugrana failed to qualify on sporting merit, and, crucially, no European team was disqualified, meaning there was no regulatory basis for inviting them to fill Leon's spot.

Even if FIFA were to consider it, the Catalans would not push for an invite. “The club won't push for inclusion in the tournament,” reported Diario AS. “They are aware of the regulations and understand they have not earned their place through sporting performance.”

With the Copa del Rey final looming on April 26, both Real Madrid and Barcelona are facing fitness scares over their biggest stars. Kylian Mbappe and Robert Lewandowski have both emerged as major doubts. 


With two of Barcelona\s most critical matches of the season fast approaching—the Copa del Rey final against Real Madrid and the UEFA Champions League semi-final showdown with Inter—Lewandowski's sudden exit could not have come at a worse time.

Carlo Ancelotti has reportedly made his decision to leave Real Madrid this summer.

Los Blancos remain in the hunt for the La Liga title and they take on El Clasico rivals Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final on April 26.

However, their brutal UEFA Champions League exit against Arsenal in midweek appears to have triggered a call on Ancelotti's future, with the club's hierarchy looking for a fresh face.

Alongside expected squad changes in the coming months, club president Florentino Perez typically opts for a switch in manager, when his lofty expectations are not met.

Failure to defend their UCL crown - despite the prospect of a domestic double - is deemed enough of a concern to cut ties with Ancelotti.

The veteran Italian coach has consistently stated his future will not be decided by himself - with his present contract running until the end of the 2025/26 season - but his second spell in Madrid looks to be over.

Despite rumours after the Arsenal UCL second-leg loss that Ancelotti would be sacked following the Copa del Rey final, those reports now look to be wide of the mark, as per The Athletic's David Ornstein.

Perez's reputation for ruthlessness does not stretch to a dismissal at such an important point in the season and Ancelotti is expected to remain at the helm until the end of the La Liga season on May 25.

The final against Barcelona, and a huge league showdown with Hansi Flick on May 11, are deemed as too important to risk but the overall picture looks set.

Ancelotti is expected to accelerate talks to take charge of the Brazil national team as Real Madrid plan for his successor.



Xabi Alonso is the No.1 favourite to come in, but with his contract at Bayer Leverkusen also in place until June 2026, Real Madrid will have to negotiate a settlement fee with the Bundesliga giants.

That will take time, and Real Madrid are on a tight schedule, ahead of their opening match at the FIFA Club World Cup against Al Hilal on June 18.

Transfer guru Fabrizio Romano has indicated the club will look for an interim/caretaker head coach to lead them at the tournament in North America if Alonso is not secured by the start of June.

Club director Santiago Solari has been put forward as the most likely short-term solution having stepped in before.

The former Argentina international led the club for four months in the 2018/19 season, following Julen Lopetegui's sacking, and Zinedine Zidane's return for the final weeks of the campaign.

He led the club to glory in the 2018 Club World Cup, and during his brief stint of 32 games in charge he sealed an overall win percentage of 69% - but a Champions League exit secured his fate and Zidane's comeback.

Others could follow as Atlético prepare changes ahead of the FIFA Club World Cup.

Atlético Madrid are preparing to move on from Brazilian winger/wing-back Samuel Lino this summer, according to Matteo Moretto's newsletter in Relevo.

Lino, signed for €6.5 million from Portuguese side Gil Vicente in 2022, has endured a turbulent 2024/25 season; he hasn't played in nearly a month due to form and injury, and he has registered only 3 goals and 2 assists across 25 games in LaLiga. Moretto explains Lino is “not considered untouchable” to the Atlético board, and “interesting offers” for him are expected from the Premier League. 

Lino's exit could be a catalyst for another busy summer at Atlético. While the first team will head to the United States to play in the new 32-team FIFA Club World Cup, Moretto's report also mentions that Ángel Correa is set to join either Mexican side Tigres and Argentine giants River Plate. Meanwhile, cup keeper Juan Musso will probably head back to Atalanta following the expiration of his one-year loan.

   MAJOR BREAKING: Samuel Lino could leave Atlético Madrid in the summer.He's likely to attract interesting offers, especially from the Premier League.[ ️: @MatteMoretto, @relevo] pic.twitter.com/ZCA5FPg5kS

In principle, I don't especially mind Lino's sale if Atlético decide on that route. And it's sad that I feel that way. A little over a year ago, I wrote about how he already looked like one of Atleti's best signings in years, especially for the fee paid; now though, Lino's situation at the club has obviously changed amid a disappointing season individually. From the board's perspective, he is one of the few players “on the exit ramp” who could realistically fetch a fee close to (or exceeding) €30 million from a hungry English side. There is a good chance the 25-year-old would be the club's most expensive departure in the upcoming window.

It is hard to pinpoint exactly what has gone wrong for Lino in 2024/25. I feel the formation switch back to a 4-4-2 impacted him more than most, as he no longer had the run of the left flank to himself as he did when Atlético attacked in a 3-5-2. It is perhaps telling if not damning that Simeone preferred the struggling Rodrigo Riquelme and even the grizzled veteran César Azpilicueta as substitutes during Saturday's loss to Las Palmas; El Cholo has spoken over the past two seasons about Lino's need to improve his attacking output with goals and assists, but the Brazilian has provided neither since the calendar flipped to March.

One of the Atlético front office's priorities this summer must be to find top-level solutions at left-back and at left midfielder, irrespective of whether Simeone will continue to bet on the 4-4-2 as his preferred formation (there are signs he could return to the 3-5-2 next year). If Lino's departure paves the way for the arrival of, say, Villarreal playmaker Álex Baena to join before the Club World Cup, I don't expect this transaction would be too controversial.

World Cup

Saudi Arabia would be “more than happy” to host an expanded 64-team men's World Cup in 2034.

In December, the Gulf state was confirmed as host for the 2034 edition of the competition following an unopposed bid. Saudi Arabia's sports minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki bin Faisal, said his country would be able to “deliver” a bigger tournament. Next year's North American World Cup will be the first 48-team edition, an increase from the 32-team format that ran from 1998 to 2022.

“I mean we're ready, and or we will be ready, inshallah,” Prince Abdulaziz told reporters ahead of Sunday's Formula One race in Jeddah. “If that's a decision that FIFA takes and thinks that that's a good decision for everyone, then we're more than happy to deliver on it.”

The calls to expand the 2030 version to 64 nations have predominantly come from South America, with Alejandro Dominguez — president of CONMEBOL, which governs soccer in the continent — supporting the idea earlier this month, after Uruguayan official Ignacio Alonso raised the proposal at a FIFA Council meeting in March.

Dominguez's argument was that, as the 2030 World Cup will respresent the 100-year anniversary since the first tournament was held in Uruguay, it should be a celebratory, further expanded edition.

Uruguay, 2022 winners Argentina and Paraguay — the home of CONMEBOL's offices — are scheduled to host one match each at the start of the 2030 tournament, with the remaining 101 games in the 48-team tournament split between Morocco, Portugal and Spain.

The proposed expansion has also provoked criticism, with Aleksander Ceferin, president of UEFA — European soccer's governing body — dismissing the proposal as a “bad idea” earlier this month. Last week, Concacaf president Victor Montagliani spoke out against the idea. Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim — president of the Asian Football Confederation, of which Saudi Arabia is a part of — also rejected the proposal, telling the Agence France-Presse that it would cause “chaos”.

A 48-team tournament sees a 40-match increase from 64 to 104 games, with the addition of a further 16 nations likely to see a similar uptick. A further expansion of the World Cup would have to be voted through at the FIFA Council, the 37-person strong decision-making arm of world soccer's governing body. The 48-team expansion was previously voted through unanimously in 2017.

One unanswered question ahead of the 2034 World Cup is whether Saudi Arabia will follow the 2022 World Cup in neighbouring Qatar in hosting the tournament during winter to minimise worries over high temperatures.

Prince Abdulaziz said that no decision has yet been reached but that there was “ongoing” dialogue with FIFA. “It is their decision to allocate the right timing,” he added.

“We are preparing everything to host it at the right time to make sure that the most important thing for us is the fan experience and to have everyone enjoy coming at the right time, at the right weather and so on.

“So yes, it's going to be a challenge with hosting two big events (the World Cup and the 2034 Asian Games) in the same year. But I think both parties, whether it was FIFA or the OCA (for the Asian Games), are open to see which is the best for the fans and for everyone to have a good discussion on that.”

There are also concerns over the rights and potential exploitation of migrant workers in the Middle Eastern nation ahead of the tournament, again similar to the 2022 tournament in Qatar.

In December, an international charity warned that workers' rights in Saudi Arabia were still an issue ahead of the 2034 World Cup. Major global human rights groups also urged FIFA to postpone the awarding of the tournament to Sauid Arabia until further reforms were introduced.

But Prince Abdulaziz said Saudi Arabia has “learned from Qatar” in the issues they had met in the lead-up to their tournament.

“We met with the Qataris, what they've been through, what they've gone through,” he said.

“We have ongoing communication with them, with FIFA as well, on what needs to be done, how do we make sure that, you know, workers' safety is a highest priority, and it's a mandate on us, and it's one of the most important things on us because we saw the impact that it had on Qatar.”

Saudi officials have repeatedly talked about the progress the kingdom has made in recent years, including labour rights, and promised to comply with FIFA's rules. They also point to the glowing technical assessment FIFA gave its bid earlier in December.

On ESPN's The Football Reporters podcast, Mark Ogden and James Olley slam the lack of transparency in the bidding process for the 2034 FIFA World Cup. (2:24)

Saudi Arabia's minister of sport, Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal, insisted workers' safety was being taken ""seriously"" and that an investigation had been launched over the death of a migrant worker during construction of a stadium for the 2034 World Cup.

Besix Group, a construction company overseeing the site of Aramco Stadium in Al Khobar, told media outlets last month that ""a worker sadly lost their life"" at the construction site on March 12.

The Guardian reported that Muhammad Arshad, from Pakistan, had fallen to his death from an upper level.

""Every incident we take seriously, we file an investigation, we look at what went wrong,"" Al-Faisal told reporters ahead of Sunday's Saudi Arabian Formula 1 Grand Prix. ""Unfortunately in construction, these things happen. We don't want them to happen. But you can take, for instance, Diriyah; they have around 35,000 workers, and I think it was 20 months or something like that without any issues happening to any of their labor.

""But we take that seriously. As soon as it was highlighted, we filed an investigation, we checked what is happening, we make sure that they put the right system in and make sure that it doesn't happen again at Aramco Stadium. And we supervise it with the contractors and so on to make sure that they deliver on these things to make sure that we deliver on our commitment, as well, to the world.""

Saudi Arabia was officially confirmed as host of the 2034 World Cup in December after a mostly opaque 15-month bid process that FIFA president Gianni Infantino helped steer toward Saudi Arabia without a rival candidate and without taking questions. Human rights groups warned that the decision will put the lives of migrant workers at risk.

FIFA and Saudi officials have said hosting the 2034 tournament can accelerate change, including more freedoms and rights for women, with Infantino calling the World Cup a ""unique catalyst for positive social change and unity.""

""I fully trust our hosts to address all open points in this process and deliver a World Cup that meets the world's expectations,"" the FIFA president said.

An international collective of rights groups said at the time that FIFA made a ""reckless decision"" to approve Saudi Arabia without getting public assurances, and the Football Supporters Europe group said it was ""the day football truly lost its mind.""

Similar criticism over the treatment of migrant workers cast a shadow over more than a decade of preparations for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

""We've learned from that,"" Al-Faisal said. ""We met with the Qataris, what they've been through, what they've gone through. We have ongoing communication with them, with FIFA, as well, on what needs to be done, how do we make sure that workers' safety is a highest priority.

""And it's a mandate on us, and it's one of the most important things on us because we saw the impact that it had on Qatar.""

This is the third in a series on The Athletic looking back at the winners of each World Cup, from Uruguay in 1930 through to Argentina in 2022. Italy had won the World Cup in 1934. Four years later, they retained the trophy.

Is 1938 the least fabled World Cup? 1930 was notable as the first edition, 1934 is often cited because of the influence of Benito Mussolini, while the ones in 1950, 1954 and 1958 have all gone down in history for different reasons. The World Cups since then have all been widely televised, so their greatest moments have been replayed thousands of times. But besides being the last tournament for 12 years due to the Second World War, what do any of us know about the 1938 finals?

Advertisement

Well, France played host, partly in recognition of its central role in creating the tournament in the first place. The South American nations believed it was their turn to stage the World Cup though, and therefore neither Uruguay nor Argentina entered.

Spain were also absent, owing to civil war. Austria had qualified, but then the country was annexed by Adolf Hitler and therefore they were forced to withdraw, with some of their players ordered to represent Germany instead. That left a spare slot in the tournament, and while FIFA begged England to take up the 16th and final place, they continued to stay away, leaving just 15 teams in a straight knockout tournament. Sweden got a bye.

Italy were, of course, the defending champions. But there had been widespread scepticism about the legitimacy of their victory four years earlier, and triumphing away from home soil was set to be much more difficult.

Still, the Italians hadn't lost since November 1935, a run which also included winning the Olympic title in 1936. They were the side to beat.

Vittorio Pozzo was still around from four years beforehand, and hyped up his team ahead of this tournament by declaring they were better than the 1934 version.

Pozzo was still regarded as a fine tactician and also an excellent motivator; ahead of the semi-final against Brazil, he learned the South Americans had booked up the only plane from Marseille to Paris for the final, so visited their training base, started an argument about it, and returned to his squad urging them defeat a group of players who were lounging around in the belief they'd be in that final.

There were still reports that Mussolini was interfering in Pozzo's business. As well as ordering the side to perform a fascist salute before matches, he also insisted that Italy played in black shirts (for the only time in their history) when the hosts wore blue for their quarter-final meeting.

Most strangely, Mussolini initially insisted that Pozzo played the immobile veteran Eraldo Monzeglio rather than highly rated Udinese defender Alfredo Foni. This was not a tactical decision: it was simply because Monzeglio had a close relationship with Mussolini, acting as a personal football and tennis coach for the dictator's children.

Following an intervention by the head of the Italian FA after Monzeglio's performance against Norway in the opener, Pozzo was allowed to pick the side he wanted for the rest of the tournament, and went for Foni.

It's difficult to find much evidence that Italy's formation had changed to any great degree since their victory four years beforehand. But this was a more technical side, based around slick passing and clever interplay in the final third.

The side was also more Italian, although in Michele Andreolo, who had starred in Uruguay's 1935 Copa America victory, they did have another South American in the crucial centre-half role played by Argentine-born Luis Monti four years beforehand.

Still, this time the wingers were Italian-born. Right-sided Amedeo Biavati was a constant source of crosses from that flank, while Gino Colaussi played on the left, and provided more of a goalscoring threat. He scored one apiece in the quarter-final and semi, then two in the final, so his late decision to postpone his wedding in order to participate was very much justified.



The star man from four years beforehand, Giuseppe Meazza, was still dictating play in midfield (one of only four survivors from 1934, along with backup goalkeeper Guido Masetti, the aforementioned Monzeglio and attacking midfielder Giovanni Ferrari). But he was now playing second fiddle.

Silvio Piola had made his debut a year after Italy's 1934 success, and won the Capocannoniere as Serie A's top goalscorer when his Lazio side claimed the league title in 1936-37.

Piola was a proper all-round centre-forward, famed for his goalscoring exploits but also considered to be technical enough, and selfless enough, to have played in midfield, and was excellent at encouraging his fellow attackers to break beyond him, varying his position and playing clever forward passes.

He scored five goals in this tournament, almost all of them crucial, including the extra-time winner in the opener against Norway with a close-range finish from a rebound, and the second and third in the 3-1 quarter-final defeat of France after the hosts had brought it back to 1-1, both of them classic striker's goals from Biavati's right-wing crosses.

Then, in the final against Hungary, he was both orchestrator and finisher of the passing move which put Italy 2-1 up, before scoring the clincher to make it 4-2, with Biavati again supplying the assist from the right. He also received criticism for making the most of a challenge from Brazil centre-back Domingos da Guia in the semi-final, winning a penalty, in a time before the concept of ‘simulation' was commonplace.

Piola remains the all-time leading goalscorer in Serie A with 274 goals, 24 clear of Francesco Totti. That status is particularly impressive considering he lost three seasons because of the war, and spent another in Serie B midway through his career.

His glory days were spent with Lazio, Torino and Juventus, bookended by spells with Pro Vercelli and Novara, who are both playing in third-tier Serie C this season.

Those last two clubs, located 15 miles apart in the corridor between Turin and Milan, slightly confusingly both play at grounds named Stadio Silvio Piola. That's a measure of his influence.

Italy defeated Hungary 4-2 in a contest which was perhaps not as thrilling as the scoreline would suggest — some reports note the lack of rhythm in the game, partly due to Italy's willingness to sit deep and play primarily on the counter-attack, which wasn't a typical approach in the 1930s. But there's no doubting the effectiveness of that approach in this final.

This is the first World Cup final where decent, decipherable television footage of the key moments is available, and it's clear Piola was the star.

He scored two goals, but he also created the opener for left winger Colaussi with a deep cross from the right, prompting a fine volleyed finish. Hungary equalised shortly afterwards, a roughly similar goal from winger Pal Titkos. But Piola put Italy 2-1 ahead — more on that shortly — and then Colaussi scored his second, this time by running in behind to finish smartly, making it 3-1.

After the break, Gyorgy Sarosi turned home a right-wing cross to halve the deficit, but then Italy replicated that move, with Biavati teeing up Piola for the third time in the tournament — 4-2, and Italy had retained the World Cup.

You can take either of Piola's two goals in the final.

His second, late on, clinched the victory. But his earlier goal put Italy into a 2-1 lead, and was a marvellous example of their interplay which impressed throughout the tournament. Piola slipped in Giovanni Ferrari, the inside-right who found himself in the left channel, seemingly through on goal. But Ferrari surprisingly opted to switch play over to Meazza on the right. That was probably a terrible decision, in fairness, but Meazza responded by faking a shot to fool a defender, then teed up Piola to score.

In the context of 1930s football, it's a genuine beautiful piece of combination play.

Italy were fortunate that they avoided facing either of Brazil's best two strikers in the semi-final. The reason is somewhat complex.

Brazil's first-choice centre-forward was the legendary Leonidas, who finished as the tournament's top goalscorer with seven goals. But their quarter-final with Czechoslovakia had gone to a replay, which was played just two days before their semi against Italy.

Advertisement

Leonidas had been the only player to feature in both matches against the Czechs, even though he'd been nursing an injury from the opening game with Poland. He was therefore omitted from the side to face Italy, which prompted a huge backlash back home, amid reports that Adhemar Pimenta was simply resting him for the final.

That final never arrived for Brazil, of course — but Leonidas played and scored in the third-place play-off, helping to legitimise the rumour he was being saved for a subsequent game.

That should have meant Brazil using Leonizio Fantoni, the forward who was known in Italy as Fantoni III, because he had joined Lazio in 1934 to play alongside his brother and cousin.

Fantoni III had taken dual citizenship in Italy and, as referenced by Pozzo when he called up foreign-born players (“if they can fight for Italy, they can play for Italy”) this meant the possibility of conscription. Indeed, while his team-mate and cousin, Fantoni II, had also been called up by Pozzo for Italy's football team, Fantoni III was summoned to serve in the army.

Fantoni III had recently married a Hungarian woman he'd met in Rome, and was also mourning the loss of Fantoni II, who had tragically died from an injury suffered in a Serie A game. He didn't fancy going to war. Therefore, Lazio paid for him to board a ship back to Brazil. They didn't agree to his transfer, but Fantoni III decided he wasn't ever going to return, so started playing club football back in Brazil.

International clearance was ignored — what would Lazio, all the way across the Atlantic, do about it?

Well, nothing. But the problem, of course, came in 1938. Italy knew all about Fantoni III. They knew he'd deserted the country when called up to fight. And they knew he'd broken FIFA laws when playing in Brazil without permission from the Italian club he was contracted to.

And so, with no formal complaint from Italy — but it seems, a whisper and a wink — Brazil felt unable to play Fantoni III.

They instead played creative inside-forward Jose Peracio as their No 9, and offered little goal threat as Italy ran out 2-1 winners, an apparently more comfortable victory than the scoreline suggests.

This time around, it's difficult to have serious doubts about Italy's triumph, notwithstanding the debates about whether the world's best teams were all present at these early World Cups.

Italy certainly rode their luck in the opening round against Norway, when the opposition hit the woodwork three times, but they convincingly defeated hosts France and a good Brazil side en route to the final, then beat Hungary comfortably, and in some style.

In retaining the trophy, Italy had become accustomed to World Cup success. But, strangely, they wouldn't appear in another World Cup knockout game for 32 years, until their run to the final in 1970.

The Stamford Bridge outfit completed a brilliant late comeback in the west London derby to keep their top-five hopes alive

Chelsea kept their hopes of securing a return to the Champions League alive as Pedro Neto's stoppage-time strike completed a come-from-behind, 2-1 win for the Blues over local rivals Fulham on Sunday.

Fulham, who were dominant throughout but simply lacked a cutting edge, had the ball in the net within five minutes against a disjointed Chelsea side, as Andreas Pereira turned the ball home, but Ryan Sessegnon was offside in the build-up. In the 20th minute, however, the Cottagers did score, with Alex Iwobi slamming a superb low finish into the bottom corner.

Ten minutes after the resumption of the second half, Neto had a huge chance to equalise, but his effort from 10 yards out was well-saved by Fulham goalkeeper Bernd Leno.

The hosts enjoyed a degree of comfort throughout the second half until Enzo Maresca chose to substitute striker Nicolas Jackson and replace him with 19-year-old Tyrique George, who pulled the Blues level with a fine strike from the edge of the box in the 83rd minute. And Neto then scored a superb winner in injury time, spinning and powering a brilliant half-volley into the roof of the net, earning Chelsea three points in what can be fairly termed as a smash-and-grab victory.

Ben Shelton is not impressing everyone on the ATP Tour with his recent on-court antics.

Shelton has made history at the BMW Open this week, after beating Francisco Cerundolo to reach the final in Munich.

It has been an impressive response from Shelton, who lost early in Monte Carlo last week after being beaten by Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in his only singles match at the tournament.

Despite losing in singles, Shelton remained in the doubles draw, where he was involved in a moment of controversy for what he did in one of his matches.

In the second round of the Monte Carlo Masters doubles tournament, Shelton and veteran partner Rohan Bopanna beat third seeds Andrea Vavassori and Simone Bolelli in somewhat of an upset.

However, the biggest talking point from the match actually came when Shelton hit a ball at Vavassori, who was standing at the net, in just the second game of the match.

While Shelton put his hand up at the time, the incident was brought back up again after the match when Vavassori approached him.

Shelton did not take kindly to this and told Vavassori, ‘It's tennis, bro, not baseball', before calling the Italian ‘so soft'.

Getting hit by the ball is an occupational hazard for top tennis doubles players.Last week in Monaco, one of Ben Shelton's opponents thought he crossed a line.Shelton responded by calling him “soft.”📝 @jameskhansen and @CDEccleshare🔗 https://t.co/Uj8E2qsShO pic.twitter.com/gREyZSkf5c

A week on from this heated moment, Vavassori spoke to Tennis World Italia about the incident and criticized Shelton's behavior.

“I think it's over with Shelton, even for the future,” said Vavassori. “In general. I didn't like how he behaved. 

“Then it depends on him, if he comes and apologizes after making fun of me for causing me a rib fracture… I'm someone who always forgives, I can forget things even immediately. If he doesn't take a step, I certainly won't.”

Vavassori added, “I'm absolutely not a doubles player who says you shouldn't shoot at me, but I told him: ‘Be careful when you shoot so hard, so close. You can hurt. And you hurt me, something in my rib for sure.' 

“I was p***** off for getting injured and watching the video I was sorry that he taunted me. He basically hurt me and he also made fun of me.”

Not only did Vavassori lose the match against Shelton, but the shot hit at his ribs also forced him to withdraw from his subsequent tournament in Barcelona.

When explaining the severity of his injury, Vavassori revealed that he would have to spend 10 days away from the court.

“I had this fracture to my rib, of a millimeter,” explained Vavassori. “Nothing serious, but I have to stay ten days without playing. It's better not to do it above the pain because it would lengthen the recovery time. 

“Until the callus forms I have to give it time to cool down. It bothers me especially when serving. In the days before the blow I had taken a Brufen for a sore elbow, it helped me cover the pain. It was conditioning more than anything on a mental level, because I realized I had hurt myself.”

MUNICH (AP) — Top-seeded Alexander Zverev beat second-seeded Ben Shelton 6-2, 6-4 to win his third Munich title on Sunday.

It was the big-serving German player's first title of the year and 24th overall on the ATP tour. He previously won the clay-court tournament in 2017 and '18.

“It's extremely special, I always love winning tournaments in Germany,” said Zverev, who celebrated his 28th birthday. ”It's definitely a great birthday present, let's put it that way.""

Shelton was playing in his fourth career final and second on clay after winning in Houston last year.

In sunny conditions at the BMW Open, Zverev served for the match and set up match point with a sliced backhand at the net that Shelton could not get back in.

He clinched the win with a sharp backhand volley at the net following a brief rally. It was a dominant performance on serve from Zverev, who did not face a break point.

He has a shot at moving back into second place in the ATP rankings.

Four-time Grand Slam champion Carlos Alcaraz — who beat him in last year's French Open final — had to win the Barcelona Open final later Sunday against Holger Rune to stay at No. 2 behind Jannik Sinner.

Novak Djokovic has arrived in Spain ahead of his first appearance at the Madrid Open since 2022 and he has confirmed his intentions to challenge for the title by bringing Andy Murray with him in his coaching box.

Djokovic's partnership with his old rival Murray has been one of the most compelling tennis storylines of the year, with the three-time Grand Slam champion a surprise pick to work with the 24-time major winner at the Australian Open in January.

It was unclear whether their partnership would continue after that experience in Melbourne, where Djokovic reached the semi-finals before he was forced to pull out with an injury in his semi-final against Alexander Zverev, but they worked together again at the Indian Wells and Miami Masters tournaments last month.

Djokovic then admitted he ‘didn't know where Murray was' as he played his first clay court tournament in Monte Carlo, with some question marks over whether the Serbian would play in the Spanish capital after he slipped to a defeat against Alejandro Tabilo in his opening match.

Djokovic described that loss and his performance as ‘horrible', with some observers suggesting he may skip the Madrid Masters as he looks to build towards his primary target in the clay court season, which is the French Open at Roland Garros at the end of May.

“I was hoping it was not going to happen, but it was quite a high probability I'm going to play this way,” said Djokovic after his loss in Monte Carlo.

“I don't know. Just horrible. Horrible feeling to play this way, and just sorry for all the people that have to witness this.

“I expected myself at least to have put a decent performance. Not like this. It was horrible. I did not have high expectations, really.

“I knew I'm gonna have a tough opponent and I knew I'm gonna probably play pretty bad. But this bad, I didn't expect.”

Djokovic's downbeat press conference has not encouraged him to skip the Madrid Open, with his eagerness to play more tournaments in 2025 emphasised by his decision to bring Murray with him to Madrid.

Djokovic and Murray practised at the Madrid venue on Saturday night, with the three-time Madrid Open champion looking in focused mood as he prepares for a draw where he will be the No 4 seed.

The case to win a 100th career title is clearly driving on Djokovic, with his near miss as he made it through to the Miami Open final last month before losing against Jakub Mensic.

“Ever since I won my 99th, which was the Olympic Games in Paris, I've been playing with the prospect of winning the special hundred titles,” said Djokovic in Miami.

“I played finals of Shanghai. I was close there. Semi-finals of Australia. Then been trying to find that necessary and much-needed level of tennis that will put me in a position to fight for a trophy, a big trophy.

“Clearly it is something I want to do, but I know it won't be easy.”

Alexander Zverev celebrated his 28th birthday in style on Sunday at the BMW Open by Bitpanda, where he soared to a record-equalling third Munich title.

The home favourite produced an assured performance to defeat second seed Ben Shelton 6-2, 6-4 and claim his 24th tour-level trophy. Zverev was imperious on serve throughout the championship match, in which he did not face a break point, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

“It's extremely special, I always love winning tournaments in Germany,” said Zverev, who earned his first title of the season. “It's probably the most special thing I can do. It's definitely a great birthday present, let's put it that way.”

Having also won back-to-back titles in Munich in 2017-18, Zverev equalled countryman Philipp Kohlschreiber's tournament-record tally of three titles. The 28-year-old also ensured that the tournament's first edition as an ATP 500 event concluded with a German champion, marking Zverev's sixth crown on home soil.

Since reaching his third major final at the Australian Open in January, Zverev went 6-6 on the ATP Tour entering Munich, including opening-round defeats in Indian Wells and Monte-Carlo, where he was the top seed. Yet the German has turned his form around with a confident week in Munich.



Shelton appeared nervy on serve in the opening set, highlighted by two untimely double faults, which came facing break point in the first and seventh games. In contrast, Zverev exuded confidence behind his first delivery, from which he dropped just three of 19 points, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

Supported by a boisterous capacity crowd in Munich, which included Bayern Munich football star Thomas Muller, Zverev continued to command the baseline with ease in the second set. He opened with another break and did not look back en route to winning his ninth ATP Tour title on clay.

“I definitely knew I had to play my best tennis today, Ben has been playing extremely well this week,” added Zverev. “The conditions suit him extremely well, it's very hot and very fast. They suit me as well, to be fair. I enjoyed my birthday so far.”







By improving to 2-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Shelton, Zverev secured his sixth ATP 500 title. The No. 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings also has the opportunity to reclaim the World No. 2 spot from Carlos Alcaraz if the Spaniard falls to Holger Rune in the Barcelona final.

“I feel really blessed to play in front of you all on Easter Sunday, it's really special for me,” said Shelton during the trophy presentation. “Happy Birthday Sascha, I didn't know that [it was your birthday]. If I did, I would have said it was a birthday gift… I was trying as hard as I could to return your serves today, but I couldn't make it work.”

Serena Williams didn't get her fairy-tale ending at Wimbledon. 

The 23-time Grand Slam champion lost in the first round at SW19 in 2022 to a player ranked outside the top 100 in what would be her last match at Wimbledon. 

Williams is considerd by many to be the most succesful female tennis player of all-time.

She enjoyed a highly successful career with 39 major titles across singles, doubles, and mixed doubles.

Along with four Olympic gold medals, the now-retired 43-year-old is widely regarded as the best women's tennis player of all time.

Williams' grip on tennis during her plays days also extended to Wimbledon, the grass-court Grand Slam where she won seven singles titles. 

However, in 2022, during her final year on tour before retirement, Williams was humbly eliminated in the first round to Harmony Tan, a little-known Frenchwoman.

Tan is a Paris native with Cambodian and Vietnamese parents. Her win was a full-circle moment as she said she often watched Williams growing up.

The 27-year-old turned professional when she was just 14 and this was her first match against Williams.

It was the first-time she'd ever played someone as accomplished as the 73-time WTA title winner, and she did the unthinkable.

“I'm really surprised today,” Tan said of her win in the on-court interview at the time.

Williams, who was ranked 1,204th in the world at the time of her loss, ended her career later that year.

It was expected Tan, who was 24 a the time, would kick on after that career-win and enjoy a steady rise in tennis.

That was not the case, however, despite breaking into the top 100 with her win against Williams.

In fact, Tan would never get a victory at another Grand Slam again.

The 27-year-old's career now sees her play in more ITF competitions than Grand Slams.

Being ranked world No. 257, she does not have enough ranking points to play at most WTA events.

While Tan has won three ITF titles, the Frenchwoman has not won a single tour-level title  in her career and has failed to qualify for a Grand Slam in three years.

Her last major match was a 2022 first-round loss to Bianca Andreescu at the US Open.

Tan's career prize money has also taken a significant dip. In 2022 at the time of her Wimbledon win over Williams, she earned $624,000.

While in 2023, Tan earned just $91,406 and in 2024 this was $132,985.

So far in 2025, the former world No.90 has won $5,679.

Tan's career demonstrates the brutal reality of tennis, from riding the highs of Grand Slam wins to playing ITF tournaments in front of half a dozen people.

Tennis has no protections for the revenue of players and while rankings can be protected for injuries, once a player's career starts to tail off, their income suffers a similar fate.

Danielle Collins has opened up about her romantic encounter with her partner in a London coffee shop following an early exit from Wimbledon. The world No. 32 enjoyed her best run at SW19 last year, reaching the second week. But one of her past disappointing losses had a silver lining when her love life took a positive turn, and she's still going strong with her beau.

The American recently reached the quarter-final in Charleston, where she was the defending champion after lifting the trophy in 2024. During her title run last year, her boyfriend Bryan Kipp was spotted cheering her on from the stands and came to the court for her victory photoshoot.

In a candid chat with the Tennis Channel, Collins shared that her partner Bryan had made the journey to North Carolina to support her and recounted their serendipitous meeting.

""He's had a really busy work week,"" she said. ""We have been going out for a while now. We met at a coffee shop in London so that was pretty exciting. I didn't think I would meet someone at a coffee shop.

""Who would have thought? Just after the tournament, Wimbledon. He didn't know anything about tennis, and he didn't know I was a tennis player, which was really nice.

""He was actually a bigger fan of golf and so he said, 'Well I really like golf. I don't really know much about tennis'. And I was like, 'Yes! That's so exciting'.



""It's fun to kind of be around someone that has interests in other things and that's not as familiar with the sport because you get to learn and grow with them and help them.""

Collins planned to retire at the end of the 2024 season and went on an incredible farewell run, winning the WTA 1000 in Miami before her Charleston title sweep.

The world No. 32 had been looking forward to spending time with her loved ones in retirement. But she made a U-turn on her decision late last year.

""We haven't had a lot of time on the court for me to like teach him because we just don't find enough time cause we're doing golf and he's also at my matches a lot and he's working,"" Collins continued.

""But in the future, I'm hoping we'll play like the husband-wife doubles like the USTA, you play for the 'Gold Ball'.

""I explained to him that this is a big deal in the tennis world so hopefully that doesn't tear us apart. He is very competitive. He was a football player at Columbia. Very smart. Engineer major. So, I'm more kind of like the jock in the relationship, and he's definitely more of the cerebral one.""

Alexander Zverev celebrated his 28th birthday in style on Sunday at the BMW Open by Bitpanda, where he soared to a record-equalling third Munich title.

The home favourite produced an assured performance to defeat second seed Ben Shelton 6-2, 6-4 and claim his 24th tour-level trophy. Zverev was imperious on serve throughout the championship match, in which he did not face a break point, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

“It's extremely special, I always love winning tournaments in Germany,” said Zverev, who earned his first title of the season. “It's probably the most special thing I can do. It's definitely a great birthday present, let's put it that way.”

Having also won back-to-back titles in Munich in 2017-18, Zverev equalled countryman Philipp Kohlschreiber's tournament-record tally of three titles. The 28-year-old also ensured that the tournament's first edition as an ATP 500 event concluded with a German champion, marking Zverev's sixth crown on home soil.

Since reaching his third major final at the Australian Open in January, Zverev went 6-6 on the ATP Tour entering Munich, including opening-round defeats in Indian Wells and Monte-Carlo, where he was the top seed. Yet the German has turned his form around with a confident week in Munich.



Shelton appeared nervy on serve in the opening set, highlighted by two untimely double faults, which came facing break point in the first and seventh games. In contrast, Zverev exuded confidence behind his first delivery, from which he dropped just three of 19 points, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

Supported by a boisterous capacity crowd in Munich, which included Bayern Munich football star Thomas Muller, Zverev continued to command the baseline with ease in the second set. He opened with another break and did not look back en route to winning his ninth ATP Tour title on clay.

“I definitely knew I had to play my best tennis today, Ben has been playing extremely well this week,” added Zverev. “The conditions suit him extremely well, it's very hot and very fast. They suit me as well, to be fair. I enjoyed my birthday so far.”







By improving to 2-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Shelton, Zverev secured his sixth ATP 500 title. The No. 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings also has the opportunity to reclaim the World No. 2 spot from Carlos Alcaraz if the Spaniard falls to Holger Rune in the Barcelona final.

With his run to a fourth ATP Tour final, Shelton is up to No. 13 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, just one shy of his career high. The 22-year-old became the first American to reach a clay final above ATP 250 level since Andre Agassi won the 2002 Masters 1000 in Rome, but was unable to contain Zverev, who was relentless throughout Sunday's 71-minute clash.
“I feel really blessed to play in front of you all on Easter Sunday, it's really special for me,” said Shelton during the trophy presentation. “Happy Birthday Sascha, I didn't know that [it was your birthday]. If I did, I would have said it was a birthday gift… I was trying as hard as I could to return your serves today, but I couldn't make it work.”

Both competitors came into their latest meeting after surviving close calls earlier this week in Munich. Shelton saved three match points in his event debut against Borna Gojo, while Zverev broke back when Tallon Griekspoor served for their quarterfinal.

Zverev's comfort on the surface ultimately shone through as he dismissed Shelton, 6-2, 6-4. The Hamburg native who has now won 29 of his past 30 matches against left-handers, celebrated his 24th career tour-level title. A quarter of those have occurred in Germany.“It's probably the most special thing I can do. It's definitely a great birthday present, let's put it that way,” Zverev said afterwards.A double fault from Shelton in the deuce court handed the top seed a break to start the final. Zverev would run with the immediate advantage, producing a consistent rhythm on his serve and from the baseline to keep the pressure across the net.

Another long double fault at 15-40 from Shelton put the first set on Zverev's racquet. After closing it out, last year's Roland Garros runner-up once again opened set two with a break when the second seed caught his forehand late.Shelton hung around for the duration of the encounter, though could never challenge his opponent's service games to give himself any hope of getting back in the contest. Reaching championship point, Zverev came forward and shut the door with a backhand volley winner. He did not face a break point throughout the afternoon, one that saw legendary football star Thomas Muller witness Zverev's triumphant day.

The third volume of the animated anthology series features nine episodes and will debut on Disney+ on Oct. 29. 



		By Patrick Brzeski, Abid Rahman, Borys Kit 

	April 19, 2025 7:01pm	




	He was just supposed to be passing by, but Ronin, the former Sith Lord character who appeared in the first season of the animated anthology Star Wars: Visions, will be returning in the third season of the Lucasfilm series which debuts on Disney+ on Oct. 29 this year. 


	The big reveal came at the Star Wars Celebration event in Tokyo, in a panel dedicated to the hit show, where Visions executive producer James Waugh confirmed that three of the most popular storylines from the first season of the show — “The Duel,” “The Village Bride” and “The Ninth Jedi” — will be continuing in the upcoming third volume of episodes.

	Waugh also revealed a “bold new direction” for Visions with the introduction of the Star Wars: Visions Presents banner, which he said would be giving filmmakers a chance to tell deeper and more longform stories without the constraints of the shorter runtime of the typical Visions episodes. First up will be a spinoff standalone series of “The Ninth Jedi” which will come out sometime in 2026. 




			Popular on THR		







	“The Duel: Payback” will be directed by Takanobu Mizuno from anime studio Kamikaze Douga. “The Lost Ones,” a followup to the “The Village Bride,” will be helmed by Hitoshi Haga of Kinema Citrus. And Naoyoshi Shiotani of Production IG will direct “The Ninth Jedi” followup “Child of Hope.” The trio of filmmakers talked about their episodes and showed designs for new characters, much to the delight of the crowd (a four-legged AT-AT, with a Japanese building on top, elicited oohs and aahs).


	The Ronin character from “The Duel” has proven to be quite popular with Star Wars fans around the world, inspiring statues, and even a Hasbro Black Series figure.


	Also at the panel, Masaki Tachibana of anime studio Kinema Citrus previewed an especially kawaii addition to the Star Wars universe for his installment, “Yuko's Treasure.” The episode's young female protagonist will be accompanied by a large, bear-like droid with a microwave built into his belly. The reveal of the character in a short clip played in the convention hall drew delighted applause.


	Hiroyasu Kobayashi of Project Studio Q discussed the darker and more mechanical world of his installment “The Song of Four Wings,” which took the four blades of an X-Wing as its central motif.“We're a studio that specializes in the creation of mechanisms, so we really focussed on the essence of the old Joe Johnston designs and featured a lot of droids and mechs,” he explained while showing a still that featured an anime riff on an AT-AT walker.

	











	“In general, Visions is a concept that really came from a passion for the animated medium,” said Waugh about the original inspirations behind the anthology and its focus on Japanese anime for its first and third volumes. “I think we've always deeply admired the craftsmen that bring such great storytelling through animation. And so, as we were talking about how we could celebrate that, we ended up coming up with a concept really focused on anime and really focused on celebrating Star Wars through the anime perspective through the idea of really giving Japanese culture a spotlight within Star Wars and its influence on Star Wars in general.”


	When it debuted in 2021, Visions was a bold creative choice by Lucasfilm as it was a collection of non-canon animated shorts created by different Japanese animation studios and featuring different animation styles. The lack of restrictions led to wildly imaginative interpretations of the Star Wars mythos that proved incredibly popular with fans and critics alike. 


	The first volume of Visions debuted on Disney+ in September 2021. The season included 9 episodes with work from Japanese animation studios Kamikaze Douga, Studio Colorido, Geno Studio, Trigger, Kinema Citrus, Production I.G. and Science Saru. Volume one was met with near universal acclaim from critics, and it enjoys a 98 percent critics score on Rotten Tomatoes and 81 percent on Metacritic.


	Volume two of Visions was released on Disney+ in May 2023, with episodes featuring work from a more international group of international studios, including Aardman (U.K.), El Guiri (Spain), Cartoon Saloon (Ireland), Punkrobot (Chile), Studio Mir (South Korea), Studio La Cachette (France), 88 Pictures (India), D'art Shtajio (Japan) along with Lucasfilm (U.S.), and Triggerfish (South Africa/Ireland). Volume two was likewise a huge hit with critics, with it scoring a perfect 100 percent on Rotten Tomatoes and 88 percent on Metacritic.

""Sometimes I feel like nature has its own way of communicating with you, especially in extremely severe situations,"" she said of the moment the melody came to her.


													By
												

	Ashley Iasimone



Lana Del Rey‘s newest release, the lullaby-like “Bluebird” just released on Friday (April 18), is a song that's been years in the making. The ballad first came to her while she held a little bird in her hands, shaken up after the small creature had crashed into her window.


	The singer shared the story behind the delicate “Bluebird” in an impromptu video filmed on her way to rehearsal on Friday.


	“I started humming this chorus to myself, with the words and the melody, a long time ago when I had been seeing someone for a very long time — and we hadn't seen each other for a while, and he called,” Lana said in the clip uploaded on Instagram. “And he asked me if I wanted to go for a walk. I was kind of excited, but I didn't think it was a very good idea.”

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Still, she said yes and began to get ready to meet him. She was startled by what happened next.


	“All of a sudden a bird smacked in the double-pane window doors of my bedroom,” Lana recalled. 


	“I was shocked, and I opened the little door and I saw this little, I think it was a little sparrow, little swallow, right there, and I just was so emotional — because you know when you just know that something is meant for you?” she said. “Like sometimes I feel like nature has its own way of communicating with you, especially in extremely severe situations — not in a sacrificial way, just in a way just for you to know.”


	Lana continued, “I just wanted to hold it. I was so hoping that it would be OK. I remember before I could even think, I just sat, knelt there, and I just sang, ‘Little bird, little bird, fly away for both of us.' I was just kind of tearing up for myself and for the bird.”


	As the story goes, the little bird did “eventually kind of stumble away,” and did fly away, according to Lana, who didn't follow suit; she went on that walk anyway.


	“That is not the first time that I have had something happen where a bird has been a little bit of a message for me,” she shared.


	On the introspective “Bluebird,” she sings: “For your thoughts are small, they can't keep you from leavin'/ As the wake of my past crashes in/ I hear the door slam, but the window's wide open/ We both shouldn't be dealing with him/ Find a way to fly/ Find a way to fly/ Just shoot for the sun 'til I can finally run/ Find a way to fly.”

	











	“Bluebird” is the second song to be released ahead of her upcoming 10th studio album, the first being “Henry, Come On.” The record, once said to have country roots and called Lasso, and then known as The Right One Will Stay, is presently untitled and without a firm release date. Though it was expected just weeks from now, last week Lana casually broke the news to fans that May is no longer looking likely for the follow-up to 2023's Did You Know That There's a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd: “You know it's not going to come on time, right?”


	She'll be performing at this year's Stagecoach, the annual country music festival held in Indio, California, the weekend after Coachella. She's billed as having “a very special country set” by the fest.

The TDE tandem brought the house down on the trek's opening night.


													By
												

	Joe Lynch


Executive Digital Director


Kendrick Lamar & SZA – who are currently sitting atop the Billboard Hot 100 for the eighth week with their “Luther” collab from the former's GNX album – kicked off the most anticipated tour of 2025 in Minneapolis on Saturday (April 19) night at the U.S. Bank Stadium.


	The Grand National Tour's start saw the TDE tandem deliver a generous, well-paced setlist for what is the co-headliners' first all-arena trek. Instead of one full-length set followed by another, they alternated stage time every 5-7 songs, which kept the energy and the curiosity factor high for fans, who seemed to be fairly evenly split over which artist they were more excited to see (at least based upon cheers, cell phone videos and bathroom breaks).


	It was a smart move. In terms of performance style, color palette and stage design, Lamar and SZA occupy very different worlds: his rapping is intense and unrelenting, her singing is expressive and relaxed; his visuals are muted and grey-toned, hers warm and green; his staging was stark and lonely, hers was imaginative and inviting. If Kendrick's stage show is a masterclass of a laser-focused vision, SZA's is a revelation of creative energy. But instead of seeming jarring, those contrasts feed off each other beautifully, adding up to a whole that is so much more than the sum of its parts – and since those individual parts are already very good on their own merits, that's saying something.


	Just two months prior to the tour's opening night, Lamar headlined the Apple Music Super Bowl Halftime Show during Super Bowl LIX, which drew 133.5 million viewers – a new record. His critically acclaimed, much-memed set saw him bring out SZA for support, emphasizing the longstanding respect and artistic chemistry between the TDE labelmates. Both together and separately, Lamar and SZA have notched a lot of wins: In addition to winning a frickin' Pulitzer, Lamar is a six-time Billboard Hot 100 topper with 22 Grammy wins, while SZA is a three-time Billboard Hot 100 topper with five Grammy wins. Simply put, these are two of the hottest artists on the planet today, so expectations were as high as the U.S. Bank Stadium's angled ceiling for this show.


	Here are some of the best moments from the Grand National Tour's kickoff in Minneapolis. And when you're done with that, here's the complete set-list.


	When the lights went down and the show began, a Buick Grand National Experimental (aka Buick GNX) rose up from the bottom of the stage. Lamar, barely visible behind the tinted windows, rapped GNX's opening track “Wacced Out Murals” while sitting at the wheel. (As a tie-in to the lyrics, Anita Baker was playing over the venue's speakers prior to the show's start). Exiting the car, Lamar revved up the crowd with a heated “Squabble Up” – and when he pulled up to the “I feel good, get the f–k out my face” lyric, the crowd readily shifted into high gear.


	During “Euphoria,” Lamar ran down his laundry list of Drake grievances while running around a circular catwalk that extended into the floor seats. There was a passion and fervor in his flow, yet in terms of body language, it never seemed like he was trying to jolt the crowd into a foaming frenzy of righteous anger. Talking about hating a person without being defined (or poisoned) by that hatred is a difficult proposition, and Lamar's handling of “Euphoria” during the show made it seem that he's mindful of that balancing act.


	While Lamar started the night behind the wheel of a GNX on an otherwise empty stage, SZA began her set with the same GNX car draped in vines, leaves and general greenery, surrounded by dancers whose individualistic outfits and balletic moves stood in contrast to Lamar's dancers (who tended to dress uniformly and move in militaristic, lockstep choreography). With her earthy, forest tones standing in rich contrast to his sharp, urban visuals, SZA seemed to immediately brighten up the stage – and Kendrick – when she joined him for a rousing “30 for 30.”


	When good kid, m.A.A.d city broke, Lamar was already a commanding, dynamic stage performer – but damn, his stage visuals have come a long way since then. “Reincarnated” was a particular standout, with Lamar rapping under a dismal streetlamp while his dancers – arranged diagonally on a staircase – popped up and down with the song's cascading piano. The entire thing was cast in a grey pallor, as if you were watching a hazy film noir in real time. Despite the arena being massive, moments like that one made the show feel intimate and even painfully revealing. (There was also a clever bit later on where you could see his dancers in color on the screens, but the picture-in-picture closeup shot of Lamar appeared in black and white.)


	SZA's second set was a delicious forest fantasia that found the R&B superstar interacting with a variety of insect dancers. “F2F” gave her the chance to live out her rock star fantasy; “Garden (Say It Like Dat)” found her wailing a massive money note on her back while two praying mantises (aka people on stilts) prowled around her; and “Kitchen” saw her riding the back of a giant ant as if it were a mechanical bull. Maybe her next film project will be Honey, I Shrunk the SZA.


	“Doves In the Wind” was a bit of a surprise for Lamar and SZA to do together on tour, but we all knew “All the Stars” was gonna be part of the setlist. Even so, when it arrived, it felt like a major moment thanks to some simple but smart staging. With the co-headliners on opposite ends of the circular runway, it felt like they were star-crossed lovers singing to each other. That drama was heightened (literally) when the platforms under them began rising into the air, bringing them closer to the stars, but not each other.


	When SZA delivered “Kill Bill,” the praying mantis imagery that recurred throughout her set paid off. Even if you're not an entomologist, you may know that after praying mantises mate, the female sometimes (though not always) eats the male. Sure enough, as SZA sweetly sang her Hot 100 song about murdering her ex, footage of a female mantis chomping off a male's head played on the screen behind her.


	SZA's insectoid theme reached chrysalis during “Saturn,” an inventively executed segment that found her rising into the air on a pair of butterfly wings as an impossibly long dress – resembling the sticky goop a pupa resides in while it transforms – unfolded beneath her. For as high as SZA got above the stage, her strong, confident vocals remained grounded and organic.


	Given that this tour that includes not just one but three Drake diss tracks, it's pretty wild that the setlist also includes two Drake collaborations (even if the Drizzy verses have been excised). Not only did Lamar rap “Poetic Justice,” a pre-feud track he recorded featuring Drake, but SZA gave fans a twerk-filled take on “Rich Baby Daddy,” which is, in terms of credits, a Drake track first and foremost. Trolling? Tribute? Olive branch? Olive the above? Whatever the message, “Rich Baby Daddy” sounded fantastic, and it had phones and eyebrows raised in equal measure.


	By the time SZA got to “BMF,” it was clear that she was killing it, and there was a loose, frolicsome quality to the way she and her dancers moved around the stage. Next up, SZA sang part of “Kiss Me More,” her collab with Doja Cat, which included a brief but noticeable nod to Prince: before the song wrapped, the distinctive guitar riff from “Kiss” rang out over the speakers, accompanied by a flash of purple light.


	Whoever had the idea to split “TV Off” into two parts deserves a raise. The GNX standout appeared early in the night, but in a shortened version that cut off before the now-beloved “Mustaaaaard” scream. People seemed a touch disappointed to miss out on the viral musical moment in real life, so when K.Dot revisited “TV Off” toward the end of the show – and brought Mustard out on stage for his long, loud shout-out – people absolutely lost their minds.


	For a song that starts out, “psst, I see dead people,” “Not Like Us” sure has a way of making thousands of people simultaneously come to life. Though Lamar's color palette for the majority of the night was grey and muted, he brought the Mustard-produced smash to the stage in living color, pairing it with a vivid, eye-popping collage of Black art throughout the ages, from Africa to America, from pharaohs to Funkadelic. Yes, the song is a diss track, but with these visuals, it feels arguably more like a celebration of Black excellence than a takedown of a rival.


	After an intense night of nonstop performances, the one-two finale of “Luther” and “Gloria” felt like a warm, gracious victory lap for both artists, particularly when they both paused to take in the crowd for a moment. “This might be one of my favorite songs,” Lamar said prior to “Gloria,” to which SZA replied, “It makes me wanna cry a tiny bit.” As a bookend, Lamar and SZA got into the GNX after the last song (he held the door for her), descending under the stage as the lights went down.

	The year's most anticipated tour has arrived. On Saturday (April 19), Kendrick Lamar & SZA's co-headlining Grand National Tour opened in Minneapolis at the U.S. Bank Stadium.


	Not every artist has the benefit of kicking off a tour while occupying the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100, but the TDE tandem are not like most artists. Not only is their collab track “Luther” in its eighth week atop the chart (it's Lamar's sixth No. 1 on the Hot 100 and SZA's third), but it follows a long series of wins for both.


	Lamar's “Not Like Us” hit 2024 like a sledgehammer, an instantly viral diss track that rattled the streets and the charts in equal measure (and based on some recent legal efforts, it also seems to have left a certain Canadian MC a touch bothered as well). “Not Like Us” — one of the top hits on Billboard's 2024 Year-End Hot 100 chart — returned K.Dot to the pole position of the Hot 100 in May 2024 after going No. 1 alongside Future and Metro Boomin one month earlier. Before the year was out, Lamar went No. 1 again (as the sole credited artist) with “Squabble Up,” another song from his three-week Billboard 200 topper GNX, which netted the sixth-largest debut week for a 2024 album when it arrived in late 2024. In February 2025, Lamar's champion run continued when he headlined Apple Music's Super Bowl Halftime Show, bringing out SZA for two songs (“Luther” and “All the Stars”).


	SZA's most recent project, in its various iterations, has spent 12 weeks atop the Billboard 200, originally as SOS and then via the deluxe LANA edition of the LP; SOS gave us “Kill Bill,” an all-timer of a breakup song that gave SZA her first Hot 100 topper as the sole credited artist. She'd previously topped the chart alongside Drake with the “Slime You Out” collab; while that one didn't make the cut for the setlist, two other Drake collabs did end up on the opening night setlist: “Poetic Justice” (Kendrick Lamar ft. Drake) and “Rich Baby Daddy” (Drake ft. Sexyy Red & SZA). Wonders never cease.


	Coming hot off two hit albums stuffed with smash singles — not to mention their respective catalogs, which includes a Pulitzer-winning LP for Lamar — there was a lot of material for these two to choose from when hammering out the Grand National Tour's setlist. When the all-stadium trek (a first for both artists) debuted in Minneapolis, here's what they played. (Some songs appeared in abbreviated versions, though most were close to full-length.)


	And, when you're done scanning the set-list, here's a list of the 13 Best Moments from the show.

	XG is lighting up Coachella again this weekend, and we're taking you behind the scenes of how they prepped for the big night. From exclusive footage of them in rehearsals to an interview about what their favorite part of Coachella has been, keep watching for an exclusive sneak peek!


	What did you think of XG's performance? Let us know in the comments!


	XG:


	Hi, Billboard! 


Tetris Kelly:


Who is the most fashion-forward in the group? 


	Me! Hi Billboard! I think we're all just so excited to perform today. We've been waiting to perform on this amazing stage with beautiful, beautiful, amazing artists. So we're just so grateful for this opportunity and in hopes that- we hope to kill it! We're gonna kill it. Yeah for sure. I mean, it's Coachella. So there's stuff the seven of us thought up together, and of course there's a ton that we talked through and came up with alongside our director, Sienna. There's stuff she brought to the table, too. But I think, like by all of us creating one performance together, we're able to really feel it and give it our all today, so yeah, I'm really looking forward to it. The song is called “IN THE RAIN,” and it's this really emotional, R&B-heavy track that's super important to us. And because it's coming out right before Coachella, it feels like – how do I put it? – it's helping us build up the momentum toward Coachella. That kind of energy is in there too. So I'd be really happy if tons of people watched it. I actually feel like a lot of people are watching it already! 


What part of the show are you most excited for?


	I can't choose! Should we say it all together? It might be a little crazy.

Bridgerton actress Nicola Coughlan has made her feelings clear on trans rights, with a swipe on social media at Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling.


	Rowling has been highly visible on social media this week, celebrating the UK's Supreme Court ruling that a definition of a woman is a based on biological sex, not gender.


	Now, The Daily Mail newspaper reports that Coughlan – who previously expressed her displeasure with the ruling as “stomach-churning” – shared an article on Instagram with the headline ‘A New Low for JK Rowling.'

	And Coughlan wrote of HBO's new Harry Potter series: “Keep your new Harry Potter lads. Wouldn't touch it with a 10ft pole.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Of Wednesday's ruling, Coughlan previously wrote:


	“To see an already marginalised community being further attacked and attacked in law is really stomach churning and disgusting, and to see people celebrate it is more stomach-churning and disgusting,”


	The debate over trans rights in the UK has become polarising within the entertainment industry, especially between the stars of the Potter movie franchise, and its creator Rowling.


	Previously, Daniel Radcliffe who played the title wizard in the big screen blockbuster series, wrote on social media to share his support with trans people and activists:


	“Transgender women are women. Any statement to the contrary erases the identity and dignity of transgender people.”


	Emma Watson, who played Hermione in the film series, wrote: “Trans people are who they say they are and deserve to live their lives without being constantly questioned.”


	Rupert Grint, who played Ron, followed sharing similar sentiments.


	This prompted a bemused retort from Rowling, who responded to a post that asked: “What actor/actress instantly ruins a movie for you?”


	Rowling wrote: “Three guesses. Sorry, but that was irresistible,” adding three laughing emojis.

Olivia Williams opened up about her harrowing journey with pancreatic cancer, revealing she experienced years of misdiagnoses and dismissals by doctors. The professionally trained British actress is now supporting the upcoming TCS London Marathon‘s charity of the year, Pancreatic Cancer UK, calling for a cheap test that would lead to earlier detection of the disease.


	Speaking to The Times U.K. in a new interview, The Crown star discussed her experience with VIPoma (vasoactive intestinal peptide-secreting tumor), a rare neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas that is detected in 1 out of 1 million people yearly. Notoriously difficult to diagnose early, pancreatic cancer is among the deadliest of the common cancers.

	Williams said she first experienced symptoms a decade ago, eventually embarking on a four-year journey where she visited 10 doctors in three countries to get to the root of her illness. She recalled being misdiagnosed with lupus, perimenopause and other forms of cancer. It wasn't until a gastroenterologist in Los Angeles “who was like a dog with a bone” tested for a rare hormone, ordered a CT scan and biopsy that the cancerous tumor was uncovered.

	“If someone had f—ing well diagnosed me in the four years I'd been saying I was ill, when they told me I was menopausal or had irritable bowel syndrome or [was] crazy — I used that word advisedly because one doctor referred me for a psychiatric assessment — then one operation possibly could have cleared the whole thing and I could describe myself as cancer-free, which I cannot now ever be,” the Dune: Prophecy star said.


	Since then, she's had several procedures to remove the tumor, along with sections of her pancreas, spleen, gallbladder and liver. However, by that point, the tumor had metastasized.


	“The metastases have kept popping up,” she explained. “So we've been playing whack-a-mole every time they appear.”


	Williams, who is also known for her work in Wes Anderson's Rushmore and M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense, has been taking medication to limit the cancer cells' growth and undergoing routine scans. With targeted internal radiotherapy, Williams described treatment including instances where “people in hazmat suits come in with a lead box of a radioactive material, which they inject into me and I become radioactive,” which have forced her to isolate from all human contact for two weeks.

	











	“It's supposed to buy me maybe a year, maybe two or three years, of freedom from treatment. In the best-case scenario it would have made [the metastases] disappear but that didn't happen,” she said.


	While the actress said it is “too late” for her, she cautioned those over 40 to remain vigilant with their health, adding, “This is where I get emotional but I'm not looking for sympathy, I'm looking for a cheap, early test.”

Walter Goggins has experienced a whole new level of stardom since his appearance in the third season of The White Lotus. Now he's shared that he cried when he first learned he had the role.


	Goggins played broken Rick Hatchett in the show that saw him on a mission to avenge his father's death, accompanied by his much younger partner Chelsea, played by Aimee Lou Wood.


Goggins told the Daily Mail newspaper that he's an inveterate crier, but sobbed heavily even by his own standards when he phoned his wife Nadia Connors after he'd learned he'd been cast by White Lotus creator Mike White.

	The actor, with the rest of the cast, spent months holed up in The Four Seasons resort in Ko Samui, Thailand, while filming the dark satire. He told the Daily Mail:


	“I'm so relieved it's out in the world,' he says of that final episode. ‘It's been uplifting getting to finally talk to people about it. For the first time in a long time I can exhale. A big exhale. Rick Hatchett was a lot to carry.”


	Twice Emmy nominated, Goggins was previously best known for his role in US crime drama Justified and Amazon Prime's post-apocalyptic sci-fi Fallout. But his success in The White Lotus has taken him to a whole other level. His other HBO series The Righteous Gemstones benefited from his rising star by airing immediately afterwards, with a reported one million viewers every episode.

Meghan Markle has been embroiled in a plagiarism dispute after a British author described “striking similarities” between her own books and a proposal by Markle for a children's TV show.


	Markle was listed as one of the executive producers of Netflix's animated series Pearl, announced in July 2021 as part of the reported $100million development deal between the streamer and Markle and husband Prince Harry, following their move to the US in 2020.


	In the blurb for the project, Pearl was described as the story of a young girl who learns to step into her power and finds inspiration from influential women throughout history.”

	Elliott is the author of a series of Pearl Power books, which debuted in 2014. The third book in the series was published in 2016 and translated into several languages. Elliott told The Daily Mail:


	“Meghan is a feminist who sticks up for other women, so I was disappointed and confused to see how similar Netflix's proposed show Pearl was to my own Pearl Power, who had been created seven years earlier. 


	“Of course, I can't know if anyone on her team had seen it and been inspired by it, but the similarities were too great for me to ignore.”


	Elliott told the newspaper she sent two letters, but did not receive reply or acknowledgement. The Sun newspaper reported that it had reached out to both Netflix and Archewell Productions for comment.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


EASTER SUNDAY AM WRITETHRU after Saturday Night post…refresh for more: It's a win for original movies as Warner Bros‘ Sinners has taken the lead at the Easter weekend box office with $45.6M per Warners over the studio's A Minecraft Movie which is landing in second with $41.3M. Since 2000, this weekend reps the eighth time that Warner Bros has led the Easter weekend box office with an event title after 2010's Clash of the Titans, 2016's Batman v. Superman, 2018's Ready Player One, 2019's The Curse of La Llorona, 2021's Godzilla v. Kong, 2022's Fantastic Beasts 3, last year's Godzilla x Kong and now Sinners.  Let the record show that Warner Bros with both titles contributed 64% of the entire weekend's box office. 

	











	This comes after a better-than-expected Saturday of $16.5M for the Ryan Coogler directed, Michael B. Jordan starring vampire pic, down only -14% from Friday's $19.2M. Rivals were forecasting more of a horror drop on Saturday between -24% to -34%. A Minecraft Movie‘s Saturday was $15.8M, -1%.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“As we continue to strive to bring an array of films to moviegoers, we are thrilled to see how Ryan Coogler's original movie Sinners, and a movie based on the fan favorite Minecraft game, have resonated with audiences in such a stellar way. Movies have the power to transport us to worlds only seen on the big screen, and Warner Bros. Pictures remains committed to bringing singular in-theater experiences to audiences looking for bold movies, both original and those based on beloved existing properties,” exclaimed Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group's Mike De Luca & Pam Abdy this Easter morning. 


	While Sinners‘ Friday was just under Nope‘s $19.5M, its Saturday is ahead of the Jordan Peele title's which did $13.9M for a 3-day of $44.3M. The 7:45PM Imax 70MM show at the AMC Universal Citywalk was sold out tonight, and it's nearly sold out tomorrow night.


	We also forgot to mention that Sinners‘ is the only horror movie in over 35 years to get an A CinemaScore besting that of Get Out (A-) and A Quiet Place Part II (A-).


	Updated under the hood on Sinners: 


	PLFs and Imax delivered 45% of the weekend; Imax alone being 20%. It's the highest grossing and best-indexing ever horror film in Imax, and in the top 10 of all time for the large format exhibitor behind movies like Interstellar (26%), Oppenheimer (26%), Tron (24%), Dunkirk (23%), Dune 2 (22%), and Gravity (21%).

	











	The top 10 locations overall are: 1. AMC Lincoln Square New York, 2. Regal Atlantic Station Atlanta, 3. AMC Southlake Pavilion Atlanta, 4. AMC Universal Citywalk Los Angeles, 5. Regal Edwards Marq'E Houston, 6. AMC Metreon San Francisco, 7. AMC Burbank, 8. AMC Empire New York, 9. Regal Irvine Spectrum Los Angeles, and 10. AMC Grove Los Angeles.


	The top cities are: 1. Los Angeles, 2. New York, 3. Atlanta, 4. Dallas, 5. Chicago, 6. Washington DC, 7. Houston, 8. San Francisco, 9. Philadelphia, and 10. Toronto.


	Nine of the top ten cities are over indexing their typical market share levels including Los Angeles(+3%), New York (+18%), Atlanta (+96%), Dallas (+27%), Chicago (+32%), Washington DC (+59%), Houston (+31%), San Francisco (+19%), and Philadelphia (+23%).


	Angel Studios' King of Kings did around $6.35M on Saturday landing it at $17.2M in its second weekend, -11%.

SATURDAY AM: Warner Bros didn't have a Good Friday, they had a Great Friday with Ryan Coogler's Michael B. Jordan-starring Sinners winning the day with $19.2M and A Minecraft Movie‘s third Friday banking $16M. Penciled out, the Legendary co-production A Minecraft Movie will win the weekend at $45M while Sinners will leg out like a horror movie with $40M, the 11th best opening ever over an Easter frame. Massive walk-up here with 61% of the audience yesterday buying their ticket same-day per Screen Engine/Comscore's PostTrak. The entire weekend for all film is expected to hit $134M, which is 104% ahead of the same frame a year ago (a non-Easter one), and only -2% behind the Easter 2024 weekend.


	For what we had been hearing about Sinners in the $30M range before a few days ago, this is a solid start for an original movie in period horror, which is a tricky genre at the box office (Focus Features pulled it off with Nosferatu over Christmas with a $21.6M 3-day, $40.8M 5-day). A $40M start for an original movie in a post-strike-streaming-Covid era is to be commended. It cannot be denied that with Coogler, Warner Bros Motion Picture co-chiefs Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy made an excellent movie. Look at these exits: Solid ‘A' CinemaScore, 5 stars PostTrak, 92% positive and a massive 84% definite recommend. Men and women over 25 respectively gave the 2-hour and 17-minute running film 93% positive. High scores among diverse groups with Black moviegoers turning out at a huge 49% giving the pic 95%, Caucasians at 27% grading it 91%, Hispanic and Latino at 14% (90%) and Asian at 6% an 86% grade. The under 18 crowd who made it into Sinners gave the movie an A+.

	











	We'll get into the economics on Sinners in a bit. 


	After seeing the movie a week ago, I questioned whether a prestige film such as Sinners with its awards patina (great cinematography, production design and acting all around) with its horror bent was better suited for the fall coupled with a TIFF world premiere, a populist festival for moviegoers. We don't often think of horror pairing with bunnies, peeps, lilies and chocolate. However, a tracking source pushed back, reminding me about the power of Easter weekend, that this was clearly the better date in its access to audiences to launch Sinners versus anytime in September or October. In addition, it was wise that Warners went with A Minecraft Movie in the first weekend of April versus Easter weekend. How's that? Had A Minecraft movie launched this weekend, it would run into Disney/Marvel Studios' Thunderbolts* two weeks from now. In the case of Sinners, the movie is counter-programming to the MCU title in its R-rated sensibility.


	Imax, PLF and select 70MM are pulling in 47% of the weekend gross for Sinners with strong plays in the East, South and West. Currently, AMC Lincoln Square in NYC is the top grossing multiplex with $114K. 


	Big reasons for why moviegoers bought tickets: 47% said it was Jordan, while a big 40% cited Coogler; 45% said they heard it was good from friends and family. Another 45% told PostTrak they were eager to see a sequel to the movie. Eighty-one percent plan on telling their friends to see Sinners in a theater, no matter what; not at home.


	At $90M-plus before P&A, it can be argued that's a lot for a period horror movie. Some studios wouldn't make this movie at this level. There was a rival offer to make Sinners at $90M. Know this is what it takes to be in business with auteurs who have delivered recent blockbusters on their resume. And with the departure of Christopher Nolan to Universal and Clint Eastwood approaching retirement, the studio of Stanley Kubrick, George Lucas (they released THX 1138) and Elia Kazan was in need of restocking. At $90M+ production for an auteur filmmaker who has a track record at the box office isn't unheard of. Nolan's Dunkirk cost $100M, and Interstellar was $165M. I'm told that Sinners' breakeven lies around $170M global box office, and that's because of the lucrative downstream from PVOD, Max, followed by subsequent windows on Prime and Netflix. Coogler did receive a rare first dollar gross (which means he begins to make a small percentage back immediately out of the film rental). Directors like Nolan and Tarantino receive first dollar gross (typically the profit payout for filmmakers and talent lies around breakeven). Others studios were offering first dollar gross for the project. I understand Coogler pushed his definition back to pay for any budget overages. The movie was shot with Louisiana tax credits.


	Here's how the rest of the weekend is looking:


	1.) A Minecraft Movie (WB) 4032 theaters Fri $16M, 3-day $45M, Total $348.3M/Wk 3


	2.) Sinners (WB) 3308 theaters, Fri $19.2M, 3-day $40M/Wk 1

Sneaks (Briarcliff) 1,500 theaters, Fri $240K, 3-day $675K/Wk 1 


UPDATE, FRIDAY MIDDAY: Warner Bros' Easter double feature weekend is currently shaping up with Ryan Coogler's Sinners winning Good Friday over A Minecraft Movie, $18 million to $16.5 million, but the Mojang movie looks to overtake the R-rated Michael B. Jordan movie, $44M–$40M, for its third No. 1 weekend win. Both projections could go higher as the weekend continues, per sources. Some see Minecraft potentially hitting $50M; Minecraft is playing at 4,032 theaters, while Sinners is at 3,308 sites.


	It's the second time that Warner Bros has led the Easter weekend box office in the No. 1 and No. 2 spots following The Curse of La Llorona ($26.3M) and Shazam (third weekend of $16.4M) going 1-2 in 2019. Last night's turnout by Black moviegoers at 46% indicates good walk-up business for Sinners, especially after the excellent word of mouth, and we're hearing a high Imax share as well. Sinners is the first release shot with Imax film cameras since Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, and the last until next year's The Odyssey.


	Coogler leaned heavily into Imax in the promotion of the film with a viral video breaking down aspect ratios; Imax premieres in NYC, Mexico City and London; and inviting tastemaker friends Lebron James, Adele, Jay-Z, The Weeknd and Snoop Dogg to screen the film at Imax's Playa Vista headquarters. Exclusively in Imax auditoriums, sequences in the film visually expand to fill the screen, allowing moviegoers to experience more picture with detail and clarity.

	Social media reach on Sinners was pretty big at 222.5 million per RelishMix across X, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and Facebook. That's higher than the social media universe before the release of comps Us (123M), Nope (179.8M) and Candyman (144.3M, $22M opening). Jordan and co-star Hailee Steinfeld are socially activated with 24M followers apiece. Among the positive reaction online, RelishMix noticed that fans loved how the trailer didn't give everything away, and they love how Coogler and Jordan are a combo much like Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.

	Elsewhere this weekend, third will go to Angel Studios' second weekend of The King of Kings at 3,535 theaters, with $6M today and $17M in its second weekend. That will take its running cume before Easter Monday to an estimated $45M.


	In fourth is 20th Century Studios' The Amateur with $8M in its second weekend, -46%, after a near $3M Friday at 3,400 sites. Its 10-day total would stand at $28M.


	Fifth is A24's Warfare at 2,670 locations seeing $1.4M today, $4M (-50%) for its second weekend and a running total by Sunday of $16M. The movie will easily eclipse the domestic run of the 2008 Iraq War bomb-squad unit movie The Hurt Locker at $17M stateside, which you'll remember won the 2009 Oscar for Best Picture.


PREVIOUSLY, FRIDAY AM: Warner Bros' $90 million+ period vampire movie Sinners chalked up $4.7 million in Thursday night previews that began yesterday at 3 p.m. Out of the gate with preview-night audiences, Sinners gets 5 stars on PostTrak with 80% definite recommend, an excellent exit that could bode well for over-indexing, knock on wood. Rotten Tomatoes is also high on the Ryan Coogler-Michael B. Jordan reteam, with reviews at 97% certified fresh and exits at that level as well.

	











	The diversity demos last night were 46% Black, 30% Caucasian, 15% Latino and Hispanic and 5% Asian. 


Sinners in its preview take is under that of genre comps like 2022's Nope ($6.4M Thursday night, $44.3M opening) and 2019's Us ($7.4M, $71.1M).


	The miracles of Good Friday at the box office, with 72% of K-12 schools and a close to a third of colleges on break, were already in effect last night, with Warner Bros/Legendary's A Minecraft Movie shooting up in its daily take by 21% over Wednesday with $6.5M, sending the Jared Hess movie past the three-century mark at the domestic box office with $303.3M. A Minecraft Movie pulled off the feat in 14 days, three days slower than Illumination/Nintendo/Universal's Super Mario Bros which took 11 days to cross $300M. That movie ended its U.S.-Canada run at $574.9M. A Minecraft Movie ends its second week with $102.9M.


	One of the two movies will wind up as No. 1 during the Easter holiday frame with respective weekend takes of $40M+. Who can ding a studio for owning the top two slots over a holiday weekend? Good on Warner Bros.


Sinners is booked at 3,308 theaters including premium auditoriums of Imax 70MM, Imax digital, 70MM, Dolby, PLFs and motion seats.


	Also opening this weekend is Bleecker Street's remake of the Ang Lee movie The Wedding Banquet starring Bowen Yang and Lily Gladstone at 1,133 theaters. The movie gets 3 stars from PostTrak audiences and a 50% definite recommend.


	The rest of the week is as follows:


	2.) The King of Kings (Angel) 3200 theaters, Thu $2.4M (+15% over Wednesday), Total $28M/Wk 1


	3.) The Amateur (20th/Dis) 3,400 theaters, Thu $1M (-6%), Total $20.1M/Wk 1


	4.) Warfare (A24) 2,670 theaters, Thu $891K (-6%) Total $12M/Wk 1 


	5.) Drop (Uni) 3,085 theaters, Thu $617K (+2%) Total $10.1M/Wk 1

King Charles and Queen Camilla have attended the traditional Easter Sunday church service at Windsor Castle, just outside London – with no sign of Prince William or Kate Middleton, but disgraced Prince Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson joining the royal party.


	Other royal figures to attend the service included the King's sister Princess Anne, Prince Andrew's daughters Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice, and the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh.


The Times of London reported that the group attended Easter Matins in the 15th-century St George's Chapel in Berkshire. This has been the venue of many royal weddings in the past, including that of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in 2017.

	The newspaper reports that King Charles continues to receive regular medical treatment, having last year announced he had been diagnosed with cancer. Last week, he joked with crowds outside Durham Cathedral in the north of England that his healthy appearance was “all smoke and mirrors.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Charles and Camilla recently celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary, and Camilla told reporters it was the King's work that kept him going, as he continued to recover from illness. The royal couple are expected to host French president Macron on a state visit to London next month. US president Donald Trump has also intimated he may visit the UK in September.


	The King's brother Prince Andrew continues to join his family for select royal events, despite incurring more controversy being named as an associate of an alleged Chinese spy. He withdrew from public life in 2019, following his notorious interview with the BBC when he attempted to explain away his longtime association with convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.

After storming off the set of the reunion and announcing her departure from the “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,” Garcelle Beauvais is showing fans exactly where she stands with her former co-stars.

Beauvais has unfollowed all of her former castmates on Instagram. When looking under her following list, Sutton Stracke, Kyle Richards, Erika Jayne, Dorit Kemsley, and Bozoma Saint John are no longer there. 

While Beauvais no longer follows Stracke's direct account, she still does follow two accounts associated with her store. She also still follows Kathy Hilton and Jennifer Tilly. 

As for the others, Stracke, Richards, Kemsley, and Saint John still follow her, while Jayne no longer does. 

A post shared by Garcelle Beauvais (@garcelle)

Beauvais posted on Instagram on March 25, telling fans that she was leaving Bravo's hit show after five seasons. She captioned it, “CHEERS TO THE NEXT CHAPTER 🙏🏾🥂💕.”

“Hi guys, I have some news,” Beauvais said in the post. “I've decided to leave Beverly Hills. It's been a wild ride, some amazing things have happened, and some hard things have also happened, but a ride nevertheless.

She said that the reason was because of her family, as she wants to “be a part” of her son Jade's new career. Her two sons are also entering their senior year of high school. 

“Secondly, I have the most exciting projects I am developing, producing, and acting in,” she continued. “I can't tell you anything right now, but you will know soon.” 

However, she could always return at some point after revealing that “Andy Cohen said I can come back any time, the door is always open. So you never know, I might pop back in sometime.”

“It's not goodbye, it's see you later,” she concluded. “So, see you later.”

A post shared by Kyle Richards (@kylerichards18)

In an interview with E! News that aired on April 8, “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Kyle Richards said that Beauvais has not responded to her texts following her exit from the show. 

“I haven't heard from her. I texted her twice and haven't heard back,” Richards said. 

“It's unfortunate she left, but I do wish her the best,” she continued. “I think she'll always do well, so I'm not worried about her next chapter.”

A post shared by Sutton Stracke (@suttonstracke)

In March 2025, a source told Parade magazine that Beauvais and Stracke haven't spoken since they filmed the season 14 reunion on February 28. 

“Garcelle was livid at the reunion,” the insider told the outlet. “She stormed off set and refused to take a photo with the cast.”

Former “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Lisa Vanderpump is sharing her support for Garcelle Beauvais following her recent decision to exit the Bravo series.

While speaking to TMZ in April 2025, Vanderpump, who exited RHOBH following the show's 9th season, said Beauvais is “a wonderful woman.”

“I'm sure she's kind of moving on to other things. It kind of served her well, and I wish her lots of luck,” said Vanderpump to the publication. 

Vanderpump made similar comments about Beauvais' exit during an April 2025 interview with Us Weekly. She said she would continue to not watch RHOBH, especially now that Beauvais has left the Bravo series. 

“There's no upside for me watching it. The only one I really liked was Garcelle [Beauvais] — I have a good relationship with her. Now it's time for her to move on. She was somebody before and she'll be somebody after. Not everybody's like that. A lot of people are defined by Housewives,” said Vanderpump during the Us Weekly interview. 

A post shared by Lisa Vanderpump (@lisavanderpump)

During the April 2025 interview with TMZ, Vanderpump said she would not come back to RHOBH. 

“That's a hard no,” said Vanderpump to TMZ. 

Vanderpump made similar comments about possibly returning to RHOBH while speaking to Us Weekly in April 2025. She said she would not come back to the Bravo franchise unless there were changes made to its cast. 

“That's a hard no, unless it was a group of different women I really liked,” said Vanderpump in the Us Weekly interview. 

Vanderpump also gave her opinion about RHOBH during a December 2024 interview with Access Hollywood. She said she would not consider coming back to the series. In addition, she gave an update on her dynamic with her former friend and castmate, Kyle Richards. According to Vanderpump, she would not mend her friendship with Richards unless she received an apology. 

A post shared by Garcelle Beauvais (@garcelle)

According to BravoTV.com, Beauvais revealed she would no longer film for RHOBH in a March 2025 Instagram video. 

“I have some news: I've decided to leave Beverly Hills. It's been a wild ride — I mean, some amazing things have happened, and some hard things have also happened — but it's been a ride nevertheless,” said Beauvais while filming the video. 

She said one of the reasons she left RHOBH following season 14 was because she wanted to spend time with her younger sons, Jaid and Jax.  

“Their last year of high school is next year and I want to be a part of that. And Jaid is starting a new [modeling] career and I want to be a part of that too,” said Beauvais. 

She also said she has been busy working as an actress and producer. 

“Secondly, I have the most exciting projects that I am developing, producing, and acting in. I can't tell you anything right now, but you'll know soon,” said Beauvais in her Instagram video.

Bravely embracing his role as a single dad since losing his wife to cancer in March 2025, beloved Hallmark star Brennan Elliott is spending Easter weekend traveling with his kids, 12-year-old Liam and 10-year-old Luna. 

Although he didn't reveal where they were visiting, Elliott shared multiple posts on April 18 with photos from an oceanside lunch, writing in one, “Not going to lie but this is my happy place!!! As a father you take pride in taking care of your kids but on this trip they are taking care of me! Thanx babies for letting me k ow it's all OK!!!Angels! 🙏”

A post shared by Professional experiencer (@brennanelliott2)

Elliott also shared individual photos of Liam and Luna, and expressed how proud he is of them as they navigate life since their mom, Camilla Row, died on March 22 following an eight-year battle with gastric cancer. 

Captioning a photo of Luna smiling in the sunshine at a table, Elliott wrote, “Spending Easter with these two beautiful creatures! Knowing mommy is looking over them and very proud!”

The actor, who has appeared in over 25 Hallmark movies since 2012, shared a similar sentiment with his photo of Liam, writing, “Spending time with this little man and his sister! Mommy is looking down proud of these two! #happyeater everyone!”

Many friends and fans commented on Elliott's posts, including one who wrote, “Camilla is with you all Brennan right next to you three and yelling you how proud she is of you Liam and Luna and see how much you love your babies❤️ Liam is so adorable 🙏❤️”

Elliott replied to that comment, “I hope so!” 

Many of Elliott's Hallmark colleagues liked his posts, including Nazneen Contractor, Wes Brown, Tamera Mowry Housley, Cindy Busby, and Princess Davis. 

Lacey Chabert, who has starred in 10 Hallmark movies with Elliott including 2024's “His and Hers,” commented on one of his posts, “We love you all 🤍”

A post shared by Professional experiencer (@brennanelliott2)

Before Row's death, she frequently shared posts about her and Elliott's kids on her private Instagram account. In her last post on March 9, she shared a photo of Liam and Luna wearing Disneyland sweatshirts, standing in front of Minnie and Mickey Mouse statues, and wrote, “Happiest place on earth!”

From a family outing at the California Science Center in March 2024 to her kids' holiday piano recital that December, Row left behind words of pride and encouragement for her kids, knowing that her stage 4 diagnosis in 2022 came with a grim prognosis.

On Mother's Day 2024, Row posted throwback Polaroid photos with her kids and wrote, “I am so blessed to have had these two choose me as their mom. By far, it is my greatest accomplishment they are growing into truly beautiful humans. Wishing my mom a very wonderful Mother's Day as well. She is the strongest person I know and I have learned so much from her. I am so thankful I am able to celebrate another Mother's Day with my family!”

Hours after Row's death on March 22, Elliott wrote in an online tribute, “Our babies and I lost our rock. A person who not only was the love of my life, my soulmate, my best friend and lover but the toughest strongest fearless person I have ever met in my life and the greatest mother to her babies.”

The defining image of Tom Waits' early career is a photograph taken by Mitchell Rose for Rolling Stone at the Tropicana Motel in West Hollywood in 1977. The singer-songwriter had been renting a room there for a few years by that point, but the photo looks like he'd moved in an hour ago. Beer bottles litter the coffee table in front of him; a guitar case rests atop an oversized cardboard box. Waits leans forward, hands folded, looking skeptical, maybe a little put-out, but certainly not embarrassed by the shabby condition of his domicile. He's sitting in a folding lawn chair that hasn't seen a ray of sunshine since the Nixon administration.

The next year, Waits put out his sixth LP on the Asylum label, Blue Valentine. The imprint, started by David Geffen and Elliot Roberts in 1971, was a showcase for the Southern California talent that was defining the post-Woodstock singer-songwriter landscape. Judee Sill's debut album was its inaugural release, Jackson Browne's with his first record a few months later, and by the time Joni Mitchell issued For the Roses on Asylum in the fall of 1972, Asylum sat near the center of a scene that was becoming a movement.

Waits knew some of these people from shared bills and the scene revolving around the Los Angeles club the Troubadour, where he'd been discovered by manager Herb Cohen. But he didn't quite fit in. The prevailing mode of the early singer-songwriters was personal expression—you were supposed to draw from your life for your material, dotting your lyrics with references to friends and lovers and changing the details just enough to maintain plausible deniability. Waits wasn't interested in this kind of sharing. Instead, he turned the whole idea on its head and based his life on his songs.

Like so many in his cohort, his early encounters with Bob Dylan blew his mind. Where many of his peers came up playing in garage bands, learning how to play Beatles tunes and “Louie Louie,” he fashioned himself as a solo songwriter from the beginning, and Dylan was his North Star. In the 2009 biography Lowside of the Road, writer Barney Hoskyns describes Waits' earliest performances at a local folk society's hootenannies as little more than impersonations, where “he was so in thrall to the staple Dylan persona that he wore a harmonica around his neck without ever putting his lips to it.” But where others copped the style and tried to write lyrics that could be considered poetry, Waits channeled the elder artist's drive for reinvention. By the time he was making a name for himself at San Diego folk hoots, his middle-class suburban upbringing in Whittier, California, suddenly became irrelevant: Music was a good way to become someone else.

Waits got a record deal and, inspired by the Beats and associated countercultural figures like Charles Bukowski, he wrote about down-and-out characters and ragged street life, delivering his songs in the guise of a shabbily dressed nightclub hipster. “The Tropicana became a kind of stage,” Hoskyns observed, “a backdrop to Waits' twenty-four-hours-a-day performance.” As the '70s wound down, the songwriter worried that he'd painted himself into a corner. His work had certainly evolved between 1973's Closing Time and Blue Valentine growing bluesier and rougher as his smoked-scorched voice deepened. But he felt stuck and worried that he was repeating himself.

His search for a new sound was set aside when Francis Ford Coppola tapped him to write and perform songs for One From the Heart. The film's music would be central to the film's story and Coppola had fallen in love with the boozy after-hours milieu the songwriter rendered so well, so Waits sat at the piano and got to work, clocking in at the filmmaker's office like a Tin Pan Alley tunesmith. While composing, he reconnected with Kathleen Brennan, a script supervisor he'd bumped into a couple of times, and they fell for each other hard. Within a week, they were engaged, and from that point forward, his creative output would be split into “Before Kathleen” and “After Kathleen.” Her greatest contribution may have been the way she bolstered his confidence. If Waits feared letting go of the persona that had defined his recording career, Brennan convinced him that something better was within his grasp. She also expanded his musical palette, schooling him on the work of avant-garde artists that would be important in his next phase—Captain Beefheart, Harry Partch, Gavin Bryars.

While continuing work on the soundtrack, Waits knocked out one last album for Asylum with his longtime producer Bones Howe: Heartattack and Vine hit stores in fall 1980. It's a strong record on which he pushed his voice further and added thick and mean guitar. But it wasn't a radical departure from what came before. The chrysalis-like transformation would have to wait until the next record: With his contract up and a new family to support, Waits fired Cohen, split with Howe, signed with Island, and released 1983's Swordfishtrombones.

Producing himself for the first time, Waits raided the musical junk shop and returned with wheezing accordion, fragile glass harmonica, thwacking talking drums, bubbling marimba, and too many miscellaneous percussion instruments to list. His previous work was informed by theater and cinema, but the songs on Swordfishtrombones were uncannily visual, the colors and textures of the sound framing his newly sharp narratives. Characters included a sailor on shore leave, a fugitive on the run from the law, and a homicidal office-furniture salesman who sets fire to the family home. If earlier songs sometimes felt like a slurring drunk telling you a story in a bar; now, they felt vivid and alive. Swordfishtrombones was recorded in California with local players; it would take a move east to New York City just after the record's release to complete his metamorphosis.

Waits found a creative community almost instantly. In recent years, the city's experimental downtown music scene had gone overground, and Waits felt a kinship with some of its players. He befriended saxophonist and composer John Lurie, whose band the Lounge Lizards had, in its early days, deconstructed jazz, celebrating the genre while undercutting it with amateurism in a way that fit with Waits' own playful reverence. Through Lurie, he met jazz guitarist Marc Ribot. Hal Willner, who was the musical director of Saturday Night Live, gave Waits an education on the carnivalesque music of Kurt Weill and invited him to contribute to Lost in the Stars, a tribute to the German composer.

Waits summoned drummer Stephen Hodges and bassist Larry Taylor from California, both of whom had worked on Swordfishtrombones, and Hodges was astonished by how quickly and thoroughly a cabal had formed around the songwriter. “He seemed like the frigging Pope of New York,” he told Hoskyns. “He was taking care of business. He was all over the place.” The degree to which Waits was feeling his oats can be measured by the fact that he asked Keith Richards to play on his record, and the living legend agreed—after years of telling guitarists he was looking for a Stonesy feel, Waits had the self-assurance to ask the man himself.

And he knew how to get what he wanted in the studio. “He really has a good ear, not just for this note or that note, but for understanding how the sound is framing the lyric,” Ribot said in a later interview. “What decade is it, what continent is it on, what kind of room is it in?” Rain Dogs has much in common with Swordfishtrombones—antiquated instruments, metal-on-metal percussion, stomping cabaret numbers alternating with wispy instrumentals. But it has a grungier and more scuffed-up aesthetic that puts guitar, both by Waits himself and Ribot, out front. The latter's style takes in Cuban syncopation, Southwestern twang, free-jazz skronk, and bluesy rock, but above all it forces you to confront the elemental materials of his instrument, with its electrified hum, heavy wood, and vibrating steel. To hear Ribot play is to understand that a guitar is a machine.

Rain Dogs is more of a band record than its predecessor—it sounds like people playing together in a room, and you notice their interplay at least as much as the arrangements. And everything revolves around the drums. After signing to Island, Waits became one of a few artists in the period—see Peter Gabriel and Robert Fripp of King Crimson—who experimented with a drum setup with few or no cymbals. Even if indirectly, some of this tendency came from the rapidly expanding interest in “world music” in the U.S. and UK in the 1980s, which made work from percussion-heavy traditions more accessible. And some can be traced to earlier strands of experimental rock, specifically the stand-up bashing of Maureen Tucker and the angular rhythms of Captain Beefheart.

For an artist with roots in jazz and rock, deemphasizing cymbals changes the recording's character. The hi-hat and ride reinforce perception of the rhythm's grid, allowing the ear to hear the precise meter more clearly, serving as an aural version of dot-and-dash notation on paper. A kit where cymbals are used sparingly can sound heavier, looser, and more rhythmically free—the drums on Rain Dogs roll, tumble, and lurch rather than simply marking time. “Tom always wanted orchestra accuracy with back-alley blues—it had to be loose, and had to be accurate,” said Hodges in a podcast interview. Amplifying the low-end was his use of a 32-inch bass drum better suited for a marching band, the rumble and quake of its diaphragm lending darkness and drama.

In the opening section of Rain Dogs, the ear goes first to the texture of the arrangements and the band's interactions. “Singapore” is a demented cabaret number that stomps on the 2 and 4, “Clap Hands” has Waits singing with an insectile buzz in the middle of what sounds like a gamelan orchestra, “Jockey Full of Bourbon” is a slinky rumba something like “Ghost Riders in the Sky” as played by Professor Longhair, and both “Cemetery Polka” and “Tango Till They're Sore” frame their titular movement forms as dances of death.

Throughout the album, guitar and marimba compete for attention. The latter instrument allows percussion to carry rhythm, chords, and melody all at once, while the use of space between mallet strikes means that some pieces unfold with a bare minimum of harmonic information. On “Black Mariah,” Richards plays his instrument like a drum, cozying up to the beat while Waits sings what could be an ancient work song. The title track begins with a sinister accordion that sounds like it's trying to raise Lon Chaney's ghost, and Ribot's guitar rides the marimba as it percolates low in the mix. “Union Square” has a horn section that seems irritated and a percussionist wailing on a brake drum who would probably rather be smashing windows.

For all its sonic pleasures, the lyrics on Rain Dogs might be the best of Waits' career. New York City is the backdrop for much of the action, but it's the city as Waits imagines it, a claustrophobic port town filled with transients and desperate characters barely surviving on the margins. “They say if you get far enough away/You'll be on your way back home,” he sings on the lovely country weeper “Blind Love.” We hear about the weather often, and as you might expect, it ain't very good. On the gorgeous ballad “Time,” he praises a woman who “said she'd stick around until the bandages came off” and measures the passing hours by watching as “the dish outside the window fills with rain.”

And then there's one wonderful number that Waits wrote because he could. He survived as long as he did in the business because he wrote songs his peers wanted to sing. That included Closing Time's “Ol' 55,” an ode the life on the road that Eagles would record for their 1974 LP On the Border, and “Martha,” on Tim Buckley's Sefronia, and “Shiver Me Timbers” from The Heart of Saturday Night, which Bette Midler included on a medley on her 1976 record Songs for the New Depression. With “Downtown Train,” he seemed to know exactly what he was doing, creating a copyright that would keep him howling and banging on trash cans into his old age. “I tried to make [it] sound like a pop song,” he told writer Bill Flanagan about the tune, and Hodges noted he tried it first with the core Rain Dogs band but wound up bringing in industry pros, including guitarist G.E. Smith and bassist Tony Levin.

It's a beautiful piece of work that offers a brief respite from the darkness of the album surrounding it, and it's the perfect vehicle for a gruff-voiced singer to turn into a hit. Rod Stewart and Bob Seger would record it at almost the same time later in the decade, and Stewart would take his version to No. 3 on the Hot 100 in 1989 and heavy rotation in CVS forevermore.

Revisiting Rain Dogs, one particular verse in Waits' biggest song leapt out at me: “The downtown trains are full/With all those Brooklyn girls/They try so hard to break out of their little worlds.” One, the idea of “Brooklyn girls” as a category is amusing—it's not something you often hear in casual conversation, since we're talking about a borough of two million people whose families come from all over the globe. Perhaps Waits, in love with his new town, was thinking of “Brooklyn girls” of Carole King's ilk, outsiders who commuted into the city to fulfill their dreams and knew intimately the terrain from their neighborhoods, from rooftop to boardwalk. “Downtown Train” was in that sense Waits' attempt to channel the wonder of a King co-write with Gerry Goffin, where fantasy is grounded in clear and specific reality.

And then there's “They try so hard to break out of their little worlds,” a line that could, at first, seem condescending. But if you understand where Waits had been, you know he was feeling every syllable of that line. Since childhood, he'd used music to try to escape his own little world, and after a while, that struggle was eating him up. Until finally, he met someone who believed in him without reservation and finally figured out how to create records like Rain Dogs and make those dreams come true.

The first time I heard a Sasquatch grunt, I was six episodes deep into the Wild Thing podcast, Denver journalist Laura Krantz's three-part show about Bigfoot, UFOs, and nuclear power.

As it turned out, the huffing vocalization that caught my ear was only Shane Corson, field researcher at the Olympic Project, a group that explores the science behind Bigfoot. Like a birder mimicking a yellow warbler's soft pish-pish-pish, Corson was attempting to lure a Bigfoot out of the brush while tromping through the woods with Krantz and her podcasting team.

Now, I wouldn't go so far as to say I believe in Sasquatch, but I suspect this is how any obsession starts: Reddit threads; a History Channel binge. One minute you're innocently enjoying Krantz's superb storytelling, and then you're mapping out a road trip across rural Colorado.

I guess I'd always know it, but Krantz's work illuminates a simple truth: Colorado is a hotbed of strangeness; a place where the Rocky Mountains rise to meet the unexplained. Whether you're a skeptic or a seeker, exploring otherworldly corners of the Centennial State is a great excuse to experience beloved and overlooked destinations alike.

Rumor has it Bigfoot is nocturnal, but I wouldn't recommend a backcountry night hike unless you're a very confident wayfarer with honed navigation skills and proper gear. For most of us, it's better to start in Bailey, at the Sasquatch Outpost, 149 Main St., open 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and closed Wednesdays. This fun retail shop is packed with a veritable hodgepodge of Bigfoot sundries–everything from mugs and figurines to books, postcards, and t-shirts.

Behind the store, enter the Sasquatch Encounter Discovery Museum ($8 for adults; $5 for kids), a homespun gallery housing an impressive collection of documents on Bigfoot history and research alongside items such as track casts, large-scale maps, and several sculptures and replicas. Owners Jim and Daphne Myers host regular meet-ups for enthusiasts, and they'll also take folks out on expeditions. They've been putting the finishing touches on a bigfoot-themed escape room, and are hopeful it'll be operational by June.

Where to eat: The Cutthroat Café, 157 Main St., within walking distance of the outpost, serves a pretty solid breakfast. Or you can quench your thirst at Craft Mountain Brewing, 23 Main St., or at a waterside seat at Aspen Peak Cellars, 60750 U.S. Hwy. 285, offering a perfect setting for higher-end lunch and dinner fare.

Where to hike: Hoping to spot a Bigfoot? The trailhead to Colorado Trail Section #6 is only 20 minutes west of Bailey, directly off Highway 285. This segment of Colorado's epic 567-mile cross-state hiking and biking route takes outdoors enthusiasts through some premium mountain terrain. Or head to Staunton State Park, 12102 S Elk Creek Road. The 12-mile route to Elk Falls is a personal favorite, but there's a lot to love about the (much shorter) David Ponds Loop, measuring in at about 2.3 miles across even, easy terrain.

Nederland may be on your weirdness radar as the birthplace of a peculiar and totally beloved festival: Frozen Dead Guy Days. The annual celebration of Grandpa Bredo (rumored to be kept frozen in a Tuff Shed) might have relocated to Estes Park, but Ned hasn't gotten any less strange, and it boasts a strong showing in the Sasquatch department. Campers tell of shadowy shapes darting between trees and screams echoing down from the Indian Peaks. As recently as March, the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization reported a new sighting 11 miles outside Boulder.

Where to camp: Spend a night in one of 22 designated tent sites at West Magnolia Trailhead, past 45 Peak to Peak Hwy., and you might find yourself reconsidering what you thought you knew about the animal kingdom. Camping is first-come, first-served; no facilities of any kind.

Where to hike: Mud Lake Open Space, 2034 County Road 126, is an excellent choice. From the Mud Lake Trailhead, combine the forested Tungsten and Kinnickinnick loop trails, and end at the on-site lake, which is way more spectacular than the name suggests.

Where to eat: I'm partial to Crosscut Pizzeria, 4 E. 1st St., which offers wood-fired pizzas, good craft beer, and creek-view dining on the patio. Salto Coffee, 112 E. 2nd St., is another solid option.

When it comes to alien activity, you'll probably want to start where the skies are darkest and the stories wildest: the UFO Watchtower off Highway 117, two miles north of Hooper, (GPS sometimes gets this destination wrong, so watch for the signs and green alien sculptures).

Judy Messoline, author of the 2005 book “That Crazy Lady Down the Road,” built her 10-foot-tall watchtower on a whim in 2000. (Some uninformed travelers might call it a raised metal platform surrounded by lawn ornaments; you'll have to see for yourself if you can feel the energy vortex.)

In 25 years, the structure has become a beloved roadside attraction that doubles as sacred ground for many sky watchers. Apparently, the UFO Watchtower has drawn more than 30,000 human visitors, many of whom have added their own small trinkets to the growing collection that's laid out on the pea gravel near the site's main attraction.

Currently, guests are welcome on weekends, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., but these hours extend in the spring and summer–we think. Messoline doesn't answer her phone, but she maintains a website with updated information: theoriginalufowatchtower.com. Be ready to pay a nominal visitation fee of $5 per person; children under 6 get in free.

Where to camp: Onsite! You don't need a reservation. It's $20 per night per tent; BYO water, food, firewood, and trash bags. You can also pitch a tent at Piñon Flats Campground inside Great Sand Dunes National Park nearby. A moonless night is the best time to experience this International Dark Sky Park. You probably won't see any pulsing orbs or darting shapes, but looking up at a pitch-black sky, you'll get a real sense for the vastness of our mysterious universe.

Krantz's podcast and books are all about determining science fact from fiction. To that end, she recommends Fiske Planetarium, 2414 Regent Drive on the CU Boulder campus. The largest planetarium between Chicago and L.A., the museum functions as a project zone for CU students and faculty. When the space isn't being used for educational pursuits, the general public is invited into the 65-foot-diameter dome for films, star talks, and even laser shows.

Where to eat: Head to Pearl Street Mall for a bite. There are dozens of restaurants, both casual and upscale, with just about any kind of cuisine.

Where to hike: On the west side of the National Center for Atmospheric Research building at 1850 Table Mesa Drive, you'll find the Walter Orr Roberts Weather Trail, a half-mile loop with informational signage. For a longer hike, follow Mesa Trail until it links with Enchanted Mesa Trail. This out-and-back hike weaves through a less-crowded segment of Chautauqua Park.

Consider traveling the stars and transcending space-time at Meow Wolf Denver's Convergence Station, 1338 1st St. Here's how the story goes: When a rare cosmic glitch aligned four worlds into one, a portal opened. For $45, curious travelers can walk through an immersive, interactive science fiction exhibition. Have fun trying to solve on-site mysteries, or just enough this over-the-top intergalactic art. Purchase tickets in advance online.

It's impossible to write about Colorado's strangeness without mentioning Denver International Airport, which has become a conspiracy theory theme park, complete with apocalyptic murals, a time capsule, underground tunnels, and 3the 2-foot-tall blue Mustang sculpture with the glowing red eyes. (Surely you already know that “Blucifer” killed its creator.)

While most of the weirdness is likely just eccentric art, there are some who believe the airport is a hub — or maybe a cover — for extraterrestrial activity. Keep your eyes peeled the next time your flight gets delayed. It's okay to want to believe.

Home » Hollywood News

Eminent Hollywood filmmaker Steven Spielberg is one of the most prolific and renowned directors across the globe. Besides directing cult films such as E.T., Indiana Jones Trilogy, Saving Private Ryan, and Schindler's List, to name a few, the 78-year-old filmmaker has also given us a few horror films, namely Jaws, Poltergeist, and Jurassic Park. Will you believe us if we tell you that even Spielberg once got terrified of watching a low-budget horror movie? Read on to know which movie we are talking about.

The name of the horror film that scared Spielberg to death was Oren Peli's directorial debut, ‘Paranormal Activity'. It was shot in a found-footage format and was initially made on a shoestring budget of just $15000.

As the story goes, according to CBR, Steven Spielberg was given a DVD copy of ‘Paranormal Activity' for his feedback. When he watched the movie, an eerie incident happened to him. After watching it, Spielberg's room somehow got mysteriously locked on its own, and he was not able to open it. He had to take the help of a locksmith to get the door unlocked. But the whole incident scared the wits out of him. He thought that the Paranormal Activity DVD was haunted by a demonic presence, so he took the copy and sent it back in a trash bag.

The found-footage supernatural horror movie's basic plot revolves around a couple who become the target of a fierce supernatural entity inside their home. So, the couple decides to record their spooky experiences using cameras, and that's when the real terror begins.

The first Paranormal Activity movie grossed a whopping $194 million at the box office globally, yielding an incredible return on investment. It currently holds a Rotten Tomatoes score of 83%, which is quite good for a horror film.

The success of the first film spanned a string of sequels, but they were not able to even remotely match the critical acclaim of the parent film, although they were commercially successful films. The series grossed around thirty times its total budget.

After his last feature film directorial venture, ‘The Fabelmans', Steven Spielberg's next film as a director will be the yet-untitled science fiction movie starring Emily Blunt, Josh O'Connor, Colin Firth, Eve Hewson, and Wyatt Russell, among others. Reportedly based on a flying saucer theme, the film is set for a theatrical release on 12th June 2026.

A decorated duck egg discovered in a trash pit is the world's oldest ""pysanka.""

Name: Lviv pysanka

What it is: A decorated duck egg

Where it is from: Lviv, Ukraine

When it was made: The early 16th century

What it tells us about the past:

Easter-egg decorating is an ancient tradition with deep roots extending at least into the medieval period of European history. But archaeological evidence of them is scarce due to the delicate nature of eggshells. At more than 500 years old, the Lviv pysanka — Ukrainian for ""written egg"" — is the oldest decorated Easter egg in the world.

Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

Archaeologists discovered the pysanka in 2013, when construction workers stumbled upon a medieval well while renovating a house in Lviv, a city in western Ukraine. The well was originally used for collecting groundwater, according to the Rescue Archaeological Service at the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Archaeology. But after the Great Fire of Lviv in 1527, which destroyed most of the city, the well was used as a cesspit.

The pysanka was nestled in a thick layer of charcoal along with ceramic dishes; small utensils; and leather, wood and metal objects, suggesting that these items may have been swept into the disused well during cleanup after the fire. Surprisingly, the damage to the egg was minor; only about 0.31 square inches (2 square centimeters) of the total area was lost.

Ukrainian pysanky are typically created using a wax-resist technique. With this method, wax is ""written"" in a decorative pattern on the surface of the egg, which is painted or dyed. The wax is then removed, revealing the light-colored shell of the egg, which, in the case of the Lviv pysanka, is from a duck.

The practice of decorating ceramic eggs or balls dates back many centuries. Archaeologists have found ceramic Easter eggs in Ukraine dated to the 12th century, revealing the antiquity of the practice in that country. And some researchers argue that decorated eggs date back several millennia, originating with the Stone Age Cucuteni-Trypillia culture in Central Europe, likely as a symbol of nature and rebirth. But this pagan tradition was eventually absorbed into Christianity, with the egg coming to symbolize the empty tomb and the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

In modern Ukraine, decorating pysanky is an important national tradition. In 2024, UNESCO listed Ukrainian pysanky decorating among the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, honoring the centuries-old practice.

The Lviv Easter egg is currently housed in the Pysanka Museum in Kolomyia, which displays many of these symbols of the long-standing Ukrainian tradition of egg decorating.

MOSCOW, April 20. /TASS/. The Russian army in accordance with President Vladimir Putin's orders strictly observed ceasefire in the area of the special military operation from 6:00 p.m. Moscow time (3:00 p.m. GMT) on April 19, the Defense Ministry reported.

""As ordered by Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Federation, all groups of forces in the area of the special military operation strictly observed ceasefire from 6:00 p.m. Moscow time on April 19 and remained at lines and positions taken earlier,"" the report said.

Russia touted as possible destination for Iran's uranium stockpile and could also act as arbiter of deal breaches

Russia could play a key role in a deal on the future of Iran's nuclear programme, with Moscow being touted not only as a possible destination for Iran's stockpile of highly enriched uranium, but also as a possible arbiter of deal breaches.

Donald Trump, who abandoned a 2015 nuclear pact between Tehran and world powers in 2018 during his first term, has threatened to attack Iran unless it reaches a new deal swiftly that would prevent it from developing a nuclear weapon.

Four hours of indirect talks between the US and Iran in Rome on Saturday, under the mediation of Oman, made significant progress, according to US officials. Further technical talks are due in Geneva this week, followed by another high-level diplomatic meeting next weekend in Oman.

Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, who was at the heart of the Rome talks, wants an agreement wrapped up within 60 days, but is likely to face resistance from Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, who believes the levels of distrust and the technical nature of the talks make such a swift agreement unlikely.

The two most daunting issues are the storage or destruction of Iran's stockpile of highly enriched uranium, and the external guarantees that can be provided to Iran if the US was to breach an agreement to lift economic sanctions in return for Iran putting its civil nuclear programme back under external supervision by the UN inspectorate, the IAEA. Iran wants a guarantee of consequences for the US if it pulls out of or breaches another deal.

Iran wants to keep its uranium stockpiles inside the country, but the US rejects this and wants either the stockpiles' destruction or a transfer to a third country, such as Russia.

Iran believes it has received assurances that the US objective is not the entire dismantling of its nuclear programme. Before the Rome talks, in an intervention that sowed confusion in Iran and the US, Witkoff had on social media seemed to endorse such an objective, causing consternation in Iran, but in Rome he gave the impression that this was largely domestic political messaging.

Mohamed Amersi, a member of the advisory board at the Wilson Center, a Washington thinktank, said: “From the Iranian perspective there had been some conflicting messages on social media and in interviews about the US wanting the complete elimination of their nuclear programme and that was not at all what Araghchi had agreed, so the first assurance was that there had been no expansion in the US objectives. If he had not got that assurance it's likely the whole negotiation would have been wrapped up, and ended immediately.”

On guarantees, Iran believes the only secure agreement is a treaty signed by US Congress, but Araghchi was told it would be anyone's guess whether Trump could get such an agreement through Congress given the strength of pro-Israeli opinion there.

Another option is for the US to agree to cover Tehran's losses if Washington were to pull out of a deal. The Iranians floated the idea of a financial penalty before, but the enforcement mechanism in the absence of a treaty remains problematic. A third option if the US is in breach is for Russia to be empowered to return the handed-over stockpile of highly enriched uranium to Tehran, so ensuring Iran would not be the party punished for non-compliance.

Such an arrangement potentially gives Russia a pivotal role in the future US-Iran relationship, and might freeze out Germany, France and the UK, the current guarantors of the 2015 agreement. Neither Iran nor the US want to keep a major future role for the UN.

Rome was seen by some as an important site for the talks, since if they went wrong the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has the best relations with Trump, and so was well placed to mount a rescue operation. A tentative proposal for a meeting between Araghchi and the US vice-president, JD Vance, who was in Rome, was seen as premature.

There is pressure on Witkoff and Trump to deliver on one of the three negotiations in which they are involved – Iran, Hamas-Israel, and Russia-Ukraine. One source said: “Whatever you may think of Iran, they are rational actors, and they are more likely to strike a deal.”

Iran's negotiating position was strengthened before the talks by the visit of the Saudi defence minister to Tehran to see the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The visit was intended as a message of solidarity that it opposes and would not collaborate in any US-Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear sites.

The Omani foreign ministry said the goal of the talks was to reach “a fair, sustainable and binding agreement … to ensure that Iran is completely free of nuclear weapons and sanctions, while preserving its right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Kyren Wilson became the latest player to fall foul of snooker's Crucible curse after a shock defeat on the opening day of the World Snooker Championship at the hands of Chinese sensation Lei Peifan — underlining the belief many have that this could finally be the year China crowns its first champion of the world.

Not since snooker's most prestigious event moved to Sheffield in 1977 has a first-time winner of the event gone on to successfully defend the title. 

Wilson is now the 20th man on that list after his defense came to a shuddering halt within hours of this year's tournament beginning, after the world No. 39 produced a magnificent comeback victory.

Wilson led Lei 6-3 after the opening session on Saturday, but crucially, it was Lei who won the final frame in the morning to ensure the deficit was just three frames, rather than five. The 21-year-old then won six successive frames to start the evening session, all with breaks of 50 or more, to move to the verge of victory.

Wilson returned serve with a clearance of 106 and edged two more nerve-shredding frames to send it to a decider. At that stage, all the momentum seemed to be with the champion, but Lei held his nerve to deliver a break of 66 and close out one of the biggest shocks in the Crucible's recent history.

As well as that, he ensured the curse would continue for at least another year as well as, more importantly, raising hopes even further that Chinese snooker might be on the verge of what it has craved for some time.

The hopes of a nation have largely rested on the shoulders of Ding Junhui for quite some time, and when 10 Chinese players were suspended as part of a match-fixing investigation in 2023, it left the sport under a dark cloud. 

However, a record 10 players — almost one-third of the draw — from China have qualified for this year's tournament.

Such is the spread throughout the draw that it seems incredibly likely that at least two would meet in the quarter-finals. 

Xiao Guodong led Matthew Selt 7-2 after their opening session. 

However, while Lei stole the show and the headlines on the opening day here, all eyes yesterday were on one of the brightest hopes Chinese snooker has ever seen.

Zhao Xintong was one of the 10 players banned in 2023, serving a 20-month suspension for his part in the scandal. However, he has been tipped for stardom from a young age, and has returned to the amateur tour since the expiration of his ban in some style, making a maximum break and coming through qualifying to reach the Crucible.

He is only the third non-professional to reach the main draw, and is scheduled to begin against last year's finalist Jak Jones after press time last night.

He would meet Lei in the last 16 if he navigates that task. 

Many within the sport believe Zhao is best placed to become China's first world champion, including the great Stephen Hendry.

What the achievement of a Chinese world champion could bring to snooker comes with great intrigue. The Crucible was a marvelous sight on Saturday; the history seeps from the walls, and the surrounding areas are a hive of activity. Few sports are as synonymous with one city quite like snooker is with Sheffield.

However, there is no doubt that the Crucible has its limitations, and talk of moving the world championship is never far from the agenda. 

With the tournament's current deal up in 2027, should a Chinese player win the game's biggest prize over the coming fortnight, who knows where it could lead, with the tournament watched by as many as 200 million people in China.

Whether Lei is the man to do that or one of the other players from China in action at this tournament remains to be seen. 

However, this victory was a statement moment so early into proceedings in Sheffield: not just for the continuation of the curse, but the belief that after so long, maybe this is Chinese snooker's time.

This year would be remembered as one in which the global development landscape was thrown into unprecedented chaos. Shortly after US President Donald Trump's administration effectively dismantled the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the British government cut its aid budget to redirect funds toward defense spending. Facing similar pressure to support Ukraine and bolster their own military capabilities, other European donor countries are following suit. Meanwhile, developing countries and international organizations are scrambling to fill massive funding gaps that threaten to disrupt life-saving efforts around the world.

These trends raise fundamental questions about the future of international development. With traditional donors stepping back, how would low-income countries and aid institutions secure the resources needed to fight poverty, build infrastructure and deliver essential public services such as health care and education? How can the global development architecture — the organizations, practitioners and relationships established to serve these goals — adapt to this harsh new reality?

It is important to remember that most countries have historically financed their own development, with foreign aid playing a relatively small — albeit important — supporting role. Even among the world's poorest countries, aid typically accounts for only 10 percent to 30 percent of public spending. In middle-income countries, aid contributions have rarely exceeded 5 percent of government expenditure, and most public services and investments have been funded through taxes on trade, value-added goods and services, income and natural resources. It is also worth noting that non-traditional donors such as China, the Gulf countries and Turkey are growing in importance alongside traditional providers of aid such as the US, Europe and Japan.

Nevertheless, we are at a turning point where levels of official development assistance are likely to fall and developing country governments would be under growing pressure to boost domestic revenues, particularly in sectors that have traditionally relied heavily on external support, such as health and education. While targeted excise taxes on harmful products such as tobacco, alcohol and sugary drinks could be part of the solution, broader tax policy reforms and stronger revenue collection systems are also necessary.

Unsustainable debt burdens severely constrain developing countries' ability to replace lost aid with borrowing. The IMF said more than half of the world's low-income countries are either experiencing or are at high risk of debt distress.

Compounding the problem, progress on debt restructuring has been slow, hampered by disagreements among the world's largest creditors, including China. For the poorest countries, their room to maneuver is extremely limited. Inevitably, public services would have to be cut, and teachers and healthcare workers would be laid off, putting hard-won development gains at risk.

So, in the aftermath of reductions in development aid by the US, the UK and other major donor countries, what would remain of the world's aid institutions? Moreover, how would the existing resources — domestic and reduced donor aid — be spent? Many developing countries would focus even more on economic growth and job creation to generate the revenues needed to fund the public services that their populations are demanding.

Among donors, there is a need for renewed public debate about the purpose of foreign aid, especially at a time when government budgets in developed and developing countries are under strain. Some say that developed countries should focus on their own citizens' well-being and abandon aid altogether; others want to use aid to advance narrow national interests; and many contend that wealthier countries have a moral obligation to help those less fortunate. However, I believe that the most compelling argument for aid — and the one that is likely to resonate with the most people — is that it can benefit donor and recipient countries alike.

PILLARS OF DEVELOPMENT

Many of the things we value today are globally connected, as are the challenges we face. Following decades of globalization, and despite current trade disruptions, economic growth still spreads across borders. Tackling climate change means cutting greenhouse gas emissions wherever it is most cost-effective to do so. And stronger health systems, supported by global disease surveillance and rapid response mechanisms, are critical to containing outbreaks before they turn into pandemics.

In an interconnected world, the case for aid must be based on evidence of such cross-border spillovers. The migration crisis is a case in point: reducing the number of refugees arriving in developed countries requires addressing root causes such as conflict, climate change and poverty in countries of origin.

However, with less money in the system, existing resources would have to be used more effectively. As traditional donors such as the US, EU and the UK reduce their aid budgets, the funds that remain must be directed toward the most efficient programs and institutions. For example, we know that investment in vaccinations, maternal and child health, and early childhood care have some of the highest social returns. Similarly, relying on local capacity and partners is far more effective than foreign consultants and parallel delivery systems. Programs and organizations that do not meet a high bar for effectiveness and efficiency would have to consider downsizing, consolidating or winding down operations if they are no longer fit for purpose. While such changes are difficult, they are necessary to preserve the most valuable elements of the international aid architecture.

So, what would the future of aid look like? I believe that, moving forward, development would rest on four pillars: humanitarian assistance, global public goods, multilateral financing and bilateral aid for a smaller subset of countries, driven by a variety of motives.

The first pillar, humanitarian assistance, represents a growing share of global aid, accounting for roughly 10 percent of total flows — US$25 billion — in 2022. That same year, donor countries spent US$29 billion on housing and caring for refugees within their own borders. As humanitarian crises become increasingly frequent, and conflict and climate change displace even more people, those figures are almost certain to rise.

Yet the existing humanitarian system is chronically underfunded, overly complex and too reactive to meet the growing demands that are being made of it. Meaningful reforms are urgently needed to make the system more effective, efficient and focused on preventing humanitarian catastrophes rather than merely responding after they strike.

The second pillar, global public goods, includes climate mitigation and pandemic prevention. Addressing these challenges requires multilateral cooperation, and the benefits are widely shared so political leaders would be better positioned to justify such investments to their electorates. The Trump administration might remain skeptical of climate change and vaccines, but European and Asian donor countries would likely continue to support international efforts to address public health risks and global warming.

The third pillar of development is multilateral finance. Reduced aid is expected to constrain concessional lending by institutions such as the World Bank and regional development banks — which rely on grants to subsidize low interest loans — and their many donor-funded trust funds. However, multilateral development banks (MDBs) still have nearly US$2 trillion in total assets and the capacity to mobilize additional private sector resources. As donor countries cut their aid budgets, multilateral institutions must significantly boost lending and put their balance sheets to full use, as recommended by the G20's independent review of MDBs' capital-adequacy frameworks. Progress on debt relief would enable these institutions to lend even more to fill the financing gap left behind by aid donors.

The fourth pillar is what remains of bilateral aid, which would vary significantly across countries and focus on a narrower set of recipients. The deepest cuts are likely to affect efforts to fight poverty and to improve social outcomes, especially because donors might find it difficult to justify spending on public services abroad when their own systems are strained. Some donor countries would increasingly view aid as a way to stimulate economic growth, channeling resources to development-finance institutions that work with the private sector. Others might revive Cold War-era strategies, using aid to advance geopolitical and commercial interests, such as securing mining rights. These approaches proved largely ineffective in the past and are unlikely to succeed in advancing development in the future.

However, national interests and global development goals are not mutually exclusive — if done well. Bilateral aid can be used more strategically while supporting global stability, long-term growth and mutually beneficial outcomes.

FOREIGN AID'S CASE

The contours of this new development landscape, marked by declining aid flows, are still taking shape. However, I believe there remains a strong case for a progressive approach that emphasizes the mutual gains from development aid, even in the face of recent policy shifts.

One clear lesson from the dismantling of USAID — and before that, the 2020 merger of the UK's Department for International Development and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office — is that abrupt, in-year budget cuts are highly disruptive. They erode credibility and damage long-standing development partnerships. Responsible donors must establish a more orderly transition process, giving partners enough time to adjust.

At a time of diminishing aid budgets, it is more important than ever that resources are managed by people with significant technical expertise. In the US, the UK, Australia and Canada, development agencies have been folded into foreign ministries, resulting in a massive loss of technical capacity. As international cooperation becomes more politicized, the problems we face — whether it is regulating artificial intelligence, advancing the clean energy transition or reforming global financial systems — are also growing increasingly complex. Against this backdrop, “nerd-to-nerd” diplomacy can be highly effective and serve as a bridge to broader political dialogue, provided that deep expertise is retained.

Looking ahead, international cooperation would depend as much on knowledge-sharing as on financial support, particularly in middle-income countries. Many developing economies already have highly skilled civil servants with access to the same information as their developed-world counterparts. What is needed now are genuine partnerships focused on finding solutions to common challenges.

While development can continue with reduced international aid — albeit more slowly — real progress is impossible without collective effort. Even in a world increasingly shaped by “might makes right” tactics and negative-sum mindsets, we must continue to uphold and champion the positive-sum logic of international cooperation on trade, financial flows, security and climate change.

Emphasizing the mutual benefits of cooperation could help political leaders make the case for development assistance and pave the way for new kinds of partnerships with developing countries in a multipolar world. In today's interconnected global economy, no country can thrive in isolation. Despite the recent cuts to aid funding, working together to achieve development goals remains the only viable path to shared prosperity.

Both aphorisms apply to China, which has long been engaged in a multifront political, economic and informational war against the US and the rest of the West.

Taiwan would aim to create a “global democratic value chain,” seek to capitalize on its position within the first island chain and promote a “non-red supply chain,” Lin was quoted as saying in the ministry's written report to the Legislative Yuan submitted ahead of the legislature's Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee meeting slated for today.

The Ministry would also uphold a spirit of mutual beneficial collaboration, maintaining close communication and consultations with Washington to show that Taiwan-US cooperation could result in mutual gains, he said in the report.

“With the rise of trade protectionism and the increasingly evident trend toward deglobalization, the global economic outlook is at risk,” he said.

“Economic uncertainties in some countries are having ripple effects across the global economy, and the international system might become even more multipolar this year,” he added.

In response to the changing global landscape, the ministry would adopt innovative approaches to its international relations, and would continue practicing its policy of “comprehensive diplomacy,” Lin said, referring to a foreign-affairs strategy he introduced last year that emphasizes “values-based diplomacy,” “alliance-based diplomacy” and “economic and trade diplomacy.”

As part of that strategy, Taiwan assists countries with economic development through its Diplomatic Allies Prosperity Project.

“Through the export of smart solutions, Taiwan has stimulated the prosperous development of allies and bolstered democratic supply chains. That has consolidated diplomatic ties and is helping allies enjoy greater prosperity,” the ministry said in a news release on Dec. 30 last year.

Taiwan would also seek participation in regional economic integration mechanisms such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, promote strategic industry overseas deployment and solidify Taiwan's role in global supply chains, Lin said.

“Through a dual-axis transformation focusing on digital and net-zero technologies, the ministry would assist Taiwanese enterprises in ‘rooting in Taiwan, expanding globally,'” he said.

In related news, a cross-party delegation of US senators Pete Ricketts, Ted Budd and Chris Coons on Saturday concluded a visit to Taiwan.

The delegation met with President William Lai (賴清德), Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim (蕭美琴), National Security Council Secretary-General Joseph Wu (吳釗燮) and Lin, the American Institute in Taiwan said in a news release.

The visit provided an opportunity to exchange views with Taiwanese officials on key issues such as Taiwan-US relations, regional security, and trade and investment, it said.

The visit demonstrated the importance the US places on its partnership with Taiwan, and reaffirms the nations' shared dedication to ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific region, it said.

The US and Iran on Saturday made progress in a second round of high-stakes talks on Tehran's nuclear program and agreed to meet again next week, both sides said. 

The Oman-mediated talks in Rome lasted about four hours, Iranian state television and a senior US official said. 

Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Abbas Araghchi declared it a “good meeting” that yielded progress.

“This time we managed to reach a better understanding on a series of principles and goals,” he told Iranian state TV. 

The senior US official said in a statement: “Today, in Rome over four hours in our second round of talks, we made very good progress in our direct and indirect discussions.” 

Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said the parties “agreed to resume indirect talks at a technical level over the next few days and subsequently continue at the level of two senior negotiators next Saturday.” 

The US official confirmed another meeting next week, but did not specify which day or where. 

Oman said the third round would be in Muscat, returning to the site of the first talks a week ago. 

Those were the first discussions at such a high level between the foes since US President Donald Trump abandoned a landmark nuclear accord in 2018. 

Western countries including the US have long accused Iran of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons — an allegation Tehran has consistently denied, insisting that its program is for peaceful civilian purposes. 

After Saturday's talks, Omani Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Araghchi and US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff had agreed to keep negotiating. 

The talks “aim to seal a fair, enduring and binding deal which will ensure Iran [is] completely free of nuclear weapons and sanctions, and maintaining its ability to develop peaceful nuclear energy,” it said. 

Omani Minister of Foreign Affairs Badr bin Hamad al-Busaidi said the talks were “gaining momentum and now even the unlikely is possible.” 

Baqaei said the delegations had been “in two different rooms” at the Omani ambassador's residence, with al-Busaidi passing messages between them. 

Tehran and Washington have had no diplomatic relations since shortly after Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution. 

After returning to office in January, Trump revived his “maximum pressure” campaign of sanctions against Iran. 

In March he wrote to Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urging renewed nuclear talks while also warning of military action if diplomacy failed. 

“I'm not in a rush” to use the military option, Trump said on Thursday. “I think Iran wants to talk.”

With more than 90 percent of the votes counted, the National Election Council said Noboa had an unassailable 12-point lead over his leftist rival Luisa Gonzalez.
Official results showed Noboa with 56 percent of the vote, against Gonzalez's 44 percent — a far bigger winning margin than expected after a virtual tie in the first round.
Speaking to jubilant supporters in his hometown of Olon, the 37-year-old president claimed a “historic victory.”

Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said that he wants to make the ongoing Japan-U.S. tariff talks a model for negotiations between the U.S. and other countries, during a TV program on NHK on Sunday.

Ishiba said he believes that a desirable outcome for both their countries will be needed.

“A result in which one side gains while the other loses won't become a model for others,” he said.

Concerning Japan's safety standards for automobiles, which the U.S. is reportedly demanding that Japan deregulate, Ishiba said, “We'll discuss [the issue] in detail and avoid accusation of being unfair while acknowledging the differences [between Japanese and U.S. regulations].”

Asked about whether he intends to put security issues on the agenda, Ishiba said, “It's a topic from a different field than trade, so I don't think it's right to discuss [these issues together].”

Meanwhile, the prime minister indicated that he viewed positively the prospect of resuming government subsidies for electricity and gas bills and introducing measures to lower the price of gasoline.

“I'm keeping in mind the necessary measures and the right timing for them,” he said. “I want to do what I can to help reduce the burden on the Japanese people as much as possible.”

Ukraine's Foreign Ministry has called out Fox News for labeling Kyiv a ""Russian city"" during its news broadcast.

During its coverage of Easter services on April 20, Fox News aired footage of religious services from around the world, including the service Russian President Vladimir Putin attended in Moscow. 

Simultaneously, the right-wing news network broadcast live images from Easter religious services in Kyiv, misidentifying the Ukrainian capital as a Russian city. The error reportedly remained on screen for 20 minutes. 

""If this was a mistake rather than a deliberate political statement, there should be an apology and an investigation into who made the mistake,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, on April 20.

Although he didn't mention them by name, President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared to also criticize Fox News at the end of a statement on April 20 in which he reported multiple Russian ceasefire violations across the front line since an Easter ceasefire was declared. 

""Instead of broadcasting religious service from Moscow, the focus should be on pressuring Moscow to genuinely commit to a full ceasefire,"" Zelensky wrote.

Australia will continue to petition Russia for the release of Oscar Jenkins, an Australian citizen captured while fighting on the side of Ukraine, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on April 19.

""We'll continue to make representations to the reprehensible regime of (Russian President) Vladimir Putin on behalf of Mr Jenkins,"" Albanese told 9News.

""We will stand up and use whatever avenues we have at our disposal to continue to make those representations. The Russian war against the people of Ukraine is a war against international law, it's against international sovereignty.""

Jenkins disappeared on Dec. 16, 2024, during a combat operation near the village of Mykolaivka, in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk Oblast. At the time, he was deployed with the 402nd Separate Rifle Battalion, a unit within Ukraine's 66th Separate Mechanized Brigade.

In the weeks that followed, unconfirmed reports began to surface, alleging that he had been executed while in Russian captivity. The claims prompted Australian officials to seek clarification from Moscow regarding his status. 

On Feb. 8, a video uploaded to YouTube appeared to show Jenkins alive but visibly injured.

Vasyl Myroshnychenko, Ukraine's ambassador to Australia, has said that Jenkins should be treated as a prisoner of war just like Ukrainian citizens fighting for their country, and that he should be realeased in a prisoner exchange.

""(Jenkins) has an official contract with the Ukrainian armed forces, so he must be treated as a prisoner of war, but Russia does not really care about international law,"" Vasyl Myroshnychenko, Ukraine's ambassador to Australia, told Nine News.

The Geneva Conventions require all parties to armed conflict to treat prisoners of war with respect and dignity. However, Russia is reported to have executed a number of POWs.

Kyiv's repatriation efforts have predominantly centered on the return of Ukrainian soldiers, leaving foreign fighters who serve in Ukraine's military in a particularly vulnerable position should they be captured by Russian forces.

Belarusian soldier Vasyl Verameichyk, who had been fighting for Ukraine, was detained by Belarusian security services while on holiday in Vietnam. He is now reportedly being held in custody in Belarus. 

Fellow Belarusian volunteers have repeatedly appealed to Ukrainian authorities to press for his release, but there has been no indication of progress.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

The Trump administration opened an investigation into the entire pharmaceutical supply chain this week, a move that threatens to widen potential tariffs on prescription drugs. The U.S. Department of Commerce filed notice Monday that it would examine U.S. imports of pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients. The notice's inclusion of pharmaceutical ingredients means that the more than $7-billion worth of Canadian pharmaceutical exports to the U.S. could be hit by tariffs. Chris Hannay and Irene Galea report that generic companies are likely to be hit hard, and Canada is home to some major generic drugmakers, including Apotex and Pharmascience. Meanwhile, on the other hand, the White House and Florida's state government are promoting the importation of Canadian medication as a way to lower drug costs.

The Bank of Canada decided to hit pause on its almost year-long monetary policy-easing campaign this week, leaving its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2.75 per cent. This move follows seven consecutive cuts, as Mark Rendell reports, which have lowered mortgage rates and other Canadian borrowing costs considerably since last summer. Governor Tiff Macklem said the central bank decided to give itself time to assess the fallout from Trump's erratic and destabilizing trade war and it needs to “proceed carefully.” The Bank of Canada also decided to forgo its usual forecast in its quarterly Monetary Policy Report, but outlined two possible scenarios. The downside scenario sees Canada entering a recession this year and inflation rising above 3 per cent. Mr. Macklem also added that he and his team are “prepared to act decisively if incoming information points clearly in one direction.” The next rate decision is scheduled for June 4.

As Canadians continue to cancel trips to the United States, one of the big beneficiaries appears to be restaurants here at home. Jason Kirby reports that the number of reservations at Canadian restaurants has grown more than 20 per cent so far in April compared to last year. It seems that Canadian travellers are saving money from the boycott and choosing to spend more at local restaurants – a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy consumer economy. Take a closer look at the numbers in this week's Decoder series.

As Hudson's Bay Co. continues to liquidate its operation, many employees are raising the alarm about long-term disability payments. Susan Krashinsky Robertson reports that the payments, which are paid out of the company's cash and are uninsured, are leaving people at risk of losing their benefits. According to a law firm representing some employees, Hudson's Bay's benefit policy provides long-term disability payments through an “administrative services only” [ASO] arrangement, which is not insured – meaning, if the retailer is unable to come up with a plan to keep some of its stores afloat, or if a new owner steps in, those benefits could disappear. The retailer also announced it intends to auction off historically significant artifacts it still owns, including its 1670 charter that played a pivotal role in the history of Canada.

Many Canadian business owners across the country have been purchasing heaps of excess inventory from both the United States and elsewhere around the globe in preparation for U.S. tariffs on Canada, among other global trade partners, and for Canada's counterlevies. But with U.S. President Donald Trump regularly shifting course on tariffs – and Canada largely spared in the latest round of sweeping levies announced on April 2, which ranged from 10 to more than 100 per cent – the strategy involves significant risk. Mariya Postelnyak spoke to businesses that are in prepper mode, and how they've embraced stockpiling as a buffer against potential disruption in the trade of supplies and finished goods.



d. Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem. In an era dominated by U.S. President Donald Trump's capricious moods, even experts are in the dark. Mr. Macklem was frank about the overwhelming lack of visibility as he announced the Bank of Canada's decision to hold its policy rate steady at 2.75 per cent.

At least 56 people were killed in attacks in Nigeria's central Benue state, sharply revising a previous toll of 17.

The death toll in attacks in Benue state in central Nigeria has risen to 56. 

Benue state Governor Hyacinth Alia cited the figure Saturday while visiting two villages that were attacked by gunmen on Thursday night 17 April, 2025, into Friday.

Police had earlier said 17 people were killed.

The governor said there was the possibility of the figure increasing because the search was still ongoing. 

This is the latest flare-up of intercommunal violence to hit central Nigeria, known as the Middle Belt, in recent weeks.

In a separate incident earlier in the week, 11 people were killed by armed attackers in the Otukpo area of Benue. 

In nearby north central Plateau state, two attacks in under two weeks left more than 100 people dead. Homes were razed and looted, according to Amnesty International, and hundreds of people were displaced.

Governor Alia blamed the attacks in Benue State's Ukum and Logo local government areas on ""suspected herdsmen.""

Clashes between the nomadic cattle herders and settled farmers over land use have become increasingly common in central Nigeria.

The attacks often take on a religious dimension; farmers are often Christian and the herders mostly Muslim Fulani. 

Overgrazing, drought, and desertification, which are worsened by climate change, have made large areas of Nigeria's north unproductive.

This drives the herders to seek grazing lands in the country's more fertile south. 

The resulting land disputes often descend into deadly violence, especially in rural areas where law enforcement is largely absent.

Amnesty International has sharply criticized the Nigerian government of President Bola Tinubu for failing to stem the violence and leaving communities ""at the mercy of rampaging gunmen.""

As court disputes heat up over the Trump administration's deportations of alleged criminal migrants to El Salvador, legal experts tell DW what's at stake for both detainees and the rule of law.

Ever since Donald Trump took office in January, migrants entering the United States have increasingly feared the threat of deportation. Now this threat has taken on a new dimension: the possibility of ending up in a high-security prison in El Salvador.

Since March, Trump's government has deported a total of 271 Salvadoran and Venezuelan migrants from the US to the CECOT megaprison in El Salvador. Washington claims that the deportees belong to criminal organizations, but has provided no evidence.

Instead, relatives and human rights organizations warn that innocent people with no criminal records have been deported. The most symbolic case is that of the Salvadoran Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who Washington has acknowledged was deported because of a ""procedural error.""

US media reported that Abrego Garcia entered the country illegally in 2011 as a teenager fleeing gang violence. Although his asylum application was rejected in 2019, he was granted a work permit and protection from deportation due to the threat of persecution. Nevertheless, the 29-year-old father of three was arrested in mid-March and deported shortly afterwards.

Washington now claims that Abrego Garcia is a member of the notorious MS-13 gang. His lawyers deny this.

Both Trump and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele have refused to return Abrego Garcia to the US. Trump has also ignored a corresponding order from the US Supreme Court.

Instead, the US president is publicly toying with the idea of having US citizens imprisoned in CECOT.

CECOT, which translates as ""Center for the Containment of Terrorism,"" is the largest high-security prison in Latin America. It opened in January 2023 and has space for 40,000 inmates.

Ana Maria Mendez Dardon, director for Central America at the Washington Office on Latin America says that the identity and whereabouts of those deported from the US since March are currently unknown. It is therefore unclear whether they are actually being held in CECOT or in another Salvadoran prison.

""Without knowing their identity, it is difficult to verify whether they really have a criminal record. That's why eight US congressmen sent a letter to Secretary of State Rubio in the midst of this serious human rights crisis, asking him to inform Congress about the details of the agreement"" between the US and El Salvador, Dardon told DW.

""The agreement has not been made public, which is a serious violation of the principles of transparency and accountability,"" Irene Cuellar, researcher on Central America for Amnesty International, told DW. ""However, press reports indicate that the US is transferring $6 million to the Salvadoran government for one year for the detention of these people.""

She described what she called an ""enforced disappearance"" of the deportees because they have been granted neither contact with their families nor access to legal counsel.

In her opinion, the pact ""opens the door to normalizing institutional violence as an instrument of migration management and foreign policy."" Furthermore, ""it directly attacks the fundamental pillars of any democracy: The presumption of innocence, due process and the absolute prohibition of arbitrary detention.""

Deporting people from the US to then hold them in a Central American prison ""is completely illegal and unprecedented,"" said Salvadoran lawyer Leonor Arteaga Rubio, program director at the Due Process of Law Foundation.

""In a democracy, the court should order the immediate release of these people. But in El Salvador there is no independence of powers. The court does what Bukele wants,"" she said, adding that ""no democracy should support such a model, let alone emulate it.""

Still, Arteaga Rubio predicts that the agreement will hold. Both Trump and Bukele want to send the message ""that anyone who is considered an enemy of Trump can be sent to Bukele's prison, which functions like a black hole, a new Guantanamo from which there is no way out,"" she said. In El Salvador, no judge could put a stop to this, she added. ""The law in this prison is Bukele's, with Trump's full support.""

It remains uncertain how the legal tug-of-war over Kilmar Abrego Garcia will end. The Trump administration has refused to take steps to repatriate the Salvadoran and continues to accuse the 29-year-old of being a criminal gang member without providing any evidence.

""Why is the government of El Salvador continuing to imprison a man where they have no evidence that he's committed any crime and they have not been provided any evidence from the United States that he has committed any crime?"" Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen, who is from Abrego Garcia's home state of Maryland, asked reporters after a meeting with the prisoner in El Salvador.

With US media casting doubt on the alleged criminal past of other migrants who have been deported to CECOT, Van Hollen accused the Trump administration of lying, and criticized their disregard of judicial orders.

There is a risk that neither Salvadoran nor US courts will decide the fate of the deportees, which could depend instead on the ""political will"" of the authorities involved, said Roberto Lopez Salazar, coordinator of the Observatory of Human Rights at the Jose Simeon Canas Central American University in El Salvador. Lopez Salazar believes that international pressure is needed to ensure that the case does not remain in a state of legal limbo or end in impunity.

Irene Cuellar took her concerns a step further: ""As long as there are no real political or legal consequences, there is a growing risk that this model of migration control policy will be exported to other countries.""

Live Updates


            • Deportation battle: President Donald Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act has become a flashpoint in his immigration crackdown. A Supreme Court ruling yesterday temporarily blocked deportations under the sweeping 18th century wartime authority, drawing a swift response from the administration and a scathing dissent from conservative Justice Samuel Alito.
    


            • Nationwide protests: Dozens of protests were held at state capitols, courthouses and city halls in several states yesterday, with demonstrators condemning Trump's deportations, dismantling of federal agencies and threats to higher education.
    


            • Easter holiday: Vice President JD Vance briefly met Pope Francis to exchange Easter greetings today on the heels of the Pope's recent criticism over the administration's treatment of migrants. Meanwhile, preparations are underway for tomorrow's White House Easter Egg Roll, which will feature corporate sponsorships underscoring Big Tech's efforts to align with Trump.
    


            Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick says he discussed the peace agreement the US is trying to broker in Ukraine with President Volodymyr Zelensky during his recent trip to the country.
    


                    “We talked at length about a whole host of topics. We didn't leave really anything out of the discussion,” Fitzpatrick said on CBS' “Face the Nation” this morning.
                





            Fitzpatrick noted that Zelensky signed a memorandum of intent on a minerals deal, designed to increase US economic and security interests in Ukraine, while he was in the country. The Republican said his talks with the Ukrainian leader focused on security guarantees that Zelensky was “rightfully concerned” about.
    


            A now-infamous Oval Office blow-up broke out between Trump and Zelensky earlier this year as the president accused the Ukrainian leader of not being grateful for US assistance as the pair had been preparing to sign the minerals deal.
    


            The Pennsylvania Republican, who visited Kyiv even as his party remains split over continuing aid to Ukraine, said the likelihood of a ceasefire is “entirely up to” Russian President Vladimir Putin, and cast doubt on the Russian leader's trustworthiness in negotiations.
    


            Asked about Trump's warnings that he needs to see “enthusiasm” in order to continue facilitating peace talks to end the war, Fitzpatrick said, “I hope it's directed to Russia. I think it is directed to Russia.”
    


Meanwhile, in Ukraine: While Putin called for a brief Easter ceasefire this weekend, each side has accused the other of violating the truce, and the Russian president's motives for making the announcement have been sharply called into question in light of the Trump administration's latest comments.
    


            Pope Francis briefly met with Vice President JD Vance today before giving the traditional Easter blessing from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, which marked his highest-profile appearance yet since being discharged from hospital.
    


            The Pope had a brief private meeting with Vance, a devout Catholic, which “provided an opportunity to exchange Easter greetings,” according to the Vatican.
    


            The pope gifted the vice president a tie, rosaries and three chocolate Easter eggs for Vance's three children, video released by EWTN TV, a Catholic television network, showed.
    


            “So good to see you … You've not been feeling great, but it's good to see you in better health,” the vice president can be heard saying to the Pope during their meeting. “I pray for you every day.”
    


            A statement from the vice president's office later expressed gratitude “for the hospitality the Vatican has extended to his family.”
    


Recent tensions: Today's meeting followed discussions between the vice president and senior Vatican officials yesterday, during which an “exchange of opinions” took place concerning migrants, refugees and prisoners, according to a Vatican statement.
    


            The vice president's office described the meeting with Cardinal Pietro Parolin as having centered on “their shared religious faith, Catholicism in the United States, the plight of persecuted Christian communities around the world, and President Trump's commitment to restoring world peace.”
    


            Just before he was hospitalized in mid-February, Francis issued a rebuke of the Trump administration's immigration policy and refuted the vice president's use of a theological concept, the “ordo amoris” (“order of love” or “order of charity”), to defend the administration's approach.
    


            And after Catholic bishops criticized the Trump administration's actions earlier this year, Vance suggested they were motivated by their “bottom line,” as the Catholic Church receives government money to help resettle immigrants.
    


            Parolin told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica ahead of yesterday's talks with Vance that the Trump administration is “very different from what we are used to and, especially in the West, from what we have relied on for many years.”
    


This post has been updated with additional details on the meeting.



            Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said she believes courts should hold Trump administration officials in contempt if they defy orders, including in the case of a Salvadoran national who the administration said it mistakenly deported in March.
    


            US District Judge Paula Xinis ruled on April 4 that the US government had to “facilitate” Kilmar Abrego Garcia's return. The Supreme Court unanimously backed her ruling on April 10. But President Donald Trump and the Salvadoran government have said he will not be returned to the US.
    


            And Judge James Boasberg — who ruled last week that the Trump administration showed “willful disregard” for a mid-March order temporarily halting deportation flights — was the first judge to find “probable cause exists” to hold administration officials in criminal contempt.
    


            When asked by CNN's Dana Bash today if she believed the courts should “hold key administration officials in contempt if they continue to defy this the Supreme Court,” Klobuchar said “yes.”
    


            The Minnesota lawmaker accused the administration of selectively following the law to keep Abrego Garcia's case in the news.
    


                    “For the most cynical reasons, this is a case they've picked to not obey the law. Maybe one day they will all of a sudden, they'll just send him back, or maybe they'll be held in contempt,” she said. “But I think it's really important for people to realize they're following the law in other cases. They just decided not to follow the law with this guy.”
                





            Conservative Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito used a scathing weekend dissent to criticize his colleagues for a temporary order issued hours earlier that halted President Donald Trump from deporting a group of Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act.
    


                    “Literally in the middle of the night, the court is­sued unprecedented and legally questionable relief without giving the lower courts a chance to rule, without hearing from the opposing party, within eight hours of receiving the application, with dubious factual support for its order, and without providing any explanation for its order,” Alito wrote in a dissent that was joined by Justice Clarence Thomas.
                





            Alito and Thomas, who is also a member of the court's conservative wing, made note of their dissent initially with a single line in the early Saturday morning order from the high court, which temporarily blocked the administration from moving ahead with its controversial use of the sweeping 1798 wartime law to remove the Venezuelans, who are detained in Texas.
    


            In his full opinion, Alito wrote that the high court had acted “hastily and prematurely” to grant “unprecedented” emergency relief to the migrants.
    


What comes next: The writing from Alito is the latest development in a winding legal saga over Trump's use of the wartime authority.
    


            In asking the high court for emergency intervention, immigrant rights groups had said they were concerned the Venezuelans were in danger of being removed imminently. Trump is attempting to use the act to speed deportations and bypass the usual review processes.
    


            The Supreme Court is now expected to issue a more formal order in the coming days about whether to allow the administration to proceed.
    


            Interior Secretary Doug Burgum compared cuts at the Department of the Interior to “emptying out the barn and deciding what should go back in” as he defended the actions of the Department of Government Efficiency today.
    


            “And what should go back in is the stuff that actually serves the American people,” Burgum said on “Fox News Sunday.”
    


            Burgum was defending an order that he signed earlier this week announcing a sweeping effort aimed at “unifying and consolidating” many of his department's functions.
    


            The interior secretary was also asked about President Donald Trump's tariff policies, and specifically if he believes the White House can reach an agreement with China.
    


            He told Fox's Shannon Bream that he has a “lot of confidence” in the president's ability to negotiate deals.
    


            GOP Rep. Tom Emmer, the House majority whip, declined to say today whether he supports President Donald Trump's suggestion that US citizens convicted of crimes could be deported and imprisoned in El Salvador.
    


            Emmer told CNN's Dana Bash he's focused on “what's actually happening,” saying Trump is following through on his campaign promise of “deporting terrorists, cartel members, rapists, murderers — the worst of the worst.”
    


                    “That's why 77 million people, Dana, elected him to follow through on this promise, and that's what they're doing,” the third-highest ranking House Republican said on “State of the Union.”
                





            During an Oval Office meeting with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele on Monday, Trump raised the idea of sending “homegrown” criminals to El Salvador, home of a mega-prison that has raised human rights concerns. Experts have told CNN the president lacks the legal authority to deport US citizens.
    


            Pressed again by Bash on whether he would be OK with the Trump administration attempting such a move, Emmer deflected.
    


            “The issue that we're dealing with is we've got a president who wants to protect US citizens from violence, from crime, at having their children solicited and murdered etc, versus Democrats who seem to want to protect illegal aliens in this country for whatever reason,” the Minnesota lawmaker said
    


            Emmer also repeatedly defended the Trump administration's handling of the case of a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, again pointing to Trump's broader immigration campaign promises.
    


            President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown remains a focal point this week, including the case of a man wrongfully deported to El Salvador and the legal battle surrounding Trump's use of a controversial 18th century wartime authority to remove migrants from the country.
    


            If you're catching up this morning, we've collected some of the other major storylines to note.

            • Nationwide protests: ﻿Dozens of protests were held at state capitols, courthouses and city halls in several states yesterday, with demonstrators condemning Trump's deportations, dismantling of federal agencies and threats to higher education.
    


            • Harvard letter sent in error: Harvard University has been in an escalating battle with the Trump administration over a letter outlining a slew of demands tied to federal funding. But the letter should not have been sent and was “unauthorized,” The New York Times reported, citing two unnamed people familiar with the matter.
    


            • Ukraine war: Russian President Vladimir Putin called for a brief Easter ceasefire in his war with Ukraine, but each side has accused each other of violating the truce. Putin's motives for making the announcement have been sharply called into question, given the Trump administration's threat to abandon peace efforts if there aren't tangible signs of progress.
    


            • “Chaotic” tariff regime: For many small business owners, years of hard work has unraveled seemingly overnight due to Trump's whiplash trade policy, despite their companies representing exactly what an “America First” trade agenda seems intended to protect.
    


            • How Dems can counter Trump: Democrats face their toughest set of Senate races in decades, and their soul-searching over how to counter Trump and compete in 2026 is evident in the rush to recruit strong candidates.
    


            President Donald Trump posted an Easter message to his Truth Social site sending wishes to “all of the people who CHEATED in the 2020 Presidential Election,” among a wide swath of others.
    


            The message centered on “Radical Left Lunatics” and other perceived enemies, including former President Joe Biden.
    


            “To all of the people who CHEATED in the 2020 Presidential Election in order to get this highly destructive Moron Elected, I wish you, with great love, sincerity, and affection, a very Happy Easter!!!” the president wrote.
    


            Trump, who is at the White House this Easter Sunday, posted that message minutes after posting a message with a different tone.
    


            “Melania and I would like to wish everyone a very Happy Easter! Whether you are heading out to Church or, watching Service from home, may this day be full of Peace and Joy for all who celebrate the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. HE IS RISEN!!” the president wrote on Truth Social.
    


            Democratic Rep. Maxine Dexter of Oregon announced Friday that she plans to travel to El Salvador to demand the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia.
    


                    “A legal resident has had his due process rights ripped away and is now being held indefinitely in a foreign prison,” Dexter said in a statement. “This is not just one family's nightmare; it is a constitutional crisis that should outrage every single one of us.”
                





            Dexter said she will release details of her trip soon.
    


Remember: Abrego Garcia, a citizen of El Salvador who was living with his wife and children in Maryland, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers on March 12 and deported to his home country three days later, despite a court having previously ordered that he could not be sent to El Salvador due to risk for his safety.
    


            The Trump administration initially acknowledged Abrego Garcia was sent to the Central American country due to an “administrative error,” but has since dug in its heels in refusing to push for his return.
    


            The announcement comes on the heels of Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland traveling to El Salvador to meet with Abrego Garcia and push for his release. Van Hollen said the man was “traumatized” by his time in El Salvador's notorious CECOT maximum-security prison and was moved to a different facility.
    


            A national day of action against President Donald Trump and his administration united protesters across the country yesterday, who rallied against what organizers describe as a relentless assault on democratic institutions and civil liberties.
    


Over 80 protests were held at state capitols, courthouses and city halls in several states as part of the “50501” demonstrations — short for 50 protests, 50 states, one movement — condemning what they describe as Trump's executive overreach, including deportations without due process, the dismantling of federal agencies and threats to higher education.
    


            In addition to protests, yesterday's events saw organized food drives and donation campaigns, offering support to those most affected by the administration's policies.
    


                    “We are sending a clear and urgent message to the country and to those in power: the people are paying attention, we are organizing, and we will not accept authoritarian overreach, fascist policy, or the dismantling of our rights under the Constitution,” Sarah Parker, one of 50501's national coordinators, told CNN.
                





            “The administration's continued targeting of marginalized communities, the criminalization of dissent, and the erosion of civil liberties demand a response — and this is ours.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House for a comment.
    


            In Washington, DC, protesters assembled outside the White House and the residence of Vice President JD Vance, who is currently in Rome. Trump was at his golf club in Virginia.

            Tomorrow's White House Easter Egg Roll will feature high-dollar partnerships with YouTube, Meta and Amazon, among others, underscoring the close relationships the leaders of those tech companies have sought to cultivate with the Trump administration.
    


            The White House, through an outside production company called Harbinger, solicited corporate sponsors for the traditional springtime event on Monday ranging from $75,000 to $200,000, with the promise of logo and branding opportunities, according to a nine-page document sent to potential sponsors and first reported by CNN last month.
    


            Several major American tech companies and associations have signed up, according to an official White House press release on the event sent by the office of the first lady Friday.
    


            The Egg Roll has been privately funded without taxpayer dollars for many years. All money raised by Harbinger will go to the White House Historical Association.
    


            Tomorrow's planned activities include a “Reading Nook, courtesy of Amazon”; the “Bunny Hop Stage, courtesy of YouTube”; an “AI-Powered Experience and Photo Opportunity, courtesy of Meta”; and a “Ringing of the Bell Photo Opportunity, courtesy of the New York Stock Exchange.”
    


            Those sponsorships come as those Silicon Valley leaders, who donated to President Donald Trump's inaugural fund, have lost billions in value as markets — from the NYSE to others across the globe — have experienced volatility as a result of Trump's tariffs.
    


            US and Iranian delegations held a second round of high-level talks on Tehran's nuclear program yesterday, with each side expressing tempered optimism about a diplomatic way forward.
    


            Saturday's negotiations in Rome came a week after an initial round was held in the Omani capital Muscat. Oman once again acted as mediator between the US team — led by President Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff — and the Iranian one, led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.
    


What the Trump administration said: The Trump administration expressed optimism following the talks, pointing to “very good progress” and saying the sides agreed to meet again in the coming days. “Today, in Rome, over four hours in our second round of talks, we made very good progress in our direct and indirect discussions,” a senior administration official told CNN.
    


What Tehran said: Araghchi also signaled the talks had been positive, telling reporters: “I can say that there is movement forward. We've reached better understanding and agreement on some principles and goals in these Rome negotiations.” The third round of talks will be held this Saturday in Oman, according to Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson.
    


How we got here: The two countries have had decades of animosity and have long been in dispute about Iran's nuclear capabilities. 



            Trump has insisted on striking a new nuclear deal within a matter of weeks, and has even threatened to bomb Iran if it does not agree to a new pact. The administration has largely tempered that rhetoric since talks began.

Fox News correspondent Chanley Painter reports on growing concerns from lawmakers and travelers as the deadline to use Real ID-compliant licenses for air travel gets closer.

Americans are scrambling to obtain a state-issued REAL ID in order to travel by plane ahead of a federal deadline next month, which comes after states from coast to coast changed their laws surrounding driver's licenses to permit illegal immigrants to drive. 

Americans will need to obtain a REAL ID, which is a federally-compliant driver's license or other identification that meets higher standards than state-issued licenses, in order to easily travel by air, the Department of Homeland Security explains on its website. Only legal U.S. citizens or residents can obtain the identification card, while valid U.S. passports can also still be used instead of a REAL ID for domestic air travel. 

Congress passed the REAL ID Act in 2005 to heighten security requirements for driver's licenses in response to the attacks on 9/11. Though some states began complying with the law more than a decade ago, enforcement for all states had been repeatedly delayed due to the pandemic, DMV backlogs, as well as some states, such as South Carolina, initially refusing to comply. 

The move to officially enforce REAL IDs at the national level for domestic air travel comes after 19 states and Washington, D.C., put laws on the books allowing illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses.

The states, which stretch from New York and New Jersey to California and Washington state, changed their laws in order to allow illegal immigrants to drive freely to work, while also ensuring they meet driving skill requirements and could obtain car insurance to bolster road safety, various liberal lawmakers and immigrant advocacy groups said as they rallied support for the law changes.

""Expanding access to driver's licenses is critical for the safety of New Jerseyans and a step toward building a stronger and fairer New Jersey for all,"" New Jersey Democrat Gov. Phil Murphy, for example, said in 2019 after signing the Garden State's legislation allowing illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses.

 ""Allowing residents the opportunity to obtain driver's licenses regardless of their immigration status will decrease the number of uninsured drivers and increase safety on our roads. I thank my partners in the Legislature for sending this important bill to my desk,"" he added.

Just a few months after New Jersey's 2021 law change, the state issued 100,000 new permits, a 65% jump compared to the same three-month period in years prior, NJ Spotlight News reported at the time. 

BONDI ANNOUNCES NEW LAWSUITS AGAINST STATES ALLEGEDLY FAILING TO COMPLY WITH IMMIGRATION ACTIONS

New Jersey is among the states that have reported long wait times at DMVs as residents scramble to obtain a REAL ID to fly ahead of the May 7 deadline. 

The states that allow illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses include: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington. Washington state had a law on the books allowing illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses since 1993, National Conference of State Legislatures data show, while most states, such as Illinois and California, began changing their laws starting in 2012. 

In Massachusetts in 2022, Republican Gov. Charlie Baker vetoed legislation allowing illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses, citing that local DMVs did not have the ability to verify the validity of foreign documents and that it would overall weaken the validity of state driver's licenses.

""I cannot sign this legislation because it requires the Registry of Motor Vehicles to issue state credentials to people without the ability to verify their identity. The Registry does not have the expertise or ability to verify the validity of many types of documents from other countries,"" Baker said at the time. ""Consequently, a standard Massachusetts driver's license will no longer confirm that a person is who they say they are."" 

Massachusetts ultimately allowed illegal aliens to obtain driver's licenses through a ballot initiative. 

Domestic air travelers who are in the nation illegally are required to present a valid and up-to-date photo ID to board a flight, and can show documents such as a driver's license, a current foreign passport, a military ID or U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) Employment Authorization Card, and other forms of photo IDs, according to various immigrant advocacy groups. 

SANCTUARY STATE'S 'GREEN LIGHT' LAW IS RED FLAG FOR AMERICANS' SAFETY, NATIONAL SECURITY: EXPERTS

The Trump administration, which has been on an illegal immigration deportation blitz, revealed in a memo last week that the REAL ID requirement will further crack down on illegal aliens moving freely around the country.

A Department of Homeland Security memo exclusively obtained by Fox Digital last week outlined that part of the motivation for the Trump administration to enforce the REAL ID law is to prevent those in the country illegally from flying – unless they are looking to self-deport on an international flight.

""Under Biden, illegal aliens used non-compliant IDs from sanctuary cities to board flights, but REAL ID's higher security standards make it nearly impossible to forge legitimate documents, ensuring only verified travelers can fly,"" the memo states. 

""This closes the gaping vulnerabilities Biden's policies created, preventing criminals and potential terrorists from exploiting our aviation system, as seen during 9/11 when fraudulent IDs enabled attacks,"" the memo continues.

NEW JERSEY BILL TO LET ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS GET DRIVERS' LICENSES ADVANCES TO GOVERNOR'S DESK

The agency emphasized that the measure prevents people in the country illegally from traveling within the U.S.

""DHS and TSA are clear, the only place an illegal alien should be flying is home. Under Secretary Kristi Noem's leadership, illegal aliens will be barred from domestic flights, with one exception: illegal aliens self-deporting on international flights will be allowed to board without a REAL ID, encouraging their exit from the U.S.,"" it states.

While many conservatives backed the REAL ID Act, both in 2005 and now, some have said it bolsters the oversight ""Big Brother"" holds over the country.

""Evidently, existing ID requirements for American citizens just aren't adequate now, so Big Brother is forcing us through more hoops for the ‘right' to travel within our own country,"" former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin posted to X. 

""If you think REAL ID is about election integrity, you're going to be sorely disappointed. Someone has lied to you, or you're engaged in wishful thinking. Please don't shoot the messenger,"" Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., wrote on X last week. 

""REAL ID is a 2005 George Bush-era Patriot Act overreach that went completely unenforced until Trump got into office. Let me guess: he's playing 4D chess and I should just go along with it?"" Massie wrote in another post. 

TOP TRUMP AGENCY HYPES IMPORTANCE OF REAL ID ENFORCEMENT, CITING ONE KEY REASON

President Donald Trump, under his first administration, pushed back the REAL ID October 2020 deadline as the pandemic raged. The Biden administration's DHS established the May 7, 2025, deadline in 2022. 

Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, told Fox News Digital in a statement last week: ""REAL IDs make identification harder to forge, thwarting criminals and terrorists. 81% of air travelers hold REAL ID-compliant or acceptable IDs. DHS will continue to collaborate with state, local, and airport authorities to inform the public, facilitate compliance, curb wait times and prevent fraud.""

President Donald Trump is revealing his education playbook — and it's shaping up to be an unprecedented battle with America's schools.

Since taking office, Trump has been clear that he wants schools to align their political ideologies with his own. Days after his inauguration, he signed executive orders to remove ""woke"" ideology from classrooms and expand the use of school vouchers. Both of these orders directed the education secretary to prepare guidance but did not yet require schools to comply.

But now, dozens of investigations into both K-12 and higher education institutions are making those orders more real, with Trump stating that targeted schools can either accept his demands or lose their funding.

On the K-12 side, Trump's administration has sent letters to school districts that it said have violated Title IX — a federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in education — through policies intended to accomodate transgender students that the administration describes as ""requiring girls in the school to share their locker room with a boy,"" according to one letter.

On the higher education side, dozens of schools have received letters from the administration accusing them of violating the Civil Rights Act through DEI initiatives, like allowing scholarships and network opportunities for minority students.

Funding is on the line across the board, and while both Democratic and Republican administrations have launched civil rights investigations into the country's schools, R. Shep Melnick, a professor of American politics at Boston College, told Business Insider that Trump's actions are at a much larger scale.

""These types of gigantic threats are really quite new,"" Melnick said. ""We have no precedent for this, and I think it's well beyond anything in the words or the intention of a statute,"" he added.

The Department of Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BI. Craig Trainor, the department's acting assistant secretary for civil rights, wrote in a February 14 ""Dear Colleague"" letter that both K-12 and higher education institutions that incorporate DEI will be flagged for ""discriminatory practices"" subject to investigations and potential funding freezes.

""Institutions that fail to comply with federal civil rights law may, consistent with applicable law, face potential loss of federal funding,"" the letter said.

Trump's administration has so far launched dozens of investigations into school districts over DEI programming, transgender student policies, and antisemitism.

One of the most drastic escalations has taken shape in Maine. What started as a public dispute between Maine's governor and Trump over the state allowing transgender athletes to play in women's school sports has turned into a major threat from the administration to cut off all of the state's federal funding for its schools.

Trump's administration said that unless Maine complied with the executive order to restrict transgender students from women's sports, it would freeze the state's federal education funding. According to the Maine Principals' Association, there are only two transgender athletes competing in girls' high school sports statewide this year.

A federal court has already blocked the Trump administration from cutting school lunch funding over Maine's transgender policies. On Wednesday, Trump's Attorney General Pam Bondi announced a lawsuit against Maine to get the state to ""stop what they're doing.""

Maine's Gov. Janet Mills has vowed to continue fighting the administration.

""This matter has never been about school sports or the protection of women and girls, as has been claimed, it is about states rights and defending the rule of law against a federal government bent on imposing its will, instead of upholding the law,"" Mills said in a statement.

Other school districts have been subject to similar investigations. The Minnesota State High School League and the California Interscholastic Federation received letters from the Trump administration stating that they would be investigated for ""allowing male athletes to compete in women's sports and use women's intimate facilities.""

Similarly, the Oregon School Activities Association is under investigation over its policy that allows students to participate in sports or activities using their preferred gender identity while ""providing a fair and safe environment for all students.""

Melnick said that both former presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden made frequent use of investigations through the Department of Education to achieve their goals. For example, the Biden administration opened over 100 new investigations in its first few weeks into racial and gender discrimination, and it was something Republicans criticized at the time.

""What is remarkable is, despite all that Republicans have criticized, they have taken those initiatives and exploded them,"" Melnick said. ""I think this is all lawless.""

As for the ongoing investigations, Melnick said that it's not unusual for an administration to conduct compliance reviews, which ensure schools are complying with civil rights laws. What's unusual here is the nature and extent of Trump's investigations; while reviews can drag out for years, Trump's administration is acting quickly.

Higher education institutions have faced similar threats from the administration, with Trump freezing billions of dollars in federal funding at schools, including Harvard, for refusing to meet the administration's demands, one of which was conducting an ""audit"" of students and faculty to determine their ideological views.

Forty-five other colleges, including Arizona State University, the University of Utah, and the University of Rhode Island, are under investigation over accusations they violated the Civil Rights Act by partnering with ""The Ph.D Project,"" which provides networking and career opportunities for business students from underrepresented backgrounds.

""We encourage open debate on campuses and different points of view, that's what education is about,"" Education Secretary Linda McMahon said. ""But we're not going to have civil rights trampled on.""

Melnick said he expects the investigations to continue, and the question is how much schools choose to comply.

""My sense is that the amount of litigation is going to increase because I think that the administration is going to lose a lot of these court suits, and the more they lose, the more other schools will be encouraged to fight rather than to comply,"" Melnick said.

JPMorgan expects President Donald Trump's tariff blitz to yield ""some deals"" between the US and its trade partners, but says tax rates will still multiply in size.

In new research, the global investment strategy team at JPMorgan Wealth Management outlined its base case for Trump's tariffs. Under the scenario, the firm says the effective tax rate would be between 10% and 20%, up markedly from 2% at the start of the year.

This ""represents a meaningful increase in import duties but lands within Wall Street estimates pre-'Liberation Day,'"" the firm wrote.

Trump has touted the protectionist pivot as a forceful negotiating tactic to elicit better trade deals. By achieving some — and then reducing the tariff rates to that 10%-to-20% baseline — JPMorgan predicts that a US recession will be narrowly avoided.

The firm warns, however, that unemployment and inflation would still weigh on economic growth.

JPMorgan laid two main recommendations for qualifying investors looking to stay safe and perhaps even capitalize on a more volatile environment:

The firm says structured notes can simultaneously provide defensive exposure to stocks while delivering income through options premiums. This strategy generates income in a volatile environment, albeit at the expense of some upside.

JPMorgan says that volatility will give hedge funds more opportunities to ""exploit market mispricings and relative value plays across asset classes."" The firm also seems them offering diversification and hedged downside during declines.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I've visited 89 countries and hundreds of cities. My favorite place is an underrated European gem that outshines Paris and London.","https://www.businessinsider.com/ive-visited-hundreds-of-cities-salzburg-austria-is-the-best-2025-4","Sun, 20 Apr 2025 11:41:00 GMT","

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with John Lovell, 60, who has traveled to 89 countries and hundreds of cities in his lifetime. Lovell is the president of Travel Leaders Network, a company that sells luxury travel, cruises, and tours.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Over the years, I've visited 89 countries and lived in many cities. There isn't a single country I've visited that I did not like — but some I just happen to like more than others.

I've been to isolated places like Tahiti, home to some of the most beautiful beaches and incredible overwater bungalows. I've also been to smaller countries like the Vatican and traveled to South Africa, which has some of the world's best vineyards and game preserves.

I've also visited more popular and famous European cities like Paris and London, where I once lived. I love both cities, and if I had to choose my top five, they'd both be on there. However, if I could live anywhere full-time, it would be in Salzburg, Austria.

Salzburg is at the top of my list because it's smaller and more intimate. There are fewer tourists than in London or Paris, so it's easier to experience the city and its culture — plus, the people are incredibly welcoming.

Salzburg is located in Central Europe, right at the foothills of the Alps. The landscape is green and lush, and the scenery is truly stunning. The city is surrounded by lakes, with rivers flowing through its heart.

While the winters can be a bit cold for me, the overall climate is quite pleasant, similar to upstate New York, so fairly temperate for the most part.

Salzburg is rich in history, has wonderful museums, and is the birthplace of composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It's also known for its Gothic and baroque architecture and beautiful catholic churches.

Salzburg is also famous because parts of ""The Sound of Music"" were filmed there. In the 1965 film, the von Trapp family — based on a real Austrian musical family — escapes Nazi-occupied Austria. A popular scene in the film, where governess Maria and the children sing ""Do-Re-Me,"" was shot at Mirabell Gardens and the Pegasus Fountain.

The city isn't overly expensive, partly because it's a bit off the beaten path. Most hotels range from mid- to high-end, with prices typically between $100 and $400 per night. Visiting won't necessarily break the bank for many travelers.

Salzburg is also a well-known getaway spot if you're into skiing and similar winter activities. While there's no skiing right in the city, it's just a short trip into the mountains.

For the younger crowd, you'll find options if you're into nightclubs and dancing. There are also plenty of great restaurants. So, even though Salzburg isn't a massive metropolis, it still has plenty to offer.

Salzburg has many cultures. Many people speak English, German, and sometimes French.

I think it's a great place to get a true sense of European culture in a midsize town.

Of all European cities, I'd compare Salzburg to Prague or Edinburgh — but those cities don't have the sheer natural beauty of the mountains and rivers surrounding them.

The people of Salzburg truly embrace travelers. You can walk into a local pub, have some schnapps with them, and by the time you finish your drink, it feels like you've known them forever.

The first time I visited Salzburg, I met some people from Florida. One was an older, retired gentleman who owned a home in Austria. He invited me to visit him and his wife and stay at their house.

They introduced me to people in the local community, showed me around, took me to restaurants, and hosted me on a boat ride. I fell in love with the area and have returned to that city four times.

I've never had a bad interaction with anyone there. It's always been very positive — everyone is helpful and genuinely interested in you: where you're from, why you're visiting. It's such a nice feeling to be so welcomed, and that's why I keep returning.

Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen said Sunday that his trip to El Salvador to meet with Kilmar Abrego Garcia was about ""defending the rights of this man to due process,"" and not about ""defending the man.""

""The Trump administration has admitted in court that he was wrongfully detained and wrongfully deported,"" the Maryland senator said on ABC News' ""This Week.""

""My mission and my purpose is to make sure that we uphold the rule of law, because if we take it away from him, we do jeopardize it for everybody else,"" he added.

Van Hollen also warned on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" that denying ""the constitutional rights of this one man, ... threatens the constitutional rights of everybody in America.""

On NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" the senator said the Trump administration is ""flouting the courts as we speak.""

When asked whether the U.S. is in a constitutional crisis, the Maryland senator said: ""Yes, we are.""

Van Hollen's Sunday show media blitz comes after he traveled to El Salvador this week to meet with Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported from Maryland.

In recounting his meeting with Abrego Garcia, Van Hollen described him as having ""experienced trauma"" from his imprisonment.

""He told me about the trauma he had been experiencing, both in terms of the abduction and the fact that he was originally sent to CECOT, which is this notorious prison,"" Van Hollen said on ""This Week.""

Van Hollen's visit to El Salvador came after its President Nayib Bukele said during a White House visit earlier this month that he would not return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.

Hours later, the Trump administration told a federal judge that it lacked authority to compel El Salvador to return Abrego Garcia, despite a U.S. Supreme Court ruling saying that the administration should ""facilitate"" his return.

Bitcoin is now trading at a critical level, holding steady above the $81,000 support but still struggling to reclaim the $88,000 resistance. After weeks of volatility and macro-driven moves, BTC appears to be consolidating above key support levels, with bulls beginning to regain momentum. As financial markets adjust to a new wave of global uncertainty, the crypto market is finding short-term clarity, sparking renewed optimism among investors.

Tensions between the United States and China remain a dominant theme, continuing to weigh on broader financial sentiment. Tariff policies and diplomatic friction have led to cautious positioning across global markets. Despite this, Bitcoin's stability above the $81K zone is fueling speculation that a breakout may be near—especially as on-chain and futures metrics show strength building.

According to CryptoQuant data, the Bitcoin futures market is showing signs of bullish momentum. Open interest is rising in tandem with a sharp increase in the funding rate, indicating increased demand for long positions. Moreover, taker buy volume is also surging, indicating that aggressive buyers are beginning to step in. If this trend continues, Bitcoin could be poised for a significant move in the days ahead.

Bitcoin continues to consolidate within a narrowing range, caught between global economic uncertainty and renewed speculative interest. With price holding firm above the $82,000–$81,000 support zone but unable to reclaim the $86,000 level, the market remains undecided. The broader macroeconomic backdrop—especially escalating trade tensions between the US and China—is now a key driver of sentiment. As tariffs rise and diplomatic friction threatens to push the global economy into a recession, risk assets like Bitcoin are under pressure.

Despite weeks of selling and investor caution, Bitcoin has managed to avoid a breakdown, fueling speculation that the worst of the correction may be over. While many analysts have turned bearish after a year that was expected to be bullish, others are watching emerging data that suggests a possible shift in momentum.

CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler shared insights that the activity in the Bitcoin futures market is now leaning bullish. Open interest has risen significantly, signaling that traders are taking more directional bets. More notably, there's been a sharp uptick in the funding rate, pointing to a preference for long positions. In addition, taker buy orders have increased, suggesting that aggressive buyers are stepping in. If this trend continues, Bitcoin could be positioning for a breakout from its current consolidation phase.

Bitcoin is currently trading at $85,200, sitting right on the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and just below the 200-day Simple Moving Average (MA). This zone has become a pivotal battleground for bulls and bears as the market awaits a decisive move. To confirm a recovery rally and flip the broader trend bullish, BTC must reclaim the $90,000 level with strong momentum and volume.

Until then, consolidation remains the dominant scenario. The price has been ranging above the $81,000 support and below the $88,000 resistance for several days, with no clear breakout in sight. This tight corridor reflects market indecision and cautious optimism amid lingering macroeconomic uncertainty.

Traders are watching this zone closely. A strong push above the $88K–$90K resistance could open the door to fresh highs and renew bullish sentiment. However, failure to hold the current levels—especially if BTC breaks below $81K—could expose the market to further downside risk. For now, Bitcoin appears to be in a holding pattern, building strength for its next major move. Whether that move is upward or downward will likely depend on upcoming economic developments and global risk sentiment.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed replacing the current Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) contract language with the RISC-V instruction set architecture to improve the speed and efficiency of the Ethereum network's execution layer.

Buterin's April 20 proposal outlined several long-term bottlenecks for scaling the Ethereum network including, stable data availability sampling, ensuring block production remains competitive, and zero-knowledge EVM proving.

The Ethereum co-founder argued that implementing the RISC-V architecture in smart contracts would keep block production markets competitive and improve the efficiency of zero knowledge functions for the execution layer. Buterin wrote:

The proposal highlights the Ethereum network's struggle to improve throughput and remain competitive with next-generation monolithic blockchains such as Solana and the Sui networks at a time when investors are losing confidence in the original smart contract blockchain.

Ethereum's blob fees, transaction fees taken from Ethereum layer-2 scaling networks, dropped to a weekly low of 3.18 Ether (ETH) during the week of March 30, according to data from Etherscan.

Using current Ether prices, the 3.18 ETH collected for blob fees during the period equaled approximately $5,000.

In April 2025, Ethereum network fees dropped to their lowest levels since 2020, averaging around $0.16 per transaction.

According to Santiment marketing director Brian Quinlivan, the dramatic reduction in fees is due to fewer users sending transactions on the Ethereum base layer, opting instead to use smart contracts or one of Ethereum's many layer-2 scaling solutions.

Ethereum's layer-2 networks have been described as a double-edged sword that dramatically lowered transaction costs on the base layer but also cannibalized the Ethereum base layer's revenue.

Concerns surrounding revenue generation on the base layer and the corrosive effects of layer-2 scaling solutions on Ethereum's market share have driven the price of Ether to historic lows and could plunge Ether prices further to around $1,100 if investor confidence continues to wane.

The price action for XRP and bitcoin (BTC) resembles a tightly compressed spring on the verge of uncoiling with a sudden release of energy.

That's the message from a key volatility indicator called Bollinger Bandwidth. Bollinger Bands are volatility bands set at plus two and minus two standard deviations above and below the 20-period moving average (SMA) of an asset's market price. The bandwidth measures the space between these bands as a percentage of the 20-day moving average.



In the case of XRP, the Bollinger bandwidth has narrowed to its lowest level since October 2024 on the 4-hour chart, where each candle represents price action for a four-hour period. The 4-hour chart interval is quite popular in the 24/7 crypto market, allowing traders to analyze and predict short-term price movements. Bitcoin's 4-hour chart mirrors the Bollinger band width pattern in XRP.

The long-held belief is that a tighter Bollinger band width, reflecting a quiet period in the market, is akin to a compressed spring ready for significant movement. 

During these calm phases, the market accumulates energy that is eventually released once a clear direction is established, often leading to dramatic rallies or sharp price declines. Both XRP and bitcoin surged in November-December following an extended range-bound period that left their bandwidth at levels comparable to those observed today.

That said, tighter bands do not always indicate a bullish volatility explosion; they can also foreshadow a sell-off. For example, the bands tightened in October 2022, signaling a significant move ahead, which materialized on the downside after FTX went bust. 

It remains to be seen whether this latest spring compression will trigger bullish volatility or lead both tokens into a tailspin. The recent hawkish comments from Federal Reserve's Chairman Jerome Powell and selling by some whales favor the latter.

 Farmers are increasingly turning to stablecoins to facilitate cross-border payments, streamline operations, and gain access to global markets. 

Opinion by: Henry Duckworth, founder and CEO of AgriDex

We all need and buy it. Food is a common, universal ground across the planet. It should come as no surprise then that the agricultural industry is enormous. In 2023, the European Union alone imported 154 million tonnes of agricultural products and exported 134 million tonnes more. The market is growing too, projected to expand by 3.45% annually from this year to reach $5.52 trillion by 2029. 

Yet, farmers and agricultural traders are confronted with a serious problem. They need to export food abroad and interact with foreign currencies. The financial system — particularly in Africa — is, however, underdeveloped. Inefficiencies in their trade result in high transaction costs, delayed cross-border payments, and high interest rates for loans. Large corporations can better navigate financial hurdles, but this isn't always the case for small farmers, who suffer the most from outdated banking systems.

Blockchain technology and stablecoins promise to smooth unstable waters for agricultural traders. Eliminating intermediaries and providing financial inclusion, the technology gives farmers direct access to global markets. With Africa's food and agriculture market predicted to be valued at $1 trillion by 2030, stablecoins stand to be much more than simply another financial trend for the industry.

Cross-border payments are the beating heart of agricultural trade, central to accessing resources, such as equipment and seeds, or engaging in trade between countries. International transactions are vital to African agriculture, as exports within Africa represent only 17% of total African exports. 

Local banking systems are, however, underdeveloped and impede these payments to a shocking degree. A huge sticking point is that traditional banking systems are expensive — they charge farmers between 3% and 6% in fees. This is no small matter when profit margins are already thin.

In transactions, the demand for an intermediary currency, typically the US dollar, leads to even more exchange rate losses, often falling within the 3%-10% range. This affects small businesses in Africa, which can pay nearly 200% more than larger companies to clear their transactions through formal channels.

As if the expense wasn't bad enough, the process is also painfully slow. Farmers can expect to wait up to 120 days for payment settlements. These delays are devastating for businesses relying on quick access to funds. They are forced to take out high-interest loans with no immediate liquidity, further eroding their earnings.

Frustratingly outdated financial systems hamper the global agricultural industry, but a glimmer of hope is arriving in the form of stablecoins. Poised to reshape the agricultural trade, crypto offers farmers three key pillars of transformation.

Stablecoins mean farmers and traders can bypass banking inefficiencies. With intermediaries taken out of the picture, they can transact instantly and with lower costs. Farmers save between 3%-6% per payment, and funds are received in minutes rather than in painful waits of weeks or months. The result? These players have the working capital needed to stay in business.

Traders can forget about unstable local currencies. By pricing their goods in a stable digital asset, they can gain access to global markets. Fluctuating exchange rates will become a problem of the past. Businesses operating in countries with volatile currencies will feel that relief most acutely, as sudden devaluations in a currency have the power to wipe out profits overnight.

Recent: Web2 is failing vertical farms — they need DePIN to survive

The agricultural trade is crippled by immense, systemic fraud and supply chain inefficiencies, with global food fraud costing $40 billion annually and global trade in fake goods another staggering $500 billion. Stablecoins could be transformative in reducing the original movement of counterfeit goods across supply chains, making the industry far more efficient.

Results are already being seen in African agribusiness. Zimbabwe-based conglomerate Parrogate, for example, is committing to blockchain to streamline payments to its suppliers while improving cross-border trade efficiency. The company, which prides itself on growth and development across the continent, is just one of numerous African businesses getting behind stablecoins and reaping the benefits.

Stablecoins should be music to the ears of those working in agriculture. The road there could, however, be rocky. Significant regulatory uncertainty, especially in Africa, is one hurdle. Many nations have strict capital outflow controls, so farmers and traders must comply with local regulations or face legal issues.

Another limitation is technological barriers and an education gap across the industry, which prevent some farmers from fully grasping and using the technology. European farmers, who need stablecoins less because infrastructure is pretty well established, will also not have full access to these stable mechanisms for facilitating trade.

There are barriers, but the demand for stablecoins in African agriculture is undeniable. There is a strong willingness within the agricultural community to get on board with compliant stablecoins that support cross-border liquidity.

The mass adoption of stablecoins won't happen overnight, but that's not to say that this industry isn't progressing toward the digital. The offer of stablecoins is tantalizing — instant transactions, lower fees and enhanced financial access. It's only a matter of time before more farmers make the switch.

Agricultural traders struggling under the weight of an outdated and intrusive banking system are ready for greater financial inclusion. And we should be, too. This industry connects us all and will be lifted by stablecoins. The tech will be transformative for the field — not just as an innovation, but as an essential evolution.

Not as beefy as the last generation, but pricing remains key. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


AMD is reportedly preparing to debut its RDNA 4 workstation GPU offerings for desktops, presumably under the Radeon Pro W9000 family. As put forwaard by Hoang Anh Phu, who frequently obtains inside scoops, AMD is considering using the Navi 48 XTW die for its top-end SKUs, paired with 32GB of video memory, likely GDDR6. As always, this leak shouldn't be taken as definitive, but there's likely some truth to it given the proximity of Computex next month, followed by AMD's Advancing AI event in June.

Radeon PRO GPUs are aimed at workstation setups, rivaling Nvidia's (former) Quadro or (now incumbent) RTX PRO offerings for prosumers. These graphics cards bridge the gap between consumers and server domains, for applications like AI, HPC, DCC, CGI, CAD, VR/AR, and the list goes on.

It seems that AMD is sticking to more conservative figures for its flagship workstation offerings this generation. That's somewhat expected since Navi 48 (356mm2) is in the same ballpark as GB203 (378mm²), found in the RTX PRO 4500 Blackwell. Nvidia's top-end GB202 at 750mm2, is home to the RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell featuring a massive 96GB frame buffer.

Navi 48, with its 256-bit interface, enables either 16GB of memory (via eight 32-bit channels) or a theoretical maximum of 32GB in clamshell mode, which is the exact configuration being reported here.

4️⃣8️⃣XTWPRO32GBApril 20, 2025

Internally, AMD segments each die into XL, XT, and XTX counterparts; each reflecting the degree to which the die's hardware resources are enabled. Based on the available data, Navi 48 wields a total of 64 Compute Units (CUs), a configuration already present in the Radeon RX 9070 XT (Navi 48 XTX).

However, we cannot infer full-enablement just from shader counts, as AMD could still have other IP blocks disabled on the consumer RX 9070 XT, reserving the full-fat die (likely Navi 48 XTW) for its professional Radeon PRO counterpart(s). It stands to reason that there must be some discernible features between Navi 48 XTX and Navi 48 XTW to justify the different designations.

Despite the per-CU improvements with RDNA 4, this supposed Radeon PRO W9070 will likely be outpaced by the W7900 in memory-intensive tasks. Adding salt on this wound, RDNA 4 still remains unsupported by AMD's ROCm platform. Nonetheless, the leaker is suggesting a launch at an upcoming event in Taiwan, likely at Computex. Here's hoping we'll learn more about broader ROCm support either next month or at AMD's Advancing AI event in June.

In a transformative review, small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs) have emerged as pivotal regulators in the complex landscape of cardiovascular diseases. These RNA molecules, which do not encode proteins, were long overshadowed by their well-studied counterparts such as microRNAs. However, new insights highlight the substantial biological impact of lesser-known sncRNA subclasses including transfer RNA-derived fragments (tsRNAs), PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), Y RNAs (yRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs).

Each of these RNA types exhibits unique biological functions in modulating gene expression, cell signaling, and physiological homeostasis. Their roles in cardiovascular health are particularly significant as they engage in processes like inflammation, apoptosis, vascular remodeling, and cardiac hypertrophy. For example, tsRNAs influence myocardial cell survival and proliferation, regulate endothelial cell functions, and have been linked to disorders such as myocardial infarction, hypertension, and diabetic cardiomyopathy. They serve as critical responders to cellular stress, modulating gene transcription and mitochondrial pathways that can protect cardiac tissue.

Meanwhile, piRNAs have advanced from their original association with reproductive biology to being recognized as influential actors in cardiovascular systems. These molecules orchestrate cell apoptosis, manage oxidative stress, and mediate gene methylation, impacting disease processes like heart failure, aortic dissection, and pulmonary hypertension. Notably, specific piRNAs such as HAAPIR and CHAPIR are involved in promoting or mitigating cardiac damage through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms.

The regulatory potential of yRNAs lies in their interplay with immune responses and cell death pathways. They are enriched in extracellular vesicles, suggesting utility as biomarkers and therapeutic agents, particularly in conditions like coronary artery disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Equally compelling are the roles of snoRNAs and snRNAs, which modulate ribosomal function, RNA methylation, and mRNA splicing. Dysregulation of these molecules correlates with adverse cardiovascular events, from vascular remodeling to electrophysiological imbalances in myocardial tissue.

Collectively, these findings open new frontiers in cardiovascular medicine. The distinct expression patterns and mechanisms of sncRNAs underscore their diagnostic and therapeutic potential.

Lipid metabolism has emerged as a central player in the progression and therapy resistance of breast cancer, particularly the aggressive subtype known as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). This review article highlights how disruptions in lipid regulation can significantly influence the behavior of breast cancer cells, impacting their growth, metastasis, and response to treatment.

Alterations in the metabolism of fatty acids, cholesterol, sphingolipids, and glycolipids are profoundly intertwined with breast cancer cell survival and invasiveness. The uptake and biosynthesis of fatty acids are notably upregulated in tumor cells, which not only fuels cellular energy demands but also supports membrane synthesis and intracellular signaling. Key enzymes and transporters, such as CD36, FASN, and FABP4, are instrumental in facilitating this metabolic shift, thereby enhancing tumor proliferation and metastatic potential.

In cholesterol metabolism, the focus falls on how elevated cholesterol synthesis and its potent metabolite 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC) accelerate tumor progression and interfere with immune responses. Proteins such as SREBP2, NSDHL, and STARD4 further contribute to this dysregulation, reinforcing cancer cell survival and dissemination. The interplay of 27HC with estrogen receptors and immune-modulatory pathways further complicates therapeutic strategies, particularly in hormone-sensitive and resistant tumors.

The dual nature of sphingolipid metabolism, especially the contrasting roles of ceramide and its glycosylated derivatives, underscores a complex metabolic paradox. While ceramide accumulation exhibits tumor-suppressive effects, including enhanced apoptosis and chemotherapy sensitization, glycosylated forms such as Globo-H ceramide and GD2 are linked to tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, and cancer stem cell maintenance.

A crucial outcome of lipid reprogramming is its role in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process associated with enhanced migratory ability and drug resistance. Factors like ELOVL2, SGMS2, and CXCL8 modulate EMT through intricate signaling cascades, including TGF-β, PI3K/AKT, and SREBP1/2 axes.

Beyond intrinsic cancer cell metabolism, the surrounding tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) also adapts in response to lipid cues. M2 macrophages, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and CD8+ T cells exhibit lipid-driven phenotypic shifts that support tumor evasion and therapy failure.

Resistance to standard treatments—including chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, HER2-targeted therapy, and immune checkpoint inhibitors—is intimately linked to lipid metabolic rewiring. Upregulation of CD36, FASN, CPT1, and GPR120 exemplifies how tumor cells exploit lipid pathways to avoid apoptosis, reduce drug accumulation, and sustain stemness.

An injury-ravaged Man City side struggled to break down Everton, as the Merseyside outfit sat deep and escaped from the Joie Stadium with a point.

Man City went into the game knowing failure to win would effectively end their hopes of Champions League qualification. But that motivation did little to inspire, with a City side depleted by injury showing little quality and consistently looking out of ideas in attack.

A bright start left the home team 1-0 up after just 13 minutes, with Kerstin Casparij tapping in from close range after some sharp work from Brazil forward Kerolin on the right hand side, followed by a defensive mix-up in the Everton six-yard box.

Despite going behind, Everton repeatedly looked dangerous on the break, with Toni Payne leading the line admirably. Sure enough, the Toffees equalised just after the 30-minute mark, with Sara Holmgaard whipping in a great ball from the left wing to find her twin sister at the back post, who converted with a bullet header.

City lacked spark in the second half, and while Brazil forward Kerolin looked most likely to break the deadlock, in truth the home side never did enough to genuinely challenge Everton's backline.

Winger shines despite suffering a kicking as Leandro Trossard and Gabriel Martinelli see off 10-man Tractor Boys","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/arsenal-player-ratings-ipswich-town--bukayo-saka-leandro-trossard/blt52319835c82cbdcc","Sun, 20 Apr 2025 15:13:02 GMT","

The Gunners eased to victory at Portman Road to delay Liverpool's title coronation for at least a few more days

Leandro Trossard and Bukayo Saka were among the stars as Arsenal romped to a 4-0 win over 10-man Ipswich Town in Suffolk.

The Gunners dominated proceedings right from the off, and could have taken the lead in the sixth minute when Bukayo Saka squared the ball to Leandro Trossard after a neat one-two with Martin Odegaard, but the Belgian took a touch instead of shooting first time, and his close-range effort was then blocked.

Trossard made amends a few minutes later, though, with a Saka pass taking a touch off Odegaard before falling at the former Brighton man's feet, and he managed to steer home a low shot despite being closely marked by two Ipswich defenders in the box. Arsenal then almost made it two when Saka floated over a deep corner, but a flying Mikel Merino headed over from barely two yards out.

The visitors didn't have to wait long for another goal, though, as Gabriel Martinelli finished off a typically fluid move after more good work from Saka down the right, with Merino producing a classy flick to find the Brazilian.

Ipswich's task was then made even more difficult when Leif Davis was sent off for a horror tackle on Saka, who was able to play on despite feeling studs rake down on his Achilles. Merino sent Saka through on goal moments later, but the England international missed the chance to rub salt in Ipswich's wounds as he shot well wide of the far post.

Mikel Arteta's side continued to dominate at the start of the second half, with Odegaard going close to a third, while Ipswich created their first meaningful opening 55 minutes in, as George Hirst cut into the box from the right, but his strike just flew past the post.

Saka then went off, still feeling the effects of Davis' challenge, but the loss of their star winger didn't halt Arsenal's momentum. Trossard doubled his account in the 70th minute with another poacher's strike after being teed up by Declan Rice just outside the six-yard box to put the game beyond all doubt. There was still time for one more, too, as substitute Ethan Nwaneri marked an impressive cameo with a deflected goal to round off a comprehensive victory.

The result ensures that Arsenal delay Liverpool's title party for at least a few more days and put some distance between themselves and the rest of the top-four chasers.

It will be a showdown between the top two seeds when Alexander Zverev and Ben Shelton battle for the BMW Open title on Sunday afternoon.If it is anywhere close to as competitive as their only previous meeting, the Munich fans are in for a treat. Zverev and Shelton squared off last summer in the quarterfinals of the Cincinnati Masters, where the German survived a 3-6, 7-6(3), 7-5 thriller.Zverev needs some more success in the worst way right now. The world No. 3 was 6-7 in his last 13 matches heading into this week and had lost his opening match at two of his last three events. He is finally showing signs of life again, though, having advanced in Munich with wins over Alexandre Muller, Daniel Altmaier, Tallon Griekspoor, and Fabian Marozsan.

Both guys are without question on their second life this week. Before Zverev watched Griekspoor serve for a straight-set victory on Friday, Shelton saved three match points in the opening round against Borna Gojo. The 15th-ranked American has raised his level considerably since then, beating Botic van de Zandschulp and Luciano Darderi in straight sets in addition to a three-set defeat of Francisco Cerundolo.Whereas Shelton has played incredibly loose since escaping his first-round match, Zverev still looks tight–which is exactly what he was the last time he competed in an ATP final at home. In the 2024 Hamburg championship match (also on clay), he melted down in a third-set tiebreaker and fell to Arthur Fils.Even though clay obviously favors Zverev in this matchup, it should not be overlooked that Shelton already owns one clay-court title (Houston 2024). It would be no surprise if he capitalizes on a vulnerable opponent and wins a second.Pick: Shelton in 3    273WWW: Zverev vs. Shelton?

I'll be cheering for Ben, but my gut says Zv will get energized by the Home crowd and play really well…in 2.

How is Cerundolo feeling right now? Has to be the worst loss of his career. Such a great opportunity to win a title, too.

Cerundolo had a LOT of bad losses earlier in his career – ie before 2025

Im surprised you guys arent talking about it. Shouldve been an easy 2-0, instead, ends up losing to a non-clay courter that wasnt playing well at all. In that context, I'd rate that his worst performance ever!

yes Cerundolo should have won, but Shelton is dangerous on ANY surface

At 26, he needs to work out what his problem is and fast. Because there is really no excuse for his pattern of going missing in wonderland.

Holger Rune put an abrupt end to Carlos Alcaraz's nine-match winning streak on Sunday at the Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell, where the Dane captured his first title of the season.

The sixth seed prevailed 7-6(6), 6-2 in a high-octane final to earn his fifth ATP Tour trophy. Rune rallied from a break deficit in the opener and converted his fourth set point. He then soared clear in the second to deny Alcaraz, who took a medical timeout, a way back in. 

“It means the world, it was such a great match,” said Rune. “In the beginning, I was a little bit stressed, because Carlos obviously plays big-time tennis. I had to breathe a lot and find my rhythm. After he broke me, I got more into the match and played my tennis. The first set was a big battle, it was super important to win it and gain the momentum. I'm so proud of myself.”

THE GREAT DANE 🇩🇰@holgerrune2003 takes down Alcaraz 7-6(6) 6-2 to clinch his first ATP 500 crown! 👑@bcnopenbs | #BCNOpenBS pic.twitter.com/NRqBCwSXgD

Both players traded heavy blows from the baseline and mixed in variation to disrupt the rhythm, but it was Rune who held firm amid a lively atmosphere on Pista Rafa Nadal. He saved all four of the break points he faced in the second set, according to Infosys ATP Stats, while Alcaraz twice took treatment on his upper right leg.

Rune was forced to retire from his Monte-Carlo opener last week with food poisoning, but quickly adjusted to the Barcelona clay with a string of impressive performances. The 21-year-old dispatched defending champion Casper Ruud in the quarter-finals and delivered a statement performance over 18-time tour-level winner Alcaraz to earn his third title on the surface.

Just by reaching the final in Barcelona, Rune ensured he will return to the Top 10 in the PIF ATP Rankings on Monday, surging from No. 13 to No. 9. Alcaraz was aiming to hold his No. 2 spot by claiming a third title of the season (also Rotterdam, Monte-Carlo), but Alexander Zverev will return to that position after triumphing in Munich.



In the first tour-level final between two players aged 21-and-under since 2022, Rune flipped the script in a topsy-turvy opening set. After falling behind an early break, the Dane won eight consecutive points to swing the momentum firmly in his favour. Alcaraz saved two set points on serve at 4-5 — the second was with an expertly disguised drop shot — but ultimately surrendered the tie-break with his 10th forehand unforced error of the set.

“When I got broken in the first set, I thought to myself that I don't need to hit every shot on the line,” added Rune. “So I [asked] myself: ‘What did Novak do when he beat him?' I played it in my mind, the Olympics final, and tried to play that style, making a lot of balls. I'm very happy with how I stayed composed when it mattered, and I was really brave.”







Alcaraz took an off-court medical timeout after the third game of the second set, and was unable to tally any further games upon his return to court. The Spaniard appeared hampered and attempted to shorten the points, but couldn't contain his unforced error count, which rose to 33. With his one-hour, 41-minute victory, Rune levelled his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Alcaraz at 2-2.
“Congratulations Holger on an amazing week,” Alcaraz said to Rune during the trophy ceremony. “Coming from Monte-Carlo, [where] you had to retire. Coming here and showing a great effort to make the people enjoy watching tennis, I appreciate that. We've been seeing each other since [we were] 12 years old. Time flies. I'm really happy to see us in this position, how far we've [come]. Keep going.”

Holger Rune ended Carlos Alcaraz's nine-match clay-court winning streak in the final of the Barcelona Open on Sunday, defeating the Spaniard, 7-6 (6), 6-2, to capture the title at the ATP 500 event.It was the fifth ATP title of the 21-year-old Dane's career, and—perhaps surprisingly—his first ATP title in almost exactly two years, since winning on the clay of Munich on April 23rd, 2003.“Thanks to my mom, thanks to my team, thanks to everyone for being here. It's an amazing feeling,” he said at the trophy ceremony.“It's been a while, so thank you guys for being here.”Rune also had kind words for Alcaraz.“I want to say congrats to you, not just for this week, but for Monaco,” he told the Spaniard. “I watched you win, and you're doing something truly amazing for tennis, and sport as well.”Alcaraz had been on a nine-match winning streak on clay, capturing the sixth Masters 1000 title of his career in Monte Carlo last week, then storming into another final in Barcelona this week.And it looked like that run would continue against Rune on Sunday after Alcaraz got the first break of the match for a 3-2 lead in the first set, but the Dane broke right back for 3-all, eventually snuck out the first set in a tie-break, then won the last five games in a row from 1-2 in the second set to lift his first ATP trophy since he was a teenager.

In a tense extended battle for the win during Race 2 in Jeddah, it was Maya Weug who came out on top as Chloe Chambers was demoted to P2 due to a five-second penalty ahead of Mercedes' Doriane Pin.

Starting from pole position for the first time in the series, Chambers executed a near-perfect getaway, sailing away from a nail-biting fight for second between Pin and Weug.

Amid scorching track temperatures, the Ferrari driver appeared unstoppable as she closed the gap to the race leader, engaging in an exhilarating wheel-to-wheel battle for first place on track by Lap 3.

Weug momentarily came out on top, but it was far from over as she was forced off the track by Chambers and lost two positions, resulting in a five-second time penalty for the driver supported by Red Bull Ford.

The drama was not confined to the frontrunners as Rafaela Ferreira was handed a 10-second time penalty for spinning Kick Sauber's Emma Felbermayr on Lap 2, dropping both of them out of the points.

As Race 2 neared its conclusion, Chambers was able to maintain her lead ahead of Weug and Pin, who had repeatedly exchanged P2 throughout the race. With the knowledge of her penalty, Chambers pushed for the remaining laps and crossed the line just under 5.1s ahead of Pin to only lose one position.

Weug became the first Ferrari driver to win in Jeddah, simultaneously taking a narrow lead at the top of the F1 ACADEMY Standings.

Alisha Palmowski was fourth ahead of Alba Larsen, with Aston Martin's Tina Hausmann taking P6 at the chequered flag. Alpine driver Nina Gademan secured six points in P7 as Ella Lloyd was promoted to P8 following Ferreira's penalty. Joanna Ciconte and Chloe Chong rounded out the points finishers.

Red Bull Team Principal Christian Horner has refuted claims that Max Verstappen is looking to move away from the Formula 1 squad, insisting the four-time World Champion “has made it very clear that he's part of the team”.

Following a difficult Bahrain Grand Prix last weekend, where Verstappen could only salvage sixth after being off the pace all weekend, rumours circulated that the reigning World Champion was considering his options for the 2026 season.

This was fuelled by the energy drinks company's motorsport adviser Helmut Marko claiming he had ""great concern"" about the Dutchman's future with the team, which prompted speculation in the paddock ahead of the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix weekend.

This included suggestions that Verstappen could jump ship to Aston Martin, reuniting with former Red Bull designer Adrian Newey to reform their partnership.

Verstappen was back on top in Qualifying at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit

Asked about the speculation, Aston Martin Team Principal and CEO Andy Cowell brushed off any talk surrounding a potential move that would bring the Dutchman to the Silverstone-based squad.

Speaking ahead of qualifying, where Verstappen claimed a sensational pole position for Sunday's race, Red Bull boss Horner insisted that Verstappen was committed to the team and that the focus was on turning around the RB21's performance this season.

“Everybody is focused on the car moving forward,” said Horner, when asked on F1 TV.

“There's an awful lot of noise and that's really what it is, it's noise. Max is working super hard with the engineers, everybody is trying to find performance, of course there's always going to be speculation but we're very comfortable.”

Qualifying Highlights: 2025 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix

When asked to directly clarify Marko's comments, Horner added: “In the heat of a moment after the race there's always going to be an emotive reaction.

“I think Max has made it very clear that he's part of the team and we're all in it together, we all want to sort and get some performance back on the car, get into the position we were two weeks ago in Japan. We've just got to pick up a bit of momentum, we know we've got some issues, we're working very hard on them, hopefully we've got some solutions coming over the next few races.”

Verstappen currently sits eight points behind Drivers' Championship leader Lando Norris but has a golden opportunity to claw back that deficit in Sunday's race at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit after the McLaren driver crashed in Q3 and will start 10th.

Once described as a hard sell at the box office, Hollywood slowly warmed to 'The Studio'-esque insider stories. Yet the boss has remained an elusive, mainly tangential character.


							By 

	Thomas Doherty



	In Apple TV+'s The Studio, Seth Rogen plays Matt Remick, a studio boss just appointed to run the apparently fictional Continental Pictures. Fueled by hyperkinetic camerawork and dialogue that name-checks the celebrities who are not actually dragooned into making cameos, the series promises an under-the-hood look at the sputtering engine of the motion picture industry in the age of streaming. Judging by the first episodes, Matt is not, in the oft-quoted phrase of F. Scott Fitzgerald, among the select handful of man who have been able “to keep the whole equation of pictures in their heads.” In fact, he has trouble with the basic arithmetic.

	Hollywood cinema has ever been a medium of self-reflexivity, mining its own art and business for story material, so the latest depiction of above-the-line talent — oddly, there is a paucity of films about gaffers, best boys, or foley artists — is part of a venerable tradition.




	How venerable? In 1896, Thomas Edison, the original American motion picture producer, in all senses of the word, collaborated with the illustrator J. Stuart Blackton for a brief vignette entitled Blackton, the Evening World Cartoonist. The film shows Blackton sketching a portrait of Edison as filmed by the Edison Manufacturing Company. 


	Edison aside, the studio boss has mainly been a tangential character in the self-caressing film á clef genre (also known as “inside-Hollywood” or “Hollywood on Hollywood” films). It reserves most of the close ups for stars being born (or flaming out) and directors who serve as surrogates for the last name in the opening credits. Screenwriters, who were treated by the front office as the disposable help, got a measure of revenge by portraying their employers as idiots or vulgarians whose sole role in filmmaking was to write the checks and gum up the works. The producer in Sullivan's Travels (1941) wants the idealistic director to keep churning out variations on Ants in Your Pants of 1938, the producer in Sunset Blvd. (1950) recalls turning down Gone With the Wind (1939) because the public didn't like Civil War pictures, and the producer in Singin' in the Rain (1952) thinks The Jazz Singer (1927) is a passing fad.


	The first portals into the world behind the studio gates were fan magazines and gossip columns, but the movies themselves soon offered a crash course into the means of production. In 1915, Universal Pictures founder Carl Laemmle opened Universal City to tour groups and followed up with the two-reel comedy A Day at Universal City (1915). Billed as “a surprisingly funny sketch of life in a motion picture studio,” it showed producer-director Al Christie supervising the scenario department, filming, editing, lab work, and screenings.   

	











	By the 1920s, moviegoers had already become well-schooled in how the sausage got made on the factory floor. In King Vidor's Show People (1928), the delightful Marion Davies sends up Hollywood — and her own persona — with the assurance that audiences understood the no-longer-inside jokes, spotted the cameos, and laughed at how the feckless leading man takes credit for the exploits of his stunt double. Of course, Davies had a studio boss in her pocket, media mogul and Cosmopolitan Pictures producer William Randolph Hearst, for whom she was much more than a side chick. The best cameo in the film is Davies's own: when the character spots Marion Davies on the lot, she crunches up her face as if to say, “she's not so hot.”


	The studio boss is the featured player in a forgotten obscurity by director Mark Sandrich, The Talk of Hollywood (1929), an early talkie shot with the camera bolted to the floor. Nat Carr, a comedian who was a mainstay of Hebrew-Hibernian shtick in films such as Koster Kitty Kelly (1926) and Private Izzy Murphy (1926), plays the shtetl-bred J. Pierpoint Ginsberg, a silent film producer who must make the transition into the talkies. Problems does he have? Don't ask. “I asked you for a chorus of sixty,” he kvetches to his casting director. “I didn't mean that's how old they should be!”  


	The ethnic stereotype was dialed back in George Cukor's What Price Hollywood? (1932), produced by David O. Selznick, who should know. The backstage, rather soundstage, melodrama was not so much an exposé of the town under the real estate sign but a review session of lessons already learned. Star Constance Bennett plays a starstruck waitress at the Brown Derby who moons over Gable and imitates Garbo before finding herself on the cover of the fan mags she lives by. Her narrative arc from bit player to name in lights coincides with a deep dive into Hollywood's star making machinery: ad-pub boys, gossip columnists, proto-paparazzi, and gala premieres. Russian-born Gregory Ratoff plays Bennett's kind-hearted, Yiddish-accented studio chief, a type who, said Variety at the time, “is closer to some film producers in his portrayal than the average audience will realize.” 

	











	In 1941, two novels by two Hollywood screenwriters placed the producer front and center in the Hollywood story: the unfinished, posthumously published The Last Tycoon by F. Scott Fitzgerald and What Makes Sammy Run by Budd Schulberg.  As the son of B. P. Schulberg, the longtime head of production at Paramount Pictures, Schulberg boasted impeccable inside dopester credentials. The anti-hero of his book is Sammy Glick, a venal go-getter who leapfrogs from copy boy to agent to producer by stealing credit and backstabbing friends.  “Such things ARE in Hollywood and Budd reports them with fine detachment,” wrote Fitzgerald, generously praising the competition in a letter to Bennett Cerf, Schulberg's editor at Random House.


	Everyone in Hollywood figured Glick was based on the outsized personality and (allegedly) unscrupulous behavior of screenwriter turned producer Jerry Wald.  Not that Wald was the only candidate whose mercenary modus operandi fit the character. At The Hollywood Reporter, Irving Hoffman pointed out that “it is not entirely fair to identify Sammy with Jerry to the exclusion of at least half a dozen other possibilities.” Schulberg always said Sammy was a composite, which didn't stop producers he had never met from glaring at him in restaurants.


	The hero — not antihero — of The Last Tycoon is Monroe Stahr, a thinly disguised stand-in for MGM's Irving Thalberg, the “boy genius” who was running Universal Studios at age 20, when he was still too young to sign the company's payroll checks. Hired away by Louis B. Mayer for MGM, he became the presiding genius of “the genius of the system,” the name the French gave to the assembly-line quality control maintained by the Hollywood studios. In 1936, when he died suddenly at the age of 36, the industry-wide shock was seismic. “Hollywood in Gloom,” headlined the Reporter. “Death of Thalberg Sinks Industry; All Mourn Passing of Great Producer.” 

	











	It was Thalberg who inspired Fitzgerald's “whole equation” panegyric and planted the seed for The Last Tycoon.  In 1939, writing to an editor at Collier's, Fitzgerald confided that Stahr “is Irving Thalberg — and this is my great secret.” The secret seems to have been well kept for neither the trade reviews nor Edmund Wilson in his introduction to The Last Tycoon mentions the obvious model. Tellingly, at the time, no Hollywood studio green lighted either What Makes Sammy Run? or The Last Tycoon for feature film treatment.  It was left to the emergent rival medium to adapt both books in 1949 for live performances on NBC's Philco Television Playhouse.


	The threat from television was probably behind the surge of Hollywood-minded films in the postwar era, as if the motion picture industry wanted to remind the public that the real glamour and art was still up on the big screen in films such as Sunset Blvd., Singin' in the Rain, The Star (1952), A Star Is Born (1954), and The Big Knife (1955) “Producers used to think that a film with a Hollywood background meant a kiss of death,” wrote gossip columnist Hedda Hopper, noting the vibe shift. Traditionally too, the old guard had been wary of airing its dirty linen at the corner Bijou. After a screening of Sunset Blvd, on the Paramount lot, MGM chief Louis B. Mayer confronted Billy Wilder. “You bastard,” he shouted. “You should be tarred and feathered and run out of Hollywood!”

	











	Actually, it was Mayer who was run out of Hollywood in 1951, ousted for younger blood, his right-hand man Dore Schary, the personification of a new generation of more urbane and erudite studio bosses. Under Schary, MGM released what may be the best of the producer-centered dissections of Hollywood life, The Bad and the Beautiful (1952), a whiplash smart corporate melodrama directed by Vincente Minnelli and written by Charles Schnee and George Bradshaw. Told in flashback, the film traces the progress of producer Jonathan Shields (Kirk Douglas) from B-movie dreck to A-list Oscar winners to box office flops. Desperate for a fresh start, he calls together three former collaborators, all of whom he has mentored and betrayed: a director (Barry Sullivan), a star (Lana Turner), and a screenwriter (Dick Powell). “Some of the best movies are made by people working together who hate each other's guts,” he figures.  Douglas — never better than when he was playing a heel (see also Champion [1949] and Ace in the Hole [1951]) — has a terrific time as the conniving, charismatic SOB with the scruples of Sammy Glick and the talent of Irving Thalberg. After a preview screening, Lana Turner sent Douglas a telegram he must have treasured: “I Wasn't Bad and You Were Beautiful.”


	Naturally, “the town is buzzing over the identity of the producer in Metro's The Bad and the Beautiful,” whispered gossip columnist Sheila Graham, who didn't name her suspect. I always figured Shields was based on Twentieth Century-Fox's ruthless and brilliant Darryl F. Zanuck, but the actual producer of the film — John Houseman — revealed in his memoir Front and Center, published in 1979, that “there is no question that substantial elements of David O. Selznick's personality are to be found in our hero-villain Jonathan Shields.” He also said Selznick hired a lawyer look at the film to see if there was anything actionable. There wasn't. 

	











	In tune with the times, the 1960s nurtured a raw and cynical perspective on Hollywood that made Sunset Blvd. look like a valentine. Richard Rouse's hate letter The Oscar (1966), which was nominated for none, stars Stephen Boyd as a Sammy Glick-ish actor who uses and abuses cast, crew, agent, and girlfriends.  New York Times critic Bosley Crowther panned it as “another distressing example of Hollywood befouling its own nest,” but producer Rouse defended his cutthroat take on the business, claiming that at screenings in Los Angeles “the Hollywood people in the audience gave an almost audible gasp at the truth of what they were seeing.” Maybe not coincidentally, the nicest guy in the vipers' nest is the producer played by Joseph Cotton.  No wonder the actresses in Valley of the Dolls (1967) zone out on drugs.  


	In the 1970s, the most memorable portrait of a producer is the mogul played by John Marley in The Godfather (1972) who wakes up next to horse's head by way of incentive to reconsider a casting decision. However, the decade also witnessed, finally, a screen version of The Last Tycoon, produced by Sam Spiegel (who also fit the title), directed by Elia Kazan, written by Harold Pinter, and starring a sleek Robert De Niro as Stahr.  


	Drunken screenwriters, actors struggling with erectile dysfunction, earthquakes on the backlot — it's all in a day's work for Stahr. Watching a slate of dailies, he makes snap decisions on which take to print and which scene to delete. Before getting sunk by a turgid love story — the kind of cinematic dead zone Thalberg would have blue-penciled in the screenplay stage — The Last Tycoon provides a good sense of what a producer actually does. In THR, Ron Pennington described Stahr as “an Irving Thalberg-type producer who never took screen credit but who was truly an artist in that he had the ability to create by effectively combining the various talents of other artists,” which is as good a definition of the producer-as-auteur as Fitzgerald's “the whole equation.” (Film critic Kenneth Turan nicked the phrase for his splendid dual biography, Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg: The Whole Equation, published earlier this year.)

	











	As the last century came to a close, studio bosses and aspiring studio bosses alike were often portrayed as ready to kill for a bankable film project. In writer-producer Michael Tolkin and Robert Altman's The Player (1992), studio executive Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins) takes time out from the joys of ordering “off the menu” at four-star restaurants to murder a screenwriter to secure a desirable property. In Get Shorty (1995), all the gangsters want to make a lateral career move into film production by packaging a sure-fire project. The winner of the Hollywood sweepstakes is film buff and loan shark muscle Chili Palmer (John Travolta), who knows the difference between Rio Bravo (1959) and El Dorado (1966).


	If any film can bring the studio boss cycle full circle, it is Nanette Burstein and Brett Morgan's bio-doc The Kid Stays in the Picture (2002). Based on Robert Evans' 1994 memoir and narrated by the man himself, the film tells of the last, so far, of the old school, hands-on Hollywood producers, who oversaw the second golden age of Paramount Pictures from 1967 and 1974. The first act includes a Hollywood original story so unlikely that no screenwriter would dare pitch it to a producer. While sunbathing at the Beverly Hills Hotel, the actress Norma Shearer noticed an attractive young man at poolside talking on a telephone.  His intense energy reminded her of her late husband — Irving Thalberg. She insisted Evans be cast as Thalberg in the Lon Chaney biopic Man of a Thousand Faces (1957). Not a star but a producer was born.

Delroy Lindo opened up about Marvel‘s long-delayed Blade reboot starring Mahershala Ali, which he describes as having “just went off the rails.”


	Speaking to Entertainment Weekly to promote Ryan Coogler's lauded Sinners, the veteran actor commented on the reported creative differences that have plagued the remake, about the Wesley Snipes-originated Daywalker vampire slayer from Marvel's comics. 


	“When Marvel came to me, they seemed to be really interested in my input,” the Da 5 Bloods star said. “And in the various conversations I had with producers, the writer, the director at the time, it was all leading into being very inclusive. It was really exciting conceptually, but it was also exciting in terms of the character that was going to form. And then, for whatever reason, it just went off the rails.”

	Having since exited the project, Lindo — who boarded the film in 2021 — said he was supposed to portray a “Marcus Garvey-esque” type persona.

	“I'm not saying that it would've been an out-and-out Garvey-ite. Not that, but just in terms of how this man's philosophy, his ethos and what was driving him. He was a character who had, very similar to Sinners, created a community, a Black community. He was a character who was the head of this community,” he explained.


	Late last year, Marvel unsurprisingly pulled Blade from its 2025 release calendar. Originally announced back in 2019, the movie was naturally delayed by the pandemic and dual industry strikes. Since then, it's also seen a number of exits, including from initially tapped directors Bassam Tariq (Mogul Mowgli) and Yann Demange (Lovecraft Country).


	Meanwhile, Marvel top brass Kevin Feige said he remains “committed” to the two-time Oscar winner Ali's take on the character, adding that everyone is “up to date on what's going on. But I can tell you that the character will be coming to the MCU.” At the same time, Snipes reprised Blade in a cameo role for Marvel Studios' Deadpool & Wolverine.

	Warner Bros' Sinners is in rare air becoming the first horror movie ever to earn an A CinemaScore from audiences in the exit poll org's 47-year existence. 


	Typically, CinemaScore audiences are hard on horror film: If you get anything in the B-range, that's amazing (the first A Quiet Place earned a B+). If you're a C, you're even safe. Outside of that the anomaly A- grades went to Five Nights at Freddies, Get Out, The Lost Boys, The Conjuring, The Conjuring 2, A Quiet Place Part II, Child's Play 2. However, no other film but Ryan Coogler's Sinners has notched an A.

Sinners went into overdrive. Tracking in recent weeks was spotting in the mid $30Ms for the $90M+ Michael B. Jordan starring movie. Then projections went into overdrive indicating $40M+. This is all due to exhibition pushing the movie out to moviegoers after a dry spell at the box office in Q1 and Warner Bros. pushing digital ads in specific zip codes to spike ticket sales; a final marketing lap that they've executed on movies such as A Minecraft Movie, The Meg, and Crazy Rich Asians to name a few to deliver at the weekend box office. On Friday and Saturday AM, many saw Sinners at No. 2. It's the clear No. 1 movie over the Easter weekend with $45.6M; don't be surprised if it's well north of $46M tomorrow.

Rory McIlroy's victory at the Masters was a career-defining moment. After 17 Masters starts and 11 years of trying to complete a career Grand Slam, he finally got his green jacket. But as he embraced his wife, Erica Stoll, on the Augusta fairways, her response to his affection raised some eyebrows. Why did Stoll seem “subdued” as her husband made golf history?

In May 2024, McIlroy served Stoll with divorce papers after seven years of marriage. According to documents obtained by Page Six, the 35-year-old golfer claimed in the filing that the marriage was “irretrievably broken.”

His rep made it clear that McIlroy didn't want to make any further comments about the split in order to keep things “as respectful and amicable as possible.” At the same time, rumors started to swirl that McIlroy had already moved on and was romantically involved with CBS sports reporter Amanda Balionis.

It was confirmed that the 29-time PGA Tour winner submitted a notice of voluntary dismissal to a court where McIlroy and Stoll live in Palm Beach County, Florida, along with their four-year-old daughter, Poppy. But then, just one month later, he called off the divorce.

A post shared by The Masters (@themasters)

Despite the difficult past year, Stoll was by McIlroy's side after his big win, offering support. The couple shared a sweet moment with a hug. During his victory speech, McIlroy praised his wife and daughter, whom he referred to as his “team.”

“They've been on this journey with me the whole way through. They know the burden that I've carried to be able to come here every year and try and try and try again,” the Northern Ireland golfer said.

But his excitement for the historic moment was contrasted by Stoll's “subdued” reaction. Body language expert Judi James analyzed the scene and explained to The Daily Mail that Stoll was “more polite and tempered” as she hugged her man and shed some tears.

“Erica uses back pats, which are firstly a gesture of gentle affection but which also usually signal a desire to break from an embrace, while Rory appears much more clingy,” James noted. 

“Rory looks overwhelmed and clingy, while Erica's response appears a little more polite, subdued, and tempered.”

A post shared by Amanda Balionis (@balionis)

So, why was Stoll so subdued after McIlroy's win? It's possible that Stoll isn't quite over the brief split in her marriage. Especially since the woman that McIlroy supposedly dated during the separation interviewed him this past week at Augusta, and posted about the win on social media.

Balionis posted a photo of their sit-down on Instagram and wrote in the caption, “It took 17 Masters starts, 11 years of attempting to complete the career Grand Slam and 73 this week but Rory McIlroy has his Green Jacket and has solidified his legacy alongside Tiger, Jack, Gary, Hogan and Sarazen. What a week and a battle down to the very end.”

Fans immediately rushed to the comment section to point out how “awkward” and “wrong” this whole situation was. McIlroy himself even made a statement about his marriage troubles before the tournament began.

“There have been rumors about my personal life recently, which is unfortunate. Responding to each rumor is a fool's game,” the athlete told the Guardian.“Over the past weeks, Erica and I have realized that our best future was as a family together. Thankfully, we have resolved our differences and look forward to a new beginning.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Holly Robinson Peete Speaks Out For Families Impacted by Autism Amid New Controversy","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/holly-robinson-peete-autism-controversy-cnn/","Sun, 20 Apr 2025 15:37:44 GMT","

Longtime Hallmark star and autism rights advocate Holly Robinson Peete is speaking up after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sparked controversy on April 16, 2025, with his remarks about kids on the autism spectrum. Two nights later, during an Instagram Live session viewed by EntertainmentNOW, Robinson Peete said “autism is not political” and that she advocates for families with kids on the autism spectrum, regardless of where they stand on the political spectrum. 

Speaking at a news conference about the rising rate of autism diagnoses in the U.S., Kennedy made multiple points that drew “fierce backlash” from the autism community, per People, including claiming that kids with autism “will never pay taxes” and that “autism destroys families.”

Robinson Peete, one of Hollywood's most vocal advocates for families impacted by autism, immediately took issue with Kennedy's comments, refuting many of his points on social media. The actress has four kids with her husband, former NFL quarterback Rodney Peete, including their 27-year-old son RJ, who is on the autism spectrum and works as a beloved clubhouse attendant for the Los Angeles Dodgers. 

After appearing on CNN on April 18 to discuss Kennedy's claims and share her experience raising a son with autism, Robinson Peete wrote on Instagram, “I am just one autism mom and I don't claim to speak for all of us as we all have different journeys but what I do know for sure is NO ONE is allowed to dictate your child's future and steal hope from you!”

A post shared by Holly Robinson Peete (@hollyrpeete)

During his first press conference since being confirmed in February as President Donald Trump's new HHS Secretary, Kennedy highlighted a new CDC study that says 3% of children in the U.S. have been diagnosed with autism, per People. Calling it an “epidemic,” Kennedy vowed to find the “environmental causes” for “relentless increases” of autism cases. 

In her interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on April 18, Robinson Peete said she has no problem with research that might help pinpoint factors contributing to autism, but took issue with many of Kennedy's comments — including calling the brain disorder a “preventable disease” and listing out things he thought kids on the spectrum would never achieve. 

“Autism destroys families, and more importantly, it destroys our greatest resource, which is our children,” Kennedy said during his press conference. “These are children who should not be suffering like this. These are kids who will never pay taxes. They'll never hold a job. They'll never play baseball. They'll never write a poem. They'll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.” 

In response, Robinson Peete told Tapper, “When RJ was diagnosed in 2000, we were given a list of ‘nevers' — he would never say ‘I love you,' he would never mainstream in school, he would never play team sports … never do so many things, never have meaningful employment. And so we call that the ‘Never Day' and when I heard (Kennedy's) list of nevers, I was taken right back to that day.” 

She continued, “I just thought it was such a wasteful and dangerous use of a platform to talk about these children — and adults, my son's an adult — as if they're just disposable,  as if they are a blight on society, and it felt like institutionalized hopelessness.” 

Robinson Peete also noted that her son RJ “does pay taxes” and “has checked almost everything off that ‘never list” outside of dating. But through her HollyRod Foundation, she said she works closely with families across the U.S. who “need a lot more support” to help their own children thrive.

Friends, fans and fellow autism parents have rallied around Robinson Peete, who co-stars in Hallmark's “Hats Off to Love” on May 3. Thousands have left comments on her posts to express their gratitude.

Fellow Hallmark actress Kimberly Williams-Paisley wrote, “You inspire me Holly-thanks for speaking out. ❤️❤️”

Another Hallmark colleague, actress Nikki DeLoach, commented, “Bravo!!!! Well done. You are a light and a force. ❤️”

Among the many autism parents who have chimed in, one wrote, “Thank you so much for speaking up about this issue for all of our benefits. I'm so proud of my autistic loved ones, and the community of love and support we all have right here. We're in this together! We're stronger together! 👏👏👏💙💙💙”

Another commented, “👏👏👏 so proud to have you fighting for our community. Thank you Holly! Very well said. 🧩 💙”

After posting her CNN interview on Instagram, Robinson Peete wrote in the comment section, “Now you guys know that it was hard for me to keep my cool because I've been so upset about this, 🤬but I just want to advocate for all the beautiful families that we serve and have met and touched us throughout the years!! We all have different issues and we all need different levels of support but one thing we're not gonna do is allow our children to be diminished in value and robbed of possibilities on our watch!!!”

I first learned about Aimee Semple McPherson while in divinity school. “Sister Aimee,” as she was known to her adoring followers, was an early Pentecostal preacher, the founder of America's first megachurch, and a pioneer of Christian mass media. She was also an unpredictable impresario who infuriated her critics with her instinct for spectacle. I remember thinking how odd it was that I had never heard of her — how did this important female religious pioneer not make it into my American history books? And then I promptly forgot about her, as so many others had. I went to work as a journalist, and part of that work included interviewing and writing about celebrities. Reporting on the very famous, often for this magazine, I soon saw common ground between religion and fame. There was something about the way these exceptional people described the unknowable to the rest of us and the ways in which they derived power and fame from that role as messenger — whether through music and art, or through spiritual experiences. In short, I was obsessed with what happens when we treat people as gods on earth.












I also saw up close how fame so often became a sickness, almost a madness. Many of the celebrities I wrote about seemed caged by their renown. I spent an evening alone with Amy Winehouse a few years before her death. As she puttered around her London flat, in an altered state, she earnestly tried to explain the pieces of her life to me and how she had ended up so far from the ambitious young jazz singer from North London whose otherworldly talent had propelled her to global fame. I wrote about others — Prince, Michael Jackson, Justin Bieber — and in all of these artists I saw a through line: The love from the throngs of fans seemed to separate them from the world, from reality, and even, at times, from themselves. I often had a sense that being famous was like being in a cage.  It turns out Aimee Semple McPherson was a prototype for so much of what bewilders us today — the dazzle of fame, and its dark side.

	On a May afternoon in Los Angeles in 1926, one of the most powerful women in American history waded into the ocean and vanished. Before she walked down to the water's edge that day, Aimee had been on a path to become one of the most important female religious figures the country had ever known. But on that sunny afternoon, a series of mysterious events unfolded, and Aimee's destiny would change forever.

	











	Aimee, at 35 years old, was often accused of hypocrisy, of using her beauty and sexual charisma to garner followers even as she railed against the libertine mores of the Jazz Age. She capitalized on the resentment and nostalgia of her congregants and satisfied their yearning for a simpler time. She embodied the old-time religion, in sappy, strident tones, dressed as a milkmaid or a nurse. Yet for all the lip service she gave to the past, she was on the vanguard of shaping what religion would look like in the next century. She created her own radio station, her own self-published monthly magazine, a national newsletter, and an army of evangelists who she educated at her bible college in order to spread her gospel around the world. And all the while, she preached a thrilling and impassioned doctrine of love and living faith to audiences of five to ten thousand or more at a time, every Sunday.


	She drew these parishioners away from movie halls and rival churches with her signature illustrated sermons: She used her pulpit to bring the Biblical word of god to life, complete with an ever-changing cast and costumes. She wore boxing gloves to duke it out with “Kid Satan,” and dressed up as a motorcycle cop to preach on living too fast in the modern era. Long before televangelists and the billion-dollar industry of Christian broadcasting, there was Aimee giving people a modern Jesus they could experience as entertainment.


	Aimee's rise to fame had been fast. Just a dozen years earlier, she had been desperately trying to live as a housewife. She was widowed and on her second marriage, with two children by two different fathers. Domestic life did not suit the 26-year-old young woman who had once sailed to China to preach the word of God. Laid out in a hospital bed in Providence, Rhode Island, her body had an almost allergic reaction to the smallness of her life. What began with bouts of vomiting, internal bleeding, and heart tremors resulted in two nervous breakdowns, appendicitis, and, finally, a hysterectomy. In her memoirs, Aimee described the surgeries, which led to hemorrhaging, as brutal and barbaric. The doctors diagnosed her with “intense nervousness.” But on her deathbed, the voice of God spoke to her and she listened. She left her husband and her domestic life to become a lady evangelist.  And like many spiritual seekers, she soon found her way to the City of Angels.

	When it was opened on New Year's Day 1923, the Angelus Temple was one of the largest churches in the world. The Temple buzzed with the thrills and demands of serving entertainment and spiritual solace to thousands of people a week. By the end of its first year, Aimee's church was employing more than a hundred people, and daily visitors numbered more than seven thousand. The temple was a veritable city unto itself: 24 departments made up the corporate body, ranging from administration and finance to the on-staff electricians to the vast musical theater production department. There were several breakout rooms for prayer, including the “120 Room,” a place people could pray for the baptism of the Holy Spirit — and discreetly experience the gift of tongues.

	











	As the main theater became more mainstream, this room became a more private place for more demonstrative worship. Nearby was a “Miracle Room,” where discarded canes, crutches, casts, and wheelchairs were displayed as evidence of divine healing. On the first floor, phone operators at two phone lines who took calls day and night from anyone in Southern California in need — supplying milk, blankets, and, of course, salvation. There was a publishing department that printed all of Aimee's literature. Along with the monthly Bridal Call, a weekly newsletter was added — the Foursquare Crusader, with reprints of Aimee's sermons, temple news, and various advertisements from neighborhood merchants. Aimee had three ministerial assistants and a board of seven elders, along with 21 deacons — 14 of them women.


	Once Aimee built the Angelus Temple in Los Angeles, she cut back on her national travel. She was asking local audiences to come to the temple every week, and in doing so she lost some of the allure of being a fleeting attraction. When she'd been traveling on the revival circuit, she had more than 60 sermons she'd written that she could perform for her ever-changing audience. But anchored in Los Angeles, she felt the pressure of producing new material.


	She needed to create a steady stream of content — sermons, programs, classes, workshops — that would bring in new people and keep them coming back for more. Her innovation was the illustrated sermon — part spectacle, part feel-good homily — delivered every Sunday night. Mimicking the state-of-the-art technology and techniques of Hollywood, she delivered a gospel that felt relevant and immediate to her audience.


	Aimee hired a stage manager, Thomas Eade, who had trained in vaudeville, to design her elaborate skits. They rented costumes and scenery from nearby Hollywood studios. Aimee drew on popular culture and everyday life, and wove current ideas and debate into sermons. She depicted life in Los Angeles as biblically prophesied and infused with meaning. Her critics called her the P. T. Barnum of Christianity. She used live camels, tigers, lambs, palm trees — whatever it took to bring the ancient world alive on her stage. Aimee's sermons were soon considered the best show in town.


	“Many objected — even some members of the Angelus Temple felt a little uneasy — to the novelty of the illustrated sermons every Sunday evening, sermons in which the lesson of the text is driven home through the eye as well as the ear,” she told Sunset magazine. “What matters the trail, so long as the goal is reached? If we can hold the wavering attention and reach the heart of just one sinner through the costumes, the scenery, and the properties of the illustrated sermon, the gain is worth all the efforts.”

	











	Once Aimee had dazzled her audiences, she moved on to the altar call: “I want you to step out in the aisle nearest you. Then I want you to march right down the aisle to the altar, kneel right here, and say yes, ‘Yes, Lord! I need your help to live the good life!' Come on everybody . . . Don't one single person sit down. Don't you dare! This may be your last warning.” Hundreds of people would pour into the aisles, weeping and shouting, the crowd heaving toward the pulpit as others fell to their knees and prayed


	But Aimee wasn't content with transforming the lives of the people who came to her pews — she wanted to reach out and touch the world with her words. Divine guidance told her that technology would help her spread the gospel. Inside a dark room in Oakland in April of 1922, Aimee faced a large microphone. A photographer stood by to take pictures, and a crowd of spectators had squeezed in to watch her: the first woman to preach over the “wireless telephone,” according to the announcer who introduced her. Aimee had been invited to give a guest sermon at the Bay Area's popular new Rock Ridge radio station. Aimee was struck by the potential of the technology, how a single radio broadcast could reach significantly more souls than even a weeklong revival meeting. In the broadcasting room, as a crowd of technicians fiddled with the dials around her, Aimee was on edge. Could she be as effective in this tiny room with no audience to engage, no audience responding to her words?


	But, as she had so many thousands of times, Aimee shifted her being out of the room and directed her focus toward the heavens, like an antenna. “After putting them all out except the operator, I felt more at ease,” she wrote. “That is, as much at ease as it is possible for one to feel facing that great horn and having only its dark, mysterious-looking depths for a visible audience . . . In a moment I found myself talking into that great receiver — talking somehow as I had seldom talked before. The room with its electrical apparatus was forgotten . . . and I prayed and preached and prayed again and did most everything but take up the collection.”


	Always attuned to new technology, Aimee believed it was her duty to find the loudest amplifier to preach her message. Radio had a magic she instantly recognized: It compressed space and closed the gap between the presenter and the audience, which gave a disembodied connectivity to divine properties.

	











	Long before the advent of television, films, or the Internet, radio made the remote immediate and the powerful intimate. With the flick of the dial, Aimee saw how she could be in people's living rooms and kitchens, her voice in the ears of her listeners as she described how Scripture outlined a plan for modern existence and how the news of the day fulfilled biblical prophecy. For a woman who had succeeded by making herself so accessible, the radio was the perfect amplification tool. It allowed Aimee to connect directly on a new scale: Her message could reach the masses in an instant.


	After Oakland, she began making appearances on the Los Angeles Times radio station and on stations in other cities she visited. Over the next year, Aimee began asking around about how she could start her own radio station and inquiring about the costs. Her mother, Minnie — who had worked for years as her business manager, nanny, and bodyguard — did the calculations on equipment, airtime, and programming, and they came up with a budget. Then they began to fundraise. Aimee used the language of magic to make her sales pitch, telling her followers that “these are the days of invention! The days when the impossible has become possible! Days more favorable than any that have ever been known for the preaching of the blessed Gospel of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ! Now, the crowning blessing, the most golden opportunity, the most miraculous conveyance for the Message has come — the radio!”


	Aimee's vision of Christian media as a replacement for small-town Christian community was prescient, as was her programming. In addition to her Sunday morning sermons and baptismal services, she included Sunday school lessons, speeches on the state of Los Angeles by civic officials, lectures from Boy Scout leaders, and in-studio performances from a multiracial mix of musicians performing spiritual ballads, such as the frequent guests the Negro Swanee Jubilee Singers, or a sacred opera performed on the massive organ inside the Angelus Temple. Listeners could enjoy Children's Hour, Minnie's Sunday school program. Minnie became known simply as “Ma Kennedy” on the program and around the Temple. Most radically, Aimee was one of the first to convey faith healing — perhaps the most physical form of worship — through the radio. She asked listeners to kneel in their living rooms and touch the hard metal of their radio sets, using her voice and this new technology to create a sacred space for individuals as far as her words could carry across the airwaves. Aimee used the medium of transmitting sound to establish a new realm of spirituality. “As I lay my hands on this radio tonight, Lord Jesus, heal the sick,” she intoned nightly, her words hushed and reverential. “Bridge the gap between and lay your nail-pierced hand on the sick in radioland.”

	











	More than any other preacher, Aimee emulated the commercial radio world. On the dial, Aimee's sermons would coexist alongside studio serials such as The Green Hornet and Superman. In response, Aimee tried to take on these secular offerings with her own sacred versions of popular entertainment. The Temple even began producing its own versions of radio plays such as The Red Comet and The Adventures of Jim Trask — Lone Evangelist.


	As the importance of the radio station within the organization expanded, Kenneth Ormiston, Aimee's chief radio engineer, became one of the most central members of Aimee's staff. He was the first person she saw every morning, when she delivered her Sunshine Hour radio sermon. She seemed to value his judgment more than others. Her mother watched as her daughter regularly stopped into Ormiston's office at the end of the day after finishing her services. She was troubled when she heard Aimee ask Ormiston for notes on the Temple productions of her illustrated sermons. Minnie could not understand why her daughter would be asking this secular and flirtatious man for an opinion on God's work.


	In the Temple, where jubilant cries of “Hallelujah!” volleyed back and forth between the congregants endlessly, Ormiston was a bit of an outcast. A tall, bald man with large, piercing eyes and cupid lips, he dressed like a dandy. He wasn't a member of the temple, or any church. He enjoyed working at KFSG but had no interest in the ideas that he helped broadcast across the West Coast. Reserved and urbane compared to the giddy go-getters who made up most of the administration, he isolated himself in his tower and spent most of his day inside the office, tinkering with his radio technology. Ormiston obsessed over sound and engineering, writing an occasional column on radio for the Los Angeles Times, and, briefly, published a small-circulation technical magazine called Radio Doings.


	Despite large ears and a significant limp from a childhood bout with tuberculosis, Ormiston enjoyed a reputation as a ladies' man. He had high cheekbones and an intense, unencumbered gaze. He was married to an Australian ice cream heiress, but rumors were that he got around. He saw the potential for Aimee and her ambition to use the radio to reach a massive audience, but he didn't speak in the reverential tones that her followers used with “Sister.” He spoke as a peer, calling her “Mrs. McPherson” with a hint of flirtation. It was their “low-voiced remarks,” during choir practice, that began to make people in the temple uncomfortable. More and more, Sister was a being that was beyond human, a figure of reverence and worship who possessed supernatural powers. At the Angelus Temple, Sister was a saint, and her followers wanted her to stay that way.

	











	In early 1920s Los Angeles, Angelus Temple became known as a place for first-class entertainment for the masses. The temple had a 14-piece orchestra, a brass band, and a hundred-voice choir, two-thirds female, all dressed in white. The whole point was to dazzle and overwhelm. Along with the rest of the city, Hollywood came to watch the legendary sermons — Charlie Chaplin was a visitor in those early days and Marilyn Monroe and Richard Nixon both attended as children.


	By 1926, Aimee had manifested her dreams into a physical institution. She had built a megachurch, the first in what would become a long line of massive places of worship that would be erected over the course of the twentieth century — a remarkable achievement for a woman whose right to vote had been granted just two years earlier. Aimee had reconstituted the centuries-old tradition of large-scale tent revivals, once the stuff of rural country fields, into an urban physical monument.


	As her congregation and fame grew, Aimee wielded incredible influence in a city that often operated as if it were still an outpost of the Wild West. The Nineteenth Amendment was ratified in the summer of 1920, ensuring women in every state the right to vote. The conversation about women's rights, birth control, and the place of women in society was happening in homes and churches across the state, and around the country, as Aimee rose to power. But Aimee navigated her own course through these cultural flashpoints. Aimee was a spectacle in a city that was becoming an industry of spectacle. 


	Despite the progressive moment, to be a woman in Los Angeles in the early 1920s was to choose between two identities: sister and sinner. Many women left the punitive existence of domestic servitude and escaped to the booming city by the sea. They chopped off their hair and smoked and danced and even, it seems, had a fair amount of premarital sex. The world of vice was alive and well, and as a young woman in Los Angeles, one could easily find oneself ensnared by the temptations of libidinous sex, opium, heroin, and crime.

	In this heady world of fame, vice and virtue, Aimee plunged into the Pacific Ocean and vanished. Within days, 40,000 people would gather along the shoreline, holding vigil for their beloved Sister Aimee. Two people would die in the effort to find the evangelist. News of her death made headlines around the world. And then, 36 days later, she walked out of the desert of Mexico wearing a white dress and telling an unbelievable story that would change the course of her history — and ours.

            In April 2023, a few months after Elon Musk purchased Twitter, now called X, the outspoken billionaire went on a bit of a media tour.
    


            “Am doing interviews across the political spectrum. BBC's SF division is ‘left wing', as evidenced by the questions he asked. Tucker is ‘right wing'. Next week, I will do interviews with moderate & slightly left media,” Musk posted at the time.
    


            Two years later, Musk continues to do interviews. But nowadays, Musk sticks with ones that don't challenge him, often with interviewers who fawn over his accomplishments rather than pushing him to answer important questions about his government work.
    


            Since the inauguration and formally joining President Donald Trump's administration, Musk has made five appearances on Fox News. He's chatted with Joe Rogan and Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz on podcasts where they lavished praise on Musk and never questioned his work in the so-called Department of Government Efficiency.
    


            Musk has also communicated with friendly political groups abroad, including a congress of Italy's right-wing Lega party or conferences like the Dubai World Governments Summit. He's also jumped into live X Spaces conversations, most recently for candidates or causes he supports, like failed Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate Brad Schimel.
    


            And while he's occasionally engaged with the White House press pool, Musk has not sat for what could be considered a challenging interview in more than a year. The closest he's come was with Fox News' Bret Baier in March, who prodded Musk over calling Sen. Mark Kelly a “traitor”.
    


            Musk's last tough interview occurred in March 2024 with former CNN anchor Don Lemon, who asked about X's rightward shift, conspiracy theories and Musk's controversial statements on diversity, transgender people and more.
    


            But Musk clearly didn't like how Lemon challenged him. Lemon, who was supposed to launch a new show on X with the Musk interview, learned shortly afterward that the deal was off.
    


            “I've interviewed many world leaders, presidents to convicts, and no one has been more sensitive or touchy than Elon Musk,” Lemon told People last year. “He's not used to being held to account. He's not used to having to answer to anyone, especially someone like me who doesn't share his worldview, who doesn't look like him.”
    


            Musk has long had a contentious relationship with the media.
    


            In the BBC interview in April 2023, Musk said he has a “love/hate” relationship with the media, though noting he leans more heavily on the “hate” side, saying he relished removing the New York Times' verification badge on X.
    


            He's been known to slash the communications departments at his businesses, leaving no one to respond to reporters' inquiries — or in Twitter's case, to respond with the “poop” emoji.
    


            Stories about Musk nearly always note that neither Musk nor his representatives responded to requests for comment. And reporters say it's difficult to know who is handling Musk's media — the White House, his personal staff or Musk himself.
    


            The White House and a representative for Musk did not respond to CNN's requests for comment about who handles his interviews.
    


            “I don't have to answer questions from the reporters, Don, the only reason I'm doing this interview is because you're on the X platform and you asked for it,” Musk told Lemon last year. “Otherwise, I would not do this interview.”

Democratic Party leaders in Arizona are fighting among themselves, with grievances between the Arizona Democratic Party chairman and the state's U.S. senators becoming public.

Democrats have steadily gained ground in Arizona in recent years, winning several statewide races, though they lost the presidential race in 2024. Ahead of the 2026 elections, where Democrats will be defending several pivotal offices, including the governorship, the party's leadership appears to be in turmoil.

Arizona Democratic Party Chairman Robert Branscomb II sent a letter to state Democratic committee members accusing Sens. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) and Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) of attempting to threaten and intimidate him over who to hire as the new executive director for the party.

Branscomb claimed his decision to appoint Michael Ruff as the party's executive director caused both senators to threaten to withdraw support for the party.

“I received a text from one of our U.S. Senators stating he would no longer support or participate in state party fundraising. Shortly after, the other Senator called me directly—demeaning me and demanding I reverse my decision within 24 hours or ‘face consequences,'” the letter said.

Branscomb, who was elected as party chairman in January, said he would not be “coerced” or “silenced” by any elected officials.

“Let me be clear: no state party chair should be threatened or intimidated by any elected official for making a decision in the best interest of our party. The idea that both Arizona Senators would withdraw support because I did not choose their preferred candidate is not only troubling—it's a threat to the integrity and independence of our party. I will not be coerced, and I will not be silenced.”

Both senators, Gov. Katie Hobbs (D-AZ), Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, and Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes responded to the claims in their own letter sent to state Democratic committee members, via the party's vice chair, according to Politico. The leaders all proclaimed that Branscomb “has lost their trust.”

“His statement today includes many false claims and is the kind of bad-faith response we've come to expect from the new leadership over the last several weeks,” the letter said.

The letter comes more than a year before three of those five officials will seek to defend their positions in the 2026 election.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Fears of a potential recession and anxiety over tariff policy are weighing on the markets, but dividend stocks can help steady investors' portfolios.

Top Wall Street analysts help identify companies that can withstand short-term challenges and generate solid cash flows, allowing them to consistently pay solid dividends.

Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros on TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Midstream energy company Energy Transfer (ET) is this week's first dividend pick. The company has a diversified portfolio of energy assets in the U.S., with more than 130,000 miles of pipeline and related energy infrastructure.

In February, ET paid a quarterly cash distribution of $0.3250 per common unit, reflecting a 3.2% year-over-year increase. The stock offers a dividend yield of 7.5%.

Energy Transfer is scheduled to announce its first-quarter results on May 6. In her Q1 preview on the U.S. midstream sector, RBC Capital analyst Elvira Scotto named Energy Transfer as one of the companies she favors in this space. The analyst contends that the recent pullback in the stocks in RBC's midstream coverage universe seems ""overdone given the highly contracted and fee-based nature of midstream businesses.""

Scotto thinks that ET's commentary about benefits from Waha price spreads (the price difference between natural gas traded at the Waha Hub in the Permian Basin and the benchmark Henry Hub price) could be one of the key drivers. She also expects ET stock to gain from any updates on potential data center/artificial intelligence-driven projects. The analyst added that management's comments about export markets, mainly China, due to the trade war, will also impact investor sentiment.

The analyst is bullish on Energy Transfer due to its diversified cash flow streams across hydrocarbons and basins, including a significant amount of fee-based cash flow. Scotto expects ET's cash flow growth, coupled with a solid balance sheet, to boost the cash returns to unit holders. She thinks that ET stock has an attractive valuation with limited downside. Overall, Scotto reaffirmed a buy rating on ET stock but slightly lowered the price target to $22 from $23 due to market uncertainty.

Scotto ranks No. 24 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Her ratings have been successful 67% of the time, delivering an average return of 18.1%. See Energy Transfer Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

Another midstream energy player that Scotto is bullish on is The Williams Companies (WMB). The company is set to announce its results for the first quarter of 2025 on May 5. Recently, WMB raised its dividend by 5.3% to $2.00 on an annualized basis for 2025. WMB offers a dividend yield of 3.4%.

Ahead of the Q1 results, Scotto listed several potential key drivers for WMB stock, including long-term AI/data center growth opportunities, dry gas basin activity, marketing segment results and the timing of growth projects coming online.

""We think investors favor WMB's natural gas focused operations currently as the impact to natural gas demand is lower vs crude oil in a downturn given the underlying demand support from increasing LNG exports and AI/datacenters,"" said Scotto.

Scotto reaffirmed a buy rating on WMB stock with a price target of $63. The analyst expects continued strong volumes across Williams' segments, though some volume headwinds may persist in the Northeast segment. Scotto expects a solid quarter for WMB's Sequent business due to weather-led storage opportunities.

Overall, Scotto is optimistic about WMB executing on its backlog of growth projects and bolstering its balance sheet. With a long-term horizon, the analyst expects Williams to remain comfortably within investment-grade credit metrics through her forecast period and keep its dividend intact. See Williams Technical Analysis on TipRanks.

Diamondback Energy (FANG) is focused on the onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin. In February, the company announced an 11% hike in its annual base dividend to $4 per share. FANG offers a dividend yield of 4.5%.

Ahead of the company's first-quarter results scheduled to be announced in early May, JPMorgan analyst Arun Jayaram reiterated a buy rating on FANG stock and slightly reduced the price target to $166 from $167. The analyst expects the company's Q1 2025 results to be relatively in line with the Street's estimates. Jayaram expects FANG to report Q1 cash flow per share (CFPS) of $8.12 compared to the Street's estimates of $8.09.

Despite the volatility in commodity prices, Jayaram doesn't expect any changes to FANG's maintenance capital plan, at least in the near term, with operations continuing to be on track following the Double Eagle acquisition. The analyst also noted solid well productivity trends from Diamondback's projects that turned-in-line in 2024, which should provide additional capital efficiency tailwinds.

Jayaram expects FANG to generate free cash flow (FCF) of about $1.4 billion, with cash returns comprising 90 cents per share in quarterly dividends and $437 million of share buybacks.

""FANG is a leader in capital efficiency among the E&Ps [exploration and production companies] and has one of the lowest FCF break-evens across the group,"" the analyst said.

Jayaram ranks No. 943 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 49% of the time, delivering an average return of 6.2%. See Diamondback Energy Insider Trading on TipRanks.

“I wonder how much money OpenAI has lost in electricity costs from people saying ‘please' and ‘thank you' to their models.”

It was a seemingly random question posed by a user on X (formerly Twitter), but OpenAI CEO Sam Altman jumped in to reply that typing those words has added up to “tens of millions of dollars well spent — you never know.”

Judging from Altman's tongue-in-cheek tone, it's probably safe to assume he didn't do a precise calculation. But his response prompted Futurism to speculate about whether it's actually a waste of time and electricity to be polite to ChatGPT and other generative AI chatbots.

Apparently, being polite to AI isn't just an unnecessary habit, misplaced anthropomorphism, or fear of our future computer overlords. instead, Kurt Beavers, a director on the design team for Microsoft Copilot, said that “using polite language sets a tone for the response,” and that when an AI model “clocks politeness, it's more likely to be polite back.”

That said, profanity has its uses, too.

A new review published in Genes & Diseases highlights the transformative role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating and potentially reversing adipose tissue fibrosis, a condition closely linked to obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Fibrosis, driven by abnormal extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation, disrupts normal adipose tissue function and contributes to broader organ dysfunction. The review explores how miRNAs act as potent molecular regulators, capable of fine-tuning signaling pathways and gene expression patterns that influence fibrotic progression.

miRNAs, a class of small non-coding RNAs, can suppress or promote the translation of target genes involved in fibrogenic processes. Within adipose tissue, their regulation of pathways such as TGF-β/Smad, PI3K/AKT, and PPAR-γ plays a pivotal role in determining the balance between healthy tissue maintenance and pathological fibrosis. Specific miRNAs such as miR-122, miR-140, miR-150, miR-30b, and miR-155 demonstrate diverse functions, from blocking collagen synthesis to preventing the conversion of adipogenic cells into fibrogenic ones.

Of particular interest is the therapeutic application of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) transfected with targeted miRNAs. These engineered cells produce a secretome—a vesicle-rich fluid carrying anti-fibrotic miRNAs—that can be delivered to affected tissues without triggering immune rejection. This approach enables precise molecular intervention, targeting key proteins like Smad3, PDGFR-β, Runx1, and PPAR-γ, which are central to fibrosis development.

The review also draws attention to miRNAs' systemic impact, noting how alterations in adipose tissue can influence fibrosis in distant organs, including the liver, heart, and kidneys. For example, miR-410-5p, elevated in high-fat diet-induced obesity, enhances fibrosis by downregulating protective factors like Smad7 in cardiac tissue. Conversely, restoring miR-140 or delivering miR-30b can mitigate these fibrotic responses.

Ultimately, the findings underscore the potential of miRNA-based therapies as a non-invasive, targeted strategy to combat fibrosis in both adipose tissue and other organs.

A new wave of scientific interest is spotlighting GOT2—glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 2—as a compelling therapeutic target in the fight against pancreatic cancer, one of the most lethal and treatment-resistant malignancies. This mitochondrial enzyme, deeply embedded in glutamine metabolism, plays a central role in sustaining cancer cell survival and growth. By regulating the malate-aspartate shuttle, GOT2 maintains cellular redox balance, generates essential metabolic intermediates, and influences energy production pathways that fuel tumor proliferation.

Unlike conventional approaches that often face resistance or poor efficacy, targeting GOT2 offers a multi-pronged strategy. Its activity is closely tied to the production of aspartate and α-ketoglutarate, vital for nucleotide and protein biosynthesis and ATP generation. These metabolic outputs are particularly essential for pancreatic cancer cells, which rely on a distinct, non-canonical glutamine metabolic route often driven by oncogenic KRAS mutations. Inhibiting GOT2 disrupts this pathway, leading to a collapse in redox equilibrium and accumulation of reactive oxygen species, thereby triggering cellular senescence and loss of proliferative capacity.

The enzyme's significance extends beyond metabolism. Recent discoveries have unveiled an unexpected nuclear function of GOT2, where it operates as a fatty acid transporter that activates PPARδ, a transcription factor involved in immune regulation. By promoting the expression of genes like PTGS2, CSF1, and REG3G, GOT2 fosters an immunosuppressive microenvironment, hindering T-cell infiltration and supporting tumor immune evasion. These dual functions position GOT2 as a linchpin at the intersection of metabolic programming and immune suppression, highlighting its appeal as a target for novel combination therapies.

Despite its critical role, pancreatic tumors exhibit adaptive resistance mechanisms. Some cancer cells circumvent GOT2 loss through macropinocytosis or by acquiring metabolites from cancer-associated fibroblasts, allowing them to replenish aspartate independently. Understanding and counteracting these resistance pathways is essential for optimizing GOT2-based treatments.

The pursuit of effective GOT2 inhibitors is ongoing, with promising early candidates like amino oxyacetate showing potential. Future research must refine these compounds and explore their integration with immunotherapies or redox-modulating treatments.

Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), a rare yet highly aggressive malignancy, continues to represent a major clinical challenge. A recent review published in Genes & Diseases offers a comprehensive overview of the molecular mechanisms, diagnostic approaches, and therapeutic strategies driving current and future management of this lethal disease. ATC, accounting for a small percentage of thyroid cancers, progresses rapidly and resists conventional therapies, underscoring the urgency for innovative treatment paradigms.

At the core of ATC's pathogenesis are genetic aberrations, with prominent alterations in MAPK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathways. These dysregulated pathways promote unchecked cellular proliferation, survival, and metastasis. Mutations in genes such as BRAF, RAS, PIK3CA, TP53, and TERT have emerged as key drivers of ATC development and progression. Understanding the interplay between these mutations has enabled refined subclassifications of ATC, potentially informing personalized therapeutic approaches.

The review emphasizes the significance of targeted therapies, especially BRAF and MEK inhibitors, in improving patient outcomes. In particular, dual inhibition strategies have demonstrated efficacy in shrinking tumors and enabling surgical interventions. While trimodal therapy—a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation—remains the cornerstone for localized disease, its limitations in advanced ATC highlight the need for additional therapeutic avenues.

Immunotherapy has gained traction as a complementary modality. The tumor microenvironment of ATC, marked by immune cell infiltration and PD-L1 overexpression, presents opportunities for immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, response rates remain variable, and research is ongoing to optimize patient selection and treatment combinations.

Diagnostic innovations are also covered in detail, including the comparative efficacy of fine needle aspiration (FNA) versus core needle biopsy (CNB) and the utility of 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging in staging and treatment planning. Advances in immunohistochemical markers and liquid biopsies hold promise for earlier detection and real-time monitoring of therapeutic response.

The article concludes by highlighting the emerging role of mitochondrial metabolism as a therapeutic target and the potential of novel agents, including nanoparticles and oncolytic viruses, to enhance radioiodine uptake and overcome therapeutic resistance.

Don't count David Cronenberg among the auteurs carrying the torch for theatrical exhibition. Speaking to Jim Jarmusch for Interview Magazine, the body horror legend explained that he doesn't see communal movie-going as an inherently superior way to watch his films.

“I only see movies in real theaters every once in a while, mostly at film festivals, and I've found that the projection isn't always so great,” Cronenberg said. “I remember being in Venice onstage with Spike Lee and some others. He was talking about the Cathedral of Cinema, the whole religious aspect of it. And I said, ‘Spike, I'm watching “Lawrence of Arabia” on my watch, and there are a thousand camels there. I can see every one of them.' I was joking, but what I meant was, I don't find the cinema experience all that great. Maybe it's because I'm older. I don't feel that communal thing.”

Cronenberg's thoughts on technological evolutions in filmmaking and viewing are consistent with much of his filmography, which often deals with the need to embrace change or risk being left behind by nature. He expressed similar thoughts about celluloid film, saying that the convenience of working with digital cameras outweighs any visual benefits that might come from shooting on film

“I do find that people talking about streaming can be very passionate in the way that we were passionate in the movie theater after we saw a film. So it's different, but I don't think it's worse,” he said. “I also don't miss working with film. The cutting and editing was a nightmare for me. It was very restrictive. You have so much more control now. And of course, we are control freaks to a certain extent, if you're making a film.”

Cronenberg's latest film, “The Shrouds,” is now playing in theaters. The film, which follows a widower who processes his grief by placing his wife's body in a live-streaming coffin, was labeled a Critic's Pick by IndieWire's David Ehrlich following its premiere at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival.

“Inspired by the loss of the director's wife, ‘The Shrouds' is a grief story as only David Cronenberg would ever think to shoot one,” IndieWire's review read. “Sardonic, unsentimental, and often so cadaverously stiff that the film itself appears to be suffering from rigor mortis, as if its images died at some point along their brief journey from the projector to the screen. And really, what else would you expect?”

Is Bowen Yang ready to go full drag? For the right project, it may be very possible. Speaking to IndieWire at the red carpet premiere of his latest film, “The Wedding Banquet,” Yang shared that despite only recently taking part in a remake of a classic film, he'd be down to do so again if it were material he really couldn't pass up.

“I would love to remake ‘Female Trouble,'” Yang said, highlighting John Waters‘ beloved 1974 dark comedy. “I don't know who would play Divine or who would play Don Davenport.”

At the same time, Yang doesn't believe everything has to get remade. In fact, he would prefer if more effort went into honoring and cherishing the original material than trying to reinvent it.

“I think that's why things like the Criterion Collection are good at preserving these things that need to be preserved because they are kind of encased in amber,” Yang said, “and I feel like sometimes it's better to not touch those things.”

Yang actually had the privilege of entering the Criterion Closet recently, where he took the time to praise Waters as “probably my favorite director ever.” Amongst his selections was another one the filmmaker's subversive Divine collaborations, “Multiple Maniacs.”

“What Divine and Mink Stole do in the church, kind of the most shocking thing I've ever seen,” said Yang in the Criterion Closet. “I'm not a pearl-clutcher. It takes a lot to shock me. John Waters is a timeless shocker.”

And speaking of shocks, Yang also told IndieWire that he wouldn't mind offering a few frights of his own should the right role come along. 

“I would do a horror movie if I got to be the killer,” he said. Upon hearing “The Wedding Banquet” director Andrew Ahn is considering a take on “The Exorcist,” in considering a role in it, Yang added, “As long as I get to wear beads.”

Offering further praise of Ahn, Yang also said, “He is someone who I think is one of our current modern greats. He, in the spirit of Ang Lee, is able to work with different genres and also keep the same coterie of people around him. That's what Ang Lee did. He kept the same cohort of people with him and collaborators with him throughout his career. And I feel like Andrew is destined for the same greatness.”

“The Wedding Banquet” is currently in theaters from Bleecker Street.

	Sen. Chris Van Hollen defended the Constitution and fired back at California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a fellow Democrat, who said that the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident, to El Salvador was “the distraction of the day.”


	“I don't think it's ever wrong to fight for the constitutional rights of one person because if we give up on one person's rights, we threaten everybody's rights. I think a lot of voters, both Republican and Democrat, are tired of elected officials and politicians who just put their finger to the wind… Anyone who is not prepared to stand up and fight for the Constitution doesn't deserve to lead,” Van Hollen said in a Sunday interview on CNN's State of the Union.

	The senator last week traveled to El Salvador and its infamous Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) — one of the harshest prisons in the world — to speak with Abrego Garcia, his constituent, whom the Trump administration has admitted should not have been deported. The administration has admitted multiple times in court that Abrego Garcia's detention was an “administrative error.”

	











	While El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele initially denied Van Hollen's attempts to speak with Abrego Garcia, he ultimately caved, and allowed Van Hollen to meet his constituent.

	“What [Abrego Garcia] told me was he was sad and traumatized that he was being imprisoned because he has committed no crimes,” Van Hollen said.


	Van Hollen demanded the Trump administration must “put up or shut up in court” regarding Abrego Garcia's case. The administration is currently defying a court order — upheld in a  unanimous Supreme Court ruling — to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. A lower court has also rejected the administration's attempt not to comply with the Supreme Court's ruling. Abrego Garcia has not been convicted of a crime or proven in court to be a member of any gang. Despite that, the administration continues to claim he is a member of MS-13.

	“The subject at hand is that he and his administration are defying a court order to give people, to give Abrego Garcia his due process rights,” Van Hollen said. “They are trying to litigate on social media what they should be doing in the courts.”

	











	He went on to quote U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who said, “No evidence linking Abrego Garcia to MS-13 or any terrorist activity has been presented to the court.”


	“He's here legally now, he has a work permit, he's a sheet metal worker, he has a family, he has three kids,” Van Hollen said.


	Van Hollen was denied entry to CECOT and initially was not allowed to see Abrego Garcia. Bukele and Trump “had no intention of letting me meet with Abrego Garcia until they felt the pressure” from public outcry the senator said. Following Van Hollen's visit, Abrego Garcia was moved to a different detention facility where “conditions are better,” the senator said Friday.


	Van Hollen also gave a peek behind the scenes of his meeting with Abrego Garcia, saying that the Salvadoran government staged the scene to look like the two of them were drinking margaritas.


	“The lengths that both the El Salvadorian President Bukele and Donald Trump will go to deceive people are boundless,” he said, adding that waiters brought to the table two glasses that “appear to be margaritas.”


	“We didn't touch them, and they tried to manipulate it to make it look like Mr. Abrego Garcia's margarita had been drunk. In other words, the liquid was lower,” he continued. “But they screwed up in their scheme because if you look at the rims of the glasses, I don't know if it was salt or sugar, but there's no gap in them. So, nobody touched the margaritas.”

	Van Hollen stressed the urgency of the issue of Abrego Garcia's deportation and the necessity of defending his constitutional rights to protect those same rights for everyone in the U.S.


	“Right now, we have a lawless president… who is ignoring the order of the Supreme Court of the United States to facilitate [Abrego Garcia's] return,” Van Hollen said. “That's what's going on right now. That is a risk to all of us.”
