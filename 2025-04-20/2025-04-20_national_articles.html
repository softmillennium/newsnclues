Fox News correspondent Chanley Painter reports on growing concerns from lawmakers and travelers as the deadline to use Real ID-compliant licenses for air travel gets closer. Americans will need to obtain a REAL ID, which is a federally-compliant driver's license or other identification that meets higher standards than state-issued licenses, in order to easily travel by air, the Department of Homeland Security explains on its website. Only legal U.S. citizens or residents can obtain the identification card, while valid U.S. passports can also still be used instead of a REAL ID for domestic air travel. Congress passed the REAL ID Act in 2005 to heighten security requirements for driver's licenses in response to the attacks on 9/11. Though some states began complying with the law more than a decade ago, enforcement for all states had been repeatedly delayed due to the pandemic, DMV backlogs, as well as some states, such as South Carolina, initially refusing to comply. The move to officially enforce REAL IDs at the national level for domestic air travel comes after 19 states and Washington, D.C., put laws on the books allowing illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses. The states, which stretch from New York and New Jersey to California and Washington state, changed their laws in order to allow illegal immigrants to drive freely to work, while also ensuring they meet driving skill requirements and could obtain car insurance to bolster road safety, various liberal lawmakers and immigrant advocacy groups said as they rallied support for the law changes. "Expanding access to driver's licenses is critical for the safety of New Jerseyans and a step toward building a stronger and fairer New Jersey for all," New Jersey Democrat Gov. Phil Murphy, for example, said in 2019 after signing the Garden State's legislation allowing illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses. "Allowing residents the opportunity to obtain driver's licenses regardless of their immigration status will decrease the number of uninsured drivers and increase safety on our roads. Just a few months after New Jersey's 2021 law change, the state issued 100,000 new permits, a 65% jump compared to the same three-month period in years prior, NJ Spotlight News reported at the time. New Jersey is among the states that have reported long wait times at DMVs as residents scramble to obtain a REAL ID to fly ahead of the May 7 deadline. The states that allow illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses include: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington. Washington state had a law on the books allowing illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses since 1993, National Conference of State Legislatures data show, while most states, such as Illinois and California, began changing their laws starting in 2012. Charlie Baker vetoed legislation allowing illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses, citing that local DMVs did not have the ability to verify the validity of foreign documents and that it would overall weaken the validity of state driver's licenses. Migrants who crossed the Rio Grande are lined up for processing by Customs and Border Protection, Sept. 23, 2023, in Eagle Pass, Texas. "Consequently, a standard Massachusetts driver's license will no longer confirm that a person is who they say they are." Massachusetts ultimately allowed illegal aliens to obtain driver's licenses through a ballot initiative. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) Employment Authorization Card, and other forms of photo IDs, according to various immigrant advocacy groups. The Trump administration, which has been on an illegal immigration deportation blitz, revealed in a memo last week that the REAL ID requirement will further crack down on illegal aliens moving freely around the country. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is recognized as President Donald Trump speaks during an event at the White House on April 2. A Department of Homeland Security memo exclusively obtained by Fox Digital last week outlined that part of the motivation for the Trump administration to enforce the REAL ID law is to prevent those in the country illegally from flying – unless they are looking to self-deport on an international flight. "Under Biden, illegal aliens used non-compliant IDs from sanctuary cities to board flights, but REAL ID's higher security standards make it nearly impossible to forge legitimate documents, ensuring only verified travelers can fly," the memo states. "This closes the gaping vulnerabilities Biden's policies created, preventing criminals and potential terrorists from exploiting our aviation system, as seen during 9/11 when fraudulent IDs enabled attacks," the memo continues. "DHS and TSA are clear, the only place an illegal alien should be flying is home. Under Secretary Kristi Noem's leadership, illegal aliens will be barred from domestic flights, with one exception: illegal aliens self-deporting on international flights will be allowed to board without a REAL ID, encouraging their exit from the U.S.," it states. "Evidently, existing ID requirements for American citizens just aren't adequate now, so Big Brother is forcing us through more hoops for the ‘right' to travel within our own country," former Alaska Gov. Please don't shoot the messenger," Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., wrote on X last week. "REAL ID is a 2005 George Bush-era Patriot Act overreach that went completely unenforced until Trump got into office. Let me guess: he's playing 4D chess and I should just go along with it?" President Donald Trump, under his first administration, pushed back the REAL ID October 2020 deadline as the pandemic raged. Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, told Fox News Digital in a statement last week: "REAL IDs make identification harder to forge, thwarting criminals and terrorists. 81% of air travelers hold REAL ID-compliant or acceptable IDs. DHS will continue to collaborate with state, local, and airport authorities to inform the public, facilitate compliance, curb wait times and prevent fraud."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democratic Party leaders in Arizona are fighting among themselves, with grievances between the Arizona Democratic Party chairman and the state's U.S. senators becoming public. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) and Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) of attempting to threaten and intimidate him over who to hire as the new executive director for the party. Senators stating he would no longer support or participate in state party fundraising. Shortly after, the other Senator called me directly—demeaning me and demanding I reverse my decision within 24 hours or ‘face consequences,'” the letter said. Branscomb, who was elected as party chairman in January, said he would not be “coerced” or “silenced” by any elected officials. “Let me be clear: no state party chair should be threatened or intimidated by any elected official for making a decision in the best interest of our party. The idea that both Arizona Senators would withdraw support because I did not choose their preferred candidate is not only troubling—it's a threat to the integrity and independence of our party. Katie Hobbs (D-AZ), Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, and Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes responded to the claims in their own letter sent to state Democratic committee members, via the party's vice chair, according to Politico. The leaders all proclaimed that Branscomb “has lost their trust.” The letter comes more than a year before three of those five officials will seek to defend their positions in the 2026 election.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democrats' panic over what they stand for and whether they can credibly compete beyond the bluest states is already erupting in the rush to recruit Senate candidates across the country for next year — a desperate effort to dig out from years of losses that have them far from power at a moment they need it most. Even this early out from the 2026 elections, these questions are all playing out against the toughest set of Senate races Democrats have faced in decades. “On its face, the Senate map does not look great, but if this is a wave election, Democrats can compete in places they normally can't,” said Jaime Harrison, who before his recently completed term as Democratic National Committee chair ran for Senate in South Carolina in 2020. “The goal has to be: recruit a Democrat for every damn seat.” Harrison failed in his attempt to turn a red state blue. But hopes of a major backlash to Trump, fed by internal poll numbers that operatives say show his popularity dropping, has Harrison and two dozen other Democratic operatives and candidates across the country who spoke with CNN arguing that next year's elections could be more in line with the Democratic wave of 2006. Related article Feeling out a bizarre post-presidency, Biden reemerges on the public stage Democrats have three incumbent senators who announced they won't run again next year and anticipate at least one more will follow. They also have to defend a senator in Georgia, where Republicans keep running strong. Their most obvious opportunities to put Republicans on defense are in Maine and North Carolina, the two states that have crushed Democrats' dreams of winning Senate races cycle after cycle. That leaves operatives looking beyond prime Democratic territory in states such as Alaska and even Kentucky and Mississippi, or nursing fantasies of revivals in once-competitive states like Ohio, where local leaders are waiting for Sherrod Brown to decide whether he'll try a comeback from his 2024 loss to run for the state's other Senate seat, or go for governor instead. And across the country, voters have doubts about what Democrats even stand for. More than on ideology, voters are pushing Democratic candidates on what they're doing to push back against Trump and whether they'd support Chuck Schumer to remain the party's Senate leader. While strategists draft preliminary plans to blast Trump on the economy and thrash Republicans as rolling over for him no matter what, Schumer and fellow New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, chair of the Senate Democrats' campaign arm, have been feeling out the strength of prospective candidates and working with local leaders to find more. Comparing what he's hearing from voters to the cynicism that takes root in chronic pain patients he has worked with, El-Sayed told CNN, “It's the morass of, ‘Everything kind of sucks,' and our job is to take it down to its key elements.” Related article Bernie Sanders' message of resistance finds fresh life as Democratic Party searches for direction Morrow said her campaign is about “success, safety and sanity” rather than the status quo. “This is a huge opportunity for us to write a new Democratic Party and really put a stake in the ground, show through our race this is what the new party can look like and sound like and act like,” she said. One measure of how sparse the Democratic bench is in states where they need to compete next year: Only a few House members are in the mix for Senate runs. All three are in more reliably Democratic states, but Pappas said being a lifelong Democrat does not mean he is at all satisfied with how the party got to where it is. In Georgia, Sen. Jon Ossoff has started building his campaign around an approach he believes worked well for him in the past — talking common sense over chaos, railing against Trump's authoritarian impulses and blasting corruption. He's also raised $11 million already and has had thousands at his rallies in a state that Trump won again last year. In South Carolina, Annie Andrews — a pediatrician who lost a 2022 House race against Rep. Nancy Mace — has been having conversations about taking on Graham this time, convinced that the demographics in the state are shifting to make him vulnerable. In Mississippi, District Attorney Scott Colom — whose nomination by Joe Biden to be a district court judge was blocked by Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith — has been gearing up for a likely run now against her. In Maine, a former Capitol Hill chief of staff who worked at the Democratic group End Citizens United has told multiple people he will soon launch a campaign, but most eyes remain on Rep. Jared Golden, the four-term congressman whose most recent break with his party was being the sole House Democrat to vote for Trump's budget bill. He's still weighing what to run, leaving Maine Democrats thinking of 77-year-old Gov. In Nebraska, Dan Osborn — the local labor leader and industrial machinist who attracted significant Democratic interest and money for his 2024 Senate run as an independent — is nearing another run. Across the Missouri River, Nathan Sage last week launched a likeminded but still Democratic campaign against Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst. “This is shaping up to be an incredibly interesting election cycle where anything's possible,” said South Carolina's Andrews, who said she expects to make a final decision about running within weeks. In Texas, after 2018 and 2024 races that fizzled despite national buzz, Democrats are trying to decide whether a GOP primary could get their hopes up for 2026. Within minutes of the race kicking off, state Attorney General Ken Paxton and Sen. John Cornyn were attacking each other as unfit for office and failing to serve Texans. National Senate campaign operatives are in the early stages of deciding where they will focus, but they acknowledge that in most places, much of that will be candidate-driven, since winning will require overperforming in regards to how voters think about Democrats. In some cases, they say, that will mean pushing the most famous Democrat they can find to run, but in others it will be hunting for an unknown unicorn who can talk about shared values rather than partisanship. “Better candidates, stronger campaigns, a winning message, and a building midterm backlash against Republicans driven by their threats to Social Security and Medicaid are going to power Senate Democrats into the majority this cycle,” Gillibrand said in a statement provided to CNN. “Republicans have more seats to defend — and they're doing it in a bad political environment.” Related article Democratic retirements create fresh challenge for hopes of winning back the Senate “Somebody has to stand up, and I've done it my entire life,” said Pam Stevenson, an Air Force colonel and the minority leader of the state House who's hoping to do better in her 2026 Senate campaign than in her 2023 race for attorney general. In Kansas, which also has a Democratic governor but hasn't had a Democratic senator for decades, state party chair Jeanna Repass told CNN on Friday that while she's already been part of several interviews with prospective opponents to Sen. Roger Marshall, she still is not sure who will run.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the pressure grows on congressional Republicans to identify cuts in Medicaid, they are crashing into a familiar problem: The changes that could save the most money would impose heavy costs on many of their own voters. Several key House Republicans have signaled in recent days that they may try to cut Medicaid spending by rolling back the expansion in eligibility for the working poor included in the Affordable Care Act approved under President Barack Obama. Most House districts where more people than the national average receive health coverage through the Medicaid expansion are also held by Democrats, according to an exclusive new CNN analysis of data from KFF, a non-partisan health care think tank. But GOP constituencies would hardly be immune if Congress rescinds the expansion. And nearly two dozen GOP senators likewise represent states with a substantial population of enrollees covered through the ACA's Medicaid expansion. “It's really a similar pattern that we've seen with the Affordable Care Act generally – that it's become so embedded in the health care system and the lives of people across the country that it becomes very hard to take it away,” said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF. Answers on whether the expansion is too entrenched for congressional Republicans to uproot could begin arriving as soon as May 7, when the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which holds jurisdiction over Medicaid, is expected to start marking up the GOP's massive budget “reconciliation” plan. For all the controversy around both President Donald Trump's assaults on civil liberties and his tariff moves, it's likely that the most politically consequential decision congressional Republicans face this year is how to balance spending and tax cuts in the budget package they are formulating. With Trump ruling out cuts in Social Security or Medicare benefits, Medicaid represents by far the largest pot of money available for the reductions that conservative budget hawks are demanding. Republicans have long viewed Medicaid, which now provides health coverage for about 83 million lower-income Americans, as a more vulnerable target than Medicare, which serves seniors; GOP attempts to cut Medicaid and convert it into a block grant were central to the 1990s budget showdowns between President Bill Clinton and then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The ACA expanded eligibility for Medicaid to far more working poor people. Previously, single childless adults were not eligible for the program at any income level; the ACA allowed states to cover those making up to 138% of the federal poverty level ($15,650 for an individual and about $21,000 for a married couple in 2025). Far more Republicans than Democrats also represent districts with greater than average prevalence of major health problems including diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure – a reflection of the GOP's growing consolidation of lower-education, lower-income, often rural House districts. But the Medicaid expansion population has remained a tempting target for them. In recent weeks, multiple House Republicans have subtly, but tellingly, distinguished between Medicaid's traditional enrollees – very low-income parents, people with disabilities, impoverished seniors – and those added under the ACA expansion. Even a dozen House Republicans from swing districts who wrote Johnson last week expressing caution about Medicaid reductions made a similar distinction: while they would oppose cuts hurting “vulnerable populations,” they also said they want to “fix flaws in the program that divert resources away from children, seniors, individuals with disabilities, and pregnant women — those who the program was intended to help.” (Emphasis added.) “We're 15 years post the ACA and I think the question for policy makers is: under what rationale should we paying more for childless adults than kids, pregnant women and people with disabilities on the program?” Brian Blase, the institute's president and a health policy adviser to Trump during his first term, said in a recent interview. Paragon projects that about 3 million people would lose health care coverage from the shift. That's largely because it anticipates that most of those removed from Medicaid would qualify for federal subsidies to buy private health insurance through the ACA marketplaces. If states tried to maintain the current eligibility levels with their own funds, the Urban Institute found, it would require them to increase their Medicaid spending by about 25% annually, a virtual impossibility. Meanwhile, it would become much harder for people kicked off Medicaid to obtain coverage instead through the Obamacare exchanges if Republicans allow the enhanced ACA subsidies approved under President Joe Biden to expire this year, as they have signaled is likely. “If people in the expansion population lose coverage, they may be eligible on paper for the marketplace but many of them would not be able to afford it,” especially if the enhanced subsidies expire, said Allison Orris, director of Medicaid policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal group. So many congressional Democrats represent big expansion populations , largely because the states that have added the most people through the expansion tend to be places where Democrats are highly competitive, including blue states California, New York, Illinois, Oregon and Virginia, as well as purple battlegrounds like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Arizona, which are all in the top 10. Conversely, Republicans in Congress are less exposed, largely because the 10 states that have refused to expand Medicaid – headlined by Texas, Florida and Georgia – all lean red, with the exception of Wisconsin (where the GOP-controlled legislature has long blocked expansion). Even so, the number of House Republicans from expansion states with large numbers of residents – and health care providers – who have come to rely on the new coverage still far exceeds the number of defections that would sink any budget plan. Thirty-two House Republicans also hold seats with an above-average number of expansion beneficiaries; 14 of them represent districts with 80,000 or more Medicaid expansion enrollees. And while the total number of expansion enrollees is greatest in Democratic-held districts (about 12.6 million), the 6.8 million in GOP seats still constitute a very large number of potential voters. Another factor could make Republicans hesitate about unwinding the expansion: its importance to health care systems in reliably red rural areas. In an interview, North Carolina Medicaid Director Jay Ludlam  , for instance, pointed out that rural residents make up twice as big a share of the state's Medicaid expansion population as they do of the overall population. Experts say that dynamic, which is evident in other states too, is primarily because workers in rural places are less likely to receive health insurance from their employers. Through the expansion, Ludlam said, “We have seen individuals get medicines for heart disease, diabetes, for treatment of seizures – chronic diseases that would go otherwise untreated.” If people lose that coverage, he continued, “initially what you would start to see is an uptick in emergency room visits, which is an incredibly expensive way to provide health care,” with “eventually some of those chronic diseases beginning to have a really adverse impact on the health of many people.” John Bel Edwards in 2016 and his Republican successor, Gov. According to Kaiser, Louisiana has signed up nearly 800,000 people for the expansion, more than all but four other (and much larger) states. Johnson and fellow Louisiana GOP Reps. Julia Letlow, Clay Higgins and Steve Scalise each have more than 100,000 district residents receiving Medicaid through the expansion, which places all of them among the top eight of all House Republicans. Jan Moller, executive director of Invest in Louisiana, an advocacy group for low-income families, says the Medicaid expansion has also provided a financial lifeline for the state's health care providers. “If you drive around Louisiana,” he added, “you will see a lot of clinics … where they didn't exist 10 to 15 years ago.” Revoking expansion funding, Moller said, “would be devastating for Louisiana's budget, and it would seriously threaten health care access for the 1 in 3 Lousianians who depend on Medicaid.” Even people with private insurance or Medicare would be hurt, Moller added, if reduced Medicaid revenue forces hospitals and other providers to close, particularly in rural areas with fewer alternatives. That could be a common problem in many states, Orris said. “Pulling as much money out of the health care system as they are talking about … will hurt everyone in a community,” she said. If congressional Republicans can't find the votes to directly reverse the expansion, they have signaled they may seek to truncate it by imposing a work requirement on Medicaid recipients. (Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley, for instance, has said he will not support cuts in benefits, but would back a work requirement.) Surveys have found about two-thirds of people on Medicaid already work full- or part-time, and almost all the rest would likely be exempt from any mandate because of factors such as a disability or caring for a family member. But when Arkansas and New Hampshire experimented with work requirements in Trump's first term, large numbers of people were still thrown off the program for failing to meet the paperwork requirements to document their work. It would be a bitter irony if a work requirement becomes a vehicle to erase the Medicaid expansion's historic gains in extending health coverage to the working poor – in red places as well as blue.</p>

Russell Westbrook may not be his triple-double machine, MVP self anymore, but on Saturday night, he turned back the clock. Westbrook hit a key 3-pointer late in regulation and made the game-saving play with 10 seconds left in overtime when he forced a turnover to give the Denver Nuggets a 112-110 win in Game 1 of the first round of the playoffs against his former Los Angeles Clippers. Westbrook has done just about everything there is to do for a Hall of Fame resume – the 36-year-old is a nine-time All-Star, MVP, two-time scoring champ, three-time assist leader, and averaged a triple-double four times. Denver Nuggets guard Russell Westbrook (4) reacts to his three-point basket in the fourth quarter against the LA Clippers at Ball Arena. But, his mentality, and self-proclaimed job description, could help him check off that final box. "My job is to, excuse my language, f--k s--t up," he said after the contest. "That's who he is," MVP contender Nikola Jokic said after watching Westbrook hit an uncontested corner 3-pointer to give Denver a two-point lead late in regulation and then knocking the inbounds pass away from — and off of — former teammate James Harden with 9.6 seconds left in overtime to help seal Denver's win over the Los Angeles Clippers. Denver Nuggets guard Russell Westbrook (4) reacts following his defensive turnover in overtime against the LA Clippers at Ball Arena. He was playing free safety out there. "And then offensively ... he attacked," Adelman said. "We maybe could have pulled it out and executed. I don't think he's going to change after 17 years. Jokic scored 29 points and finished one rebound shy of a triple-double. 5 seed Clippers' loss was their first since March 30 at Cleveland. They rolled into the playoffs having won 18 of 21, including their last eight. Game 2 is Monday night back in Denver, who made the shocking move of firing Michael Malone less than two years after winning a title, and a week before the playoffs began.

NEW YORK (AP) — Opponents of President Donald Trump's administration took to the streets of communities large and small across the U.S. on Saturday, decrying what they see as threats to the nation's democratic ideals. The 80-year-old retired mason from Maine said he believes Americans are under attack from their own government and need to stand up against it. “This is a very perilous time in America for liberty,” said Bassford, who was with his partner, daughter and two grandsons. “I wanted the boys to learn about the origins of this country and that sometimes we have to fight for freedom.” In Denver, hundreds of protesters gathered at the Colorado State Capitol with banners expressing solidarity with immigrants and telling the Trump administration: “Hands Off!” People waved U.S. flags, some of them held upside down to signal distress. Thousands of people also marched through downtown Portland, Oregon, while in San Francisco, hundreds spelled out the words “Impeach & Remove” on a sandy beach along the Pacific Ocean, also with an inverted U.S. flag. People walked through downtown Anchorage, Alaska, with handmade signs listing reasons why they were demonstrating, including one that one that read: “No sign is BIG enough to list ALL of the reasons I'm here!” People hold signs and chant slogans during a protest against the Trump administration, Saturday, April 19, 2025, in Miami. Elsewhere protests were planned outside Tesla car dealerships against billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk and his role in downsizing the federal government. Others organized more community service-oriented events such as food drives, teach-ins and volunteering at local shelters. The protests come just two weeks after similar nationwide demonstrations. Organizers say they oppose what they call Trump's civil rights violations and constitutional violations, including efforts to deport scores of immigrants and to scale back the federal government by firing thousands of government workers and effectively shuttering entire agencies. Boston resident George Bryant, who was among those at the Concord protest, said he is concerned that the president is creating a “police state.” He held a sign saying, “Trump fascist regime must go now!” Protesters form a “Impeach & Remove” human banner on Ocean Beach during a protest against U.S. President Donald Trump, in San Francisco, Saturday, April 19, 2025. In Washington, Bob Fasick, a 76-year-old retired federal employee from Springfield, Virginia, said he came out to the rally near the White House out of concern over threats to constitutionally protected due process rights, Social Security and other federal safety-net programs. The Trump administration, among other things, has moved to shutter Social Security Administration field offices, cut funding for government health programs and scale back protections for transgender people. “I cannot sit still knowing that if I don't do anything and everybody doesn't do something to change this, that the world that we collectively are leaving for the little children, for our neighbors is simply not one that I would want to live,” Fasick said. In Columbia, South Carolina, several hundred people protested at the statehouse holding signs with slogans such as “Fight Fiercely, Harvard, Fight.” And in Manhattan, protesters rallied against continued deportations of immigrants as they marched from the New York Public Library north toward Central Park and past Trump Tower. People gather to protest President Donald Trump's policies on Saturday, April 19, 2025 in New York. Marshall Green said he is most concerned that Trump invoked the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798 by claiming the country is at war with Venezuelan gangs linked to the South American nation's government, even though a recent U.S. intelligence assessment found no coordination between them. “Congress should be stepping up and saying no, we are not at war. You cannot use that,” said the 61-year-old from Morristown, New Jersey. “You cannot deport people without due process, and everyone in this country has the right to due process no matter what.” Meanwhile Melinda Charles, of Connecticut, said she worries about “executive overreach,” citing clashes with the federal courts, Harvard University and other elite colleges. “We're supposed to have three equal branches of government,” she said, “and to have the executive branch become so strong, I mean it's just unbelievable.”</p>
