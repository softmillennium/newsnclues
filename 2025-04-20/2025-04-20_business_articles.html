                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen said Sunday that his trip to El Salvador to meet with Kilmar Abrego Garcia was about "defending the rights of this man to due process," and not about "defending the man." "The Trump administration has admitted in court that he was wrongfully detained and wrongfully deported," the Maryland senator said on ABC News' "This Week." "My mission and my purpose is to make sure that we uphold the rule of law, because if we take it away from him, we do jeopardize it for everybody else," he added. Van Hollen also warned on CNN's "State of the Union," that denying "the constitutional rights of this one man, ... threatens the constitutional rights of everybody in America." When asked whether the U.S. is in a constitutional crisis, the Maryland senator said: "Yes, we are." Van Hollen's Sunday show media blitz comes after he traveled to El Salvador this week to meet with Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported from Maryland. In recounting his meeting with Abrego Garcia, Van Hollen described him as having "experienced trauma" from his imprisonment. "He told me about the trauma he had been experiencing, both in terms of the abduction and the fact that he was originally sent to CECOT, which is this notorious prison," Van Hollen said on "This Week." Van Hollen's visit to El Salvador came after its President Nayib Bukele said during a White House visit earlier this month that he would not return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. Hours later, the Trump administration told a federal judge that it lacked authority to compel El Salvador to return Abrego Garcia, despite a U.S. Supreme Court ruling saying that the administration should "facilitate" his return.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many U.S. companies have expressed concern, or even anger, about the wide-ranging tariffs recently announced by President Donald Trump, which economists say threaten to increase their companies' costs and result in higher prices for consumers. The tariffs, and the back-and-forth nature of their rollout, has spurred "panic-buying" of a wide range of products that could face price surges in the coming months, according to a Reuters report on Wednesday that cited U.S. Commerce Department data. Back Market saw its sales triple over a single week in the wake of Trump's tariffs announcements, says Thibaud Hug de Larauze. "Maybe some people rushed into [replacing their smartphones or computers] earlier, because they were afraid it's going to cost so much more weeks from now," Hug de Larauze, who also co-founded the company, says. Most smartphones and computers are manufactured in China, which currently faces a 145% total tariff rate on goods imported to the United States. Trump issued a temporary exemption for those products on April 11, but subsequently announced plans to introduce specific tariffs targeting electronics that could take effect as soon as May. Hug de Larauze's takeaway from Back Market's boom week: More Americans could start opting for used or refurbished devices, if Trump's tariffs raise prices on new electronics for the foreseeable future. "This is a big opportunity to change the way American people consume this stuff, because the incentive has never been as high to avoid those tariffs," he says. Prolonged tariffs could cause a "huge uptick" in short-term sales of used and refurbished devices, especially smartphones, says Dan Ives, Wedbush Securities global head of technology research. Companies like Apple might need to increase their prices by hundreds of dollars per product — if not more — depending on the eventual electronics-specific tariffs, other analysts estimate. Currently, enough Americans prioritize replacing their devices with brand-new ones that Back Market only sells about one-third of its stock in the U.S., says Hug de Larauze. Long-term, Ives suspects that the typical American consumer might settle for a used or refurbished device for now, but return to buying new tech once their wallets allow it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fears of a potential recession and anxiety over tariff policy are weighing on the markets, but dividend stocks can help steady investors' portfolios. Top Wall Street analysts help identify companies that can withstand short-term challenges and generate solid cash flows, allowing them to consistently pay solid dividends. Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros on TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. The company has a diversified portfolio of energy assets in the U.S., with more than 130,000 miles of pipeline and related energy infrastructure. In February, ET paid a quarterly cash distribution of $0.3250 per common unit, reflecting a 3.2% year-over-year increase. The stock offers a dividend yield of 7.5%. Energy Transfer is scheduled to announce its first-quarter results on May 6. In her Q1 preview on the U.S. midstream sector, RBC Capital analyst Elvira Scotto named Energy Transfer as one of the companies she favors in this space. She also expects ET stock to gain from any updates on potential data center/artificial intelligence-driven projects. The analyst added that management's comments about export markets, mainly China, due to the trade war, will also impact investor sentiment. The analyst is bullish on Energy Transfer due to its diversified cash flow streams across hydrocarbons and basins, including a significant amount of fee-based cash flow. Scotto expects ET's cash flow growth, coupled with a solid balance sheet, to boost the cash returns to unit holders. She thinks that ET stock has an attractive valuation with limited downside. Overall, Scotto reaffirmed a buy rating on ET stock but slightly lowered the price target to $22 from $23 due to market uncertainty. 24 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. See Energy Transfer Ownership Structure on TipRanks. Recently, WMB raised its dividend by 5.3% to $2.00 on an annualized basis for 2025. Ahead of the Q1 results, Scotto listed several potential key drivers for WMB stock, including long-term AI/data center growth opportunities, dry gas basin activity, marketing segment results and the timing of growth projects coming online. "We think investors favor WMB's natural gas focused operations currently as the impact to natural gas demand is lower vs crude oil in a downturn given the underlying demand support from increasing LNG exports and AI/datacenters," said Scotto. The analyst expects continued strong volumes across Williams' segments, though some volume headwinds may persist in the Northeast segment. Scotto expects a solid quarter for WMB's Sequent business due to weather-led storage opportunities. Overall, Scotto is optimistic about WMB executing on its backlog of growth projects and bolstering its balance sheet. With a long-term horizon, the analyst expects Williams to remain comfortably within investment-grade credit metrics through her forecast period and keep its dividend intact. Diamondback Energy (FANG) is focused on the onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin. In February, the company announced an 11% hike in its annual base dividend to $4 per share. Ahead of the company's first-quarter results scheduled to be announced in early May, JPMorgan analyst Arun Jayaram reiterated a buy rating on FANG stock and slightly reduced the price target to $166 from $167. Jayaram expects FANG to report Q1 cash flow per share (CFPS) of $8.12 compared to the Street's estimates of $8.09. Despite the volatility in commodity prices, Jayaram doesn't expect any changes to FANG's maintenance capital plan, at least in the near term, with operations continuing to be on track following the Double Eagle acquisition. The analyst also noted solid well productivity trends from Diamondback's projects that turned-in-line in 2024, which should provide additional capital efficiency tailwinds. Jayaram expects FANG to generate free cash flow (FCF) of about $1.4 billion, with cash returns comprising 90 cents per share in quarterly dividends and $437 million of share buybacks. 943 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with John Lovell, 60, who has traveled to 89 countries and hundreds of cities in his lifetime. Lovell is the president of Travel Leaders Network, a company that sells luxury travel, cruises, and tours. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Over the years, I've visited 89 countries and lived in many cities. I've been to isolated places like Tahiti, home to some of the most beautiful beaches and incredible overwater bungalows. I've also been to smaller countries like the Vatican and traveled to South Africa, which has some of the world's best vineyards and game preserves. I've also visited more popular and famous European cities like Paris and London, where I once lived. I love both cities, and if I had to choose my top five, they'd both be on there. However, if I could live anywhere full-time, it would be in Salzburg, Austria. Salzburg is at the top of my list because it's smaller and more intimate. There are fewer tourists than in London or Paris, so it's easier to experience the city and its culture — plus, the people are incredibly welcoming. The city is surrounded by lakes, with rivers flowing through its heart. While the winters can be a bit cold for me, the overall climate is quite pleasant, similar to upstate New York, so fairly temperate for the most part. In the 1965 film, the von Trapp family — based on a real Austrian musical family — escapes Nazi-occupied Austria. Most hotels range from mid- to high-end, with prices typically between $100 and $400 per night. Visiting won't necessarily break the bank for many travelers. Salzburg is also a well-known getaway spot if you're into skiing and similar winter activities. There are also plenty of great restaurants. So, even though Salzburg isn't a massive metropolis, it still has plenty to offer. Many people speak English, German, and sometimes French. Of all European cities, I'd compare Salzburg to Prague or Edinburgh — but those cities don't have the sheer natural beauty of the mountains and rivers surrounding them. The people of Salzburg truly embrace travelers. One was an older, retired gentleman who owned a home in Austria. I fell in love with the area and have returned to that city four times. I've never had a bad interaction with anyone there. It's such a nice feeling to be so welcomed, and that's why I keep returning.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>JPMorgan expects President Donald Trump's tariff blitz to yield "some deals" between the US and its trade partners, but says tax rates will still multiply in size. In new research, the global investment strategy team at JPMorgan Wealth Management outlined its base case for Trump's tariffs. This "represents a meaningful increase in import duties but lands within Wall Street estimates pre-'Liberation Day,'" the firm wrote. Trump has touted the protectionist pivot as a forceful negotiating tactic to elicit better trade deals. The firm warns, however, that unemployment and inflation would still weigh on economic growth. JPMorgan laid two main recommendations for qualifying investors looking to stay safe and perhaps even capitalize on a more volatile environment: The firm says structured notes can simultaneously provide defensive exposure to stocks while delivering income through options premiums. This strategy generates income in a volatile environment, albeit at the expense of some upside. JPMorgan says that volatility will give hedge funds more opportunities to "exploit market mispricings and relative value plays across asset classes." The firm also seems them offering diversification and hedged downside during declines.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As other San Francisco hacker houses lure young founders with promises of glitzy megamansions and catered food, one of the city's oldest houses, Mission Control, remains proudly no-frills. "It is not the Four Seasons," resident Conor Brennan-Burke said. That was quickly dispelled when my Uber dropped me off on a noisy street in the Mission District and I walked up to an entrance sandwiched between an abandoned storefront and a graffiti mural. When I walked inside and slipped off my shoes, as everyone is required to do, I met Lisa Shmulyan, who has lived here since 2020. That energy is hard to find anywhere else. Mission Control was founded by a group of former Thiel fellows in 2013. Since then, other houses like Chez JJ and Negev have disbanded as newer entrants offering far more accoutrements, like AGI House and HFO Residency, have soaked up more buzz. Mission Control endures, in spite of or perhaps because it operates as a commune. He estimates that during that time, residents have raised over $2 billion and created companies worth more than $200 billion. Alums include Kashish Gupta, Tejas Manohar, and Josh Curl, the cofounders of Hightouch, an AI marketing company which recently raised $80 million at a $1.2 billion valuation. Residents of the main house are raising their own venture fund, Mission Street Capital, to back other residents and alums, and VCs from famous firms like Sequoia and Andreessen Horowitz recently paid visits. Cost is certainly part of the appeal; rent for one of the 10 bedrooms is around $1600, around half of what it would typically cost to rent a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco. But many residents have chosen to stay even after raising their Series A funding round. "I think ultimately the reason that people stay, even though maybe they could live in a nicer place, is just a really strong community," said Shmulyan. "This is a house where people are doing their life's work, and doing it side by side with each other." When I walked upstairs, a dozen current and former residents were bunched together in the living room, sipping Diet Cokes and coding on their MacBooks. COVID proved people can work from anywhere, but far from making hacker houses like this one obsolete, the residents here said the pandemic made them more in demand than ever, especially as the outside world has become more unstable. "It's a natural human instinct to find connections when there's confusion and crisis," said Chase Changhee Seon, who came to Mission Control from Seoul to start an events and community platform. "Even in this world of tech and AI, you cannot replace human connections." At first glance, the 6400-square-foot interior somewhat resembles a frat house, with a random bench press no one seems to use in the hallway and mismatched furniture that has seen better days. There are no TVs, and everything from the kitchen to the bathrooms is immaculately clean thanks to cleaners who come every week. And almost no one in the house drinks any alcohol. "We drink tea, build stuff, and hang out." There is no cold application to get into Mission Control. You have to know someone in the house who is willing to advocate for you, and even then, the odds are long, with less than 3% of prospects making it through the extensive interview process. When I met residents, I was surprised to learn how many are not currently working on any startup, and the interview criteria reflect that. "People have moved here with nothing," Brennan-Burke said. One thing that gets a major red flag: Being an influencer. "People don't come here for clout," Schulyan said. It only works when you filter for authenticity." Before I left, I met Jessica Gerwin, who was selected to move into Mission Control last year after becoming known in San Francisco's startup scene for hosting lively dinner parties. She is now building Socrates Lab, an AI agent startup. She says such a massive understanding would have seemed fanciful in the Los Angeles apartment she was living in before, but now she is putting in 80-hour workdays at Mission Control to see it come to fruition. "You have to be somewhat delusional to want to change the world in the ways that founders do, and so there's something special about surrounding yourself with other people who don't bat an eye when you're trying to do the same thing," Gerwin said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia on Sunday of creating a false appearance of honoring an Easter ceasefire, saying Moscow continued to launch attacks overnight after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a unilateral temporary truce in Ukraine. "As of Easter morning, we can say that the Russian army is trying to create a general impression of a ceasefire, but in some places, it does not abandon individual attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine," Zelenskyy said in a post on X. Despite Putin's declaration of an Easter ceasefire on Saturday, Zelenskyy said Ukrainian forces had recorded 59 instances of Russian shelling and five assaults by units across various areas along the front line, as well as "dozens" of drone strikes. Zelenskyy emphasized that Russia must fully adhere to the ceasefire conditions and reiterated Ukraine's offer to extend the truce for 30 days, starting Sunday midnight. Late on Saturday, Russia-installed officials in the partially occupied Ukrainian region of Kherson said Ukrainian forces continued their attacks. "Ukrainian troops continue to strike peaceful cities in the Kherson region, violating the Easter truce," Moscow-appointed governor Vladimir Saldo wrote on his Telegram channel. Just hours after the Russian president announced the ceasefire, he attended an Easter service late Saturday at Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Saviour led by Patriarch Kirill, head of the Russian Orthodox Church and a vocal supporter of Putin and the war in Ukraine. Putin announced the temporary ceasefire, citing humanitarian reasons. According to the Kremlin, the ceasefire will last from 6 p.m. Moscow time (1500 GMT) on Saturday to midnight (2100 GMT) following Easter Sunday. Putin offered no details on how the ceasefire would be monitored or whether it would cover airstrikes or ongoing ground battles that rage around the clock. His ceasefire announcement came after U.S. President Donald Trump said Friday negotiations between Ukraine and Russia are "coming to a head" and insisted that neither side is "playing" him in his push to end the grinding three-year war.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some Canadian retailers aren't playing nice about US imports anymore. They've escalated from simply labeling products made in Canada to singling out American-made products with a warning label "T" for "tariffs." Loblaw Companies Ltd., which operates about 2,400 stores across Canada, announced on March 10 that it planned to roll out the 'T' label on US-imported goods that may have been subject to a tariff-related price increase. As the warning labels have been slowly rolled out over the last month, shoppers have noticed and are buying accordingly. An April 17 Leger poll found that 76% of Canadians have increased their purchases of locally made and sourced goods in recent weeks, representing the highest number of respondents looking to buy Canadian goods since the market research firm began tracking the behavior in mid-February. Business Insider previously reported that Canadians have seen a surge in patriotism since President Donald Trump, in mid-March, made comments about making the 158-year-old nation the 51st US state — and that patriotism is reflected in the grocery aisle. "All the grocery stores now have Canadian and American labelled produce — and the Canadian produce is always gone," Vancouver-based shopper Isabella Zavarise told BI. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported that small grocery stores, in particular, are seeing price increases related to the tariffs being exchanged between the US and Canada, and the country's consumer price index rose 2.3% year over year in March, following an increase of 2.6% in February. Prices of American imports have skyrocketed — 100ml of Tropicana orange juice is listed for $13.99 at Metro stores, another Canadian chain — but even locally-made goods have seen increases, the outlet reported. The US and its Northern neighbor have been locked in an escalating trade dispute over Trump's aggressive trade strategy, which, as of March 13, levied tariffs of 25% on many Canadian consumer goods and 10% on energy product imports from Canada.</p>
