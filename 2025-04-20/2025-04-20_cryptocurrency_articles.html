                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ConstitutionDAO But for the Apocalypse: Solana NFT Project Aims to Buy Nuclear Bunker Remember when ConstitutionDAO tried (and failed) to buy a copy of the U.S. Constitution? To do this, 100,000 Billionaire Bunker Club NFTs will be offered for sale at $14 a pop in an attempt to raise $1.4 million, with NFT holders forming a decentralized autonomous organization or DAO collective that will vote on what to do with the property. The site spans 1.4 acres with a nuclear bunker and former reservoir, according to SDL Property Auctions, and was built in 1960 to act as a British Royal Observer Corps (ROC) Cold War monitoring post. Planning permission has already been secured for the site by its current owners to turn it into a luxury home with two floors of “cathedral-type ceilings,” a large glass frontage, and views across the Leicestershire countryside. ConstitutionDAO eventually refunded its participants, which Meatbags has also pledged to do if it can't secure the aforementioned bunker or an alternative site within six months of its bid being rejected. But other DAO-driven efforts have had more success fulfilling their aims—such as LinksDAO, which purchased the Spey Bay Golf Club in Scotland in 2023 and is overhauling the site. Robert, the pseudonymous co-founder and CEO of Meatbags creator Dead Bruv, told Decrypt that the team has scoped out a couple of alternatives already, some of which are also in the United Kingdom—but they're open to landing a site elsewhere, too. Either I think it will turn into a tourist attraction, or I think it could also go down the route of being an insane property on Airbnb,” Robert told Decrypt. “Ultimately, it'll come down to what the DAO votes [for].” Meatbags is a narrative-driven NFT project about doomsday preppers living in a world that is coming to an end, called Surviville, which mirrors real-world concerns like war tensions, global pandemics, and the rise of powerful AI. Aside from participating in the DAO, Billionaire Bunker Club holders will also receive an on-chain land deed verifying that they own a share of the bunker, and will be invited to an opening party. SDL Property Auctions did not respond to Decrypt's request for comment. The site is currently listed for a guide price of over £650,000 (or about $862,000) plus fees. Meatbags aims to raise $1.4 million so it can also refurbish the place, create wiggle room for negotiating, and pay management, operating, and legal fees incurred throughout the campaign. Billionaire Bunker Club NFTs will go on sale on Monday at 8am ET, with users able to purchase using Solana Pay or credit card via the Dead Bruv website. ConstitutionDAO fell short of its own goal, and attempting to sell 100,000 NFTs in 2025 at any price might seem like a Herculean task. Even so, the team is confident in its chances to pull this off. “I'm about as optimistic as you can be when betting on crypto and the apocalypse at the same time,” pseudonymous co-founder and creative director Psychrome told Decrypt.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The arrival of an altcoin season is often tied to Bitcoin's performance. As money flows out of BTC and into altcoins, this triggers a rise in altcoin prices. One such factor is the recent surge in token generation events (TGEs). In the past four and a half months, 45 new tokens have launched, with most failing to provide decent returns. Many tokens launched in 2025 failed to sustain growth post-listing, raising the question of whether this trend is driven by bearish macroeconomic conditions or the lack of fundamental value in these tokens. Talking to BeInCrypto, Vincent Liu, CIO of Kronos Research, shed light on this question. “Relentless token launches, especially meme coins, diluted liquidity and fragmented investor attention. Simultaneously, macro headwinds like rising interest rates and a global shift to risk-off sentiment throttled speculative capital. Tokens lacking utility, clear roadmaps, or sustainable ecosystems were quickly repriced in line with growing investor skepticism,” Liu explained. One of the few successful launches with strong ROI has been Solayer (LAYER). Since its February launch, LAYER has posted an 88% rise and is currently trading just under $2.00. Rapid token launches and post-listing failures are contributing to the delay. However, Liu noted that niche categories like AI-linked tokens continue to show strong demand despite the broader market conditions. “While a full-fledged altcoin season hasn't materialized, niche categories like AI-integrated meme coins and emerging tech narratives have shown signs of strength. Arthur Cheong, founder and CEO of DeFiance Capital, recently raised concerns over TGEs. He highlighted the risk of projects and market makers working together to inflate token prices artificially. “You don't know whether the price is a result of organic demand and supply or simply due to projects and market makers colluding to fix the price for other objectives. Absolutely bizarre that CEXs are turning a blind eye to this and altcoin markets are becoming more and more like a lemon market where confidence gets lesser,” Cheong tweeted. “…the issue of artificially inflated token prices before launch presents a growing concern. While these short-term surges might attract initial attention, they often undermine long-term investor confidence. To mitigate this, the industry must champion greater transparency around partner agreements, listing criteria, and pre-launch disclosures. Liu believes addressing this problem requires collaboration from market makers, centralized exchanges (CEXs), and investors. “By conducting thorough research into the fundamentals of new projects, investors can protect themselves from significant losses and identify valuable tokens in the long run,” Liu concluded.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin exchange order book liquidity analysis suggests that BTC price action may make a break for lower levels before challenging sellers at $90,000. Bitcoin (BTC) tapped 3-day lows into the April 20 weekly close as analysis warned of a fresh liquidity grab next. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD dropping 1.5% to $83,974 on the day before rebounding. Investigating the current liquidity setup across exchange order books, popular analyst Mark Cullen was particularly skeptical of $83,000. BUT, i think the 83k level isn't safe, those lows from last Sunday and Wednesday are likely to get run first,” he summarized on X. I think next week will get interesting as the charts are quite compressed. Any decent good/bad headline could spark a pretty large move I think. Even if its just from positions getting squeezed,” popular trader Daan Crypto Trades continued. An accompanying chart showed BTC price action relative to the latest closing point of CME Group's Bitcoin futures, potentially inviting the creation of a “gap” that could provide a short-term price magnet. “If volume is decreasing on the way to 76k, I'll take longs,” he told X followers. Updating readers on the daily chart, popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital had good news. Related: Bitcoin can reach $138K in 3 months as macro odds see BTC price upside Bitcoin, he confirmed, had definitively broken out of a multimonth downtrend without violating it during retests as support.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The price action for XRP and bitcoin (BTC) resembles a tightly compressed spring on the verge of uncoiling with a sudden release of energy. That's the message from a key volatility indicator called Bollinger Bandwidth. Bollinger Bands are volatility bands set at plus two and minus two standard deviations above and below the 20-period moving average (SMA) of an asset's market price. The 4-hour chart interval is quite popular in the 24/7 crypto market, allowing traders to analyze and predict short-term price movements. Bitcoin's 4-hour chart mirrors the Bollinger band width pattern in XRP. During these calm phases, the market accumulates energy that is eventually released once a clear direction is established, often leading to dramatic rallies or sharp price declines. Both XRP and bitcoin surged in November-December following an extended range-bound period that left their bandwidth at levels comparable to those observed today. For example, the bands tightened in October 2022, signaling a significant move ahead, which materialized on the downside after FTX went bust. It remains to be seen whether this latest spring compression will trigger bullish volatility or lead both tokens into a tailspin. The recent hawkish comments from Federal Reserve's Chairman Jerome Powell and selling by some whales favor the latter. Omkar holds small amounts of bitcoin, ether, BitTorrent, tron and dot.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin and crypto prices are treading water after U.S. president Donald Trump's trade war sparked market chaos that's threatening to spiral into a full-blown “U.S. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has plummeted from its January peak of almost $110,000 per bitcoin, dropping along with the stock market, as crypto hurtles toward a $19 trillion “tipping point.” Now, as billionaire Ray Dalio warns the U.S. is teetering on the verge of a financial crisis and recession that could be worse than 2008, the White House has confirmed Trump is exploring whether he can fire Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell—something that could trigger an “apocalyptic scenario" for markets. This week, Trump posted to his Truth Social account that “Powell's termination cannot come fast enough” after Powell reiterated his intention to keep interest rates on hold due to uncertainty over Trump's tariff trade war. Last month, influential Democratic Party senator Elizabeth Warren said Trump could try to fire Powell, ominously warning, “nobody is safe.” “Overall, it would almost be like an apocalyptic scenario for the market.” The bitcoin price has diverged from gold, which has rocketed to all-time highs as traders flee to the traditional safe haven, though some have predicted bitcoin will ultimately benefit and begin trading as “digital gold.” “Powell continues to sit on the fence with the ‘we'll wait and see' approach because he still believes tariffs will lead to higher inflation,” bitcoin and crypto investor Lark Davis wrote in his Wealth Mastery newsletter. "Only time will tell but firing Powell risks bringing even more uncertainty to markets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum's price continues to consolidate within a descending channel. The $1,600 support level has experienced increased buying pressure. The market awaits possible confirmation of this breakout because it could push Ethereum to test higher price levels with a $4,000 target. Analysts predict a positive trend that strengthens the overall bullish sentiment around Ethereum. If Ethereum successfully breaks out above the current consolidation zone and maintains its support level, it could mark the start of a new upward price trend. The current market movement mirrors Ethereum's price action in 2020. Ethereum experienced a major price increase after breaking out from its consolidation zone. Historical data indicates that Ethereum is following a similar pattern, which could trigger an upward price surge. In 2020, the Ethereum price consolidated around $215 before a decisive breakout to $1,000. Analysts predict that the current Ethereum consolidation phase around $2,100 could trigger a similar price action. Global liquidity trends have a substantial impact on Ethereum's price performance. Previous market cycles show that Ethereum price maintains an inverse correlation with Bitcoin and global liquidity. The market participants continue to monitor liquidity indicators to detect any reversal in the current downward trend of Ethereum's price against Bitcoin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With blockchain entering a new cycle of regulation, real-world adoption, and decentralized breakthroughs, people across South America are watching this shift with eagle eyes. From São Paulo to Buenos Aires, blockchain developers and digital asset communities are shifting their attention to projects solving real problems—not just adding noise. As crypto tariffs shake markets and China's crackdown backfires, there's an urgent push toward coins delivering utility, not just hype. And five names are being whispered everywhere—from Telegram alpha groups to dev subreddits. While older chains promised change, Qubetics is already delivering it. It's powering real-world asset tokenization, streamlining global finance, and setting new standards for how Web3 should connect people, protocols, and platforms. Let's break down why this, and four other top-tier tokens, are being called the best crypto to join now. With over 508 million tokens sold, the best crypto presale tally of $16.2 million, and more than 24,900 token holders, Qubetics isn't just gaining traction—it's building the rails for tomorrow's Web3 economy. As the world's first Web3 aggregator, it's connecting dApps, chains, data, and financial tools into one seamless ecosystem. What's shaking up the market is its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. Imagine small manufacturers tokenizing equipment to secure cross-border loans, logistics firms fractionalizing fleet assets for shared ownership, or even independent developers turning digital code into legally recognized collateral. Qubetics lets participants tokenize, verify, and trade real assets on-chain. Right now, Qubetics ($TICS) is cruising through its 30th presale stage, with each token priced at $0.1729. Let's break it down with a $200 investment scenario. At the current price, $200 fetches approximately 1,157 $TICS tokens. Now imagine holding tight until $TICS hits $1—your $200 would flip into $1,157, delivering a 478% ROI. And if Qubetics hits $15, you're staring at a mind-blowing $17,355, an 8,568% return from just $200. Because Qubetics is solving real problems with scalable tech, giving early community members a front-row seat to one of the best crypto to join now. Fast, climate-friendly, and built for the next-gen Web3 world, Near Protocol is doing more than just flexing speed—it's changing how people build decentralized apps. Its Nightshade sharding architecture allows for super low fees, and it auto-scales based on network traffic. That means builders don't need to worry about congestion or high gas fees derailing their dApps. In Latin America, dev teams are already choosing Near for its ease of use, strong dev community, and clean integration into real-world fintech applications. Whether it's payment rails, digital IDs, or localized DeFi apps, Near is quietly becoming the go-to layer for scalability. It's also partnering with big-name brands and bringing more users into the decentralized space without them even knowing they're on-chain. You might not have heard of Astra unless you're tapped into alpha circles—but that's exactly what makes it such a wild card. Astra focuses on decentralized compliance, bridging the gap between Web3 and real-world financial regulations. Its mission is bold: make DeFi protocols 100% compliant without giving up decentralization. It's working with European regulators and integrating on-chain KYC/AML layers without compromising user privacy. Astra is gaining momentum as a decentralized AI protocol bridging real-time computation with secure data ownership. As Web3 gaming shifts from flashy trailers to actual play-to-earn ecosystems, Immutable is becoming the playground of choice for developers and studios alike. Built on top of Ethereum with ZK-rollups, it offers instant trade confirmation, high scalability, and zero gas fees for NFT creation or transfers. From Latin America to Southeast Asia, gaming economies are booming, and Immutable is the one enabling real ownership. No longer do players need to just spend—they can now own, trade, and profit. Immutable's marketplace is buzzing, and it's ready for explosive growth. Immutable X continues to dominate the NFT and gaming layer-2 scene with lightning-fast, gas-free transactions. While most blockchains parade transparency, Monero marches to the beat of privacy. In countries where financial surveillance is growing, Monero's untraceable transactions are becoming a powerful shield. Monero isn't flashy, but it's quietly used across industries and geographies that demand financial privacy. When things get turbulent, Monero becomes the escape hatch. Because it's the privacy-first giant in a world tilting toward surveillance, easily making it one of the best crypto to join now. That's not just innovation—it's survival for people in unstable economic zones. Monero remains the go-to choice for privacy maximalists, offering unmatched anonymity in an era of growing surveillance. With tariffs, crackdowns, and regulation storms stirring up chaos, the only way forward is aligning with projects offering real innovation. That's where Qubetics, Near, Astra, Immutable X, and Monero come in—each building solid foundations for different pieces of the decentralized puzzle. For those watching from Latin America and beyond, the timing couldn't be sharper. With Qubetics still in presale and the others gearing up for game-changing partnerships and updates, this lineup isn't about catching up—it's about getting in early. These five names aren't riding hype—they're setting the new benchmarks for what it means to be part of the best crypto to join now. What is the best crypto to join now for long-term ROI in 2025? Qubetics ($TICS) is topping lists thanks to its real-world asset tokenization utility and impressive ROI potential, especially during its presale phase. Why are real-world use cases important for crypto in 2025? Coins with actual use cases, like Qubetics and Astra, are more likely to survive regulations and achieve mass adoption, making them stronger plays for long-term gains. How do I know which are the best crypto to join now? Look at real utility, presale traction, partnerships, and community momentum.

In a recent podcast interview with CNBC, Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of both Ethereum and Cardano, suggested that Bitcoin (BTC -1.18%) could hit a price of $250,000 this year. That's an astounding 194% increase from its current price of $85,000. So what makes Hoskinson so confident that Bitcoin is poised for a major rally in the second half of 2025? As he points out, there are now 659 million crypto users worldwide. Crypto is a truly global phenomenon, so even if Bitcoin adoption in the United States stalls out due to the slowing of economic growth, there is still demand for it worldwide. As of March 31, it held 528,185 Bitcoins worth nearly $45 billion at today's prices, making it the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world. A growing number of companies are starting to follow in its footsteps, with the goal of boosting their stock market valuations by adding Bitcoin to the balance sheet. And not to be outdone, sovereign governments are also getting into the mix. President Donald Trump, who made Bitcoin part of his platform during the 2024 election, has been looking for new ways that the federal government can integrate crypto into the financial system. The first major piece of legislation will be one related to stablecoins, which have grown into a $200 billion industry. These two new pieces of legislation are important because the U.S. currently does not have any comprehensive framework for crypto, and has been forced to rely on a policy of "regulation by enforcement" by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The European Union, for example, recently put into place a comprehensive crypto framework called MiCA at the end of 2024. This new legislation is vital for another important reason: It will theoretically make crypto safe enough for America's biggest corporations. In fact, Hoskinson thinks several of the "Magnificent Seven" tech companies could start to get involved with crypto as soon as the new legislation goes into effect. These "digital dollars" could be the key to paying workers in different countries, while enabling faster and more efficient cross-border transactions. That might sound far-fetched for anyone new to crypto. However, as long as the price of Bitcoin goes up, momentum will build for major tech companies to embrace crypto. For example, in December, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) shareholders voted on a shareholder proposal calling on the company to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet. While Microsoft ultimately voted "no" on the proposal, it now looks like similar shareholder proposals could be on the way for other tech companies. Hoskinson also has some interesting thoughts on the current tariff uncertainty, and the threat of a looming trade war. As soon as the Fed lowers interest rates, it could lead to "cheap, fast money" pouring into crypto, thereby pushing up the price of Bitcoin. He's fully expecting a speculative crypto rally by September, which could lead to Bitcoin hitting that $250,000 price target by the end of 2025. There is also the storyline that's always been popular with crypto enthusiasts, based on a vision of the world where everyone owns crypto, and everything runs on blockchain rails. And, layered in on top of that, you have tariff uncertainty and the potential for a global trade war. Getting from a current price of $85,000 to $250,000 -- an epic 194% increase in price in less than eight months -- is a big ask. Dominic Basulto has positions in Bitcoin, Cardano, and Ethereum. The Motley Fool recommends the following options: long January 2026 $395 calls on Microsoft and short January 2026 $405 calls on Microsoft. Cost basis and return based on previous market day close.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the holidays, major crypto coins may consolidate, but some selected altcoins also gain popularity due to retail momentum and speculative interest during quieter trading periods. In this Easter Special, we bring you crypto easter eggs with the top 5 altcoins, which may see a surge in trading volume during this vacation.s Here is a price analysis of the top 5 altcoins, including XRP, Hyperliquid, Solana, Shiba Inu, and TRUMP, that may perform during this holiday period. The token's price is currently moving towards a significant resistance level between $2.20 and $2.40, which highlights a bullish market for XRP if momentum continues. The Relative Strength Index is around 47.10, which shows a neutral position with chances for upward movement. Experts predict that its price during the Easter holiday may range between $2.92 and $4.22. The reason behind this upward trend includes a historical trend that suggests a bullish movement of XRP in April and the upcoming launch of XRP Futures ETFs on April 30. SOL is the native currency of the Solana blockchain, which is currently trading at $139.60 with a market cap of $72.08 billion. Further, the Average Directional Index (ADX) is around 25.50, which also suggests a growing trend. The reasons behind this price prediction is due to an increase in institutional interest with the filing of the Solana ETF and a surge in on-chain activity, which bypassed Ethereum in total gas fees collection. HYPE is the native token of the Hyperliquid Layer-One blockchain, which is currently priced at $18.01 with a market cap of $6.05 billion. Its price has surged by 15% in the last 7 days, which shows a growing interest of investors in the HYPE token. Technical indicators also suggest bullish price movement with the Relative Strength Index range around 70, which shows increased activity, and ADX has risen from 15 to 19, which also suggests a growing trend. The reasons behind this optimistic prediction is its technological advancements with the launch of HyperEVM and increased activity on Hyperliquid DEX. Experts predicted that its price may range between $0.00003217 to $0.0000461 during the Easter holiday. This prediction is based on developments like continuous token burn and due to upcoming Shibarium upgrades. Technical indicators like RSI stand around 76, which shows a strong buying pressure, and ADX at 59 shows a strong upward trend. The reason behind this bullish prediction is due to pro-crypto policies and strategic announcements made by President Trump ever since he assumed office in January this year. As the Easter Holiday approaches, these 5 altcoins show a remarkable strength and may seen a massive surge during the Easter holidays. However, it is always considered best to do your own research before making any investment related decisions in the cryptocurrency market, due to its high volatility.
