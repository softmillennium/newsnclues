                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What if it could solve all of our energy problems? We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Nestled between Hawaii and the western coast of Mexico lies the Pacific Ocean's Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), a 4.5 million-kilometer-square area of abyssal plain bordered by the Clarion and Clipperton Fracture Zones. Although this stretch of sea is a vibrant ecosystem filled with marine life, the CCZ is known best for its immense collection of potato-sized rocks known as polymetallic nodules. These rocks, of which there are potentially trillions, are filled with rich deposits of nickel, manganese, copper, zinc, cobalt. However, a study reports that these nodules might be much more than simply a collection of valuable materials for electric cars—they also produce oxygen 4,000 meters below the surface where sunlight can't reach. The rocks could also rewrite the script on not only how life began on this planet, but also its potential to take hold on other worlds within our Solar System, such as Enceladus or Europa. “For aerobic life to begin on the planet,” Andrew Sweetman, deep-sea ecologist with the Scottish Association for Marine Science and lead author of the study said in a press statement, “there had to be oxygen and our understanding has been that Earth's oxygen supply began with photosynthetic organisms. I think we therefore need to revisit questions like: where could aerobic life have begun?” Taking note of the nodule's “battery in a rock” tagline, Sweetman wondered if the minerals found in these nodules were somehow acting as a kind of “geobattery” by separating hydrogen and oxygen via seawater electrolysis. A 2023 study showed that various bacteria and archaea can create “dark oxygen,” so Sweetman and his team recreated the conditions of the CCZ in a laboratory and killed off any microorganisms with mercury chloride—surprisingly, oxygen levels continued rising. According to Scientific American, Sweetman found a voltage of roughly 0.95 volts on the surface of these nodules, likely charging up as they grow with different deposits growing irregularly throughout, and this natural charge is enough to split the seawater. However, 25 countries want the governing body—the International Seabed Authority (ISA) Council—to implement a moratorium, or at the very least a precautionary pause, so more research can be conducted to see how mining these nodules could affect the ocean. This is especially vital considering that the world's seas are already facing a litany of climate challenges, including acidification, deoxygenation, and pollution. In response to this discovery, Scripps Institution of Oceanography's Lisa Levin, who wasn't involved with the study, highlighted why such a moratorium is so important for protecting these deep-sea nodules in a comment to the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition: The ISA is still negotiating with key players on deep-sea mining regulations. So while the future of the world's oceans is approaching a critical moment of conservation or exploitation, science has proven once again that disrupting these ecosystems could have consequences we can't even imagine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists have identified a genetic mechanism that could point to new ways of treating a rare but deadly fungal infection that has forced multiple hospital intensive care units to shut down. Candida auris is especially dangerous for people who are already critically ill, leaving hospitals highly exposed to outbreaks. This resistance makes treatment extremely challenging and allows the pathogen to persist in hospital wards. The infection was first detected in 2008, and its origin is still unknown. Since then, outbreaks have been reported in more than 40 countries, including the UK. Candida auris, also called Candidozyma auris, is now recognized as a serious global health threat and appears on the World Health Organization's critical priority fungal pathogens list. Researchers at the University of Exeter have now taken a major step forward by examining how genes are activated during Candida auris infection. This marks the first time such genetic activity has been studied in a living host using an approach based on fish larvae. It can be deadly for vulnerable patients, and health trusts have spent millions on the difficult job of eradication. One of the biggest obstacles in studying Candida auris has been its ability to survive high temperatures. When combined with its unusually strong tolerance for salt, this has led some researchers to suggest it may have originated in tropical oceans or marine animals. These traits also made it difficult to study using conventional laboratory models. To overcome this, the Exeter team developed a new infection model using Arabian killifish. During the experiments, researchers observed that Candida auris can change its shape by forming elongated fungal structures known as filaments. These structures may help the fungus search for nutrients while infecting a host. The team also analyzed which genes were activated or switched off during infection to identify possible weak points. Because iron is essential for survival, this process may represent a critical vulnerability. We now need to find out if this also occurs during human infection. The fact that we found genes are activated to scavenge iron gives clues to where Candida auris may originate, such as an iron-poor environment in the sea. It also gives us a potential target for new and already existing drugs." He said: "While there are a number of research steps to go through yet, our finding could be an exciting prospect for future treatment. The Arabian killifish larvae model was developed with support from an NC3Rs project grant as an alternative to using mouse and zebrafish models, which are commonly used to study interactions between pathogens and their hosts. Dr. Katie Bates, NC3Rs Head of Research Funding, said: "This new publication demonstrates the utility of the replacement model to study Candida auris infection and enable unprecedented insights into cellular and molecular events in live infected hosts. The paper is titled 'Xenosiderophore transporter gene expression and clade-specific filamentation in Candida auris killifish (Aphanius dispar) infection' and is published in the Nature portfolio journal Communications Biology.

Nature Neuroscience (2025)Cite this article Parcellation of the cerebral cortex into functionally modular brain areas is foundational to cognitive and systems neuroscience. Here, we question the central status of brain areas from the perspectives of neuroanatomy and electrophysiology. We argue that the major ostensible determinants of brain function, such as cytoarchitecture and connectivity, seldom produce convergent parcellations. Brain areas themselves are just one of several equally important organizing principles; others include macroscale gradients, distributed networks, layers, columns and patches. We further argue that the evidence for a close correspondence between areal parcellation and cognitive function is weaker than is generally supposed. Indeed, many important cognitive functions appear to be implemented in a broadly distributed manner, whereas others appear to obey organizations that have little relationship to brain areas, including distributed networks and functional gradients. We conclude by suggesting a set of guiding principles for performing systems and cognitive neuroscience without the intellectual foundation provided by arealization.

Transition metal complexes have found many applications in the modern world ranging from catalysts, luminescent materials to bioactive compounds and more. However, methods for the systematic synthesis and evaluation of large numbers of metal compounds at a time are still limited. Here, a high-throughput combinatorial approach using copper(I)-catalyzed alkyne–azide cycloaddition chemistry is implemented to make 192 bidentate pyridyl-1,2,3-triazole ligands. This ligand library is coordinated to five metal scaffolds under mild conditions to yield 672 metal compounds, allowing for an accelerated exploration of the transition metal complex chemical space. The prepared libraries are showcased for compound discovery in antimicrobial applications through a “Direct-to-Biology” approach, with selected libraries further tested for catalytic and photophysical properties. Six promising metalloantibiotics are identified and re-synthesized, exhibiting activity against Gram-positive bacteria in the nanomolar range with favorable therapeutic windows. Two iridium complexes are selected from a transfer hydrogenation screening assay and re-synthesized, with one showing high catalytic activity. This methodology represents a significant step forward in the field of metal-based combinatorial chemistry and its application towards the systematic coverage of vast chemical spaces in the search for molecules with optimized properties. The Copper(I)-catalyzed Alkyne–Azide cycloaddition (CuAAc Click) reaction to form substituted 1,2,3-triazoles (hereafter referred to as “triazoles”) is one of the cornerstones of modern chemistry1,2,3,4. Functional group tolerance, bio-compatible coupling conditions and high yields make it a powerful transformation. Although mostly used as a convenient way of linking molecular fragments together, it is possible for the resulting triazole unit to bind to metal centers as a ligand. This coordination opens up avenues for catalysis and complexes with highly tunable photophysical properties5,6. Incorporation of a pyridine or other lone pair donating group to the triazole compound enables formation of bidentate ligands, which are able to chelate metal centers effectively via 5- and 6-membered metallocycles (Fig. The binding modes of these ligands can be varied by switching the substitution site on the triazole ring (through different pyridine/azide structures), giving ligands with substantially different chemistries8. Coordination tends to occur through the more electron rich N3, giving more stable complexes, while coordination through the more electron deficient N2 is much rarer and can cause instability in complexes (Fig. Triazoles can also coordinate to metals as N-heterocyclic carbenes rather than through the N donors10. (Top) pyridyl-triazole ligand potential building blocks, numbering convention used in this paper and coordination modes to metal centres8. (Bottom) Previous examples of pyridyl-triazole metal complexes for a range of applications; A Re-based sulfonamide anchored complex15; B tris(homoleptic) Ru complexes16; C tis(homoleptic) mer-Os complex17; D Mn(CO)3-Clotrimazole complex19; E RuCy complex with a coordinated sugar derivative20; F cyclometallated IrCN complex21. From our perspective, the coordination chemistry of these triazole ligands holds great promise for the development of metal-based antibiotics11. This area is becoming increasingly relevant due to the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to the current arsenal of antibiotics, which has been designated by the WHO as one of the top global health threats12,13. Concurrently, there are very few antibiotics being developed, with only 19 antibacterial drugs being approved for use between 2013 and 2023, and of these only 2 represent a new chemical class14. There have been several examples of bidentate pyridyl-triazole ligands being used for therapeutic applications, from using CuAAc-formed triazoles to anchor sulfonamide drugs to metal centers (increasing activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Fig. 1A)15, to using bidentate triazole ligands directly in forming tris-homoleptic ruthenium [Ru(L)3]2+ complexes (showing broad spectrum antibiotic properties, Fig. 1B)16, tris-homoleptic osmium mer-[Os(L)3]2+ complexes (photoactive against MRSA, Fig. Additionally, similar bidentate pyridyl-triazoles have been coordinated to a manganese(I) tricarbonyl scaffold, utilizing Clotrimazole as an axial ligand, and were demonstrated to be active against Gram-negative bacteria (Fig. In terms of other therapeutical applications, a ruthenium(II) arene (Fig. 1E) scaffold was coordinated to derivatized sugar pyridyl-triazole ligands (selective activity against ovarian cancer cells)20, and pyridyl-triazole ligands were used to coordinate cyclometallated iridium(III) scaffolds, generating several compounds with photoluminescence properties (Fig. These could be relevant for photodynamic therapy applications against either bacteria or cancer cells, similar to recent work on cyclometallated complexes by Kench et al. 22,23. Platinum compounds containing triazole ligands or linkers have also been investigated for anticancer therapy24. Although an impressive array of compounds has been made utilizing triazole ligands25, it should be noted is that in almost all cases, only a handful of individual complexes have been synthesized and tested for their intended applications. One of the reasons for this is the synthesis of the triazole ligand, which requires an azide to be generated as a precursor. Azide formation typically occurs in batch via a reaction between sodium azide and an aryl/alkyl bromide, requiring forcing conditions and undesirable solvents, and can generate significant impurities26,27. Recent developments by Meng et al.28 have opened the door to high-throughput synthesis of this class of ligands through sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEx) chemistry under ambient conditions, efficiently generating azides in situ from virtually any primary amine (Fig. We envisaged that this methodology could be used to generate substantial and varied libraries of pyridyl-triazole based ligands. Notably, these ligands offer stability benefits over Schiff-base type counterparts, which are prone to hydrolysis and degradation in the presence of acid or base. Coordination of this library to various metal scaffolds in a similar vein to previous work by our group and others using combinatorial chemistry approaches with Schiff-base ligands29,30,31 would allow us to create libraries of complexes. These could in turn be screened for antibacterial hits, toxicity towards mammalian cells and other potential areas of discovery such as catalysis and photophysical applications. Conditions for i) Amine (80 mM) FSO2N3 (1.05 equiv. ), MTBE/DMSO/H2O (11:84:5), r.t., 18 h; conditions for ii) Alkyne (80 mM, 1 equiv. ), sodium ascorbate (0.5 equiv), CuSO4 (2.5 mol%), (BimH)3 (2.5 mol%), DMSO/H2O (3:1), r.t., 18 h; to give the triazole library at 20 mM concentration (for more details, see Supporting Information Section 2.1). Details of the coordination of the triazole libraries with metal can be found in Fig. To rapidly cover and focus in on the vast chemical space represented by this chemistry, we have turned to a “Direct-to-Biology” screening approach, which has been successfully used across academia and industry22,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41. This approach involves the high-throughput synthesis and characterization of compound libraries, followed by biological testing of reaction crudes without purification. Concurrently, the reaction components (in our case metal scaffolds and ligands) are tested to support that any observed biological activity is likely from the putative metal complex. There are potential issues with impurities having an outsized effect in these assays, so high yielding reactions, such as those typically used in combinatorial chemistry are favored29,30,31. As a result, while it is possible to get false positives with a Direct-to-Biology approach, false negatives are rare. The final step is hit validation, where target compounds which showed promising properties in the crude-screening are re-synthesized and purified, and finally re-tested to confirm their biological activity. Overall, Direct-to-Biology represents a powerful screening technique that allows for coverage of a large amount of chemical space quickly, reduces time wasted in making inactive compounds, and funnels down to a small number of compounds with desirable properties. A similar approach can also be taken with photophysical and catalytic testing42,43. We began by optimizing the conditions described by Meng et al.28 for the in situ generation of azides from primary amines, followed by CuAAc Click reactions with 2-alkynepyridines. Initially, significant alcohol impurities were observed, but this was remedied by changing the copper ligand from tris-hydroxypropyltriazolylmethylamine (THPTA) to tris(2-benzimidazolylmethyl)amine (BimH)3. Additionally, we found that the reported phosphate buffer was not required in our system, and low catalyst/ligand loadings of 2.5 mol% were sufficient. With the optimized conditions in hand, we used an Opentrons liquid handling robot to generate a library of 96 triazole-4-pyridine (Tz-4-P) compounds (24x amines, 4×2-alkynepyridines, Fig. The success of these couplings was verified by Liquid Chromatography coupled Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS, Fig. A further library of 96 triazole-1-methylpyridine (Tz-1-MP) compounds (12x alkynes, 8×2-picolylamines, Fig. 3B) was prepared using the same method. Under the same conditions, we also attempted to couple 2-aminopyridine with alkynes to generate a Tz-1-P library, but this was unsuccessful. Overview of amine and alkyne building blocks utilized for the Tz-4-P (A) and Tz-1-MP (B) libraries and synthetic schemes and conditions for the coordination of Tz-4-P and Tz-1-MP libraries to metal scaffolds to form the metal complex libraries. Sol = solvent, Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, BeMeIm = 1-methylbenzimidazole, ppy = 2-phenylpyridine. Purity as ascertained by peak area% of the total from LC-MS data (254 nm). Compound peaks were identified automatically using the mass of the target ion and the corresponding UV peak was automatically integrated by custom Python scripts (Supporting Information Section 2.9). RuCy library conversions were normalized to 100% due to low UV response at 254 nm, and the conversions of IrCp* libraries is an aggregate of the parent ion (M+) and the MeCN adduct (M2+) peaks. The average conversion efficiency (as determined by automated LC-MS chromatogram integration at 254 nm)44 was 75 ± 16%, showing that despite the structural diversity of the amines a generally high conversion efficiency was observed (Fig. In terms of trends across the formation of this library, the electron withdrawing ester group on M11 tended to lead to lower conversions (both for the initial click reaction, and for subsequent coordination), although other electron deficient amines (M13, M17) seem to form ligands in high yielding reactions comparable to electron rich systems (M12, M19). The LC-MS traces of ligands containing 7-aminocephalosporanic acid and ampicillin (M15, M16, respectively) were not as clean as the others, and it was found that these ligands and their metal compounds slowly degrade over time in solution (See Supporting Information (SI) Figs. However, it was decided to include them in further testing as they represented more complex structures with β-lactam motifs, and ideally the coordination of these derivatives to metal centers would enhance their biological effects45. On a practical level, it was discovered that several of the target ligands were poorly soluble in DMSO and tended to precipitate or crystallize out of solution. This was especially prevalent among Y4 ligands, where the pyridyl bromine group seems to have significantly affected solubility. This was remedied by pulverizing the affected samples through sonication and aspirating the mixture to homogenize it before dispensing the ligands for further reactions. Similarly, the Tz-1-MP library was synthesized with a high average conversion efficiency (77 ± 12 %), with no noticeable degradation of the products (Fig. Initial tests included two aliphatic alkynes (cyclohexylacetylene and cyclopropylacetylene), but the products of these reactions were not observable by LC-MS. As these alkynes also exhibited problematic volatility, the building blocks were restricted to aromatic alkynes only. These were in turn limited to relatively simple derivatives, which demonstrates a limitation of using aromatic alkynes (Tz-1-MP) compared to primary amines (Tz-4-P) for triazole formation. Conversely, the use of picoline-derived amines allowed for a substantially larger variety in the pyridine fragment of the ligand compared to the Tz-4-P library, with several halogenated derivatives included. Although the structural variety of the Tz-1-MP library is not as broad as Tz-4-P, the overall conversion is comparable, with only A3 (highly electron-deficient p-nitro group) and P4 showing consistently lower conversions. No solubility issues were observed with the Tz-1-MP library. Purity as ascertained by peak area% of the total from LC-MS data (254 nm). Compound peaks were identified automatically using the mass of the target ion and the corresponding UV peak was automatically integrated by custom Python scripts (Supporting Information Section 2.9). RuCy library conversions were normalized to 100% due to low UV response at 254 nm, and the conversions of IrCp* library is an aggregate of the parent ion (M+) and the MeCN adduct (M2+) peaks. After test coordination reactions using M4Y1 to optimize conditions, the entire Tz-4-P library was coordinated to the following metal scaffolds (Fig. These scaffolds were chosen due to their previously demonstrated biological activities and their amenability to combinatorial chemistry19,23,30,31. Both manganese and rhenium scaffolds were pre-activated with silver triflate, and solvent libraries without 1-benzyl-2-methylimidazole (BeMeIm) as the axial ligand were also generated as controls. The reaction mixtures for the five different metal complex libraries were set up simultaneously in a semi-automated high-throughput manner using the Opentrons OT2 liquid handling robot. Coordination of the Tz-4-P library to the IrCN scaffold was achieved under conditions far less forcing than current literature procedures, which require toxic, high boiling point solvents, temperatures >150 °C, or microwave conditions22,42. In our procedure, high conversion was achieved by heating the ligands and [Ir(ppy)2Cl]2 dimer in a 1:1 mixture of DMSO:H2O at 60 °C for 18 h. IrCp* and RuCy libraries were generated in good purity under ambient conditions. The IrCp* library is being explored in an ongoing project for biological activity, so will not be discussed further here. For the Re(CO)3 library, poor conversion to the target complexes was initially obtained (1:2 MeOH/DMSO, 70 °C, 18 h). After addition of an excess of MeOH, the reaction crudes were left standing for one week at room temperature to allow for the solvent to evaporate, giving significantly improved product formation. This is likely due to DMSO solvent competitively binding with the rhenium scaffold instead of BeMeIm. A similar effect was observed for the Mn(CO)3 library, as when conversion is low, the byproduct is often the solvent adduct (e.g. Mn(CO)3M2Y3, see Supporting Information Figs. Previously, our group has shown that manganese(I) carbonyl complexes with solvent as the axial ligand tend to have low antibacterial activity31. Manganese(I) tricarbonyl complexes are often light-sensitive, so this library was prepared, handled, tested and stored in the dark. Test coordination to the same scaffolds using Tz-1-MP (P1A1) implied that DMSO bound competitively with all metal centers, preventing coordination in many situations, even at elevated temperatures. The exception to this was the [IrCp*Cl2]2 scaffold, which yielded product and led to the creation of an IrCp* library (Fig. In addition, excess EtOH with [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2 gave the desired complexation with P1A1 in high yields, so the corresponding RuCy library was prepared with the Tz-1-MP ligands (Fig. Generally, rigid 5-membered rings are significantly more stable than 6-membered rings due to fewer degrees of freedom and a more optimum “bite angle” (the angle between the donor groups and the metal center)46. More specific examples involving Tz-1-MP scaffolds from Urankar et al. show that under certain coordination conditions, these ligands can bind in a monodentate fashion through the triazole ring (to palladium) rather than a chelating effect47. Maisonial et al. similarly demonstrated that for triazoles with a pendant primary amine, 5-membered chelates were significantly more stable when coordinated to platinum than 6-membered metallocycles48. Typically for metal-based combinatorial synthesis, libraries are only partially characterized (either random representative samples or predetermined subsets, e.g. using 19F NMR for fluorine containing compounds) to reduce the time-consuming characterization step to a more practical level29,42,43. In our case, the charged nature of the metal complexes makes them amenable to characterization by LC-MS, a technique that itself can be highly automated both in collection and assessment of the data (see Supporting Information Section 2.9). Therefore, the purity and identity of all compounds were assessed and the processed LC-MS spectra, target complex percentage conversion and retention times are supplied as Supplementary Data 1 with this article. For Mn(CO)3, and to a lesser extent the Re(CO)3 library, Y2 containing ligands were consistently poor at coordination. This could be due to steric clashing of the pyridine methyl group with the axial ligands during coordination. Similarly, Y4 containing ligands performed poorly, possibly due to the lower solubility of the ligands, or electron withdrawing effect of the pyridyl para-bromine. Generally, ligands formed from simple aryl amines such as M8, M10 and M17 tended to coordinate most efficiently. Our data also indicates that M group sterics do not affect the yields, likely due to these groups being spatially removed from the metal center. Electronic effects seem to be more consequential, with strong electron donating units such as methoxy- and methyl-groups favored. Aliphatic groups from building blocks such as M1, M2 and M3 also coordinated well, again implying the prevalence of electronic effects on coordination over steric influences. As well as being a useful functionality in medicinal chemistry49, it was envisaged that the Thorpe-Ingold effect would be beneficial to coordination, both increasing rotational barriers and decreasing the bite angle of the ligand50. Instead, it appears that the steric bulk of the gem-dimethyl groups effectively inhibits chelation in P6 containing ligands. In most other cases, coordination of this library to the metal centers was reasonably successful, and the general high yielding formation of this ligand library by CuAAc reaction is a testament to the robustness of the optimized Click conditions. A range of fluorescence intensities was observed, but the maximum emission wavelength (λmax) was evidently dependent on the Y alkyne substituent (see Supporting Information, Fig. This indicates that chemical modifications on the pyridine (Y) are generally more electronically impactful than the amine modifications (M, affecting the triazole). The typical excitation and decay cycle of cyclometallated iridium(III) complexes involves excitation from the ground state to a singlet metal/ligand-ligand charge transfer excited state (MLLCT, dπ → π* transition), followed by intersystem crossing to a triplet 3MLLCT excited state. The decay of this pure excited state is often rapid and is a single peak with a roughly Gaussian distribution, such as observed in Y2 and Y4 complexes. To ascertain whether ROS was generated by the IrCN library, irradiation at 405 nm with ROS scavengers (ABDA (anthracenediyl-bis(methylene) dimalonic acid) and RNO/histidine (p-nitrosodimethylaniline)) was undertaken. ABDA was observed to degrade in the DMSO:PBS media, a previously reported effect upon irradiation below 450 nm51. Significantly less ROS was detected for all compounds compared to the Ru(bpy)32+ (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridyl) control using the RNO/histidine assay52. This suggests that ROS generation for these IrCN compounds is occurring at a lower rate. Altering the cyclometallated ligand may result in complexes with higher ROS-production rates. Following combinatorial work on ruthenium arene Schiff-base complexes by Weng et al., we tested the crude RuCy libraries for transfer hydrogenation (TH) catalysis using the Coumarin-N3 assay developed by the same group43. As Coumarin-N3 is hydrogenated to the amine, it becomes fluorescent, so the formation of the product can be monitored over time (Fig. The rationale behind this reaction is to take advantage of high formate concentrations in E. coli and S. aureus to hydrogenate azide pro-drugs in bacteria53. As can be seen in Fig. 6B, C, which shows the change in fluorescence (∆fl) intensity from TH catalyzed by the RuCy libraries, RuCy(Tz-4-P) type compounds (Fig. 6C) are generally more active than the RuCy(Tz-1-MP) library (Fig. 6B), with 3 compounds (M11Y2, M13Y2, M24Y2) all having a ∆fl > 15000 arb. units, comparable with active compounds reported by the Ang group. Interestingly, the most active compounds all contain the Y2 motif with an electron donating methyl group in the 2-position, which seems crucial for activity.

Traces and values are an average of 3 replicate reactions for each set of conditions. PBS = phosphate buffered saline, Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl. We additionally tested the crude IrCp* libraries for transfer hydrogenation in an assay adapted from Miller et al. for evaluating the activity of iridium-based artificial metalloenzymes using harmaline (Fig. Iridium-based TH systems tend to be the most active compared to other transition metal catalysts55, and for the harmaline assay this was demonstrated to be the case. Preliminary testing with the RuCy(Tz-1-MP) library showed no activity, while several of the IrCp*(Tz-4-P) (Fig. 6F) complexes showed high conversions of the harmaline starting material to product (measured by a change in absorbance (∆abs) at 384 nm corresponding to harmaline consumption, confirmed by LC-MS, Figs. In the cases where good conversions were observed, the electron donating methyl and methoxy groups (Y2, M14, M23) as well as bromine groups were present (Y4). This is in line with previous work in the field where small changes in ligands can have dramatic effects on the activity of the catalyst56. This can be ascribed to a complicated interplay of steps in TH, which first require abstraction of the coordinating chloride, formation of a hydride species (favored by electron rich ligands)57, substrate coordination (aided by labile ligands, often electron poor)58 and concurrent transfer of hydride (enhanced by electron rich ligands). Upon testing the IrCp*(Tz-1-MP) library (Fig. 6E), it became apparent that these catalysts were significantly more active than their Tz-4-P counterparts. As 6-membered chelates, they are more labile while remaining electron donating, which could explain the higher catalytic activity47,48. Additionally, the IrCp*(Tz-1-MP) library tended to have a greater proportion of MeCN adduct (M2+) peaks in the LC-MS traces than the IrCp*(Tz-4-P) library, indicating that halide abstraction is easier. As such, we decided to resynthesize and re-test two of the most active complexes, IrCp*(P1A7) and IrCp*(P4A11). The lability of 6-membered chelates meant that for both compounds, some free ligand was observed in solution by NMR spectroscopy even after purification. In the harmaline assay, only IrCp*(P4A11) demonstrated activity, on par with its crude. Upon examination of the crude LCMS of IrCp*(P1A7), there were a couple of significant impurities including free ligand and an unknown iridium(III) dimer, suggesting that the parent complex was not the catalytically relevant species. In contrast, the crude LCMS of IrCp*(P4A11) only showed the parent complex and the [solvato-iridium]2+ species (See Supporting Information Section 2.6 for LC-MS traces and kinetic graphs). Interestingly, both purified catalysts were active in the coumarin-N3 assay, with IrCp*(P4A11) displaying superior activity. Both catalysts surpassed the activity of the best crude RuCy catalysts (Table 1, ∆fl = 46056, 31295, 16505 arb. We further investigated the effect of exogenous chloride by testing the two pure catalysts in PBS 1X / H2O co-solvents with tBuOH, with and without halide extraction by AgOTf (Fig. As can be seen in Table 1, removing excess chloride accelerates the reaction in all cases, likely due to biasing the equilibrium towards the complex required for catalysis58. For IrCp*(P1A7), pre-activation with AgOTf did indeed accelerate the reaction (1.4x faster), even in the presence of exogenous chloride (1.1x faster) in the harmaline assay, suggesting that initial chloride abstraction is the key energetic barrier for this catalyst. On the contrary, in the same assay, IrCp*(P4A11) did not benefit from pre-activation in both water (no change) and PBS (1.4x slower), suggesting that a different part of the mechanistic cycle is the turnover-limiting step. We envisage that these catalysts could be applied to molecular uncaging in bacteria or even in mammalian cells43,56,59, but further mechanistic analysis and assay development would be required, which is beyond the scope of this work. Overall, we have demonstrated that these metal complex libraries can be rapidly assessed for photophysical and catalytic properties using 96 well plate-based assays under ambient conditions. We envisage that any property-screening assay that is amenable to a well plate format could be adapted to test these and other combinatorial metal complex libraries to identify ideal compounds. We are currently exploring further optimization of metal scaffolds in this area. With the main focus of our group being the exploration of transition metal complexes as antimicrobial agents, we advanced all the prepared libraries to an initial biological assessment, using a “Direct-to-Biology” approach. In a primary screening, all crude reaction mixtures were evaluated against two bacterial strains, one Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and one Gram-negative (Escherichia coli). As hit-rates against Gram-negative strains are generally much lower60, we decided to evaluate compounds against E. coli at 50 µM and against S. aureus at 12.5 µM and 50 µM to be able to better differentiate the level of activity. Metal-based compounds have a reputation of being generally toxic, although recent reports have questioned this assumption, at least in the realm of in vitro assays11. We therefore tested compounds against human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) at 50 µM. Amongst the 192 Tz-4-P and Tz-1-MP ligands, only one reduced the average viability of HEK293T cells below 50% (M12Y3, 45 ± 7% cell viability), showing that the ligands on their own are generally non-toxic (Fig. As M16 contains the broad-spectrum antibiotic ampicillin and the reactions to form those compounds had relatively lower conversion, the observation of some antibacterial activity is unsurprising. We conducted dose-dependent testing of these crudes against S. aureus to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the putative ligands and found them to be 50 µM for M7Y1 and M23Y3, while lower MICs of 12.5 µM and 3.13 µM were observed for the ampicillin containing triazole compounds. Preliminary testing on the metal complex precursors ([Ir(ppy)2Cl]2, [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2, Re(CO)5Cl, Mn(CO)5Br) showed that only [Ir(ppy)2Cl]2 had an MIC of 50 µM against S. aureus., with the rest having a values > 50 µM. Overall, almost all the ligands showed no significant antibacterial or cytotoxic properties, and alongside the lack of activity of the metal scaffolds, this allows us to assign any biological effects observed on the metal complex crudes to the putative metal complex with high confidence. For A–E, average % growth of HEK293T cells refers to the toxicity of the compounds at 50 µM (single dose, 2 biological and 2 statistical repeats). Any compounds under 50% (dashed line) are labelled as “toxic”. The circles on these graphs refer to whether the compounds had an MIC of ≤ 6.25 µM against S. aureus. The MIC heatmaps show at what concentration the compounds fully inhibit growth of S. aureus (2 biological and 2 statistical repeats). For F, G, only single dose response bacterial data were collected due to low activity, with OD600 (optical density at 600 nm) referring to the concentration of bacteria present after incubation (a low value is classed as “active”). All but one of the IrCN complexes showed antibacterial activity against S. aureus (Fig. However, none showed any appreciable effect on the growth of E. coli. This finding aligns with the general difficulty across the field of (metallo)antibiotic drug discovery to find compounds able to effectively penetrate the double-membrane and evade the efflux pumps of these pathogens61,62. Dose-dependent screening of the IrCN libraries against S. aureus revealed high antibacterial activity. The lowest MIC measured was 0.39 µM for four compounds which is comparable to the standard-of-care antibiotic vancomycin (MIC = 0.42 µM), which was used as a control. Overall, 59 out of 96 compounds displayed an MIC < 5 µM. A crucial parameter of any antibiotic is its selectivity for bacterial cells over healthy human cells, often denoted by the Therapeutic Index (TI). Unfortunately, most of the IrCN also significantly reduced human cell viability at 50 µM. However, given the very high level of antibacterial activity and the observation that the inhibition of a significant portion of the compounds was in the 25–50% range, we identified several compounds with a potentially viable therapeutic index of >10. The Re(CO)3 compounds similarly showed high levels of antibacterial activity in S. aureus, with 61 compounds completely inhibiting bacterial growth at 50 µM or lower (Fig. Most caused less than 50% growth inhibition in the HEK293T cells, while still having MICs as low as 0.78 µM. Comparing the Re(CO)3 and IrCN libraries, there is a clear mirroring of activity for individual ligands. Generally, if a Re(CO)3 complex with a given ligand is active, then the corresponding IrCN will be equally or more active. This is noteworthy as the ligands themselves are demonstrably not active and the two metal scaffolds are clearly distinct. For the Re(CO)3 library, there is a correlation between its activity and conversion efficiency. In terms of specific trends, Y2 and Y4-derived ligands are much less active for Re(CO)3 than IrCN, which can be ascribed to lower conversion efficiency in the former. Y1 and Y3-derived ligands are the most active for Re(CO)3, with active compounds having similar activity in both metal libraries. Indeed, M17–22 for Y3 shows almost identical activity for both Re(CO)3 and IrCN, which suggests that the identity of the metal scaffold is not necessarily important for activity. M5 (enantiopure (S)-1-phenyl-ethylamine)-derived ligands are the overall most active for Re(CO)3, and are similarly highly active for IrCN, while there was no or very low activity for: M2 (pendant amide, despite high conversions), M11 (phenyl-ester, which showed good activity for IrCN despite low conversions), M15 (β-lactam, poor conversions), and M23 (biaryl, also poor conversions). By contrast, the Mn(CO)3 compounds generally showed lower to no significant antibacterial properties than its congener library (Fig. Only 21 compounds showed any antibacterial activity against S. aureus and only 4 had an MIC < 10 µM. Nevertheless, the overall hit-rate of 21% is comparable to the hit-rate we previously observed in Mn(CO)3 Schiff-base libraries of 15.3%31. The hit-rate is also still much higher compared to what is generally found in purely organic molecule screening campaigns (~1%)62. At the same time, this compound class showed similar rates of cytotoxicity to rhenium, with half of all compounds causing cellular growth inhibition of less than 50% at 50 µM, and a handful causing greater than 75% growth inhibition. Lastly, the RuCy libraries with both Tz-4-P and Tz-1-MP ligands (Fig. 7F, G) showed the lowest level of antibacterial properties. Only a few of the RuTz-4-P compounds inhibited growth against S. aureus at 12.5 µM. This is in slight contrast to previous work on ruthenium p-cymene Schiff-base compounds, which have shown high hit-rates and significant antibacterial activity30,38,43,63. Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR, see Supporting Information Section 4) analysis was performed on the data gathered to gain insights into what features contribute most to activity and toxicity. A strong correlation between the retention time (RT) of the Tz-4-P library by LC-MS and calculated cLogP values for the ligands indicates that RT is a good descriptor for lipophilicity in these libraries. For the Re(CO)3 library, the active compounds tended to have a tighter range of RTs than non-active compounds, and the molecular weight (MW) was also important (low MW compounds tending to be more active). This is in line with guidance for organic antibiotics, which indicates that lighter and more polar molecules have better uptake in bacteria64. Conversely, a weak trend between MW and toxicity suggests that heavier compounds are less toxic. An analysis of the fraction of carbon sp3 character suggested that there is an optimum window that imparts high activity, which can be rationalized by the ligand structure affecting uptake into bacteria. There was also a clear correlation between the antimicrobial activity and toxicity of this library, with more active compounds being more toxic. However, at MIC 6.25 µM, most compounds are in the 50% viability range for HEK293T cells at 50 µM, so there is a good potential therapeutic window. For the IrCN library, the trends were not as clear, but there was a weak correlation between MW and activity, with more active compounds being lighter, as well as between MW and toxicity. There is also a weak positive correlation between activity and toxicity. For a given ligand, the IrCN complex tended to be significantly more active than the same Re(CO)3 compound, which was in turn more active than the Mn(CO)3 complex. Some further insights into more concrete structural contributors to antimicrobial activity in metal complexes were obtained by training a support vector machine machine learning (SVM-ML) model on the antibacterial activity data. The structures of rhenium and iridium metal complexes (which had the most interesting levels of antibacterial activity) were converted to a 598-bit ELECTRUM fingerprint based on our recent work65. Due to the limited dataset size of 192 compounds, we converted the antibacterial activity data into binary classification data (a compound was labelled active (“1”), if MIC value was ≤ 6.25 µM or inactive (“0”) otherwise), which is commonly done even for larger datasets of antimicrobial compounds66. The SVM-ML model was trained with 5-fold cross validation, and the trained model showed strong performance in predicting compound bioactivity. It achieved a mean AUC of 0.83 ± 0.05, indicating good ability to discriminate between active and inactive compounds. The mean precision was 0.80 ± 0.09, demonstrating that roughly 80% of compounds predicted to be active were truly active. Overall, the balance between precision and recall is reflected in a mean F1 score of 0.83 ± 0.07, suggesting reliable and consistent hit prediction across cross-validation folds. This suggests that detailed molecular structural features within the compounds correlate with their biological activity. Structural features that correlated to antibacterial activity against S. aureus included: amide bonds, fluorine substituents and higher substitution patterns around the metal coordination site (Fig. Conversely, ether groups and alkyl amines correlated with inactive compounds (Fig. In summary, we have efficiently evaluated 192 ligands and 480 metal complexes for their antibacterial and cytotoxic properties (an additional 768 IrCp compounds are currently undergoing evaluation in ongoing work). This “Direct-to-Biology” methodology allows us to rapidly narrow our focus on potentially interesting compounds with a desirable therapeutic index, and the combination of single-dose response and full MIC assays on crude reaction mixtures provides key insights into activity trends across metal libraries. Based on the MIC and single dose response toxicity data of the crude reaction mixtures, 6 complexes were chosen for re-synthesis, full characterization and re-testing (2x Re(CO)3, 2x IrCN and 2x Mn(CO)3). The criteria for choosing these was based primarily on antimicrobial activity, with the most active complexes identified (no compounds with an MIC higher than 6.25 µM were considered). Of these, the least toxic compounds were selected. For the IrCN library, as almost all compounds caused less than 50% cell viability, the least toxic compounds with MIC of 1.56 µM were chosen. The Re(CO)3 appeared to provide a good balance of active compounds with low apparent toxicity, so again the most active and least toxic compounds were chosen. For the Mn(CO)3 library, only four compounds had an MIC of 6.25 µM, so the purest compounds by LC-MS were selected for re-synthesis. The synthesis of all compounds was achieved by first making the ligands using the scaled-up procedure for generating ligand libraries, changing the solvent from DMSO to DMF to enable a more feasible workup and purification. After purification by flash column chromatography, the pure compounds were fully characterized. Single crystals of Mn(CO)3(M19Y1), Re(CO)3(M1Y1), and Re(CO)3(M20Y3) were obtained by slow vapor diffusion (CHCl3/Et2O, DCM/n-hexane, and DCM/Et2O respectively), with the X-ray diffraction structures (Fig. (Top) Chemical structures of lead complexes for re-synthesis and biological testing (MIC and toxicity); (bottom) single crystal X-ray diffraction structures of Mn(CO)3(M19Y1), Re(CO)3(M1Y1), and Re(CO)3(M20Y3) (thermal ellipsoids set at 50% probability and hydrogens represented as spheroids). Stability assays on the pure compounds were undertaken, with biologically relevant solvents and mixtures tested (DMSO, H2O, 1X PBS and a combination of DMSO with H2O and 1X PBS). The stability was ascertained by measurement of UV absorbance (320 nm) at 37 °C over 21 h. Most compounds demonstrated good overall stability with less than 10% difference in the spectra over this period; however, the Mn(CO)3 complexes exhibited significant changes in their overall UV-Vis spectra in H2O and 1X PBS over 2–8 h. This could be due to anion exchange (in the case of PBS) or water competitively binding with the complex in the axial position. However, this did not seem to be detrimental to the antibacterial activity of these compounds (vide infra). Biological studies were undertaken on the purified compounds to confirm activity against bacteria (MIC assays) and ascertain toxicity (CC50 measurements against HEK293T cells). Almost no activity was observed against E. coli at the measured concentrations, with the exception of Re(CO)3(M1Y1) and Mn(CO)3(M22Y1) (MIC = 100 µM, see Supporting Information Table S5). However, perturbation of the outer membrane by polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN) resulted in significant activity against E. coli for all compounds (see Supporting Information Table S6)67. PMBN has no inherent antibacterial activity, but damages and weakens the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria by interacting with the anionic lipopolysaccharide molecules. This permeabilizes the membrane to antibiotics, suggesting that uptake into Gram-negative bacteria is the issue for these compounds and they are not necessarily Gram-positive specific68. For the Gram-positive strains, high activity was observed in almost all cases. A comparison of activity between the crude reaction mixtures and re-synthesized compounds against S. aureus gives an increase in activity in all cases, with very low MICs (5/6 compounds active in the nanomolar range, similar to the vancomycin control MIC = 0.42 µM, Table 2). This confirms that in all cases it is the putative metal complex in the crudes that is responsible for the observed activity, validating our methodology of pre-screening large crude libraries (Table 2). It should be noted that in several cases (Re(CO)3(M1Y1), IrCN(M12Y1), Mn(CO)3(M19Y1)) there were larger increases ( > 16x, >4x, and >8x more active respectively) in antibacterial activity than expected from the increase in purity due to re-synthesis (crude purity by LC-MS of 43%, 72%, 41% respectively). The other tested Gram-positive strains showed generally good activity, with slightly higher MICs against Enterococcus faecalis in most cases. Enterococcus faecium showed very low growth in the Mueller-Hinton (MH) growth medium that was typically used, so Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) growth medium was used instead. This gave measurable MICs, but a comparison with E. faecalis (which was tested in both MH and TSB) indicates that TSB results in a significant rise in MIC values. As such, although the MICs for E. faecium are higher than S. aureus, there is still good activity in most cases (Table 2). Generally, Re(CO)3(M20Y3) and IrCN(M12Y1) show exceptional activity across the tested Gram-positive (and sensitized Gram-negative) bacterial strains, with often nanomolar MICs. The fact that the compounds showed very low MICs against E. coli upon permeabilization suggests that further structural optimization targeted at improving Gram-negative bacterial uptake could result in pan-active metalloantibiotics. However, due to their high level of antibacterial activity, all compounds except Mn(CO)3(M22Y1) still displayed a favorable therapeutic index >10. The best ratio of antibacterial activity and toxicity was determined for IrCN(M8Y4) showcasing a therapeutic index between 49–99. Overall, these values are comparable and in several cases superior to that of other recently reported metal-based antibiotics16,23,31. Additional toxicity testing in the form of haemolysis was undertaken. For human red blood cells, the concentration at which 10% of them have lysed (HC10) was low to moderate for the two Re complexes (HC10 = 36 ± 6 µM and 73 ± 29 µM, respectively), mirroring their toxicity against mammalian cells. This was also true for IrCN(M12Y1) and Mn(CO)3(M22Y1), which also caused haemolysis, albeit at higher concentrations (HC10 = 81 ± 4 µM and 87 ± 7 µM respectively). Interestingly, both IrCN(M8Y4) and Mn(CO)3(M19Y1) showed no haemolysis at any of the tested concentrations (HC10 > 200 µM). For IrCN(M8Y4), this is especially encouraging, as it is highly active against Gram-positive strains, has the highest CC50 tested and is not haemolytic. For all compounds, the HC10 values are significantly higher than the MIC concentrations against Gram-positive strains, so there is still a potential therapeutic window available. From a methodology perspective, the single dose toxicity assay was used as a guide to select the most active and least toxic compounds for re-synthesis. For the IrCN compounds, it was expected that they would have significant toxicity based on recent work, and the single dose assay did indeed indicate that22. More surprising is the Re(CO)3 data, which was significantly more toxic than expected from the preliminary assay. As such, the high throughput assay does successfully indicate toxicity, but more stringent conditions on selecting active and non-toxic compounds will be used in future work, such as increasing the toxicity threshold above 50% cell viability. It should be noted that cell-based assays can only provide so much information and hit compounds will have to undergo more stringent testing before a conclusion can be made about their safety. In summary, we have presented a combinatorial methodology to generate large libraries of pyridyl-triazole bidentate ligands formed by CuAAc Click reactions. These libraries have been demonstrated to coordinate efficiently to a number of metal scaffolds, generating 672 well-characterized complexes under mild conditions. We have showcased some applications of our metal libraries for catalytic and photophysical applications, including synthesizing and testing two iridium complexes in transfer hydrogenation assays. We have successfully screened all compounds for antimicrobial activity and toxicity in a high-throughput “Direct-to-Biology” approach, and, using the available data, have re-synthesized several highly active metalloantibiotics, with MICs as low as 200 nM against S. aureus. We have also demonstrated that the single-dose antibacterial and toxicity assays are a reliable indicator of the properties of the pure compounds from crude reaction mixtures, even for low-yielding reactions. However, care must be taken when it comes to single-dose toxicity assays as they tended to indicate that compounds are less toxic than they turned out to be upon re-synthesis. We have identified one complex by our Direct to Biology approach, IrCN(M8Y4), which has good activity against Gram-positive strains and relatively low toxicity against HEK293T cells, giving it a favorable therapeutic index ( > 49 against S. aureus). Additionally, it has been shown to be non-haemolytic and demonstrates good stability in a variety of relevant solvents. These properties make it a potential candidate as an antibiotic against systemic infections. Further testing will involve advanced toxicity and stability studies, efficacy against a broader panel of Gram-positive bacteria, and potential in vivo testing. Although promising activity against Gram-positive bacteria has been reported here for a number of different metal complexes, activity against Gram-negative strains has been lacking. Improved activity in the presence of the PMBN sensitizer suggests that the low original activity is in part due to poor uptake of the synthesized metal complexes. However, thanks to the combinatorial and versatile ligand architecture there is now scope to significantly vary the ligands to explore and include motifs to improve uptake into bacteria69,70. Screening crude reaction libraries for catalytic applications has also been demonstrated, with 384 complexes evaluated across two different transfer hydrogenation assays. These assays are amenable to high-throughput reaction monitoring under ambient conditions in 96-well plates and allowed us to identify and resynthesize two promising IrCp* catalysts. One of them, IrCp*(P4A11), was highly active in both assays and shows promise for further catalytic testing, including pro-drug unmasking in cells. Work in our group is currently ongoing with derivatives of IrCp* and IrCN libraries to explore photophysical properties, photodynamic therapy, and catalytic applications. However, this limitation is more than made up for by the capacity to use practically any primary amine to generate bidentate ligands, and hence a large number of metal complexes are now obtainable. Additionally, as the ligand architecture is highly variable around a fixed core motif, this methodology lends itself well to potential machine learning applications to enable the discovery of highly optimized compounds30. In terms of other biological applications, assays for any disease-based screening would in principle be possible on these libraries or derivatives of them. We believe there is much scope to expand the types of chemistry that are amenable to the combinatorial generation of ligand structures described here. Additionally, we have only scratched the surface of the periodic table in terms of explored metal scaffolds. While each metal may require slightly different conditions and not all of them will be amenable to this type of chemistry, we believe that the field of combinatorial metal complex synthesis is only just at its beginning.

Separately, 1-(fluorosulfonyl)-2,3-dimethyl-1H-imidazol-3-ium trifluoromethanesulfonate (600 mg, 1.83 mmol, 1.2 equiv.) was dissolved in 150 µL of MeCN in a Falcon tube, and was added to the reaction mixture. A further 150 µL of MeCN was used to wash the Falcon tube and ensure efficient transfer of material, with this also being added to the reaction mixture. The mixture was stirred vigorously at 0 °C with the lid loosely screwed on top for 15 min, then allowed to settle at r.t. for 30 min. The upper organic layer was decanted and diluted with 3 mL DMSO, giving a solution of FSO2N3 of ~173 mM. Method adapted from Meng et al.28. The following procedure assumes a concentration of 173 mM for FSO2N3 and describes the addition to 1 well of a Paradox® 96 well plate (700 µL glass vial) using an Opentrons OT2 liquid handling robot (P300 Gen2 300 µL pipette and P20 Gen2 20 µL pipette). FSO2N3 stock solution was then added (48 µL, 173 mM 1.05 equiv., Note: the pipette was aspirated 3 times to equilibrate solvent vapor pressure).

After cooling, the supernatant was used as a stock solution of [Re(CO)3(MeOH)3][OTf] (20 mM). Ligand stock solution (30 µL, 20 mM) and 1-methylbenzimidazole stock solution (30 µL, 20 mM, DMSO) were dispensed into 700 µL glass vials, with 30 µL of Re(CO)3(MeOH)3OTf stock solution added to each well. The plate was sealed and heated at 70 °C (600 rpm) for 18 h. After this, 240 µL of MeOH was added to each well, and the plate was left unsealed for one week, allowing for the MeOH to evaporate off (giving 60 µL of 10 mM complexes). (Note: Mn complexes are light sensitive, so all steps were done in darkness. The pre-activation of Mn was performed under N2, but other steps were done under ambient conditions). Note: hydroscopic, light-sensitive) were placed in a 50 mL 2-necked round bottomed flask fitted with a condenser, and evacuated/backfilled with N2 three times. Dry THF (7 mL) was added, and the mixture was refluxed under N2 at 70 °C for 45 min. After cooling, the supernatant was used as a stock solution of Mn(CO)3(THF)3OTf (20 mM). Ligand stock solution (30 µL, 20 mM) was dispensed into 700 µL glass vials, with 30 µL of Mn(CO)3(THF)3OTf stock solution added to each well. After 2 h at r.t., 1-methylbenzimidazole stock solution (30 µL, 20 mM, DMSO) was added, and the plate was left shaking at r.t. (600 rpm) for 72 h, allowing for the THF to evaporate off (giving 60 µL of 10 mM complexes). di-μ-chloro-bis[chloro(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)iridium(III)] (49.4 mg, 0.062 mmol) was dissolved in DMSO (6.2 mL, 10 mM). Ligand stock solution (30 µL, 20 mM) was dispensed into a polystyrene 96 well plate, with 30 µL of IrCp* stock solution added to each well (giving 60 µL of 10 mM complexes). The plate was left stationary for 24 h at r.t. [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2 (RuCy, 21.4 mg, 0.035 mmol) was dissolved in DMSO (3.5 mL, 10 mM). Ligand stock solution (30 µL, 20 mM) was dispensed into a polystyrene 96 well plate, with 30 µL of RuCy stock solution added to each well, followed by 60 µL water (giving 120 µL of 5 mM complexes). The plate was left stationary for 18 h at r.t., before analysis by LCMS. [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2 (RuCy, 38.3 mg, 0.0625 mmol) was dissolved in EtOH (25 mL, 2.5 mM). Ligand stock solution (60 µL, 20 mM) was dispensed into 700 µL glass vials, with 240 µL of RuCy stock solution added to each well. The plate was sealed and shaken at r.t. (600 rpm) for 48 h, after which the EtOH was evaporated under a flow of nitrogen, and the compounds diluted with DMSO (120 µL of 10 mM compounds), before analysis by LCMS. FSO2N3 was synthesized as before and diluted with DMF to approx. 200 mM in 1:1 MTBE:DMF (by volume). in water) was added, followed by FSO2N3 solution (1.05 equiv.). The resulting mixture was stirred at r.t. for 18 h. Sodium ascorbate solution (5.6 mL, 50 mM, 0.5 equiv. in water) was added, and the mixture was stirred for a further 10 min. 7 mL of DMF was added, followed by alkyne (0.56 mmol, 1.0 equiv. ), then (BimH)3 solution (0.7 mL, 20 mM, 2.5 mol% in DMF) and CuSO4 solution (0.7 mL, 20 mM, 2.5 mol% in water). The resulting mixture was stirred for a further 18 h at r.t. The crude reaction mixture was analyzed by LCMS, then 100 mL of deionized water was added. The combined organic layers were washed with 5 wt% LiCl solution (5 × 25 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered, and the solvent evaporated. The residue was redissolved in EtOAc (40 mL) and washed with more LiCl solution (3 × 20 mL). Purification was achieved by flash column chromatography. Re(CO)5Cl (50 mg, 0.138 mmol, 1 equiv.) and AgOTf (35.5 mg, 0.138 mmol, 1 equiv., Note: hydroscopic, light-sensitive) were charged to a 5 mL microwave vial, followed by MeOH (2 mL). The vial was sealed and heated in a microwave reactor at 120 °C for 30 min. The colorless solution was filtered through celite (with an additional 1 mL of MeOH) into a second 5 mL microwave vial containing the target ligand (0.152 mmol, 1.1 equiv.) The vial was sealed and heated in a microwave reactor at 120 °C for 1 h. The solvent was removed to give the crude compound as a pale yellow solid, which was purified by crystallization (approx. 15 mL n-hexane, and stored at 5 °C overnight) or flash column chromatography. All reaction vessels and containers were covered in aluminium foil and handled in the dark to prevent degradation by light. and AgOTf (85 mg, 0.33 mmol, 1 equiv., Note: hydroscopic) were charged to a 10 mL microwave vial, which was evacuated and backfilled with N2. Dry THF (4.5 mL) was added, and the vial was sealed under N2 and heated at 75 °C for 45 min, after which it was allowed to cool. The pressure was released by piercing the seal with a N2 balloon when cool, and 2 mL of the yellow solution (0.15 mmol Mn complex) was decanted into a second 10 mL microwave vial containing target ligand (0.155 mmol, 1.05 equiv.) The vial was sealed and heated at 75 °C for 2 h. The solvent was removed in vacuo to give the crude compound as a yellow solid, which was purified by flash column chromatography. To a 100 mL round bottom flask fitted with an air condenser, IrCN dimer (40 mg, 0.037 mmol, 1 equiv.) CHCl3 (30 mL) and MeOH (10 mL) were added, and the resulting solution was stirred rapidly at 40 °C for 18 h. The solvent was removed in vacuo, and the residue was purified by flash column chromatography. To a 7 mL glass vial, di-μ-chloro-bis[chloro(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)iridium(III)] (40 mg, 0.05 mmol, 1 equiv.) DCM (2 mL) and MeOH (2 mL were added, and the reaction mixture stirred overnight at room temperature. The mixture was transferred to a 20 mL vial and the solvent was evaporated in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in DCM (2 mL), to which Et2O (10 mL) was slowly added to precipitate the complex. The fine precipitate was isolated on a glass sinter and washed with Et2O (3 ×20 mL). The precipitate was dissolved in DCM, collected and the solvent removed in vacuo. Et2O (2 mL) was added to the residue and dried in vacuo, yielding the target complex as a yellow solid. Coumarin-N3 (10 mg, 0.05 mmol) and sodium formate (34 mg, 0.5 mmol) were dissolved in a mixture of 1:1 tBuOH / 1X PBS solution (25 mL) to give a solution of 2 mM coumarin-N3. In a polystyrene 96 well plate, 165 μL of 1:1 tBuOH /1X PBS solution was added, followed by coumarin-N3 / sodium formate mix (25 μL). 10 μL of RuCy catalyst stock solution at 5 mM was added to initiate the reaction. The reaction was monitored by fluorescence (generation of Coumarin-NH2) using a plate reader (λex = 350 nm, λem = 445 nm) over 21 h at 25 °C, with 2 min of shaking (400 rpm) and 13 min delay between data points. IrCp* catalyst samples were diluted to a stock solution of 750 µM (50:50 DMSO/H2O). Separately, stock solutions of harmaline (4.3 mg, 0.02 mmol, 2 mM) and sodium formate (136 mg, 2 mmol, 200 mM) were dissolved in mixtures of 1:1 tBuOH / 1X PBS solution (10 mL). In a polystyrene 96 well plate, 135 uL of 1:1 tBuOH /1X PBS solution was added, followed by the harmaline stock solution (20 µL, 1 equiv. ), then sodium formate stock (25 µL, 125 equiv. ), and finally 20 uL of IrCp* catalyst stock solution at 750 µM was added to initiate the reaction. The reaction was monitored by UV-Vis absorbance (consumption of harmaline) using a plate reader (λ = 374 nm) over 48 h at 25 °C, with 2 min of shaking (400 rpm) and 3 min delay between data points. 5 µL of each compound in the IrCN library (5 mM) was diluted with 200 µL DMSO. Of this, 50 µL was taken and diluted with a further 150 µL DMSO in a polystyrene 96 well plate (31.3 µM). The following bacterial strains were used for testing: Enterococcus faecalis CCUG 19916 T (Gram positive), Enterococcus faecium CUG 19434 (Gram positive), Staphylococcus aureus CCUG 19434 (Gram positive), Escherichia coli NCTC 13476 (Gram negative). Bacterial stock solutions were prepared as follows. Single bacterial colonies were grown on Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB, Gram positive) or Miller's LB Broth (LB, E. coli) agar. A single colony was removed and placed in the relevant growth medium (5 mL, TSB or LB) and incubated overnight at 37 °C (200 rpm). 100 µL of this overnight culture was added to 5 mL of the same growth medium, and the day culture was incubated at 37 °C (200 rpm) until the OD600 was 0.4–0.9 (~4 h). A sample of this culture was diluted with Mueller Hinton (MH) broth to OD600 = 0.022, at which point the bacterial cultures were added to plates for testing. For all testing, samples were incubated with bacteria for 16–20 h at 37 °C, after which the absorbance at 600 nm was measured using a plate reader. Antibiotic controls were Vancomycin (stock solution at 1 mg/mL in water, MIC beginning at 20 µg / mL) for Gram positive bacteria, and Polymyxin B (stock solution at 1 mg / mL in water, MIC beginning at 20 µg / mL) for E. coli. Unless stated otherwise, 2 biological repeats per sample were recorded, with each having 2 technical repeats. Polystyrene 96 well plates from TPP and CytoOne were used in all cases (sterile, DNA, DNase, RNase, pyrogen free). DMSO and other solvents were kept below 5% volume in the final solutions for biological testing. Of these stock solutions, 20 µL (for 50 µM) or 5 µL (for 12.5 µM) per sample was added to 96 well plates. MH growth media was added to each well (making up the volume to 290 µL), followed by the relevant bacteria in MH growth media (10 µL). The plates were incubated for 16–20 h at 37 °C, after which the absorbance at 600 nm was measured using a plate reader. Stock solutions of samples were diluted with DMSO/H2O (to give a 50:50 stock solution) so that 6 uL of stock solution can be added to 300 µL of MH growth media to give an initial concentration of either 50 µM (crude compounds) or 100 µM (pure compounds). These solutions were serially diluted (150 µL into 150 µL) 7 times (crude compounds) or 11 times (pure compounds) to give solutions of 150 µL. To these, 5 µL of the relevant bacterial strain was added in MH growth media. The plates were incubated for 16–20 h at 37 °C, after which the absorbance at 600 nm was measured using a plate reader. Pure compounds were tested with 2 biological repeats per sample, with each having 3 technical repeats.For testing with Polymyxin B nonapeptide, a solution of 300 µg / mL was prepared, and 5 µL of this was added to each well immediately before the addition of E. coli. The human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 T cell line was cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium high glucose (DMEM) (Sigma Aldrich, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 μg/mL streptomycin and 100 Units/mL penicillin, and 2 mM L-glutamine. The cells were maintained in a 5% CO2 environment, at 37 °C and the culture media were replaced with fresh media every 72 hours. HEK-293T cells were seeded at 10000 cells per well and incubated overnight to enable adhesion. The absorbance at 590 nm was measured using a TECAN well plate reader instrument M1000. Two biological repeats in duplicate were performed for this study, and the recorded absorbances were adjusted for the respective crudes and growth media. HEK-293T cells were seeded at 10000 cells per well and incubated overnight to allow adhesion. 5 mM stock solutions of pure compounds were prepared in 1:1 DMSO: PBS 1X. In a 1.5 mL 96 well dilution plate, starting concentrations of 150 µM and 200 µM of each compound were made in growth media (1 mL). 500 uL of media was then added to each well added to make 1 mL of each concentration (starting at 75 µM and 100 µM). 100 uL of these solutions were added into wells containing the pre-counted cells and treated for 24 h. Thereafter, the MTT assay was used to quantify viable cells and at least three biological repeats in triplicate were conducted from which the CC50 was determined using GraphPad Prism v8.0.2 (GraphPad Software, California, USA). The absorbance at 590 nm was measured using a TECAN well plate reader instrument M1000. 4 biological repeats in triplicate were done for this study (12 data points). For the Mn complexes, 2 biological repeats in triplicate (6 data points) were used. Blood samples were obtained from healthy volunteers through Hull York Medical School. The haemolysis assay was adapted from a previously reported procedure72. Whole blood (5 mL) was centrifuged (Thermo Scientific SL 8 R) at 4500 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C, and the plasma was discarded. The remaining human red blood cell (hRBC) pellet was washed three times with PBS 1X (pH 7.4): for each wash, PBS was added up to 15 mL, followed by centrifugation at 4500 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. After the final wash, the cells were resuspended in PBS to a final volume of 35 mL. The stock solutions for the samples to be tested were 2.5 mM in PBS:DMSO (60:40). For the determination of HC₅₀ and HC₁₀ values, test compounds were diluted in PBS to give a concentration range from 200 µM down to 5 µM, giving a total volume of 125 µL. Dilutions were prepared in 20 µM decrements with the final points at 10 and 5 µM. Each plate included a blank medium control (PBS) and a haemolytic activity control (1% SDS in PBS). The hRBC suspension (125 µL) was incubated with the samples in PBS in a V-shaped 96-well plate for 4 h at 25 °C. After incubation, 60 μL of supernatant was carefully pipetted to a flat bottom, clear 96-wells plate. Haemolysis was measured by absorbance at 540 nm using a plate reader (TECAN M1000). The percentage of haemolysis at each concentration was determined and the HC10 and HC50 were calculated by inhibitor vs. normalized response fit (Prism). The minimum haemolytic concentration (MHC) was determined by visual assessment of the wells after incubation. The MHC was defined as the lowest compound concentration at which visible haemolysis (red coloration of the supernatant and/or loss of intact red pellet) could be observed compared to the PBS control. Each experiment was repeated in triplicate (3 biological and 3 statistical replicates).
