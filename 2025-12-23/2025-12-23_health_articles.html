                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this interview, News Medical speaks with Dr Bryony Henderson, Medical Director for the UK and US at MedExpress, about the evolving role of GLP‑1 agonists in obesity care and the future of metabolic health treatments. I am the Medical Director for the UK and US at MedExpress, where I lead our clinical governance and quality teams. My journey to this role has been defined by a passion for safe, innovative, and scalable care. I've always been committed to being a clinical voice for change, whether that's through publishing research on health inequalities or leading award-winning public health campaigns and speaking to national media. Today, my focus is on ensuring that as we innovate in the digital space, we remain committed to upholding the highest standards of patient safety. Physiologically, GLP-1 receptor agonists mimic a naturally occurring hormone that our bodies produce in the gut after eating. These medications act as a "biological bridge" in three key ways: first, they stimulate the pancreas to release the right amount of insulin; second, they slow down gastric emptying, meaning you feel full for longer; and third, perhaps most importantly, they interact with the brain's reward centres to reduce "food noise" and cravings. Understanding that this is a hormonal intervention, rather than just an appetite suppressant, helps patients view it as a tool to reset their metabolic signals. These injections are usually prescribed to adults living with obesity, who have a body mass index (BMI) over 30, or over 27 if they have other weight-related health issues such as high blood pressure or prediabetes. However, looking to 2026, the "benefit profile" is expanding, so clinical supervision remains essential. Patients benefit most when medication is paired with broader lifestyle restructuring. As clinical evidence accumulates, we are seeing GLP-1s move far beyond the scale. We expect to see these medications prescribed for a broader range of indications, including osteoarthritis, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. By 2026, we may also see their application in treating sleep apnoea and even certain neurodegenerative conditions. We are moving from "weight loss drugs" to "metabolic health stabilisers." Sustainability is highly dependent on the "wraparound" care provided. GLP-1s are incredibly effective at inducing weight loss, while on the treatment, we know that obesity is a chronic condition. Without a robust transition plan, hunger signals can return if treatment is ceased. This is why, at MedExpress, we focus on increased personalization; by 2026, I expect to see more sophisticated dosing schedules and tracking tools that help patients maintain their "non-scale" health improvements long-term, whether they remain on a maintenance dose or transition off it. Managing the "quick fix" narrative is a core part of clinical governance. We must be clear: these are medical interventions, not "vanity drugs". We need to address the behavioral relationship with food simultaneously. In my view, the most successful treatment models in 2026 will be those that combine medication with behavioral change to ensure the patient's lifestyle evolves alongside their biology. Access through systems like the NHS remains limited compared to clinical need. This creates a "two-tier" system in which private prescribing offers earlier access. However, 2026 will be a turning point: as semaglutide loses patent protection in major global markets, such as China, Canada, and Brazil, and with liraglutide already off-patent in the US, the growth of generics is expected to drive down costs and improve global equity. The current guidelines offer a strong safety framework, but there is room for further development. As we move toward 2026, I would like to see guidelines that allow for more "dosing flexibility" and personalized treatment paths. We need to ensure that widening access, a public health necessity, does not come at the expense of clinical oversight. They are helping dismantle the “willpower myth.” By demonstrating how hormonal pathways influence weight, these treatments are reframing obesity as a chronic metabolic disease rather than a lifestyle choice. This shift in perception is vital for reducing the stigma that has prevented many patients from seeking help in the past. We will see an expansion of options, including new combination therapies and oral formulations like orforglipron, which will offer patients more choice in how they take their medication. We'll see expanded options including combination therapies and oral formulations like orforglipron, integrating medication with wearable tech, real‑time metabolic monitoring, and tailored nutritional coaching. We are moving away from a "one-size-fits-all" and towards personalized lifelong metabolic health management.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Recent advancements in cancer vaccine development have demonstrated their potential for precise tumor targeting through antigen-specific immune activation. Nevertheless, critical challenges persist in clinical translation, including inefficient antigen cross-presentation, suboptimal carrier-mediated immunogenicity, and systemic immune-related adverse events. These drawbacks highlight the pressing requirement for creative approaches to engineer next-generation vaccine platforms that synergistically enhance antigen delivery efficiency, immune activation precision, and biosafety. Herein, this study constructed a pH-responsive nanovaccine (Lyc-OVA) based on polysaccharide-functionalized CDs derived from Lycium barbarum (Lyc-CDs). The unique surface chemistry of Lyc-CDs, enriched with hydroxyl/amino groups and retained LBP, endowed Lyc-OVA with high antigen-loading capacity (48.4%) and tumor microenvironment-triggered release (80% OVA release at pH 5.4). In vitro, Lyc-OVA enhanced DCs maturation (CD80+CD86+ proportion matching LPS controls) and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion (TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-6). Construction of pH-responsive Lycium barbarum-derived carbon dots nanovaccines for enhanced anti-tumor immunotherapy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Using marijuana just once or twice a month was associated with worse school performance and emotional distress for teens, according to a large national study of adolescents led by Ryan Sultán, an assistant professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. The more frequently teens used cannabis, the more likely they were to report emotional distress and other social and academic problems. "While previous studies have focused on the effects of frequent cannabis use among teens, our study found that any amount of cannabis use at all may put kids at risk of falling behind in school, and the kids using most often may have the greatest risk," says Sultán, who studies adolescent substance use. "A few 'harmless' joints can snowball into real academic consequences. Teens using it regularly often struggle to focus, miss school, and may lose interest in their future plans." The new study arrives amid a national backdrop of shifting trends in teen drug use. While use of many substances is at record lows among US youths, cannabis remains an exception. About 1 in 5 high school students currently use cannabis, and approximately 6% of 12th graders use it daily – a rate that has increased in the past decade. Scientists are especially concerned because today's cannabis products contain two to three times more THC (the ingredient that causes a high) than in the past, making them more potent. And previous studies have shown that using cannabis during adolescence, when the brainis still developing critical neural connections, may have lasting effects on cognitive functions that are critical to academic performance. A teenager's brain is still developing the circuits for learning, self-control, and emotional regulation. Using cannabis, even casually, during these critical growth periods interferes with those processes and can derail normal development." Tim Becker, a child & adolescent psychiatrist at Weill Cornell Medicine and study co-author Over one-quarter of the respondents reported cannabis use; less than 20% reported monthly or less frequent use; and much smaller percentages said they used cannabis weekly or almost every day. In the study, adolescents who used cannabis once or twice a month reported higher rates of depression-like symptoms, anxiety, and impulsive behavior than those who abstained. These associations were even stronger for younger cannabis users. Experts recommend having frank, nonjudgmental conversations with teens about cannabis early and often. "Make sure they understand that "natural" doesn't mean "safe," Sultán says. "Parents also need to keep an eye out for warning signs like declining grades, mood changes, or loss of interest in hobbies – and consider that cannabis could be a factor."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>University of Arizona researchers in the Gutruf Lab have developed a comfortable, easy-to-use wearable device that incorporates artificial intelligence to detect subtle warning signs of frailty, signifying a leap forward in elderly care. The current model of care is lagging behind. Right now, we often wait for a fall or hospitalization before we assess a patient for frailty. Philipp Gutruf, associate department head of biomedical engineering and senior author on the study The project study, published in Nature Communications on Dec. 20, introduces a soft mesh sleeve worn around the lower thigh that monitors and analyzes leg acceleration, symmetry and step variability. Frailty, which indicates greater susceptibility to falls, disabilities and hospitalization, affects 15% of U.S. residents 65 and older, according to a 2015 study in the Journals of Gerontology. "This device allows clinicians to intervene early, potentially preventing costly and dangerous outcomes," said Gutruf. His lab published a study in May on an adhesive-free wearable that measures water vapor and skin gases to track signs of stress. Adapting and expanding on that technology, the approximately two-inch-wide, 3D-printed sleeve lined with tiny sensors is "designed to be invisible," said Gutruf. Results are transferred via Bluetooth to a smart device. And long-range wireless charging capabilities free the user from plugging in the device or swapping out a battery. "Continuous, high-fidelity monitoring creates massive datasets that would normally drain a battery in hours and require a heavy internet connection to upload. We solved this with Edge AI," said Kevin Kasper, lead study author and biomedical engineering doctoral candidate. The AI-enabled technology is "an ideal solution for remote patient monitoring in rural or under-resourced communities," he added. "We are effectively putting a lab on the patient, no matter where they live."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new systematic evidence review finds that cannabis products that carry relatively high levels of the psychoactive compound tetrahydrocannabinol, commonly known as THC, may provide short-term improvements in pain and function. However, the review found THC-based products led to an increased risk of common adverse symptoms like dizziness, sedation and nausea. At the same time, the review found that recent randomized controlled trials involving products mainly or only containing cannabidiol, or CBD, which does not have psychoactive properties, demonstrated almost no improvement in managing pain. But, at least in our analysis, it didn't have an effect on pain." Roger Chou, M.D., lead author, senior adviser for the Pacific Northwest Evidence-based Practice Center at Oregon Health & Science University The cannabis plant contains both THC and CBD. Both are believed to act on the body's endocannabinoid system, which modulates pain. Many U.S. states, including Oregon, have legalized cannabis for both recreational and medicinal use, and many people have turned to cannabis to treat conditions including pain, anxiety and sleep. The review, an update to a living review first published in 2022, was conducted by researchers at OHSU and published today in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Researchers incorporated several additional short-term placebo-controlled randomized trials since the previous review. Both the original review and the new update found some evidence of pain relief for two prescribed products, dronabinol and nabilone, which are made of 100% THC or its analogue. The new review found that oral THC-only products slightly reduce pain severity. "It's not like taking a standardized dose of ibuprofen, for example. Cannabis is derived from a plant and has multiple chemicals in addition to THC and CBD that may have additional properties depending on where it's grown, how it's cultivated and ultimately prepared for sale." The medical profession is equally divided on the benefits of medicinal use of cannabis: The American College of Physicians recently declined to recommend inhaled cannabis for non-cancer pain whereas a previous expert panel issued a soft recommendation for people with chronic cancer or non-cancer pain when standard treatments did not work. Chou said the review's finding that CBD products failed to reduce pain will surprise many people. Many people use these products and they think it helps," he said. The data showed that oral THC-only products slightly reduced pain severity, but that across trials they were also linked to moderate-to-large increases in dizziness, sedation and nausea. They concluded that more research is needed on long-term outcomes and other types of cannabis products; whether there are differences between THC-only products in effectiveness; and to better understand how results based on the products evaluated in the review apply to products that are available in dispensaries. In addition to Chou, co-authors included Rongwei Fu, Ph.D., Azrah Y. Ahmed, B.A., and Benjamin J. Morasco, Ph.D. GLP-1 agonists are pivotal in obesity care, promoting weight loss and addressing related health issues, with a focus on personalized, holistic treatment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After traumatic brain injury (TBI), some patients may recover completely, while others retain severe disabilities. Accurately evaluating prognosis is challenging in patients on life-sustaining thery. Though resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) can assess neurological activity shortly after brain injury, it is unknown whether communication across brain regions at this early juncture predicts long-term recovery. Investigators from Mass General Brigham and collaborators in the U.S. and Europe analyzed data from three prospective cohorts comprising 97 patients who underwent rs-fMRI after injury, finding that early communication between three pairs of brain regions is associated with favorable six-month functional outcomes. Using brain scans, we identified signature patterns of recovery after moderate or severe TBI. These findings open new avenues for prognostic assessment in TBI, and emerging evidence suggests these patterns may be modifiable, raising the possibility of future therapeutic application." The researchers analyzed brain scans (resting-state fMRI) from half of the participants with TBI, identifying two patterns in which different brain regions worked in opposite ways and a third in which regions worked together. People with any of the three patterns were more likely to have better outcomes, even after adjusting for factors like sedation and consciousness level. The researchers incorporated their findings into a model to predict outcomes after TBI. This model did a better job of predicting recovery than older prediction models. One pattern that strongly predicted positive outcomes involved parts of the salience network, a coordination "hub" for many brain networks, and the default mode network (DMN), which is active during rest. Together, these regions mediate conscious access to incoming information. Another pattern included regions involved in cognitive control and basic visual processing. Connectivity between the DMN and language network also helped predict outcomes. Importantly, findings were consistent across patients with injuries of varying severity, treated in multiple hospitals with different MRI scanners in different countries. Future studies may explore the extent that these neurological connections are essential to recovery and their ability to guide prognostic decision-making after TBI.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Temporal lobe epilepsy, which results in recurring seizures and cognitive dysfunction, is associated with premature aging of brain cells. A new study from researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center found that this form of epilepsy can be treated in mice by either genetically or pharmaceutically eradicating the aging cells, thereby improving memory and reducing seizures as well as protecting some animals from developing epilepsy. Our hope is that senotherapy, which involves using medications to remove senescent, or aging cells, could potentially minimize the need for surgery and/or improve outcomes after surgery." Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) can be caused by several factors, including brain injuries from trauma or stroke, infections like meningitis, brain tumors, blood vessel malformations and genetic syndromes. They found a five-fold elevation of senescent glia cells in human TLE cases compared to autopsy tissue from people without the disease. Glia cells support and protect neurons but do not produce electrical neuronal impulses. Based on their human brain tissue investigation, the researchers suspected there could be an abundance of senescent cells in a mouse model that mimics TLE. Treatment to remove the aging cells in mice resulted in a 50% reduction in these senescent cells, normalized their ability to navigate mazes, reduced seizures and protected a third of animals from epilepsy altogether. The combination of the two drugs has been widely used to kill senescent cells in a range of diseases modeled in animal studies. The researchers also chose these drugs because they are already in early phase clinical trials for other diseases. Forcelli also notes that because dasatinib is FDA approved as a treatment for a form of leukemia, investigators already know its safety profile, meaning a potentially faster route to clinical trials in people. The study's first co-authors Tahiyana Khan, Ph.D. and David J. McFall, both trainees in Forcelli's lab, say that senescence of glial cells has recently been implicated in aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, another area they are exploring. "We have ongoing studies using other repurposed drugs that can impact senescence as well as studies in other rodent models of epilepsy. We would like to understand the critical windows for intervention in epilepsy, and the hope is that these studies will lead to clinically useful treatments," says Forcelli. In addition to Forcelli, Khan and McFall, authors at Georgetown include Abbas I. Hussain, Logan A. Frayser, Timothy P. Casilli, Meaghan C. Steck, Irene Sanchez-Brualla, Ph.D., Noah M.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A possible new treatment for impaired brain blood flow and related dementias is on the horizon. Research by scientists at the University of Vermont Robert Larner, M.D. College of Medicine provides novel insights into the mechanisms that regulate brain blood flow and highlight a potential therapeutic strategy to correct vascular dysfunction. Their preclinical findings, published December 22 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggest that adding a missing phospholipid back into a person's circulatory system could restore normal brain blood flow and reduce symptoms of dementia. This discovery is a huge step forward in our efforts to prevent dementia and neurovascular diseases. We are uncovering the complex mechanisms of these devastating conditions, and now we can begin to think about how to translate this biology into therapies." Research deciphers the role of proteins, inflammation, neural activity, and brain cell dysfunction. Previous studies showed that Piezo1 activity is altered in carriers of Piezo1 gene variations. Findings from this new study, "PIP2 Corrects an Endothelial Piezo1 Channelopathy" provide novel insights into how Piezo1 affects cerebral blood flow and shows that diseases such as Alzheimer's disease are associated with increased vascular Piezo1 activity. Harraz's team investigated a phospholipid in brain cell membranes called PIP₂. This phospholipid is vital for cell signaling and ion channel regulation-a complex process where cells control the opening and closing of protein pores. They tested adding PIP₂ back into the system, which suppressed Piezo1 and restored normal blood flow. The study suggests that boosting PIP₂ could become a new treatment strategy to restore normal blood flow and enhance brain function. Further investigation will focus on defining how PIP₂ interacts with Piezo1, including whether it directly binds specific protein regions or alters the surrounding membrane environment to restrain pore opening. Future studies will also examine how disease-associated reductions in PIP₂ disrupt this regulatory brake, leading to sustained Piezo1 overactivity and impaired cerebral blood flow. Clarifying these mechanisms will be essential for refining PIP₂-based or Piezo1-targeted therapeutic strategies to restore healthy neurovascular function in dementia and related vascular disorders.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy has revolutionized hematologic cancer treatment, but its efficacy in solid tumors remains limited by poor infiltration into the complex tumor microenvironment (TME). A new review published in Volume 138, Issue 19 of the Chinese Medical Journal on October 05, 2025, outlines breakthrough strategies to address this critical bottleneck. Solid tumors present multiple barriers: abnormal vasculature, dense extracellular matrix, disordered chemokine signals, and immunosuppressive stromal cells. These obstacles reduce CAR-T cell access to tumor cells, with circulating CAR-T levels in solid tumor patients 5–10 times lower than in hematologic cancer cases. Anti-VEGF drugs like bevacizumab, when combined with CAR-T cells, remodel abnormal tumor blood vessels, improving T cell penetration. In preclinical models, inhibiting pathways like PAK4 or endothelial cell metabolism further enhances vascular function and CAR-T efficacy. A phase I trial of glypican-3-CAR-T cells co-expressing CCL19 and IL-7 showed promise in hepatocellular carcinoma. Targeting fibroblast activation protein (FAP) on cancer-associated fibroblasts or using enzymes like hyaluronidase to degrade the extracellular matrix improves CAR-T infiltration. Preclinical studies with synNotch CAR-T cells secreting matrix-degrading enzymes have demonstrated enhanced antitumor activity. Combination therapies amplify results: chemotherapy (e.g., nab-paclitaxel) disrupts stroma, radiotherapy triggers inflammatory signals, and oncolytic viruses remodel the TME. Local delivery methods-intratumoral injection, biomaterial scaffolds, or oxygen-releasing systems-boost CAR-T bioavailability while reducing off-target toxicity. Despite progress, challenges persist: translating preclinical models to humans, optimizing CAR-T cell phenotypes for solid tumors, and scaling biomaterial-based delivery systems. The review emphasizes integrating immunology, genetic engineering, and materials science to advance personalized treatments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A research group led by Professor Hiroaki SUZUKI and Takeshi HAYAKAWA from the Faculty of Science and Engineering at Chuo University, graduate student Zhitai HUANG, graduate students Kanji KANEKO (at the time) and Ryotaro YONEYAMA (at the time), together with Specially Appointed Assistant Professor Tomoya MARUYAMA from the Research Center for Autonomous Systems Materialogy (ASMat), Institute of Integrated Research (IIR), Institute of Science Tokyo, and Professor Masahiro TAKINOUE from the Laboratory for Chemistry and Life Science, Institute of Integrated Research, Institute of Science Tokyo, has developed a novel and highly accessible technology for producing uniform Biomolecular Condensates using a simple, low-cost vibration platform. This method builds upon the unique vibration control technology originally pioneered by Professor HAYAKAWA. It eliminates the need for expensive equipment or complex microfluidic circuits. By utilizing simple mechanical vibration, it achieves precise control over condensate formation within a single aqueous phase similar to the cellular environment, establishing a highly versatile technology. This technology bypasses complex microfluidic pumping systems by employing stable micro-vortex arrays within a simple open device featuring a micropillar array. This is achieved using a standard piezoelectric vibrator. These vortices function as molecular traps, inducing uniform condensation by capturing and concentrating DNA molecules at their central regions. This approach enables condensation control within a single aqueous phase, preserving the activity of sensitive biomolecular components. The team successfully constructed highly uniform DNA condensates and demonstrated precise regulation of their stability through a low-frequency "maintenance mode." We anticipate that this simple and accessible technology will be widely utilized as a standard tool for developing functional artificial cells and novel smart materials.
