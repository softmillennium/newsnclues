                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A transfer into the domestic league is rumored for one of the USWNT's biggest stars The recent trend in USWNT player transfers has been that of stars moving away from the domestic league to play in Europe. However, a big name is now drawing interest from NWSL teams as Catarina Macario's contract with Chelsea is set to expire. According to ESPN, Macario is set to be a free agent at the end of the 2025-2026 season and can sign a pre-contract with clubs beginning on January 1, 2026. However, it seems that in order to come stateside the league would need to adopt rules that would allow teams to pay a single “High Impact Player” (HIP) a salary that would push past the salary cap by $1 million. Macario has been a key player for the national team when healthy but she has dealt with significant injuries in the years since joining the USWNT. So far this year for Chelsea, she has played just over 600 minutes with two goals and two assists across all competitions. A new rule may keep Trinity Rodman in the league The dual-national attacker is showing her mettle. The league has a chance to innovate and keep its best players Plus, a look back at 2025 and the depth that has been elevated this year. USWNT finish 2025 with another dominant win over Italy</p>

Garcia's mastery was evident once again as he awed the Barcelona bench with his saves against Villarreal. The report points out how Spain coach Luis de la Fuente likes having a well-knit team, in which he can trust. In Unai Simon, Remiro, and David Raya, de la Fuente already has three goalkeeping options he can trust and therefore, unless one of them picks up an injury, Garcia may remain out of his plans. However, there is a considerable part of the season still remaining, and it will be interesting to see if Garcia gets to make his debut for La Roja in the upcoming Finalissima in March, where Lionel Messi could potentially face Lamine Yamal.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Italy coach Gennaro Gattuso admits that his ‘obsession' is to qualify for the 2026 World Cup, but warns the Azzurri about Northern Ireland: ‘In modern football, there are no easy games.' Italy CT Gattuso released an interview with Vivo Azzurro just two days before Christmas. “We must not make the same mistake as four years ago against North Macedonia. In modern football, there are no easy games,” Gattuso said, via TMW. “[Northern Ireland] is a team that can cause trouble for us. We must be able to react and not go down if something negative happens. We'll play for something meaningful, and the entire country is waiting. We must be calm and get there with the right mentality, for the country we represent and for this shirt.” Italy have not played in the World Cup for more than ten years, having failed to qualify in 2018 and 2022. That legendary team was coached by Marcello Lippi, a role model for Gattuso. “Since I've been the Italy coach, I've made a copy and paste of what he had done,” he said. “Being true and coherent, there's just one way if you want to create a group. We must want it at all costs and don't see ghosts after the first difficulty,” continued the Azzurri boss. In the next three months, I'll be working, travelling to watch games, meeting and talking to my players. Gattuso won five of his opening six games as Italy's coach. The team was always ready, and I saw a positive attitude, mentality and great sense of belonging,” he said. Somebody didn't feel well, but remained with us for a long time. During my playing career, I went to Coverciano on crutches many times and rightly so, because you don't create a group in just two or three days.” “I have the chance to coach the Italy national team, and I think that a million people would like to be in my place. I've been dealing with pressure for my whole life. I hope I can give the best with my lads and give the whole country great joy.” Lorenzo Bettoni is the Editor of Football Italia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Liverpool star John Arne Riise believes that Jurgen Klopp "would love" to take charge of England, and has tipped the German to move into international management. Klopp's near-nine-year reign at Liverpool reshaped the club's modern identity. Despite having a contract that still had two years to run, Klopp chose to leave on his own terms. Since leaving Liverpool, Klopp has taken on a senior strategic position with the Red Bull group as their global head of soccer, overseeing a network of clubs rather than living match to match. Riise believes Klopp's next move, if there is one, would almost certainly be with a national team. England, in his view, stand out as a particularly attractive possibility. I think he would love the England job at one stage. While acknowledging that Klopp's legacy at Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool is already secure, Riise suggested that the relentless grind of club football may no longer appeal. "I would love to see him back, obviously, because of the energy and who he is, but at the same time, his legacy now is high. He's done so well for Dortmund and for Liverpool, and I can't see that he can do even better at another club. But anyway, I do think his job at Liverpool cost him a lot, he was mentally and physically drained because he put everything he had into that job, basically all his energy." Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. For now, Klopp appears in no rush to test Riise's theory. Despite being linked with European giants such as Real Madrid, he has repeatedly signalled that he is content with his current lifestyle. He told The Diary of a CEO podcast: "I said I will never coach another team, a different team, in England. Instead, he has spoken openly about how the job consumed his personal life, eroding the balance he now values deeply. In an interview with German outlet Welt, Klopp reflected on the tunnel vision that defined his career. "I was in a tunnel, but never with myself," he said. But it took me too far away from normal life – and ultimately, I no longer had a normal life. Whatever normal life is: my car knew three ways – to the stadium, to the training ground, and home. "But I don't want that [management] anymore. I have a job now that fulfills me and is also intense. My wife, for example, is really happy with it because we can plan things much better that we couldn't before." Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Klopp's name will always surface whenever a major job becomes available, particularly one as prestigious as England manager - with Thomas Tuchel currently under contract in that position until the end of the 2026 World Cup. His charisma, tactical acumen and ability to connect with players make him an alluring candidate in theory. Yet his own words suggest that any return to the touchline would require extraordinary circumstances. For now, Klopp seems at peace, shaping football from a distance rather than living on its edge.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paris Saint-Germain are reportedly weighing up an unprecedented contract proposal for Luis Enrique. Appointed in 2023 to replace Christophe Galtier, the Spaniard inherited a club long defined by domestic dominance but haunted by European frustration. Under Luis Enrique's guidance, PSG lifted their first-ever Champions League trophy last season, finally removing the psychological barrier that had loomed over the club for more than a decade. It was a breakthrough that reshaped perceptions of Parisian football across Europe and cemented Luis Enrique's status as the architect of a new era. Across 143 matches in all competitions, Enrique has recorded 98 wins, 26 draws and just 19 defeats, a win percentage of 68.53 per cent. That level of consistency has translated into silverware, including an Intercontinental Cup triumph against Flamengo, coached by former Chelsea defender Filipe Luís, to cap a near-flawless 2025. The only blemish came last July, when Enzo Maresca's Chelsea denied PSG a clean sweep at the Club World Cup. Even that setback has done little to dull the sense that this is a team operating at the peak of its powers. According to reports from Diario AS, the club are seriously exploring the idea of offering a so-called "lifetime contract", a concept that has never previously been seen at the elite level of European football. Senior figures within the club are understood to be thrilled with Luis Enrique's work and increasingly convinced that he should be the long-term steward of PSG's sporting vision. More than a coach, he is viewed as a cornerstone of the club's future identity, someone capable of sustaining success rather than merely delivering it in bursts. That confidence was reinforced last weekend as PSG eased into the next round of the French Cup with a 4-0 win over fifth-tier side Vendee Fontenay Foot. Afterwards, Luis Enrique struck a tone that mixed satisfaction with professionalism. It was a celebration, and we played seriously. But we are also happy for the Christmas holidays. It is good for us to have this recovery time. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Crucially, Luis Enrique has found at PSG an environment perfectly suited to his footballing philosophy. Empowered by the club's hierarchy, he has instilled an uncompromising belief in hard work and collective responsibility, values that have not always been universally embraced in star-studded dressing rooms. The departure of Kylian Mbappe to Real Madrid proved a turning point. Freed from the gravitational pull of a single superstar, Luis Enrique discovered a balance that had eluded PSG in the 2024–25 season. Luis Enrique has shown a willingness to bench any player, regardless of reputation, reinforcing the principle that no individual stands above the team. Dembélé, once questioned for his consistency, has flourished to such an extent that he has captured both the Ballon d'Or and The Best FIFA Men's Player award under Luis Enrique's guidance. Talents such as Bradley Barcola and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia now understand that selective effort leads only to the bench. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Despite the trophies, two major tests lie ahead. PSG know the task will not be straightforward. Sustained success attracts attention, and a club that has finally found the formula must now work to protect it by tying down their superstars to longer deals, so that they remain protected from potential suitors in the future.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lionel Messi has been a sporting sensation in the United States, with the history books being rewritten by the Argentine at Inter Miami, but MLS has been told that Cristiano Ronaldo would have made an even greater impact than his “very quiet” eternal rival. Portuguese GOAT CR7 favoured a Saudi Arabian adventure over pursuit of the American dream. A couple of all-time greats found themselves on the move in 2023. Ronaldo was a free agent at that point following his stunning release by Premier League giants Manchester United ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. He accepted a lucrative offer from Al-Nassr in the Middle East. Rather than remain in Europe, or follow Ronaldo to the Saudi Pro League, the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner linked up with another former United No.7 in South Florida - Inter Miami co-owner, David Beckham. He has won the Golden Boot and back-to-back MVP awards, while agreeing a contract extension through 2028. A-list guests continue to flock to Inter Miami fixtures, with ticket prices soaring when the Messi show is in town, but former Herons and USMNT star Brek Shea has told Jackpot City Casino of North American soccer missing a trick: “I think Cristiano Ronaldo would have had a bigger impact in MLS than Lionel Messi. He doesn't speak the language quite well yet. “So I think just on that, speaking the language, doing interviews, I think would have just automatically had a bigger impact. I don't know if he would have put up the same numbers, but a bigger impact? It has been suggested that Ronaldo and Messi could reunite in America, having previously competed on opposing sides of the fierce El Clasico divide with Real Madrid and Barcelona, respectively. Ex-Manchester United coach Rene Meulensteen, who worked with CR7 at Old Trafford, has said: “Can you imagine having Messi and Ronaldo playing in the same team in Miami? Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Ronaldo will be crossing the Atlantic next summer when gracing the 2026 World Cup, but will not be making an imminent move at club level as he is tied to terms at Al-Nassr through to 2027 and has already passed his 40th birthday. Messi has more tales to tell in the States, after agreeing fresh terms, with Shea admitting it was imperative that MLS did not allow their star attraction to move on. He added: “I think from Miami's point of view, they could not let Lionel Messi go. “It's actually insane how many Inter Miami jerseys there are everywhere you go, which is amazing for the league, and amazing for Inter Miami. “But yeah, I didn't think he was going to be playing at this World Cup. “I think Inter Miami personally needs him for their new stadium opening next year. I think they need that to kick it off for the first two seasons.

Messi will be there for opening day, as will veteran Uruguayan striker Luis Suarez - as he has agreed a 12-month extension to his deal. There has been talk of the Herons making moves for other forwards with strong ties to Barcelona, such as Brazilian superstar Neymar and prolific Polish striker Robert Lewandowski.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>World Cup Fan Fests will feature 'Freedom' trailer-trucks Jason Smith / Getty Images A White House task force facilitated a proposal for World Cup host cities in the United States to house vast ‘Freedom' trailer-trucks with United States flags at official Fan Festivals in celebration of the country's 250th anniversary. Trump appointed Andrew Giuliani, the son of former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, to run its day-to-day operations as executive director. The task force's primary role is to lead and coordinate federal efforts in support of the tournament, notably across safety and security concerns. The task force holds regular weekly calls with the 11 American host city committees, which are effectively subsidiaries of FIFA's U.S. operations. At one recent meeting, the task force invited a pitch from organizers of America's 250th birthday celebrations, which falls on July 4, 2026, at the start of the World Cup's round of 16. Major FIFA Fan Fests have already been announced by several host cities across the United States, such as Liberty State Park in Jersey City, and a 25,000-person capacity Fan Fest at the National WW1 Museum and Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri. Others, such as the San Francisco Bay Area, are considering a reduced slate of Fan Fests amid the major financial burden FIFA has transferred onto cities. Since his January inauguration, Trump has taken several steps to ramp up celebrations for ‘America 250.' This included the establishment of the White House Task Force 250, which is also chaired by President Trump and includes representation from cabinet members. He further announced that between June 25 and July 10, the U.S. will hold a Great American State Fair on the National Mall, “celebrating America's exceptional history and culture.” He also announced a national prayer event, “to rededicate (America) as one nation under God”, as well as a UFC event at the White House and the inaugural Patriot Games — a four-day athletic event involving one male and one female high school athlete from each U.S. state and territory. Previously, another organization, named America250, was created by Congress in 2016, charged with organizing the national commemoration, and this has bipartisan representation from Congress, as well as honorary presidency positions for former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, and First Ladies Michelle Obama and Laura Bush. The Atlantic reported that America250 had launched a partnership with Moms For Liberty, a conservative group, while also securing sponsorships with companies such as Palantir, UFC, Coinbase and Oracle, whose executives have financially supported Trump. According to four people with knowledge of the call, all of whom wished to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, these were described as mobile museum freedom trucks and airstream trailers, which would tell the story of America's history and independence. The news release added: “At a time when 64 percent of Americans cannot pass the citizenship test, these key exhibits aim to make our nation's history more accessible and reinforce patriotism among Americans of all ages.” The World Cup task force declined to comment, but senior sources with knowledge of the presentation confirmed the offer was true, while saying it is an offering rather than an obligation for host cities. Other offers included the provision of U.S. swag and tourism guides. The task force did not confirm which specific 250-themed entity set out the offer at the World Cup meeting, but indicated there is internal government involvement, as well as public/private partnerships working across America 250 initiatives. In a recent interview with The Athletic, Giuliani described the World Cup as “an incredible opportunity to show off” America's first 250 years. He added: “President Trump, more than anything, represents the fact that, as Americans, we don't have to apologize anymore for whatever imperfections may exist in our country's history. We can look at the overall work of the last 250 years and what America has done for Western civilization, and truly celebrate that American greatness.” White House spokesman Davis Ingle said the Trump Administration is “committed to working with and providing resources and opportunities with all of our partners, including the FIFA World Cup 2026, to deliver one of the most iconic sporting experiences in history for Americans and the world to enjoy.” FIFA has already demonstrated willingness to promote Trump's agenda, most famously when awarding the U.S. president its inaugural Peace Prize this month. FIFA president Gianni Infantino attended Trump's pre-inauguration rally and his inauguration, as well as joining the U.S. president on visits to Qatar and Saudi Arabia in May. Some World Cup host city executives, however, told The Athletic they were unsure whether ‘Freedom' trucks would be relevant or appropriate at Fan Fests during a global soccer tournament, indicating they may not take up the offer. They also have an awareness that the word “freedom” has come to be interpreted in differing ways across the United States, according to one's political leanings. Turning Point sells merchandise, including T-shirts, hoodies, baseball caps and flags, with the word ‘Freedom.' But the group's view of what constitutes ‘freedom' has sometimes contrasted with the interpretation of liberals, or left-leaning groupings. Michele Goodwin, a professor at Georgetown University Law Centre, explains the nuance: “History and origin stories are critically important. Whoever gets to tell the story dominates a narrative and there are very different narratives. “Another version of a story is that the lands were occupied for thousands of years, and the indigenous people were marched off their lands. There's the retelling of American enslavement, where there were boys, girls, babies, men and women being regularly sold by people. Who is curating the story makes a difference.” Now that the World Cup draw and schedule have been confirmed, qualified nations are figuring out where exactly they should base themselves for a tournament that spans three countries and several time zones. The good news is that FIFA has, to a certain extent, clustered group stage matches within regions of North America, but that does not discount a vast amount of travel for many teams. England, for example, will begin against Croatia in Dallas before heading to Boston and New Jersey to face Ghana and Panama. England's logistics team had been very keen on basing the squad in Kansas City during the tournament due to its central location and the qualities of Sporting Kansas City's facilities. But nations must follow FIFA's process to secure their favored base. FIFA has published a brochure, available to peruse on its website, in which national teams' executives can study training base options, as well as nearby hotels across North America. Brazil, for example, have looked closely at the New York Red Bulls' training facility. If a nation has two games, compared to one game, located close to the training site, then this team will be given preference. Should England miss out on their preferred Kansas City base, they have previously looked at Charlotte FC's training base in North Carolina, while they are also assessing options in New York and New Jersey, where the FIFA brochure lists options including the Pingry School, Rutgers University, Stockton University and Columbia Park Training Facility. Preparations are continuing across host cities for the anticipated footfall, global attention and associated security threats posed by the World Cup and this month, Los Angeles Police Department chief Jim McDonnell sounded a note of concern six months out from the tournament. Los Angeles will host eight matches at the World Cup, including two group-stage games at SoFi Stadium for the USMNT, and two games involving Iran, all of which are likely to require enhanced security provisions. Los Angeles has seen protests against the U.S. government following raids by immigration and customs enforcement officials, while President Trump also sent in the National Guard. City Council members, including Katy Yaroslavsky, have warned their responsibility is to keep Los Angeles “solvent” as well as safe. When we're fully deployed at 10,000 officers, we have half the officer-to-population ratio as New York and less than half of what Chicago deploys per capita. We're a very lean organization to begin with. I was given budget approval to hire 240 new officers this year. That is not the place any city would want to find themselves. But if you if you don't do it appropriately, then it could be a different outcome.”</p>

Dan McKee, Bryant University President Ross Gittell, Bryant University Vice President of Athletics and Recreation Bill Smith, and General Treasurer James Diossa performed an exchange of Bryant and Ocean State 2026 soccer jerseys at the press conference on Oct. 31. SMITHFIELD – After hosting Rhode Island's newest sports team, the Rhode Island Football Club, for its inaugural season, Bryant University will be a base camp for the FIFA World Cup 26 in June. The announcement was made in late October, with fans waiting to see the bracket of teams that will be playing at Gillette Stadium. So far, England, France, Brazil, Morocco, Scotland, Haiti, Ghana, and Norway will be among the teams potentially using Bryant's stadium for a team base camp next year. Currently, Boston is set to host seven matches through June and July. “Bryant's recognition by FIFA World Cup ‘26 affirms the foresight of our investment in best-in-class facilities across our campus,” said Bryant President Ross Gittell. Gittell emphasized the recent opening of Bryant's 43,000-square-foot field house this fall, with state-of-the-art spaces for training, recovery, and wellness. “Our goal has always been to create resources that strengthen academics and the student experience, leading to top 1 percent outcomes for graduates. FIFA's recognition of our modern campus facilities underscores both their quality and their broader global appeal,” he said. There are more than 60 potential sites mapped out for the FIFA World Cup tournament next year. All sites must meet FIFA World Cup standards, including level grass pitches with a certain blade height for specific grasses, adequate lighting, ample security and extensive training facilities. Bryant University is partnering with The Graduate by Hilton Providence and is the only New England site included for consideration. Town Council President John Tassoni said the town is looking forward to hosting athletes from other nations. “We will continue to be respectful, discreet, and professional as we interface with the team in the hopes that our site will be selected. With the honor comes the opportunity for some of our youth soccer players to train with these athletes,” he said. There was an error processing your request.
