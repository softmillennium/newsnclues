Warning: This post contains language readers may find disturbing.



            A handwritten letter signed by “J. Epstein” appears to make crude references to President Donald Trump in a short 2019 message from jail addressed to convicted sex offender Larry Nassar.
    


            The letter does not explicitly name Trump, but instead refers to “our president.” The message appears to have been sent in August 2019, the same month Epstein died by suicide. Trump was president at the time.
    


            It is included in the latest collection of Epstein documents released by the Justice Department. “Our president also shares our love of young, nubile girls,” the letter reads.
    


            Authorities have not accused Trump of any wrongdoing or charged him with any crimes in connection with Epstein.
    


            “Dear L.N.,” the letters reads, “As you know by now, I have taken the ‘short route' home. Good luck! We shared one thing … our love and caring for young ladies and the hope they'd reach their full potential. Our President also shares our love of young, nubile girls.” The letter makes another lewd reference to Trump's treatment of women.
    


            “Life is unfair,” the letter reads.
    


            While not referencing this specific letter, the Justice Department released a statement saying some of the documents released “contain untrue and sensationalist claims” against the president.
    


            “To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on the letter.
    


            While the letter is addressed to an “L.N.,” a photo of the envelope – postmarked on August 13, 2019 and addressed to the former Olympic doctor and sex offender – was released by the DOJ. The envelope was sent from the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City to Nassar, who was listed as an inmate at a federal prison in Arizona.
    


            The letter was postmarked three days after Epstein died. Prison staff are authorized to read and inspect outgoing mail, which can cause delays. It's not clear why Epstein's letter was permitted by prison officials to be sent and why it was delayed.
    


            CNN previously reported that while he was jailed, Epstein sent a letter to Nassar — although the contents of the letter were not disclosed. It was discovered by prison officials investigating Epstein's suicide weeks after his death. It is not known if Nassar and Epstein had a relationship.
    


            The FBI in 2020 requested from its laboratory a handwriting analysis be done to compare the letter to other writings from Epstein, according to another document posted on Tuesday from the DOJ. It did not say what the lab concluded.
    


            Nassar, the longtime doctor for the USA gymnastics team and Michigan State University, is serving a 60-year sentence in federal prison on child pornography charges. More than 150 women and girls publicly told a court he sexually abused them.
    


            The envelope, addressed to Larry Nassar at 9300 S. Wilmot Road, Tucson, Arizona, 85756, a Federal Bureau of Prisons facility, was marked as “return to sender,” as the addressee was “no longer at this address.”

Demonstrators have staged a protest outside the Bangladeshi mission in the Indian capital, New Delhi, over the lynching of a Hindu man and alleged acts of violence against the religious minority in the neighboring country. 

Last week, a Hindu man named Dipu Chandra Das was lynched in the Bangladeshi city of Mymensingh over allegations of blasphemy against Islam.

“I'll also be a Dipu, and you'll also be a Dipu if we don't raise our voice today,” a protester was quoted by NDTV as saying.

The protesters managed to climb over some of the barricades around the Bangladesh High Commission, leading to clashes with local police.

On Tuesday, Bangladesh summoned the Indian envoy to protest “incidents” at Bangladeshi diplomatic missions in two Indian cities.

“Bangladesh condemns such acts of premeditated violence or intimidation against diplomatic establishments,” its Foreign Ministry said.

New Delhi has said it has never allowed its territory to be used for activities against Bangladesh.

Bangladesh has witnessed several acts of violence since last week, when a leader of the 2024 uprising, who was shot earlier this month, died. Former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government was ousted during the 2024 protests.

Last week's unrest in Bangladesh also triggered a diplomatic spat between New Delhi and Dhaka, with both countries summoning envoys.

The United Nations and Russia have voiced concerns about the situation in Bangladesh.

“Yes, we're very concerned about the violence that we've seen in Bangladesh,” Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said at a daily press briefing on Tuesday, according to The Hindu newspaper.

Russia has called upon Bangladesh to take steps to check the unrest in the country and defuse the diplomatic spat with New Delhi.

Russia Urges Bangladesh To Reduce Tensions With India: 'The Sooner, The Better'Russian Ambassador to Bangladesh Alexander Grigoryevich Khozin added that neighbouring countries should be guided by mutual trust and confidence.📹 @sidhantpic.twitter.com/nzMoSxmDHt

“The sooner you reduce the tension... the better. Because... historically, since 1971, when Bangladesh gained independence, [it was] mostly because of Indian help. And Russia also supported this in this regard. And shoulder to shoulder, India, Bangladesh, and Russia, we work together,” Russian Ambassador to Bangladesh Aleksandr Khozin said on Monday.

National elections will be held in Bangladesh on February 12. Hasina's Awami League, which had been in power for 15 years before the uprising, has been barred from participating in the polls.

Finland will raise the upper age limit for rank-and-file military reservists by 15 years, from 50 to 65, starting next year, the Defense Ministry has announced.

The Nordic nation, which shares a 1,340-km (830-mile) land border with Russia, abandoned its long-standing policy of military neutrality and joined NATO in April 2023, citing security concerns linked to the Ukraine conflict.

Since then, it has begun constructing a 200-km border fence equipped with barbed wire and surveillance systems and has hosted large-scale military exercises near the Russian border.

The age-limit change will give the Finnish armed forces and the Border Guard “more opportunities to assign skilled personnel to key duties in exceptional circumstances, regardless of military rank,” according to a press release published on Monday. Officers holding the rank of colonel or above are not subject to an upper age limit and will remain in the reserve as long as they are medically fit, it added.

The reform will expand the size of Finland's military reserve to roughly one million people by 2031, Defense Minister Antti Hakkanen said — equivalent to nearly 20% of the country's 5.6 million population.

Finland's move comes amid a broader wave of changes to military service across the EU, including Croatia's decision to reintroduce conscription, Denmark's expansion of mandatory service to include women, and France's launch of a new voluntary national service program.

Some EU members of NATO, including Poland and the Baltic States, have claimed that Russia could attack them – accusations Moscow has repeatedly rejected.

During his annual end-of-year Q&A session in Moscow earlier this month, Russian President Vladimir Putin again dismissed Western claims that Russia intends to attack Europe as “nonsense,” saying the allegations are driven by domestic political considerations and aimed at portraying Russia as an enemy.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said in an interview with Die Zeit on Monday that he didn't believe that Moscow was aiming for a full-scale war against NATO.

US President Donald Trump has announced plans to introduce a new class of battleships for the US Navy's ‘Golden Fleet', claiming they will be the biggest and most powerful ever built.

Speaking Monday from Mar-a-Lago during what the White House called a “major announcement,” Trump said he approved two ships to start, with plans for up to 25. He was joined by Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Secretary of the Navy John Phelan.

Larger than WWII-era Iowa-class ships, the ‘Trump-class' vessels will carry hypersonic missiles, rail guns, and lasers, according to the US president. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the president's plans, wrote that the US Navy plans to procure the first ship in 2030.

“As you know, we're desperately in need of ships,” Trump said. “They'll be the fastest, the biggest, and by far, 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built.” 

The plan is part of a wider naval expansion with both manned and unmanned ships.

Officials have warned that the US trails China in shipbuilding capacity and output. When asked whether the new warships were intended as a counter to America's chief rival, Trump declined to single out Beijing. “It's a counter to everybody,” he said.

The announcement comes as Washington's operations in the Caribbean have ramped up, with the US Coast Guard targeting oil tankers linked to Venezuela. 

Since September, US Navy ships have been deployed to intercept vessels that the White House claims were involved in drug trafficking and to block oil shipments. Caracas denies the claims and has accused Washington of seeking regime change to access its resources.

The US Navy has also been active in the Red Sea, where it has responded to attacks on commercial shipping linked to regional conflicts.

Last week another new set of vessels, based on the US Coast Guard's Legend-class National Security Cutter, were announced by the US Navy.

“Recent operations from the Red Sea to the Caribbean make the requirement undeniable - our small surface combatant inventory is a third of what we have,” Chief of Naval Operations Daryl Caudle said. “We need more capable blue water small combatants to close the gap and keep our [destroyers] focused on the high-end fight,” he added.

The US Navy recently canceled a smaller warship project due to delays and cost overruns and continues to face challenges with its Ford-class carriers and Columbia-class submarines.

Letter to former US gymnastics team doctor postmarked three days after Epstein's death

US politics live – latest updates

A disturbing letter that appears to have been written by Jeffrey Epstein and sent to Larry Nassar, the US Olympics gymnastics team doctor convicted of sexual abuse, is included the latest batch of Epstein-related documents released by the US government.

“As you will know by now, I have taken the ‘short route' home,” the letter, which appears to have been signed from Epstein to Nasser, reads. “Good luck! We shared one thing … our love & caring for young ladies and the hope they reach their full potential.”

The letter continues: “Our president also shares our love of young, nubile girls. When a young beauty walked by he loved to ‘grab snatch', whereas we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system.”

The letter is signed: “Life is unfair. Yours, J. Epstein.”

Donald Trump, who was president at the time of this writing, has repeatedly denied any knowledge of or involvement in Epstein's criminal activities and any wrongdoing.

The existence of the letter was first reported in 2023 by the Associated Press after it was discovered in the midst of more than 4,000 pages of documents held by the Bureau of Prisons.

The letter is postmarked 13 August 2019, notably three days after Epstein died in custody in what was ruled a suicide. It was found by investigators in the jail mail room weeks later after it was returned from a prison in Arizona and marked “no longer at this address”.

“It appeared he mailed it out and it was returned back to him,” the investigator told a prison official in an email included in the documents. “I am not sure if I should open it or should we hand it over to anyone?

It is unclear if Epstein and Nassar had any relationship.

Nassar, the former doctor for the US gymnastics team and Michigan State University, is currently serving a 60-year federal sentence on charges of child sexual abuse images. He was also sentenced in 2018 to a 40-to-175 Michigan state sentence after pleading guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct.

At trial, more than 150 women – including Olympic gold medalists Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney – said he sexually abused them.

The document comes as questions continue to swirl around Epstein's death in custody, with his brother, Mark Epstein, continuing to maintain that the sex offender was murdered in his cell.

It has also been suggested that Epstein blamed his former friend Donald Trump for his 2019 arrest on sex-trafficking charges, which came more than a decade after he was granted immunity from prosecution under a 2007 Florida state plea deal where he pleaded guilty to solicitation of a minor.

In a statement from the Department of Justice about the release of the latest tranche of Epstein-related documents, it said: “Some of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election. To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already. Nevertheless, out of our commitment to the law and transparency, the DOJ is releasing these documents with the legally required protections for Epstein's victims.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Son of jailed former Brazilian president says spokesperson for ‘national symbol' sandals is ‘openly left wing'

Leaderless since its figurehead was jailed for attempting a coup, Brazil's far right has found a new nemesis: the flip-flop brand Havaianas, which has been “cancelled” by Jair Bolsonaro's supporters over a television advert.

The controversy stems from the actor Fernanda Torres – the star of I'm Still Here, the Brazilian film that won an Oscar for best international feature – saying in the ad that she hoped audiences would not start 2026 “on the right foot”, but “with both feet”.

Bolsonaro supporters interpreted the remark as a jab at the right and called for a boycott, echoing actions by Donald Trump's backers against Bud Light, Keurig machines, Kellogg's cereals and even Beyoncé.

One of the former president's sons, Eduardo Bolsonaro – whose mandate was recently revoked after he abandoned his post as a congressman and moved to the US to lobby Trump to retaliate against Brazil over his father's trial – recorded a video in which he throws a pair of Havaianas into a bin.

“I thought this here was a national symbol,” he said, pointing to the small Brazilian flag that is a trademark of the sandals. “But I was mistaken. They chose as the spokesperson for the sandal someone who is openly left wing.”

Neither Torres nor the brand have commented publicly on the controversy.

“I'll tell the marketing people [at Havaianas] to get advice from the Budweiser marketing department here in the US, which also lost touch with reality and took a billion-dollar loss,” said the former congressman, referring to the backlash Bud Light faced after running an advert featuring the transgender TikTok star Dylan Mulvaney, before later being “forgiven” by Trump.

The first day of the flip-flop boycott, on Monday, is said to have wiped about £20m off the company's market value.

On the left, reactions ranged from earnest appeals urging Bolsonaro supporters to donate their sandals, to mockery, including offers to swap the flip-flops for an electronic ankle tag in Brazil's national colours.

The device has become a running joke since Bolsonaro was caught trying to destroy his own ankle tag with a soldering iron, prompting his transfer from house arrest to a cell where he began serving his sentence after being convicted of masterminding a plot to overturn the result of the 2022 election.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Decision comes amid growing public support for Guan Heng – who secretly filmed detention facilities in China – after he illegally entered US by boat

The Department of Homeland Security has dropped its plan to deport a Chinese national who entered the country illegally, two rights activists have said, after his plight raised public concerns that if deported the man would be punished by Beijing for helping expose human rights abuses in China's Xinjiang region.

Rayhan Asat, a human rights lawyer who assisted in the case, said Guan Heng's lawyer received a letter from the department stating its decision to withdraw its request to send Guan to Uganda. Asat said she now expected Guan's asylum case to “proceed smoothly and favourably”.

Zhou Fengsuo, executive director of the advocacy group Human Rights in China, also confirmed on Monday that the administration had decided not to deport Guan. “We're really happy,” Zhou said.

The Department of Homeland Security didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The database of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) lists Guan, 38, as a detainee.

His legal team is working to secure his release from an ICE detention facility in New York on bond, Zhou and Asat said.

Guan in 2020 secretly filmed detention facilities in Xinjiang , which activists say have been used to lock up as many as 1 million members of ethnic minorities in the region, especially the Uyghurs. Beijing has denied allegations of rights abuses and says it has run vocational training programs to help local residents learn employable skills while rooting out radical thoughts.

Knowing he could not release the video footage while in China, Guan left the mainland in 2021 for Hong Kong and then flew to Ecuador, which at the time did not require visas for Chinese nationals. He then travelled to the Bahamas, where he bought a small inflatable boat and an outboard motor before setting off for Florida, according to the nongovernmental organisation Human Rights in China.

After nearly 23 hours at sea, Guan reached the coastline of Florida, according to the group, and his video footage of the detention facilities was released on YouTube, providing further evidence of rights abuses in Xinjiang, the rights group said.

But Guan was soon doxxed, and his family back in China was summoned by state security authorities, the group said.

Guan sought asylum and moved to a small town outside Albany, New York, where he tried to live a quieter life, the group said, until he was detained by ICE agents in August.

Public support for Guan, including in Congress, has swelled in recent weeks after Zhou's group publicised his case. Before Guan appeared in court earlier this month, US lawmakers called for providing him with a safe haven.

“Guan Heng put himself at risk to document concentration camps in Xinjiang, part of the CCP's genocide against Uyghurs,” the congressional Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission said on social media platform X, referring to the Chinese Communist party (CCP). “Now in the United States, he faces deportation to China, where he would likely be persecuted. He should be given every opportunity to stay in a place of refuge.”

Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, the top Democrat on the House select committee on the CCP, wrote to the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, urging her to release Guan and approve his asylum request.

Krishnamoorthi wrote that the US “has a moral responsibility to stand up for victims of human rights abuses in Xinjiang, as well as the brave individuals who take immense personal risks to expose these abuses to the world”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Security has been tightened at German Christmas markets after deadly attacks, but if some online videos were to be believed, they have become barbed-wire fortresses guarded by armored personnel carriers. 

A flood of disinformation has circulated on social media, with some doctored clips also giving the wrong impression that an Islamic cleric called for prayers at one of the festive events, and that markets have been stormed by Muslim men. 

False claims circulating online amplify far-right narratives about immigration and the “Islamization” of German society.

Images and videos showed what were claimed to be Muslim men or “Islamist immigrants” massing at Christmas markets in the cities of Hamburg and Stuttgart. 

However, the footage was from other events: a rally in October last year by the activist group Muslim Interaktiv, which has since been banned, and Syrians celebrating the fall of former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad late last year. Several artificial intelligence-generated pictures have also shown Christmas markets with exaggerated security measures such as meter-high barbed wire fences or military-style vehicles parked around them. 

German Christmas markets, a centuries-old tradition, are hosted by almost every town and city, and consist of stalls with merchants selling gifts and decorations, as well as sweets, sausages and hot mulled wine. 

However, the cozy family atmosphere of the markets has been tarnished by the shock of attacks. 

Last year six people were killed and more than 300 wounded in a car-ramming attack on the Christmas market in the eastern city of Magdeburg. 

The man now on trial is a Saudi Arabian psychiatrist who adhered to conspiracy theories, held strongly anti-Islam views and repeatedly expressed his fury at German authorities. 

That attack recalled a 2016 truck rampage through Berlin's Christmas market by a Tunisian man with jihadist motives that killed 13 people. 

Earlier this month, German authorities said they had arrested five men — an Egyptian, a Syrian and three Moroccans — on suspicion they were involved in a radical Muslim plot to plow a vehicle into a Christmas market in Bavaria. 

The far-right Alternative for Germany has seized on such attacks and plots as it calls for the “remigration” of foreigners, especially to Muslim-majority countries. 

Another much-shared video this month showed a man dressed in a white robe apparently delivering the Islamic call to prayer at an unspecified German Christmas market. 

“This Christmas market has completely capitulated!” an Instagram user commented on the video, which was also shared on Facebook in several languages including English, Greek, Russian and Slovak. 

However, the video dates from November 2023 and actually shows a market in the Bavarian town of Karlstadt, an event that had nothing to do with Christmas. 

The Andreasmarkt has a different theme every year and in 2023 opened with a call to prayer after two local Islamic groups were asked to contribute, organizers said. 

A separate Christmas market was due to open in the town in early December, they said — which is why a Christmas tree can be seen in the video. 

Christmas markets are a ripe target for disinformation, because of their emotional associations, Center for Monitoring, Analysis and Strategy researcher Lea Fruehwirth said. 

“Christmas symbolism stands for joy, a warm feeling of community and security,” she said. 

Narratives that “accuse Muslims of wanting to violently destroy this idealized image can therefore trigger a lot of emotion,” she said. 

The creators of such posts are likely seeking to “sow mistrust and deepen divisions in society, as is the case with Russian disinformation campaigns, for example,” Fruehwirth added.



                                                                                The Burmese junta has said that detained former leader Aung San Suu Kyi is “in good health,” a day after her son said he has received little information about the 80-year-old's condition and fears she could die without him knowing.
In an interview in Tokyo earlier this week, Kim Aris said he had not heard from his mother in years and believes she is being held incommunicado in the capital, Naypyidaw.
Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, was detained after a 2021 military coup that ousted her elected civilian government and sparked a civil war. She is serving a                                    


REVENGE: 
                                        Trump said he had the support of the Syrian government for the strikes, which took place in response to an Islamic State attack on US soldiers last week                                        The US launched large-scale airstrikes on more than 70 targets across Syria, the Pentagon said on Friday, fulfilling US President Donald Trump's vow to strike back after the killing of two US soldiers.
“This is not the beginning of a war — it is a declaration of vengeance,” US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth wrote on social media. “Today, we hunted and we killed our enemies. Lots of them. And we will continue.”
The US Central Command said that fighter jets, attack helicopters and artillery targeted ISIS infrastructure and weapon sites.
“All terrorists who are evil enough to attack Americans are hereby warned                                    



                                                                                Seven wild Asiatic elephants were killed and a calf was injured when a high-speed passenger train collided with a herd crossing the tracks in India's northeastern state of Assam early yesterday, local authorities said.
The train driver spotted the herd of about 100 elephants and used the emergency brakes, but the train still hit some of the animals, Indian Railways spokesman Kapinjal Kishore Sharma told reporters.
Five train coaches and the engine derailed following the impact, but there were no human casualties, Sharma said.
Veterinarians carried out autopsies on the dead elephants, which were to be buried later in the day.

US President Donald Trump has announced a bold plan for the US Navy to build a new, large warship that he is calling a “battleship” as part of a larger vision to create a “golden fleet.” 

“They'll be the fastest, the biggest, and by far 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built,” Trump said during the announcement at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. 

He said the ship, the first of which would be named the USS Defiant would be longer and larger than the World War II-era Iowa-class battleships and would be armed with hypersonic missiles, nuclear cruise missiles, rail guns, and high-powered lasers — all technologies that are in various stages of development by the US Navy.

The announcement comes just a month after the US Navy scrapped its plans to build a new, small warship, citing growing delays and cost overruns, deciding instead to go with a modified version of a US Coast Guard cutter that was being produced until recently. The sea service has also failed to build its other newly designed ships, such as the new Ford-class aircraft carrier and Columbia-class submarines, on time and on budget. 

Meanwhile, the US Navy has struggled to field some of the technologies Trump says would be aboard the new ship. 

It spent hundreds of millions of dollars and more than 15 years trying to field a railgun aboard a ship before finally abandoning the effort in 2021. 

Laser technology has seen more success in making its way onto navy ships in the past few years, but its employment is still limited. 

One system that is designed to blind or disable drone sensors is now aboard eight destroyers after spending eight years in development. 

Developing nuclear cruise missile capabilities or deploying them on ships might also contravene non-proliferation treaties that the US has signed with Russia. 

A US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing plans, said that design efforts are under way for the new ship and construction is planned to begin in the early 2030s. 

Trump and US Secretary of the Navy John Phelan spoke about the new Trump-class warship as a spiritual successor to the battleships of the 20th century, but historically that term has referred to a very specific type of ship — a large, heavily armored vessel armed with massive guns designed to bombard other ships or targets ashore. 

This type of ship was at the height of prominence during World War II, and the largest of the US battleships, the Iowa-class, were about 60,000 tonnes. However, after World War II, the battleship's role in modern fleets diminished rapidly in favor of aircraft carriers and long-range missiles. The US Navy did modernize four Iowa-class battleships in the 1980s by adding cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles, along with modern radars, but by the 1990s all four were decommissioned. 

According to a newly created Web site for the “golden fleet,” this new “guided missile battleship” is set to be roughly the same size as Iowa-class battleships, but only weigh about half as much, about 35,000 tonnes, and have far smaller crews — between 650 and 850 sailors. 

Its primary weapons would also be missiles, not large naval guns. 

Trump said he would have a direct role in designing the new warship, adding that “the US Navy will lead the design of these ships along with me, because I'm a very aesthetic person.”

Hello, this is Kateryna Hodunova reporting from Kyiv on day 1,399 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Today's top story so far:

Around 100 Russian soldiers entered the village of Hrabovske in Sumy Oblast and attempted to advance toward the settlement of Riasne, Viktor Tregubov, head of the Joint Forces communications department, told Suspilne on Dec. 23.

""Russian units are currently consolidating their positions in the southern part of Hrabovske. Ukrainian forces are trying to dislodge them from their positions. Fighting continues in the village,"" Tregubov said.

The attack by Russian forces was ""sudden,"" according to Tregubov.

Tregubov added that settlements located directly on the Russian border, where Russian territory can be reached on foot, can only be reliably secured if Ukrainian forces establish a control zone extending several kilometers into Russia.

Hrabovske lies on the border with Russia's Belgorod Oblast.

Soldiers from Russia's 36th Brigade abducted 52 civilians from the village, including children, and took them to Russia — an act that constitutes a war crime. Ukraine has called on its international partners to help facilitate the return of the abducted civilians.

Last updated 6:33 p.m. Kyiv time. 

Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Siversk, Donetsk Oblast, the General Staff announced on Dec. 23.

Fighting continues in the area around Siversk, but Ukrainian soldiers have withdrawn from the settlement, ""in order to save lives and maintain the combat capability of units,"" the General Staff said.

The General Staff added that Russian forces advanced because of its ""significant numerical superiority"" and ""constant pressure from small assault groups in difficult weather conditions.""

""The city remains under the fire control of our troops. The occupiers remaining in the city are being defeated, and their logistics are being cut off. Enemy units are being blocked to prevent their further advance,"" the General Staff said.

Last updated 5:45 p.m. Kyiv time. 

Soldiers from the 79th Separate Tavriya Airborne Assault Brigade destroyed a Russian BM-21 Grad multiple-launch rocket system in the village of Malynivka, Donetsk Oblast, using a drone, the brigade said on Dec. 23.

The brigade did not specify the exact timing or location within the village where the Russian equipment was destroyed.

The operation was carried out by operators of Perun Corps strike drones, resulting in the destruction of the BM-21 Grad launcher loaded with a full complement of shells.

The BM-21 Grad is a Soviet-era 122 mm multiple rocket launcher mounted on a truck, with 40 tubes capable of firing all rockets within a few seconds. Designed for area bombardment, it has a range of 20–40 km (12–25 miles), is operated by a crew of 3–5, and can quickly redeploy after firing.

Last updated 5:08 p.m. Kyiv time. 

Ukraine has returned a group of children, aged 9 to 16, from the Russian-occupied part of Kherson Oblast, regional Governor Oleksandr Prokudin announced on Dec. 23.

Prokudin did not specify the number of children, but said they had ""gone through threats, searches, and interrogations.""

Among those rescued was a 9-year-old girl whose family had long feared leaving the occupied territory because her father is a former Ukrainian soldier. 

Another was a 16-year-old girl who lived under constant Russian strikes and was threatened by Russian military and Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officers after taking a photo of a destroyed building near her home.

All the children who returned to Ukrainian-controlled areas are now receiving psychological support, as well as assistance with paperwork and finding housing, according to Prokudin. 

Last updated 2:54 p.m. Kyiv time. 

Ukraine's State Security Service (SBU) on Dec. 23 revealed details of several alleged ""mobilization evasion schemes"" it had uncovered, leading to the arrest of eight ringleaders who now face up to ten years each in prison.

In one such scheme, the SBU said it had arrested a 62-year-old man from Lviv who ""delivered"" evadersto the west of the country before ""laying out an escape route for them to the EU through a non-working gas pipeline.""

He worked in conjunction with another Ukrainian man living in the EU who advertised their services on TikTok and met them at the other side of the pipeline when they emerged, the SBU said.

In Poltava Oblast, the SBU arrested a 48-year-old former law enforcement officer who ran a scheme obtaining fake medical certificates from neurologists he was ""familiar"" with.

""As the investigation established, draft evaders were first registered as 'inpatients' in local medical institutions, and then they were given fictitious discharge papers with serious diagnoses,"" the SBU said.

Other schemes were not quite as imaginative — one in Odesa involved a man disguised as a military officer simply transporting people in the trunk of his car, while another involved issuing camouflage clothing and sending people along a long forest trail.

At least 4 people have been killed and 26 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities reported on Dec. 23.

Russia launched 635 drones, 35 Kh-101 and Iskander-K cruise missiles, and three Kinzhal hypersonic missiles at Ukraine overnight, the Air Force said. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 587 drones and 34 Kh-101 and Iskander-K missiles. At least thirty-nine drones made it through, striking 21 locations.

Debris from intercepted missiles and drones was found at eight locations, and three Kinzhal aeroballistic missiles failed to reach their targets, with their crash sites still being identified.

In Kherson Oblast, Russian attacks injured nine people over the past day, the local military administration said.

Kherson Oblast Governor Oleksandr Prokudin also reported one death and one injury on the morning of Dec. 23 following Russian drone attacks. A man was killed in the regional center of Kherson after a drone dropped explosives on him, while a 51-year-old man was injured in the village of Tomyna Balka.

In Zhytomyr Oblast, Russian strikes killed one child and injured five other people overnight on Dec. 23, according to the local military administration.

In Kyiv Oblast, a Russian attack sparked a fire in a two-story building, killing a woman. Three others, including a girl, were injured in overnight Russian strikes, the local military administration said.

In the city of Kyiv, five people, including a child, suffered injuries due to Russian strikes, Ukraine's Emergency Service said.

In Khmelnytskyi Oblast, a Russian attack killed a civilian, Governor Serhii Tiurin said.

In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Russian strikes injured a 76-year-old man and two women, aged 76 and 69, Governor Vladyslav Haivanenko said.

In Donetsk Oblast, one person suffered injuries in a Russian attack against the city of Kostiantynivka, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin.

The mass Russian attack overnight on Dec. 23 also triggered widespread power outages across Ukraine, leaving Rivne, Ternopil, and Khmelnytskyi oblasts almost completely without electricity, the Energy Ministry said.

Russian strikes caused power outages for consumers in Vinnytsia, Chernihiv, Zhytomyr, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, and Kharkiv oblasts as well.

Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities prompted the emergency shutdown of Zaporizhstal, one of Ukraine's largest metal producers, the company said. 

The swift switch to alternative power sources allowed production to be safely halted, avoiding a man-made disaster and reducing emissions, according to the company's statement. 

Russia has lost around 1,199,280 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Dec. 23.

The number includes 1,420 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,446 tanks, 23,792 armored fighting vehicles, 70,966 vehicles and fuel tanks, 35,331 artillery systems, 1,576 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,263 air defense systems, 434 airplanes, 347 helicopters, 93,166 drones, 28 ships and boats, and two submarines.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

At least three people have been killed, and 12 others injured in a massive Russian missile and drone attack on multiple oblasts of Ukraine overnight on Dec. 23.

The assault once again targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure and Rivne, Ternopil, and Khmelnytskyi oblasts in the country's west ""are almost completely without electricity,"" the Energy Ministry said.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia launched more than 650 drones and over three dozen missiles targeting ""the entire infrastructure of life."" At least 13 oblasts were attacked, he added.

Ukraine's Air Force later reported that Russia launched 635 drones and 38 missiles, with air defenses intercepting 587 drones, and 34 missiles. Thirty-nine drones made it through, striking 21 locations.

Ukraine's Energy Ministry said that emergency power outages have been implemented in several regions across the country amid Russia's targeting of energy infrastructure.

""As soon as the security situation allows, rescue teams and energy specialists will begin addressing the consequences of the attack to restore electricity supply in the regions as quickly as possible,"" the Energy Ministry said in a statement.

Ukraine's Deputy Energy Minister Artem Nekrasov said during a briefing on Dec. 23 that as a result of the attack Ukraine's nuclear power plants have been forced to reduce their generation capacity.

""The capacity of power plants will be gradually increased to nominal values as soon as energy companies restore the networks damaged by the enemy,"" Nekrasov said.

Russian strikes damaged thermal power plants facilities operated by Ukraine's largest private energy company, DTEK,  the company said in a statement, the seventh such attack since October.

Zaporizhstal, one of Ukraine's largest steel makers, was completely cut off from power, which led to an emergency shutdown of production, its press service said.

In Zhytomyr Oblast, the attack killed a four-year-old child, and injured five people, Vitaliy Bunechko, head of the Zhytomyr Oblast Military Administration, reported.

In Kyiv Oblast, one person was killed and three others injured, Governor Mykola Kalashnyk reported.

Kyiv's mayor, Vitali Klitschko said that four people were injured in the city's Sviatoshynskyi district, where a five-storey apartment building was damaged.

In Khmelnytskyi Oblast, one person was killed, Governor Serhii Tiurin said.

In Rivne Oblast, approximately 300,000 consumers were left without electricity due to damage to a power facility, according to Governor Oleksandr Koval.


""This Russian strike sends an extremely clear signal about Russia's priorities.""
    

Lviv Oblast Governor, Maksym Kozytskyi, said that Russia attacked a critical energy infrastructure facility in the region.

In Odesa Oblast, energy, port, transport, industrial, and residential infrastructures were damaged, Governor Oleh Kiper reported. In the Chernihiv and Sumy oblasts, Russian attacks damaged critical and civilian infrastructure, governors Viacheslav Chaus and Oleh Hryhorov reported.

Explosions also were reported in the western communities of Burshtyn and Rohatyn, both located in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, as well as on the outskirts of the city of Cherkasy, public broadcaster Suspilne reported.

Poland scrambled its fighter jets and put ground-based air defense and radar detection systems on alert in response to the attack, the country's armed forces said.

The attack comes as President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that Ukrainians should brace for mass Russian missile and drone strikes over the Christmas period.

""This Russian strike sends an extremely clear signal about Russia's priorities. An attack ahead of Christmas, when people simply want to be with their families, at home, and safe,"" Zelensky said.

""An attack carried out essentially in the midst of negotiations aimed at ending this war. Putin still cannot accept that he must stop killing. And that means that the world is not putting enough pressure on Russia.""

Russia rejected a Christmas truce because it could give Ukraine a temporary respite, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Dec. 16.

Peskov's comment came after numerous temporary truces on religious holidays, including those initiated by Moscow, were previously broken by Russian forces.

Russian forces have regularly attacked Ukrainian cities in recent months amid U.S. efforts to negotiate the end of Russia's war in Ukraine.

Despite multiple rounds of negotiations, the fate of ongoing peace talks remains uncertain amid Moscow's refusal to budge from its maximalist demands in Ukraine.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

Ukrainian drones reportedly struck the Stavrolen petrochemical plant in Budyonnovsk, located in Russia's Stavropol Krai, overnight on Dec. 22, Russian Telegram media channels reported.

Photos and videos posted to social media and filmed by local residents appear to show large flames emanating from the direction of the plant, media channels claimed. 

The Stavrolen Petrochemical Enterprise is one of Russia's leading petrochemical companies and a subsidiary of Lukoil. It produces polyethylene, polypropylene, benzene, butylene-butadiene fraction, heavy petroleum resins, and other petrochemical products.

Ukraine's General Staff previously said that the plant produces drone components, composite materials, body parts, seals, and insulation for various types of Russian military equipment.

The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify reports of the strikes. Ukraine's military has not yet commented on the reported attack.

No information was immediately available on the extent of the damage caused. 

Stavropol Krai Governor Vladimir Vladimirov warned of a drone threat on the region ahead of the reported explosions and fire at the plant.

Ukraine routinely launches deep strikes against military and industrial facilities in Russia, primarily relying on domestically developed drones.

Kyiv continues to escalate its campaign against Russian oil and gas infrastructure, a key source of Moscow's revenues helping to fuel its all-out invasion of Ukraine.

The petrochemical plant, located approximately 500 kilometers (around 310 miles) from the eastern border of Ukraine, has previously served as a target of Ukrainian attacks, given its proximity to the front line.

Ukraine's Special Operations Forces confirmed a ""successful fire attack"" on plant on Nov. 12.

The 24-year-old unemployed man was recruited by Belarusian State Security Committee (KGB) to spy on Ukraine's northern borders.



Ukrainian soldiers withdrew from the settlement ""in order to save lives and maintain the combat capability of units.""

Serbia and Russia have not yet agreed on a long-term gas supply contract. The previous three-year contract expired earlier this year.

The attack comes as President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that Ukrainians should brace for mass Russian missile and drone strikes over the Christmas period.



According to Russian state media, one person was killed as a result of the incident.

Under martial law, Ukrainian men aged 25 to 60 are subject to conscription and are forbidden from leaving the country except under a certain number of specific circumstances.

Ukraine's General Staff previously said that the plant produces drone components, composite materials, body parts, seals, and insulation for various types of Russian military equipment.

According to preliminary information, on Dec. 18, Russian forces illegally detained about 50 civilians — residents of the village of Hrabovske — holding them without access to communication or adequate conditions. On Dec. 20, they were forcibly taken to Russia.

U.S. President Donald Trump, speaking at an event in Palm Beach, Florida on Dec. 22, said talks on ending Russia's war in Ukraine are ongoing, but offered few specifics on progress, next steps, or deadlines.

In Canada, however, the economy shrank more than expected by 0.3 per cent in October, the largest drop in almost three years, but is forecast to stage a partial recovery in November, official ‌data showed.

“The economy's lack ‍of momentum reinforces our view that markets have gotten ‍ahead of themselves in terms of ‌pricing in interest rate hikes for next year,” ⁠said Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics.

Money ​markets are predicting the Bank of Canada will maintain the current interest rate before potentially increasing it by 25 basis points, likely in July 2026.

On the TSX, heavyweight financial sector was up 0.5 per cent, ​outperforming peers.

Conversely, despite the ongoing rally in precious metals prices, both the gold and broader metal mining sub-indexes registered the day's largest declines.

Nevertheless, the Canadian benchmark remains on track for its strongest annual performance since 2009, with mining and gold sub-indexes more ⁠than doubling in value this year.

Brian Madden, chief investment ⁠officer at First Avenue Investment Counsel, attributed gold's performance to multiple factors, including ‌central banks diversifying reserves into gold, persistent geopolitical tensions and the diminishing opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets as markets anticipate Federal Reserve rate cuts.

Among share moves, Strathcona Resources plunged 24.7 per cent after the oil and gas producer ‌provided an update on capital structure.

U.S. stocks are holding near their record levels Tuesday following updates that showed the economy grew sharply during the third quarter, but inflation remains high and consumers are losing confidence.

The S&P 500 rose 0.1 per cent and is just below the all-time high it set earlier this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 66 points, or 0.1 per cent. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.1 per cent.

A majority of stocks with the S&P 500 were losing ground, but the market was being bolstered by several big technology stocks. Nvidia rose 0.8 per cent and Google's parent company, Alphabet, rose 1 per cent. They are among several companies with outsized valuations that tend to have more impact on the broader market's direction.

Novo Nordisk jumped 8.9 per cent after U.S. regulators approved a pill version of the blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy, the first daily oral medication to treat obesity.

Wall Street is getting the latest economic updates during an otherwise quiet holiday-shortened week. Markets in the U.S. will close early Wednesday for Christmas Eve and remain closed for Christmas on Thursday.

The U.S. economy grew at a 4.3 per cent annual rate during the third quarter. That builds on 3.8 per cent growth during the second quarter and marks a sharp turnaround from the first quarter, when the U.S. economy shrank for the first time in three years.

The latest report also showed that stubborn inflation continues to hover over the economy. The Federal Reserve's favored inflation gauge — called the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE — climbed to a 2.8 per cent annual pace last quarter, up from 2.1 per cent in the second quarter.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.18 per cent from 4.15 per cent just before the report on gross domestic product for the third quarter was released. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed actions, rose to 3.54 per cent from 3.49 per cent just prior to the report's release.

The Fed has been taking a more cautious policy approach amid mixed signals from the economy. Economic growth has been occurring at the same time that inflation remains stubbornly above the central bank's 2 per cent target. The job market is also slowing, adding another layer of concern to whether the central bank should continue cutting interest rates.

Wall Street expects the Fed to hold rates steady at its upcoming meeting in January.

Consumer spending and confidence has been a shaky amid worries about high prices, especially with a wide-ranging U.S. trade war that could drive prices for many goods even higher.

The latest update from business group The Conference Board showed that consumer confidence fell in December to its lowest level since tariffs were rolled out in April. Meanwhile, retail sales have been weakening, with consumers growing more cautious.

Consumers have become more targeted in their buying during the holiday shopping season, according to Visa's Consulting and Analytics division. From Nov. 1 through Sunday, cash and credit card sales rose 4.2 per cent, which is less than the 4.8 per cent increase during the same period a year ago.

Markets were mixed in Asia and Europe.

A mega-prison known as Detention Center Against Terrorism in Tecoluca, El Salvador.Salvador Melendez/The Associated Press

A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration must give legal due process to Venezuelan migrants flown to a notorious prison in El Salvador, either by providing court hearings or returning them to the U.S.

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ordered the government to come up with a plan within two weeks for the men, who have since been returned to Venezuela in a prisoner swap.

“Plaintiffs should not have been removed in the manner that they were, with virtually no notice and no opportunity to contest the bases of their removal, in clear contravention of their due-process rights,” Boasberg wrote.

It's the latest development in a case that's been a legal flashpoint in the administration's sweeping crackdown on immigration. It started in March, after Trump invoked an 18th century wartime law to send Venezuelan migrants accused of being gang members to a mega-prison known as the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.

Two planeloads of men were flown to the prison, despite a verbal order from Boasberg for the aircraft to turn around. Boasberg subsequently started a contempt investigation, though the dramatic battle between the judicial and executive branches has been paused by an appeals court.

The administration has denied violating his order. The White House did not have immediate comment on Monday's ruling.

More than 200 migrants were released back to Venezuela in a prisoner swap with the U.S. in July.

The ruling from Boasberg, who was appointed to the federal bench by Democratic President Barack Obama, opens a path for them to challenge the allegation that they're members of the Tren de Aragua gang and subject to removal under the Alien Enemies Act.

“This critical ruling makes clear that the Trump administration cannot simply spirit people off to a notorious foreign prison with zero due process and simply walk away. There are consequences,” said ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt, who represents the migrants.

U.S. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth alongside President Donald Trump looks on, at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club on Monday. The Trump administration has said the recent boat strikes were meant to stop the flow of drugs into the U.S.Alex Brandon/The Associated Press

The U.S. military said Monday that it had conducted another strike against a boat it said was smuggling drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean, killing one person.

In a social-media post, U.S. Southern Command said, “Intelligence confirmed the low-profile vessel was transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Eastern Pacific and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations.” Southern Command provided no evidence that the vessel was engaged in drug smuggling.

A video posted by U.S. Southern Command shows splashes of water near one side of the boat. After a second salvo, the rear of the boat catches fire. More splashes engulf the craft and the fire grows. In the final second of the video, the vessel can be seen adrift with a large patch of fire alongside it.

Earlier videos of U.S. boat strikes showed vessels suddenly exploding, suggesting missile strikes. Some strike videos even had visible rocket-like projectiles coming down on the boats.

Trump threatens Maduro as U.S. steps up Venezuela campaign

The Trump administration has said the strikes were meant to stop the flow of drugs into the U.S. and increase pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

At least 105 people have been killed in 29 known strikes since early September. The strikes have faced scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and human rights activists, who say the administration has offered scant evidence that its targets are indeed drug smugglers and say the fatal strikes amount to extrajudicial killings.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Coast Guard has stepped up efforts to interdict oil tankers in the Caribbean Sea as part of the Trump administration's escalating campaign against Maduro.

Over 30% of people who regularly need support from a food bank in Germany are children, activists say. Meanwhile, German property prices have risen for a fourth straight quarter. DW has the latest.

We've paused this blog for now. Below is a roundup of the main headlines from Germany on Tuesday, December 23.

We're pausing our coverage here since it's the evening of 23rd December. We'll be back with the latest news from the country tomorrow morning. See you then!

Germany has deported a convicted criminal to Syria for the first time since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011, the Interior Ministry has said.

The man was handed over to Syrian authorities in Damascus on Tuesday morning, after Berlin reached an agreement with the Syrian government allowing deportations of convicted criminals and security threats to take place on a regular basis.

The deported man had served a prison sentence in North Rhine-Westphalia for particularly serious robbery, assault, and extortion, the ministry said.

Earlier on Tuesday, another convicted offender was deported to Afghanistan, following a similar removal last week.

The Afghan national had been imprisoned in Bavaria, including for intentional bodily harm. The ministry said this marked the second deportation of an Afghan criminal within a week.

Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt said the government was acting in the public interest.

""Our society has a legitimate interest in criminals leaving our country,"" he said, adding that the government stood for control, consistency, and clear consequences.

Human rights groups have been critical of Berlin's efforts to send back immigrants to Syria and Afghanistan, as both countries still suffer instability and consistent reports of rights abuses.

But the conservative-led government has prioritized resuming deportations to Syria since its former President Bashar Assad was overthrown in December last year.

Nearly one in three people relying on food banks in Germany is a child, highlighting growing social pressure despite stable overall demand.

Food bank volunteering organization Tafel Deutschland said some 1.5 million people are currently using the services of more than 970 food distribution points nationwide.

About 30% of users are children, while roughly 20% are older than 63.

""Above all, the number of children has risen slightly compared with last year, and that worries us,"" said Andreas Steppuhn, chair of Tafel Deutschland.

Rising rents and food prices are leaving many households with less money each month, Steppuhn said, adding that around one-third of food banks are still operating waiting lists or have stopped taking on new users.

In 2025, the food banks rescued about 265,000 metric tons of food that would otherwise have been thrown away.

That amounts to around 500 kilograms (about 1,100 pounds) per minute, equivalent to about 500 cartons of milk every minute, according to the organization.

Investigators in the German city of Giessen have continued working overnight after a car crash in the city center left several people injured.

The incident happened on Monday afternoon when a 32-year-old driver veered into oncoming traffic on a main road and collided with another vehicle near a bus stop. 

A woman standing nearby was seriously injured, according to a police spokesperson. Three other people suffered minor injuries, including the driver, who was also hurt. How exactly the injuries occurred — and whether the crash was accidental or deliberate — remains under investigation.

The driver, a 32-year-old man from Azerbaijan who lives in Giessen, was provisionally detained. Police said they were investigating ""in all directions.""

The state of Hesse's Interior Minister Roman Poseck, said late Monday that a political or terrorist motive currently appeared unlikely. He added it was possible that an illness may have played a role, and that the serious injury was likely caused by the collision with another vehicle rather than an intentional act.

Germans have been popping fewer corks, with sales of sparkling wine falling sharply over the past decade.

The country's statistics agency said on Tuesday that 255.3 million liters of sparkling wine were sold last year, down 19.5% compared with 10 years earlier. Alcohol-free sparkling wine was not included.

On average, people aged 16 and over drank about 4.8 bottles of sparkling wine, or 36 glasses, over the year. That marks a clear drop from 2014, when per-capita consumption stood at 6.1 bottles, or 46 glasses.

The figures are based on tax data, as sparkling wine with more than 1.2% alcohol is subject to a special excise tax. In 2024, the federal government collected about €352 million ($415 million) from the sparkling wine tax, accounting for just 0.04% of total public tax revenue.

By comparison, beer tax revenue — collected by individual states — was higher, bringing in about 558 million euros, the statistics office said.

The tax on sparkling wine was introduced in 1902 to help fund the German navy, making it one of the oldest still-existing consumer excise taxes in the country.

House and apartment prices in Germany continued climbing into autumn, showing a fourth consecutive quarterly increase.

Germany's Federal Statistical Office said prices between July and September were up 3.3% from a year earlier, extending a rebound after steady declines since late 2022.

According to the statistics office, residential property prices increased in all regions.

Single- and two-family homes rose most in urban districts at 3.6% and in large independent cities at 3.5%, while gains in sparsely populated rural areas averaged 3.2%.

Apartment prices climbed even faster in cities. Buyers paid 4.7% more in urban districts and 5.0% more in large cities, while prices rose 2.6% in sparsely populated rural areas and 5.5% in densely populated rural districts.

In Germany's seven largest cities — Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, and Duesseldorf — prices for single- and two-family homes increased 2.7%. Apartment prices in those cities rose slightly more, up 2.8% year on year.

Seven people have been injured in Hamburg after a driver fleeing police caused a crash on Monday evening.

Police said the 37-year-old had been due to face questions after unsuccessfully trying to break into cars, but instead fled the scene in another vehicle.

During the escape, his car became trapped between a city bus and another vehicle.

Three people on the bus and three occupants of the car suffered minor injuries or shock, police said.

The driver was pinned inside his vehicle and had to be freed by emergency crews. He was then taken to hospital and received treatment for minor injuries.

Guten Morgen from DW's newsroom in Bonn, where the Christmas market season is slowly drawing to a close and the holiday season proper is about to start.

Not everything is cheerful as Christmas draws near, however. Today, figures released by a food bank charity show that one in every three people relying on food banks is a child.

Tafel Deutschland says rising rents and food prices are leaving many households with less money each month.

Influential game developer Vince Zampella, one of the creative minds behind the popular Call of Duty franchise, died after the Ferrari he was driving reportedly crashed into a concrete barrier in northern Los Angeles.

Renowned game designer Vince Zampella has died, US video gaming company Electronic Arts said in a statement on Monday. The gaming juggernaut did not mention the cause of death.

A separate report by the NBC Los Angeles, however, stated that the 55-year-old had been driving a Ferrari with another passenger on Sunday afternoon when the car slammed into a concrete barrier and caught fire.

Zampella died at the scene, while the passenger later died in hospital, the broadcaster said.

Police told the LA Times that the identities of the deceased were pending release by the county coroner.

Zampella co-created Infinity Ward, the studio that published the wildly popular ""Call of Duty"" video games.

The first-person shooter game debuted in 2003 as a World War II simulation and has since spawned dozens of spin offs and sequels, the most recent being ""Call of Duty: Black Ops 7"" which was released in November 2025. The franchise has sold over 500 million copies globally and came to dominate the first-person-shooter genre, especially among the millennial generation of gamers.

A feature film based on the game is also in production with Paramount Pictures.

But Zampella isn't just known for ""Call of Duty.""

In 2010, he cofounded Respawn Entertainment, an EA subsidiary. As head of the studio, he led the creation of successful games such as ""Titanfall,"" and ""Apex Legends.""

The story-driven single-player games ""Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order"" and ""Star Wars Jedi: Survivor"" also received widespread acclaim, particularly among fans.

In its statement, Electronic Arts said that Zampella's influence on the video game industry was ""profound and far-reaching.""

""A friend, colleague, leader and visionary creator, his work helped shape modern interactive entertainment and inspired millions of players and developers around the world,"" the statement said.

Video game journalist Geoff Keighley, who is also the founder of the annual The Game Awards celebrating the industry, said he was shocked to hear of Zampella's sudden death.

He called Zampella a ""titan of the video game industry"" in a post on X.

""Vince was an extraordinary person — a gamer at heart, but also a visionary executive with a rare ability to recognize talent and give people the freedom and confidence to create something truly great,"" Keighley wrote on social media on Monday.

In a separate post, Keighley posted an old interview he did with Zampella about Call of Duty.

Five new hotels were opened in Samjiyon, near the Chinese border, with Kim Jong Un praising the ""rising status"" of North Korea's people.

North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un and his daughter Ju Ae have opened what state media calls an ""attractive mountainous tourist resort and leisure ground for the people.""

According to the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), five luxury hotels have opened their doors in Samjiyon, a remote northern city near China.

Pyongyang promoted its latest luxury hotels, featuring amenities such as barbecue restaurants, hot tubs and leisure spaces, despite widespread economic hardship across the country.

Kim, who attended the ceremonies on Saturday, declared the resort ""clear proof of the rising status of our people,"" despite the hardships most North Koreans endure.

He personally inspected the facilities, even testing the firmness of the beds for good measure, according to KCNA. His daughter, believed by many analysts to be the heir apparent, was by his side for the grand tour.

State media insisted the hotels were proof citizens have ""nothing to envy in the world.""

The opening comes as Kim seeks to highlight the ⁠country's ‍economic progress ahead of a party congress next year, when a new development plan ‌is expected ‌to be unveiled.

According to KCNA he said the new resort was ""clear proof of the ever-growing ideal of our people and our state's potential for development.""

Tourism to North Korea remains a tightly choreographed affair mostly limited to government-approved tours that offer only controlled glimpses of life in the hermit kingdom.

But Kim is on a drive to boost tourism, and the opening of the new hotels at Samjiyon follows North Korea's launch of the Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Zone earlier this year.

He declared Samjiyon to be an ""innovative and highly civilized city representing the tourism culture of the country.""

""The main target demographic is foreigners,"" Peter Ward, a research fellow at the Sejong Institute in Seoul, told AFP. But, he added, visits to Samjiyon could also serve as rewards for ""productive units"" of workers.

Lim Eul-Chul, a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies at Kyungnam University, said ""large-scale group tourism could soon be accommodated via border regions with China.""

			President says US will build a ‘Golden Fleet' including the largest battleships in its history

The US will commission a new “Golden Fleet” of heavily armed Navy ‘battleships' named after Donald Trump.

The president announced that the laser-armed vessels would be the “largest battleships in the history of the world” to maintain his country's military supremacy.

He said construction on the Trump Class USS Defiant – the first US warship to be named after a sitting president – would begin soon, and it was expected to be operational within two and a half years.

Mr Trump told reporters at Mar-a-Lago, Florida: “Each one of these will be the largest battleship in the history of our country, the largest battleship in the history of the world ever built.”

Speaking alongside images of the ships, he described them as “100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built” and said: “They'll help maintain American military supremacy, revive the American ship-building industry and inspire fear in America's enemies all over the world.”

Mr Trump said the new laser-armed battleships would be built with the help of robots and AI, but also create employment: “We're going to be employing a lot of artificial things but the beauty is we're going to have more jobs than we've ever had.”

The 30,000 to 40,000-tonne battleships will be made from steel and armed with missiles, guns, hypersonic weapons and high powered lasers, the US president said.

They will also carry new nuclear-armed, sea-launched cruise missiles that are currently under development and, he said, had been proven to be “extremely lethal”.

Mr Trump said he would assist the US Navy in designing the ships because he was a “very aesthetic person”, and that Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary, and Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, who attended the press conference, would be involved.

However, Mark Montgomery, a retired rear admiral and current senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington, said the ships were not suitable for confronting China.

He told the New York Times the navy needed a dispersed fleet of minimally manned ships with large weapons magazines. “These ‘battleships' will achieve none of these tactical goals,” he said.

Mr Trump also said the government plans to keep oil recovered from seized Venezuelan oil tankers. US authorities have boarded two tankers this month and are in “active pursuit” of a third ship as America ramps up pressure on Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela's president to relinquish power.

The Trump administration has accused Venezuela of using oil money to fund drug-related crime, while Caracas has described the tanker seizures as “piracy”. Asked what they plan to do with the oil, Mr Trump said: “We'll keep it, maybe we'll use it in the strategic reserves, we're keeping it, we're keeping the ships also.”

The Golden Fleet announcement comes a month after the US Navy scrapped its plans to build a new small warship, citing growing delays and cost overruns. It instead decided on an upgraded version of an existing Coast Guard cutter.

Historically, the term battleship has referred to a very specific type of ship – a large, heavily armoured vessel armed with massive guns designed to bombard other ships or targets ashore.

Battleships were at the height of prominence during the Second World War, and the largest of the US battleships, the Iowa Class, were roughly 60,000 tons. Since the war, modern fleets have favoured aircraft carriers and long-range missiles.

The US Navy did modernise four Iowa-class battleships in the 1980s by adding cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles, along with modern radars, but by the 1990s all four had been decommissioned.

Recommended

Mr Trump has long held strong opinions on specific aspects of the Navy's fleet, sometimes with a view to keeping older technology instead of modernising.

During his first term, he unsuccessfully called for the return to steam-powered catapults to launch jets from the Navy's newest aircraft carriers instead of the more modern electromagnetic system.

He has also complained to John Phelan, the Secretary of the Navy, about the look of its destroyers and decried ships being covered in rust.

Mr Phelan told senators at his confirmation hearing that Trump “has texted me numerous times very late at night, sometimes after one [o'clock] in the morning” about “rusty ships or ships in a yard, asking me what am I doing about it”.

The US government warned of “untrue and sensationalist” claims after documents released in the Epstein files accused Donald Trump of rape.

The Department of Justice said some documents released on Tuesday were “unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they would have been weaponised against President Trump already”.

One FBI document includes details of a call from a limousine driver to investigators. The driver says he overheard a phone conversation in 1995 by Mr Trump in which he discussed “abusing some girl” while mentioning the name “Jeffrey”.

The driver then claims his ex-partner told him she was raped by Mr Trump and Jeffrey Epstein.

The FBI has appended a “note” to the testimony that appears to cast doubt on the source.

The DoJ warned against Epstein Files claims made to the FBI “right before the 2020 election”, but did not reference the rape claims specifically.

The call to the FBI by the driver was made on October 27, 2020, a week before that year's election.

The claim was included in the release of 30,000 more pages of documents on Monday night. The White House has been accused of orchestrating a “cover-up” to protect Mr Trump, with earlier releases containing little to no mention of the president and heavy redactions.

A “duchess from England” was “supposed to teach” Epstein's Palm Beach staff how to properly maintain a house, a document suggests, writes Fiona Parker.

Notes on the recollections of a former member of Epstein's household staff also describe how the individual would “wipe and sanitise massage tables” on a “weekly” basis and how he “fought” with Epstein once when Epstein didn't have a pen by his night table with a light as “required”. 

The November 2021 document appears to be notes recorded by federal prosecutors or their colleagues.

A “booklet” was discussed by the former member of staff which contained rules for how the household should be run.

The notes read: “The document contained all of the tasks that were demanded of him. remembers seeing this manual for the first time when a duchess from England came. 

“She was a woman who was supposed to be royalty and supposed to teach the staff how to properly maintain a house. 

“This document was a booklet provided to [redacted] by this lady who was hired by [Jeffrey Epstein] and [Ghislaine Maxwell].”

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) received an anonymous tip in 2020 alleging that Jeffrey Epstein helped organise “pedophilia… for Prince Andrew”, writes Poppy Wood. 

A tranche of documents published by the US Government on Tuesday included an official FBI record detailing the claim against the former duke made by an anonymous tipster from Finland. 

The report was submitted via a tips portal on the FBI's website a year after the agency launched a call for evidence following Epstein's indictment for sex trafficking minors. 

The website was open to all members of the public and there is no evidence that the tip was substantiated.

It said: “Pedophilia organized by JE for Prince Andrew. For evidence: look for keys stored in the drawing room. There are tapes in a secret compartment of a drawer next to a Michelangelo picture of a flower vase at his house in the Bahamas. Look also for other things in the kitchen. There is also another studio apartment in the Bahamas and in Ipanema, Brazil, and Florianopolis, Brazil.”

The tipster added that their allegation referred to “Jeffrey Epstein and Prince Andrew of the UK”. Asked via the FBI tips website how long the alleged activity had been going on for, they replied “15 years”, and claimed to have either evidence or a witness to support the claim. 

The claimant did not provide any personal details but the FBI report included an IP address, which was redacted when published on Tuesday as part of the latest Epstein files release.

Epstein was not known to own properties in the Bahamas or Brazil, but owned a house on Little Saint James in the US Virgin Islands – more than a five hours' flight away from the Bahamas. 

The anonymous report was submitted to the FBI in March 2020, seven months after US court records were unsealed detailing Virginia Giuffre's allegations against the former prince, and four months after the royal's famous Newsnight interview.  

Mrs Giuffre alleged that Epstein forced her to have sex with the then-prince on several occasions in 2001 when she was 17. Andrew has always denied the claims. 

Jeffrey Epstein once planned for two prominent figures — former Barclays chief executive Jes Staley and former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers — to oversee his estate in the event of his death, the new tranche of documents shows.

The material, published this week by the United States Department of Justice, includes multiple drafts of Epstein's will spanning several years. These show that the disgraced financier revised his estate plans repeatedly, at one point naming Staley and Summers among those responsible for administering his affairs.

In a 2012 draft, Staley appeared only as a “successor executor”, meaning he would step in if others were unable to act. In later versions dated 2013 and 2014, he was listed as a full executor. Summers was named as a successor executor in the 2014 document.

Neither man appears in what seems to be Epstein's final will from 2019. Epstein comitted suicide in a New York jail in August that year while awaiting trial on federal child sex trafficking charges.

The files also show that Staley celebrated Epstein's release from jail after the latter was convicted of procuring an underage prostitute. Writing to Epstein in 2010, Staley wrote: “Happy new year. It nice to have u free. Much to come... Please know that I am a friend forever.”

Lawyers for Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor were assured that any FBI interview with him would not be recorded, a memo of a conversation suggests, writes Fiona Parker. 

Notes that appear to be taken from a telephone conference with a counsel for the then-Duke of York in January 2020.

It is not known which individuals sent or received the email, but the subject is entitled “notes from t/c with counsel to Prince Andrew”.“prosecutors and also two primary FBI agents” were listed below an “introductions” heading.

Under a head, “how does such an interview ordinary work?”, notes read: “[N]ot recorded, not videotaped or audiotaped; instead, agents take notes (and of course counsel can take notes as well).

“[T]he interview is not formally under oath, there's no swearing-in, but it is a crime in the U.S. to knowingly lie to federal law enforcement officers.”

The notes - which appear to be written by US prosecutors or the FBI also state that they “do not publicize the content or even existence of interviews”.

The notes continued: “Subject matter we are interested in is, broadly, the nature and scope of client's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and his associates, including professional associates, staff, and personal relationships, including Ghislaine Maxwell.”

Newly released emails suggest that Epstein may have used a fake Austrian passport to travel during the 1980s under the identity of a real man who lived in the US.

Emails show agents attempting to identify the passport holder, noting that a man with the same name — originally from Austria and later residing in Southampton, New York — appeared to have lived for a period in Saudi Arabia, matching details listed on the passport.

The fake passport was found in a safe in Jeffrey Epstein's Manhattan residence in July 2019, days after his arrest on federal sex trafficking charges.

Investigators discussed verifying the individual's date of birth and contacting him directly to establish why a foreign passport in his name, but with Epstein's photograph, was found inside Epstein's safe.

The new file dump also contains photos of the fake passport.

A victim of Epstein described Ghislaine Maxwell as a “psychopath” who lived a “parasitic” and “lavish” lifestyle funded by Epstein, according to newly released documents, writes India McTaggart.

Emails in the Epstein files reveal a victim impact statement submitted in December 2020 to Alison J. Nathan, opposing Maxwell's application for bail. In the statement, the unnamed victim accused the British socialite of “abusing her position of power to live beyond the rules”.

“I write this not only on behalf of myself, but all of the other girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell,” the victim wrote, adding that Maxwell had sexually abused her as a child and must be held accountable in court.

Drawing on her own experience, the victim said she believed Maxwell to be “a psychopath”, arguing that her abuse of multiple children and young women demonstrated a “disregard for and violation of the rights of others”.

The submission was emailed to the court by Boies Schiller Flexner partner Sigrid McCawley, who asked how the statement should be formally lodged.

The victim warned that Maxwell was “willing to harm others if it benefits her” and “quite capable” of doing so again if released, adding that she had shown no remorse for her role in procuring victims for Epstein.

Earlier this month, Maxwell said publication of the Epstein files could harm her chances of release. She is currently serving a 20-year sentence.

As the world sifts through the latest dump of files for more details about Jeffrey Epstein's circle of associates, Donald Trump has only one thing on his mind in Palm Beach, writes The Telegraph's Rob Crilly.

He left his home at Mar-a-Lago just after 9am to spend the morning at his nearby golf club. The weather is a pleasant 24C and Mr Trump, a creature of habit, is doing what he normally does when he is in Florida: Playing golf.

He has stepped up pressure on Venezuela, faces continuing questions about a cost of living crisis, and has seen once-loyal Members of Congress become obstructions to his programme. But he has nothing on his public schedule today and looks like he is winding down for Christmas.

US lawyers believed there were “various factual inaccuracies” in Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's accounts during their probe into Epstein, newly released emails show.

The internal communications came during a public row between the former duke and US prosecutors over his cooperation with their requests for an interview.

Andrew's legal team had released a statement before the June 2020 email in which they said he had on “at least three occasions this year offered his assistance as a witness” to the Department of Justice.

An unnamed lawyer from New York told Geoff Berman, the former US attorney for the Southern District of New York, on June 8 2020: “Geoff – as discussed, I've put together a short proposed statement responding to the press release issued by Prince Andrew's counsel this morning.

“If we do issue something in response, as you'll see, I would recommend we keep it short and forward looking, rather than trying to rehash all of the various factual inaccuracies in his account of the past.”

Mr Berman went on to publicly accuse the former duke of attempting to “falsely portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate”.

Emails released this week show that the Metropolitan Police contacted the FBI last month to ask whether there were any active investigations linked to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and his association with Epstein.

In a Nov 10 email, a detective chief inspector said the Met was “reviewing” allegations that the former duke sought information about Virginia Giuffre through his protection officers, alongside claims related to human trafficking and Epstein flight logs involving trips to the UK.

The officer noted that a colleague had previously worked with the FBI in 2021 on cases involving Epstein and his convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.

The enquiry followed the release of documents by the US House oversight committee and an interview request from Democratic members of the committee to the former duke. Earlier this month, the Met said it would not open a criminal investigation into the claims.

The credibility issues do not end with the Trump rape claim itself.

In the same testimony, the speaker also discusses “John W Nichols”, a figure frequently cited in conspiracy theories surrounding the Clintons. They reference an alleged incident in which Hillary Clinton was seen “drunk”, and claim they were once set up for “the bombing in Oklahoma City” – an apparent confusion with the 1995 Unabomber attack.

After the Trump allegation, the speaker also refers to a murder supposedly covered up as a suicide, involving a Mexican drug cartel and Ghislaine Maxwell.

Without additional context, it is difficult to give these claims any more weight than that of an anonymous hoaxer wasting the authorities' time. It also strains credulity that Mr Trump would have spoken so openly about alleged crimes in a setting where he could be overheard by a driver he did not know. The testimony also refers to attempts – apparently by the driver's ex-partner – to extract money from Ghislaine Maxwell.

There is a danger for the president in material like this being released without filtering. It may generate headlines alleging he raped a woman alongside Epstein.

But there is also a danger for the media. Reporting such material as a serious allegation, without further corroboration, risks backfiring — handing ammunition to those who argue that the Epstein files are unreliable, and that their release muddies rather than clarifies the truth.

The Trump administration's decision to cut funding for World Food Program operations has left families desperate.

In August, I traveled to Kakuma, Kenya, to try to understand what happened when the U.S. cut off food to the world's third-largest refugee camp.

Soon after President Donald Trump froze foreign aid on his first day in office, my colleague Brett Murphy and I began hearing from government experts. We learned that despite explicit promises from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that food and other life-saving care would continue during the administration's review of foreign aid, programs were shutting down, putting millions of lives at risk. I've covered health in the U.S. and abroad for 15 years, and Brett has covered both the State Department and public health in the U.S. Brett and I teamed up, interviewing dozens of government officials and aid workers, and pouring over reams of internal government documents. Then, we traveled to Kakuma (and South Sudan) to see for ourselves how these policies were affecting people.

In an investigation we published last week, we wrote about how food rations were slashed throughout the camp of more than 308,000 people. We learned first-hand how the Trump administration's decision to withhold funding for the World Food Program's operations in Kenya led children to starve and forced thousands of families to make impossible decisions. One of the groups hit hardest by the cuts was pregnant women.

We arrived on a hot, dry day in August with Kenyan photographer Brian Otieno and went straight to the camp's only hospital, which is run by the International Rescue Committee. The only physician working the hospital's wards at the time, Dr. Kefa Otieno (no relation to the photographer), gave us a tour.

As we entered the maternity unit, a large yellow room with around 45 beds, the majority of them occupied, the doctor explained that the aid cuts were causing an epidemic of life-threatening pregnancy complications. Starving women were giving birth to premature babies. Even those who made it to term were often dangerously underweight. The hospital was understaffed, and people in the camp were so anemic that they couldn't get enough blood donations. Otieno had twice donated himself while he was midsurgery in order to save a pregnant woman's life.

Off one side of the maternity ward was a small, stark room with a bench along one wall and two wheeled, metal beds. Otieno called it the kangaroo room. Inside were moms and premature babies too small to safely return home. The hospital had no functional incubators, so medical staff ascribe to a method called kangaroo mother care, where moms hold their babies against their skin to keep them warm and help them grow.

There, we met Monica and her baby Mary, and Binti and her son Nuru. Both women had difficult pregnancies that the medical staff ascribed to malnourishment. Both had given birth prematurely to underweight babies. And when we visited, both had been trapped in the room for weeks, desperately trying to help their babies gain weight.

Monica, 21, is funny, with a dry, sharp wit. She met her husband Ramazani at church, when she was singing in the choir. They'd dated for a couple of years before she found out she was pregnant in December last year. They were both scared and excited to be parents, but the timing of the pregnancy was unlucky: As Monica's belly grew, food rations shrank.

Monica began struggling with anemia and high blood pressure. Otieno told me the roots of these complications were undernourishment. 

Monica doesn't remember going into labor. Ramazani found her collapsed on the floor when he returned from one of the camp's community showers. She was having seizures, and it took a few hours before they got her to the hospital. Medical staff rushed her in for an emergency cesarean section; she was in such dire shape that staff thought they were going to lose both Monica and her baby. When we met three weeks later, Monica still struggled to speak, her tongue contorted and swollen from biting on it for so long during the seizures.

Still, she was able to tell me about her pregnancy, including a time when she was about five months along and hadn't eaten for two days. She went to a nearby vendor to beg for a samosa on loan, promising to pay him back later in the day. She then hid in her house for several days, pretending no one was home when he came by to collect the few cents she owed. (Ramazani eventually paid him back.)

At age 28, Nuru was Binti's thirdchild. She'd had no complications with her previous pregnancies, but with Nuru, she barely gained weight. Binti had come to Kakuma in 2016 after fleeing violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo. When she first arrived at the camp, there was always food.

“I had other kinds of stress, but never with food,” she said one afternoon while sitting on the floor sewing curtains for the sparse hospital room.

But during this pregnancy, she said, food was all she thought about. She was so anemic and hungry that she resorted to eating clay, digging out the top layer of earth to get to the cleaner soil below, and charcoal. Her chart showed she gained fewer than 10 pounds during her entire pregnancy. Her baby, Nuru, was born at 33 weeks, weighing about 3.5 pounds.

Otieno wanted the babies to weigh 4 pounds before they went home, enough that they'd have a fighting chance against infection. Hospital staff put the babies on a scale every two days, and before each weigh in, Binti would get herself hyped up: “I can feel it, today is the day we are going home,” she said one afternoon. Monica tried not to think about what the scale would say. Both she and Mary had dropped weight in the preceding weeks. After so much loss, she didn't want to get her hopes up.

But, while Binti and Monica were desperate to get out of the hospital and home to their families — Binti to her other children and Monica to her two younger siblings — leaving would come at a cost. If and when they went, they'd be cut off from food again. 

At the hospital, staff brought around three simple meals every day, typically lentils and rice or sorghum porridge. Outside the hospital, they'd have almost nothing.

Facing dwindling supplies, WFP, which provides food for the camp, made the dramatic decision to only give rations to about half the camp's residents in August. Families were placed into groups based on rough estimates of need. Even though Monica and Binti were stuck in the hospital precisely because they didn't have enough to eat, Binti and Ramazani had both been placed in categories that meant they would get no food. Monica and her younger siblings were set to receive just 420 calories a day each.

In the meantime, Binti and Monica bonded: They told stories and held one another's babies while they showered or went to the bathroom. They took turns sleeping on the bench so the babies could have one of the beds. Monica and Ramazani, who spent almost every night at the hospital, made sure that a tiny copy of the Bible was always placed next to baby Mary's head.

One Saturday morning, Otieno came in to weigh the babies. Binti bounced back and forth on her feet like a boxer preparing for a bout. Nuru weighed in at just under 4 pounds. Binti raised her arms in victory: They could go home.

Then it was baby Mary's turn. “This baby is refusing to gain weight,” Otieno mumbled, trying to still her wiggly legs to get an accurate measurement. Mary had gained 10 grams, equivalent to two-thirds of a tablespoon of water. After days of losing weight, it was perhaps a small victory, but not one that Monica would celebrate. She picked up Mary, held her against her chest, and sat back down on the bench.

I asked Monica about her hopes for the future. She said all she wanted was to be resettled in the U.S. with her siblings and Mary, so they could all go to school and have enough to eat. “Fill your notebook with that,” she said. “It's the only thing I want.”

At the end of September, the administration gave WFP's Kenya operations $66 million, 40% less than the U.S. gave in 2024 and nine months into the year. WFP has said the funds will be enough to provide food to the camp through March, though rations are still far below what humanitarians consider the daily minimum of calories. 

In response to a series of questions, a senior State Department official told us that the U.S. still gives WFP hundreds of millions a year and the administration is shifting to investments that will better serve both the U.S. and key allies like Kenya over time. 

The official also said that the Office of Management and Budget, not the State Department, has ultimate authority to approve new foreign aid money. When we asked OMB about the delays, communications director Rachel Cauley told us: “That's absolutely false. And that's not even how this process works.” She did not clarify what was false.

Trump is mentioned numerous times in the latest batch of documents related to the elite sex trafficker.

As we produce journalism that combats authoritarianism, censorship, injustice, and misinformation, your support is urgently needed. Please make a year-end gift to Truthout today.

The US Department of Justice on Tuesday released a new batch of documents related to the criminal investigation of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein — along with a disclaimer aimed at exonerating President Donald Trump, who is mentioned numerous times in the latest disclosures.

In a message posted on X, the DOJ asserted that some of the latest documents “contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election.”

The DOJ insisted that “the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.”

Among the latest batch of documents released by the DOJ was a letter purportedly written by Epstein in prison to fellow convicted sex offender Larry Nassar in which he claimed that Trump “shares our love of young, nubile girls.”

The existence of this letter was reported by the Associated Press in 2023, although its contents were not known at the time. According to MeidasTouch, investigators who found the letter submitted it for handwriting analysis to verify its authenticity, but it is not definitively known at this time if it was written by Epstein.

An internal DOJ email from 2020, meanwhile, states that Trump flew with Epstein on his private plane at least eight times between 1993 and 1996, which was more than had been previously known.

On two occasions, Trump and Epstein shared flights with two people whom the DOJ described as “possible witnesses” in a criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime Epstein accomplice who is serving a prison sentence for conspiring to help him sexually abuse minors.

The DOJ's post defending Trump from allegations made in the documents it had just released drew scrutiny from Politico senior legal affairs reporter Kyle Cheney, who pointed out some basic logical inconsistencies with the department's claims.

“Bizarre defensive post from DOJ saying if allegations of Trump had any credibility they would've been ‘weaponized' against him,” he wrote in response. “But… if they had credibility, then pursuing them, by definition, wouldn't be weaponization.”

Former Republican congressman Joe Walsh, who left the party over his disgust with Trump, said the DOJ post was further evidence of a justice system that had been totally compromised by the president's personal interests.

“Technically, this tweet is coming from our government,” he wrote. “But it sounds like and reads like it's coming from Trump's lawyers. Trump has so completely corrupted our Justice Department.”

Walsh's sentiment was echoed by Rep. Nellie Pou (D-NJ), who argued that “the US Department of Justice shouldn't be acting like the White House's personal law firm.”

Trump's past relationship with Epstein has come under greater scrutiny in recent months, and the New York Times last week published a lengthy report detailing the two men's years of friendship.

Stacey Williams, a former model who has accused Trump of groping her in front of Epstein in 1993, told the Times that the two men were engaged in “trophy hunting” when it came to their pursuits of women.

The Times report also found that Epstein and Maxwell over the years “introduced at least six women who have accused them of grooming or abuse to Mr. Trump,” including one who was a minor at the time.

The report emphasized, however, that “none have accused Mr. Trump himself of inappropriate behavior.”

The suit targets a federal permit for Enbridge's Line 5, which the tribe says puts treaty-protected resources at risk.

As we produce journalism that combats authoritarianism, censorship, injustice, and misinformation, your support is urgently needed. Please make a year-end gift to Truthout today.

Around August of each year, when temperatures swell in the Great Lakes region, wild rice — or manoomin in the Ojibwe language — begins to flower. Rice stalks can grow as high as 10 feet in the shallow waters, and to harvest, sticks and poles are used to knock seeds loose into boats or canoes. The harvest is critical each year to the Ojibwe.

But those ricing waters are under threat as the Canadian oil transport company Enbridge looks to reroute its controversial pipeline, Line 5, through prime harvesting areas. Now, the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, one of six Ojibwe bands in northern Wisconsin, has filed a lawsuit against the United States Army Corps of Engineers, or USACE, to stop construction.

“For hundreds of years, and to this day, the Band's ancestors and members have lived, hunted, fished, trapped, gathered, and engaged in traditional activities in the wetlands and waters to be crossed by the project,” the lawsuit says.

In October, USACE granted Enbridge a permit to build a 41-mile addition to Line 5 in order to circumvent the Bad River reservation, but Earthjustice, a nonprofit litigation organization representing the tribe, argues the permit failed to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act and the Clean Water Act. Earthjustice says the pipeline will cross waterways that flow onto the Bad River Reservation and leaks would threaten the watershed and ecosystem, needed for wild rice harvesting and fishing. After the largest inland oil spill from Enbridge's pipelines in the U.S. in 2010 — flooding more than a million gallons into the Kalamazoo River in Michigan — the largest spill in Wisconsin's history happened last year. The company reported around 69,000 gallons of oil spilled onto the ground near a rural town in the south of the state. Initially, the spill was reported as two gallons; it was a month before the public officially knew the spill's size. 

Line 5 has operated for more than 70 years and has become a major legal battle for multiple tribal nations in the Great Lakes region. During the 1950s, for the Lakehead Pipeline, the company fitted 12 miles of pipeline across the 124,655-acre reservation to transport oil from western Canada to eastern Canada. Despite the treaty of 1854 that established permanent reservation territory and the treaty of 1842, cementing the right to hunt, gather, and fish, the company did not initiate talks with the tribe on pipeline siting. 

In 2019, the Bad River Band sued Enbridge to cease operations on their land, ordering the company to remove its pipeline from the reservation. In 2023, a federal judge backed the nation, ruling that the company had three years to remove its property from the reservation and pay a $5.1 million fine for trespassing. The tribe said the proposed 41-mile addition would impact at least 70 different waterways as Enbridge will need to use explosives and horizontal drilling to build the extension.

“Oil and gas contribute to pollution in a number of ways, and the Trump administration is focused on energy dominance,” said Gussie Lord, a member of the Oneida Nation and an attorney at Earthjustice. “It's cut out renewable energy from the equation to the extent it can, and it just really feels like a backward-looking playbook to me.” 

Last year, under the Biden administration, the USACE conducted an environmental assessment on the proposed route rather than an environmental impact study. Environmental assessments allow for faster review, while environmental impact studies are more thorough and require more time and resources to evaluate a project's impact. They also allow for consultation with tribal nations to determine if a project violates treaty rights, cultural resources, or access to clean water.

In neighboring Michigan, Enbridge is also up against tribal nations and state officials in order to operate a nearly 5-mile pipeline segment under the Great Lakes to replace a 72-year-old section of Line 5. This month, a federal judge blocked Michigan from enforcing an order to shut the pipeline down, ruling that pipeline safety is a matter of federal responsibility, not states. In March, the Army Corps fast-tracked a permit for the segment under the Trump administration's energy emergency declaration, allowing the agency to bypass regulatory laws, like the National Environmental Policy Act. Shortly after, seven tribal nations withdrew from discussions, citing the federal government's failure to engage with tribal governments.

Currently, the initial permit hasn't been signed or finalized by the USACE. “Until the permit is signed, USACE has not engaged in a judicially reviewable final agency action,” a spokesperson for Enbridge said. “Enbridge will move to intervene in the lawsuit and defend the USACE's forthcoming permit decision.” In Wisconsin, the Bad River Band has also initiated litigation against the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources over its state permitting of Enbridge in August. 

Gussie Lord of Earthjustice said litigation is going to be an uphill battle, but adds that the Bad River Band believes it's their responsibility to protect the area's watershed and environment.

“We need people who are going to be thinking about what makes sense, for the future, not just 10 years from now, but 50 years, 100 years from now,” Lord said.

Before Friedrich Merz won Germany's parliamentary elections in February of this year, the country faced a money dilemma: Germany's economic stagnation required significant reform and investment to revitalize industry, and the United States demanded more spending on collective defense. The budgetary dispute over how to simultaneously address these conflicting priorities had led to the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government. To avoid the same fate, lawmakers in Merz's grand coalition, comprising the center-right Christian Democratic Union and the center-left Social Democratic Party, as well as the Greens, agreed to leverage debt to finance its dual obligations. Suddenly, Germany was flush with money. 

Seven months in, however, Merz's government has still been unable to chart a course for economic reform and persuade voters that better days lie ahead. Merz's bold moves on defense spending have confirmed Germany's leadership role in Europe but at a cost to his domestic popularity. Merz's expenditure of significant political capital at international summits to manage U.S. President Donald Trump and defend Ukraine has left him vulnerable to accusations that he is focusing too much on foreign policy and not enough on domestic issues. The right-wing, Russia-friendly Alternative for Germany party (AfD) is channeling economic anxiety to profit in the polls, criticizing Merz's government for squandering German wealth to build a “war economy.” And although Merz's efforts on defense have won him praise from the White House, the Trump administration is steadily undermining him by normalizing the AfD and—in the words of the newly released National Security Strategy—other “patriotic European parties.”

Merz's government does not have much time to hedge against growing discontent within the electorate. Failing to pursue reforms to revitalize and grow Germany's economy could jeopardize public support for Merz's centrist coalition. If the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats cede more ground to the AfD, they may also lose their ability to build viable future coalitions. If the grand coalition proves unable to pursue a path of economic reform and growth, it could break up the government prematurely and reverse Germany's long-awaited leadership role in Europe, to the detriment of U.S. interests.

Angela Merkel, Germany's former leader and Merz's chief rival, became chancellor in 2005 by sidelining Merz and other candidates. She then managed to stay in power for 16 years by avoiding potentially disruptive reforms. This is not a formula that Merz can afford to follow.

Merz entered office with a mandate to build up Germany's defense capabilities and improve its economy. To avoid the guns-versus-butter debate haunting many European governments, Merz bucked his party's traditional preference for fiscal discipline and pushed the parliament to loosen Germany's debt brake. Established in 2009, the brake caps deficit spending at 0.35 percent of GDP. Soon after this year's federal election, the German parliament amended the debt brake to allow for unlimited deficit spending on defense and avoid significant cuts in areas such as social welfare. Merz also agreed to earmark an unprecedented 500 billion euros to invest in Germany's crumbling infrastructure.

At the same time, Berlin has sought to fulfill the country's obligations to European security. During the NATO summit at The Hague in June, Germany pledged to increase spending on defense to five percent by 2035, with 3.5 percent of that covering core defense requirements. Merz has taken advantage of a degree of fiscal flexibility that Germany's European peers cannot match: France, for example, is already heavily indebted, whereas the debt brake has afforded Germany a more balanced budget and therefore more room to maneuver. Under pressure, too, from Trump, Merz has already announced a massive increase in Germany's military spending; the country is projected to meet its NATO pledge well ahead of schedule. Germany's defense budget—projected at 650 billion euros in total over the next five years—is now the largest in the European Union. Approximately 8.5 billion euros per year is earmarked for support for Ukraine.

Merz also helped secure the sale of U.S. weapons to Ukraine after the Trump administration formally ended its military assistance. He worked out a deal with the American president whereby Berlin and other European countries would purchase Patriot missile systems from Washington and send them to Kyiv. In July, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte praised Germany's leadership and resolve to ensure Europe's shared security.

Such high marks, however, remain elusive at home. Before entering the chancellery, Merz knew that the efforts he had to make to address security demands and domestic economic challenges could conflict and risked prompting a populist backlash to his agenda. A majority of Germans support increased military spending financed through debt. But many would also like to see the government make debt-financed investments in other priorities, such as industry, pensions, and education.

Germany's industrial growth has been stagnating since 2019. The German Council of Economic Experts has estimated that the country's economy will grow by a dismal 0.2 percent in 2025 and 0.6 percent in 2026. Europe's economic powerhouse is clearly underperforming in comparison with its G-7 peers. Germany's export-oriented market has also suffered from an influx of inexpensive, state-subsidized high-tech goods from China, which threatens the German auto industry and its millions of jobs. A lack of domestic investment since the adoption of the debt brake in 2009, coupled with Washington's new tariff regime and Chinese overcapacity, has rendered Germany's economic model defunct.

Now, with the reform of the debt brake, Merz's grand coalition has access to sufficient budgetary resources to both increase defense spending and make economic reforms—a position previous governments have not enjoyed. Historically, Germans have opposed deficit spending. Merz's government is therefore pressed to better justify this change in policy and put its unprecedented additional funds to good use instead of wasting them. Merz is trying to implement an economic reform plan he calls “Agenda 2030,” which includes tax cuts and deregulation as well as some reductions in social welfare benefits. This plan alone, however, has thus far proved inadequate for the scale of Germany's economic problems. It addresses problems with traditional economic instruments instead of focusing on China's challenge to German and European industry. In addition, infighting within the coalition over how to spend the 500 billion euro infrastructure fund has raised concerns that coalition members will use deficit spending as a Band-Aid on legacy problems and as a way to service their voter bases rather than create economic opportunities.



Failure to deliver has helped the opposition AfD thrive. In 2021, during Merz's campaign for party leader, he vowed to cut the AfD's support in half. Today, the AfD enjoys record-high support: a December Forsa Institute poll that asked Germans which party they would vote for showed the AfD above Merz's conservative camp. Although Germany's far right supports more defense spending in principle, it opposes financing it through debt and has attacked Merz's government for relaxing the debt brake. The AfD's views on defense spending are deeply rooted in a nationalistic conception of German military power outside of constraining institutions such as the EU and NATO.

Putting money on the table for defense has helped Merz manage his relationship with Trump, but members of the U.S. MAGA movement, such as Vice President JD Vance and Representative Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican from Florida, have found common cause with the AfD and are encouraging closer cooperation. This poses a real threat to Merz, who prides himself as a transatlanticist and is trying to keep the postwar German conservative movement's center of gravity intact against the extremist AfD. Trump's new National Security Strategy, which officially embraces nationalist conservative parties and even seeks to instigate political change in European countries such as Germany, is a further blow to Merz's efforts.

In the 1980s, Franz Josef Strauss, the legendary chair of the Christian Social Union (the Christian Democrats' sister party in Bavaria), warned that far-right parties must not be permitted to become the flank of mainstream conservatism. The Christian Social Union should serve as the movement's outer band. Germany's political spectrum has since changed, and the AfD is firmly in place as a particularly radical far-right party in Europe. This past May, Germany's Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution deemed the party extremist. And yet it has become the most successful far-right party in Germany's history since World War II.

Merz faces a predicament. The dangers of U.S. retrenchment and Russian aggression require increased defense spending and international shuttle diplomacy. The chancellor understands the stakes, and he has tried to make the case that foreign policy and domestic prosperity are interlinked. But as Helmut Kohl, Germany's chancellor during German reunification, experienced, foreign policy prowess does not guarantee electoral success.

After his first hundred days in office, Merz had become even more unpopular than his predecessor Scholz, who was the first German chancellor in decades to serve a single term. According to a Forsa poll from early December, 76 percent of Germans are dissatisfied with Merz's performance as chancellor.

Merz may also become the victim of an internal power struggle. Many conservatives are grumbling about dismantling the debt brake. A younger cohort desires reform of the pension system, which the Social Democrats oppose. Moreover, some in Merz's caucus are not wedded to sustaining the firewall against the AfD and envision cooperation with the far-right party, an idea Merz absolutely rejects.

Despite the conflicting priorities of the center right and the center left, Merz's coalition is managing to hold together because another snap federal election could bring the AfD closer to power. Even without a snap vote, however, the grand coalition will face a test in German state elections next year. The AfD enjoys solid support across the country and is polling ahead by double digits in some former East German states. If the AfD wins big in the next federal election, centrist coalition building will become even more difficult. Merz's tenure as well as Germany's leadership role in Europe could be short-lived.

Undertaking challenging reforms is nothing new for Germany, and it has generally made the country stronger. Forging East and West Germany into one country after the fall of the Berlin Wall brought economic hardship and fostered resentment among former East Germans, who felt like second-class citizens. Anti-immigrant sentiment dogged Germany in the 1990s, requiring policies for integration. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's Agenda 2010 tackled loosening the country's tight labor market and paved a path of economic reform.

Merz must now deliver on his promise for renewal with his Agenda 2030. With more than a trillion euros committed to defense and infrastructure projects over the next four years, Merz has the fiscal means to reboot Germany's economy and maintain its political center. Germany's export-led economic model needs to be refashioned to stimulate domestic demand in Germany and Europe. More investments must be made in the defense industrial base to create jobs to replace the ones that Germany's traditional manufacturers are currently losing because of Chinese exports. The true scope of the Chinese economic threat is only now becoming clear to German leaders.



Germany is pro–free trade by default, but it must better coordinate its industrial policy with the rest of the EU to help insulate against the worst effects of U.S. tariffs and Chinese overcapacity by seeking new trading partners and building competitive European producers. And with moribund growth and an aging population, Berlin cannot afford to prop up the country's current levels of social spending. For Germany to remain economically competitive, it must raise its retirement age to alleviate budgetary pressures. Investment in innovation and future technologies cannot be given short shrift compared with social spending.

Such reforms will not magically make the AfD disappear. In fact, they might make the party stronger in the short term. Like other established Western democracies, Germany now has a far-right party embedded in its political system, chipping away at the mainstream parties. But Merz and his coalition can diminish the AfD's legitimacy by showing voters that providing for European security and investing in Germany's defense will also trigger a new era of economic growth and competitiveness. To handle the transatlantic relationship with Trump, deter Russian aggression, address economic pressure from China, and ease worries at home, Germany needs Merz's centrism, not the AfD's extremism.

 Persistent Limited Conflict Is More Likely Than Peace

 Daniel Byman

Gaza has reached a new equilibrium. Unsurprisingly, it is an ugly one. The good news is that the intense fighting is over and humanitarian relief is steadily entering the strip. Since the cease-fire began on October 10, Israel has released almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, and Hamas has returned all living hostages as well as most of the bodies of those killed, in keeping with the Trump administration's 20-point peace plan. Israel has reopened the Kerem Shalom, Kissufim, and Zikim border crossings and promised to allow 600 trucks per day into Gaza, carrying both aid and commercial goods for sale, which it has begun. The Israel Defense Forces has also withdrawn to a “yellow line” that limits its presence to around 53 percent of the strip, although several of the specific boundaries are disputed.

Plans for a more extensive resolution, however, are stalled, and the relations between Hamas and Israel today are characterized by limited but persistent conflict, not progress toward peace. Israel's policies, Hamas's refusal to lose more power, and the Trump administration's poor attention span are likely to foil the peace proposal's more ambitious plans for Gaza's rehabilitation. Fundamentally, further progress depends on the creation of an International Stabilization Force to police Gaza, disarm Hamas, and eventually train a new, vetted, non-Hamas Palestinian police force that would assume control over Gaza. The IDF would then withdraw to 40 percent of the strip and eventually to 15 percent, as local security conditions improved. At the same time, a technocratic and apolitical Palestinian government would emerge to govern Gaza, reporting to what U.S. President Donald Trump has called a “Board of Peace,” which would be officially headed by Trump and run on a day-to-day basis by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. The Palestinian Authority, which governs the West Bank, is supposed to undertake major reforms while preparing to eventually take on a major role in governing the strip.

The United States is making some efforts to move the ball forward. The U.S. military has created a Civil-Military Coordination Center in Israel to monitor the cease-fire and disbursement of humanitarian aid into Gaza. Senior U.S. officials, including Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and senior adviser (and Trump's son-in-law) Jared Kushner, have visited Israel in recent weeks to demonstrate the U.S. commitment to the cease-fire agreement. But the vagueness surrounding statements and plans for important next steps to improve security; the Trump administration's reluctance to take a bigger, more direct role in Gaza's reconstruction; and the hesitation from potential partners to offer greater support to such efforts all make it less likely that the more aspirational parts of the Trump plan—namely, disarming Hamas and creating a new Palestinian government in Gaza—will be implemented soon, if ever.

Meanwhile, violence persists, leading to the deaths of a number of IDF soldiers and an even larger number of Palestinians, both fighters and civilians. Reports of cease-fire violations are difficult to verify, but the Government Media Office in Gaza, which Hamas controls, claims that Israel has violated the cease-fire agreement at least 282 times; the IDF, for its part, claims that Hamas has violated the agreement 24 times. As this limited fighting continues, 90 percent of the population in Gaza remains displaced, with 1.5 million people needing emergency shelter assistance. Despite Israel's promise to allow 600 trucks of aid per day to enter Gaza, the United Nations has reported that the daily figure has averaged less than 120. Heavy rainfall and cold weather have added to Gazans' misery.

This status quo—marked by improvised policies, hasty U.S. efforts to put out fires, and ongoing civilian suffering—may seem unstable. Yet something like the current situation may represent Gaza's future: limited but persistent violence and mini crises rather than progress toward development, peace, and greater stability.

Establishing a long-term stabilization force is one of the most vital tasks for progress toward peace, but it will also be one of the most difficult. For Israel, such a force is necessary to stop Hamas from returning to power and to oversee the group's disarmament. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for his part, has assured his cabinet that Israel will hold veto power over which countries are part of the force.

The United States, although it has championed the idea of a stabilization force, has declined to participate. So have other U.S. partners, despite their often supportive rhetoric. Even sympathetic Arab and Muslim states have hesitated, recognizing that on the ground, such a force would suppress Palestinians on behalf of Israel—political poison for their governments, especially if there is no clear path to a Palestinian state that might justify their cooperation with Israel in the short term. Still others seek a UN mandate for the overall effort, which would be difficult to achieve given China and Russia's opposition, which they are employing to showcase support for Palestinian sovereignty and hostility to U.S. influence in the Middle East. Even if boots could be put on the ground, counterinsurgency is difficult, particularly in an urban environment, and requires aggressive rules of engagement, skilled forces, and a willingness to take casualties—a rare combination in the best of circumstances.



Demilitarizing Gaza and disarming Hamas are similarly challenging tasks. The Trump plan calls for ensuring that Hamas's weapons are “permanently beyond use” and that, in general, all “military, terror, and offensive infrastructure” is destroyed. Considering how firmly Hamas has resisted disarmament in the past, it is likely to continue to do so in practice, despite its hypothetical acquiescence to the 20-point plan. Ideologically, Hamas sees itself as a resistance organization, and a resistance group without weapons is not credible. More practically, Hamas's military power preserves its control of Gaza, allowing it to suppress its rivals and protecting it from revenge attacks by its many enemies. Shortly after the cease-fire began, for example, Hamas attacked members of the powerful Doghmush clan—a large family centered primarily in Gaza City that has fought against Hamas and, according to various media outlets, worked with Israel to do so—to ensure that the clan, and other Gazans, knew that Hamas was still in charge.

Outside states are also not eager to reconstruct Gaza. The Trump administration has promoted ambitious visions of what a future Gaza would look like, proposing as one of its 20 points an “economic development plan to rebuild and energize Gaza . . . by convening a panel of experts who have helped birth some of the thriving modern miracle cities in the Middle East.” Trump put the onus on “Muslim and Arab nations” to finance the rebuilding of Gaza—which will require an estimated $70 billion. But so far, there has been far more rhetoric than dollars in support of this end. Continued fighting, even if low level, will frighten away investment and reconstruction funds.

Perhaps the biggest difficulty is the unsolved question of who will govern Gaza in the long term. Language about “technocrats” or a “reformed” Palestinian Authority masks the reality that there is currently no obvious or even plausible alternative to Hamas rule or direct Israeli military occupation, the two realities in Gaza today. Hamas has already begun repairing its damaged reputation among Gazans simply by being the only credible force that can provide basic law and order. And to avoid being bypassed by Israel or shot at by Hamas, any future government will need to be acceptable to both, a feat currently hard to fathom. Without such a government and competent security force in place, Israel will continue to feel the need to strike Gaza to prevent Hamas from rebuilding.

Israel does not seek a return to full-scale fighting. As the war dragged on, Israel's military operations suffered diminishing returns, a problem compounded by the accumulating damage to its international reputation. The costs to Israeli society also grew as the war disrupted the country's economy and imposed an unequal burden on families, given the exemptions from conscription that ultra-Orthodox and Israeli Arab communities historically enjoyed. Now, renewed fighting would risk angering Trump, if he blamed Israel for the collapse of one of his signature achievements. Most Israelis have thus welcomed the cease-fire.

But Israelis remain unwilling to accept Hamas leadership in Gaza, both out of a fear that the events of October 7, 2023, will be repeated and a broader anger at the militant group for the devastation and humiliation the attack wrought on Israel. Right-wing Israeli leaders oppose any deal that benefits the Palestinians in general, believing that Palestinians should not “win” in any way because of October 7. And Israelis are broadly suspicious of the Palestinian Authority. At an operational level, this means Israel would be hesitant to pass off security to an International Stabilization Force, let alone Palestinian forces, unless it were fully confident that the force would suppress Hamas—a confidence that may never come. Although these Israeli attitudes may not prompt the resumption of outright war, they are likely to lead to regular Israeli strikes on Gaza in the future. If Hamas openly consolidates power in parts of Gaza, it is plausible that Israel would try to kill the Hamas leaders who emerged, to ensure the group remained on its back foot.

Hamas, like Israel, does not want a return to full-scale fighting, but it, too, has strong incentives to carry out limited acts of violence. The brutal war following October 7 left much of Hamas's leadership dead and its command and control weakened. Hamas's particular excuses for the recent attacks on the IDF may be plausible, as local commanders may at times strike on their own. But the organization will almost certainly continue to use violence to put down those that defy its rule and may at times attack Israeli forces, either out of a desire for revenge or to send a message to its supporters that it remains strong enough to resist Israel.

When the time comes to implement the aspects of the Trump plan that would greatly weaken Hamas's power and destroy it as a political actor, Hamas is also likely to violently resist, both for ideological reasons, given that it still seeks to control Gaza and the Palestinian national movement, and out of fear that rival Palestinians would take revenge if Hamas could not defend itself. Hamas attacks on the IDF and the inevitable massive Israeli response would, in turn, discredit any technocratic or Palestinian Authority government, revealing its inability to protect Gazans and making it more likely that such a government would be seen as a collaborator. This would be a political win for Hamas even if its leaders, and Gazans in general, suffered from the Israeli retaliation.

Today, Israeli forces vigilantly patrol the yellow line laid out by the cease-fire, shooting at Gazans who try to cross it—killing dozens—and building physical barriers with concrete blocks to mark it. It is easy to see how such a temporary line could become semipermanent. Amid this reality, some U.S. efforts to promote reconstruction have already been dashed. In November, for example, the United States tried to create “Alternative Safe Communities” where Israeli-vetted Palestinians could live on the Israeli side of the separation line in Gaza. But this proposal stalled almost immediately in the face of difficult questions about whether Palestinians in these communities could cross freely between parts of the strip respectively controlled by Israel and Hamas. The effort, which remains in limbo, is a warning that even seemingly benign proposals have political consequences that one or both sides might oppose.

Over time, international attention to Gaza will fade, particularly if limited violence does not become massive and if the humanitarian situation is miserable rather than catastrophic. As scrutiny recedes, pressure on both sides to make painful concessions will diminish, and Israel will face lower potential diplomatic costs for military strikes.

As the parade of senior U.S. visitors suggests, the Trump administration is proud of its role in creating a cease-fire and would like to make Gaza a success story. Doing so, however, would require constant pressure and patient diplomacy, neither of which are hallmarks of Trump foreign policy. It would also involve Washington deploying U.S. troops as part of a stabilization force or cajoling capable allies into participating. Trump himself would have to press Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders to withdraw from parts of Gaza, despite the uncertain security situation, and coordinate continued pressure from Arab and Muslim partners on Hamas. Without the headlines generated by war and starvation in Gaza, the administration is unlikely to sustain its efforts. And without such near-constant efforts by the United States, Israel and Hamas are likely to settle into an uneasy relationship that avoids all-out war but is nevertheless characterized by constant conflict, a lack of reconstruction in Gaza, and little or no political progress toward lasting peace.

            When jobs or inflation data counter President Donald Trump's preferred economic narrative, he typically offers alternative statistics to shine a more positive light on the economy. But Trump's latest effort asks Americans to buy into some puzzling logic.
    


            After America's unemployment rate hit a four-year high of 4.6% in November, Trump made the argument that the job market is far better than it appears. His reasoning: He could quickly put millions of Americans to back to work – but won't.
    


            “Now, if I want to make some good numbers, I'll add 300,000 jobs. I can do it with one phone call,” Trump said at a campaign-style rally in North Carolina Friday.
    


            He said, if he wanted to, he could force government agencies to add jobs that they lost this year through a combination of resignations, attrition and staffing reductions led by the Department of Government Efficiency.
    


            “They'll hire them immediately. They'll pour in. And the 4.5% would be down to 2.5% in a matter of moments. I could get it down to zero – hire a couple of million workers,” Trump said. “But that's the destruction of a country.”
    


            Trump's argument contains numerous factual errors. That's no surprise, considering he has been second guessing jobs statistics for a decade – from when he falsely stated during the 2016 presidential campaign that the jobless rate was 42%, to when he fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner this summer over revisions that showed the labor market was worse off than previously expected.
    


            But the most significant problem with Trump's message is he once again is asking people to ignore their lived experiences of a weakening job market – and believe in an alternative portrait of America's economy that doesn't match reality.
    


            Trump got a number of the facts wrong in his recent unemployment rate denial – the least of which is that the unemployment rate stands at 4.6%, according to the BLS, not 4.5%, as he stated.
    


            Trump said he could get the unemployment rate down to 2.5% by rehiring all 271,000 workers eliminated from US government payrolls this year. But Trump was off by a factor of 13 – federal agencies would need to employ 3.5 million more people to accomplish that. (Only 2.7 million people currently work for the US government, and the the federal government has never employed more than 3.5 million people.)
    


            Rehiring for all the 271,000 lost federal worker positions would take the unemployment rate down to just 4.4%.
    


            To get the unemployment rate down to “zero,” it would take more than the couple of million government employees that Trump suggested: Federal agencies would need to add 7.8 million positions. Zero unemployment has never come close to happening – the lowest US unemployment rate ever recorded was 2.5%, last achieved in June 1953.
    


            The reason the unemployment rate has risen to 4.6% from 4% when Trump took office is because there were 982,000 more unemployed people in November than in January. Government work is responsible for just a fraction of that.
    


            So Trump's math is seriously fuzzy – but so is his underlying message that the US job market is significantly stronger than the unemployment rate suggests.
    


            The US economy has lost jobs in three of the past six months, and 2025 is on pace to post the worst job growth since 2020.
    


            The lived experience of most people in the labor force also shows the job market is stuck: People who don't have work are increasingly complaining that they can't get a job, and folks who have a job are cleaving to them tightly.
    


            The era of quiet quitting is over. Quitting, in general, has been out of vogue this year, as people stay in their jobs for longer: The rate of workers who voluntarily quit their jobs fell to a five-year low in October.
    


            Exacerbating America's stuck job market is a mismatch between the industries that are hiring and people who are unemployed. For example, jobs are growing in the health care industry, but an increasing number of workers in the leisure, transportation and manufacturing sectors are out of a job.
    


            In other words: Who cares if there are nursing jobs if you're trained as a factory or hotel worker?
    


            The jobs situation is worse for lower-income workers than high-income employees, and Black unemployment is starting to surge – it rose above 8% in November for the first time in four years.
    


            By denying the economic reality that people are experiencing in their everyday lives, Trump is muddying his economic message and making the same political mistake that haunted his predecessor, former President Joe Biden and contributed to the Democrats losing the White House in 2024.
    


            Trump has had a decade-long struggle with the truth about the unemployment rate and other jobs data.
    


            As the unemployment rate was falling below 5% during his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump falsely stated, “The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42%.”
    


            But in March 2017, after the first full jobs report of Trump's presidency was released, the unemployment rate fell to 4.7% from 4.8%. So Trump then claimed that the supposedly “fake” numbers of the past were now “real.”
    


            “I talked to the president prior to this and he said to quote him very clearly: ‘They may have been phony in the past, but it's very real now,'” said Sean Spicer, the former press secretary, on March 10, 2017.
    


            In August 2024, during his most recent presidential campaign, Trump complained about a preliminary annual revision to Biden's jobs numbers that showed the US economy had added 818,000 fewer jobs over the previous year than earlier reported. Trump in a Truth Social post incorrectly called that revision a “record” – a 902,000-job revision in 2009 was larger. And the final 2024 revision, issued in February, showed that the 2024 data was overestimated by only 589,000 jobs.
    


Former BLS commissioner says firing her was a ‘dangerous' step for the US economy



            In August of this year, Trump fired then-BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, whom he accused, without evidence, of manipulating the monthly jobs reports for “political purposes.” In that month's report, the BLS revised down the previously reported gains for May and June by a combined 258,000 jobs.
    


            Those revisions, though historically large, were not unprecedented. Weaker-than-expected hiring, sampling errors and low survey responses can make the jobs report more challenging to estimate. But the BLS continues to collect the payroll data as it's reported, and it revises the data accordingly.
    


            Calling into question the validity of official data could undermine the government's important role in helping businesses make informed decisions about hiring. It's also a dubious political tactic – Trump's claims that the US job market is better than it really is could sow doubts about his own credibility, particularly on the economy, which is one of his most vulnerable issues with voters in the midterm elections.

            President Donald Trump's announcement of a new class of battleships bearing his name puts a fresh spotlight on a US naval shipbuilding program that has fallen short on delivering the new warships on time and on budget in recent years, something Trump himself pointed out in his speech from Mar-a-Lago on Monday.
    


            “We make the greatest equipment in the world, by far, nobody's even close. But we don't produce them fast enough,” Trump said, as he announced he would meet soon with top US military contractors to ramp up production for the new battleships and other weapons programs.
    


            But at least in the battleship plan, the Navy would seem to be swimming upstream, with construction of the vessels themselves and some of the weapon systems the service says would be aboard.
    


            Here's what to consider about the proposed “Trump-class” battleships:
    


            A US Navy fact sheet released Monday says the Trump class will be “the most lethal warship to ever be built.”
    


            With a length of up to 880 feet and a displacement of 30,000 to 40,000 tons, they'll also be the biggest surface combatants the US Navy has constructed since World War II.
    


            Those battleships, like the renowned USS Missouri, which hosted the Japanese surrender in 1945, were 887 feet long and displaced around 58,000 tons.
    


            The biggest surface combatants in the US Navy fleet now are the Zumwalt destroyers, which displace 15,000 tons.
    


            As envisioned, the ships will have “the most destructive fire power of any surface ship to ever sail – having the ability to strike an adversary at 80x the range of the previous class,” the Navy's new website on the ships says.
    


            The battleships will be armed with new nuclear-capable cruise missiles to be launched from 12 cells on board. The missiles would be hypersonic – more than five times the speed of sound – and maneuverable to confuse enemy defenses.
    


            The Trump class would also feature 128 vertical launch cells that can be used for slower-flying Tomahawk cruise missiles, anti-ship missiles, or missile defense interceptors.
    


            Other armaments would include a rail gun, five-inch conventional guns, and a range of lasers and smaller guns.
    


            Overall the planned ships would be 100 times more powerful than those World War II-era battleships, Trump said.
    


            The administration has given no timeframe for how long it will take for the design phase – which the president said he will personally be involved in – or the building of the first two ships.
    


            The new battleships project would be led by a naval shipbuilding base that has struggled to deliver in recent years and which Navy Secretary John Phelan said this year was in disarray.



            “All of our programs are a mess,” he told a US House hearing in June. “I think our best (ship build) is six months late and 57% over budget … That is the best one.”
    


            Then last month Phelan axed the Constellation-class frigate program, which was about three years behind schedule and was expected to yield much smaller and less complex warships than the new battleships Trump now proposes.
    


            As far as large complex ships go, the Navy's newest aircraft carrier, the USS John F Kennedy, has slipped about two years behind its scheduled delivery date, which was July of this year. Those delays have been attributed to new landing and weapons elevator systems which the service is still trying to get certified.
    


            Then there's the question of who will build these new battleships. US shipyards are already stretched thin with current construction, maintenance and overhaul jobs.
    


            “We no longer have the shipbuilding and maritime industrial infrastructure to do this quickly,” said analyst Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain.
    


            Ships the size of the Trump-class would need the same dockyard space as large amphibious and logistical support ships the Navy also needs, so closed shipyards would need to be reactivated or new ones built, Schuster said.
    


            And then there's the workforce.
    


            “A national scale recruitment and training program for shipyard, electrical, information and sensor system workers (would be) required to support this program,” Schuster said.
    


Can South Korean shipyards help ‘Make American Shipbuilding Great Again'?



            Navy Secretary Phelan just recently pointed out the difficulties in recruiting a workforce, especially when it comes to pay.
    


            If workers can make the same money working in an Amazon warehouse or a convenience store, they're less likely to choose the he arduous, backbreaking jobs found in a naval shipyard, he told a defense conference in Indiana last month.
    


            Alessio Patalano, professor of war and strategy at King's College London, said Washington has the technical know-how to make these ships, but it must overcome the shipyard problem.
    


            “The question is … whether the US has a sufficient shipyard capacity and workforce to translate a visual gold fleet into a real sailing one,” he said.
    


            Lastly, cost has to be a consideration.
    


            Trump said Monday the new battleships ships would eventually replace the Navy's Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, the backbone of the US surface fleet.
    


            Those destroyers cost about $2 billion each. A Trump-class ship would have a price tag as high as $15 billion, according to a Monday report from USNI News.
    


            Schuster noted the Navy's sketchy record on seeing ambitious shipbuilding programs followed through to completion.
    


            Take the aforementioned Zumwalt-class destroyers, a program that began in the 1990s. A plan for 32 of the high-tech, stealthy ships, was eventually cut to three, with the last of the class, the USS Lyndon B. Johnson, still awaiting commissioning –– now not expected until 2027.
    


            Or the Constellation-class frigates, which were cut to a maximum two hulls from a planned 20.
    


            And, as Schuster points out, recent shipbuilding programs that have reached plan numbers have fallen well short of overall success, specifically the Littoral Combat Ships. That program, which has produced more than three dozen hulls, has seen some of them retired with as little as five years of service as they've been plagued by reliability issues and a lack of a well-defined mission.
    


US Navy chief defends plan to scrap troubled warships even though some are less than 3 years old



            At least one of the weapons planned for the Trump class – the rail gun – will need to be rescued from the scrap heap if it's to be used on the battleships.  The Navy cancelled its rail gun program in 2021, when technical challenges proved too difficult to overcome.
    


            Rail gun tech uses electromagnetic power to propel a hardened projectile at speeds far higher than current weapon systems - but it requires huge amounts of power and most programs around the world have made little progress so far towards a commercially viable, reliable weapon.
    


            Schuster says the Trump administration also needs to make some changes in management if it wants the Trump class to be successful.
    


            “This project will be managed by NAVSEA (Naval Sea Systems Command), an organization and staff that has screwed up every surface warship program of this century,” he said.
    


            “I believe Trump must clean house in that organization if he wants any shipbuilding program to succeed.”
    


            Patalano says there's a further problem within the Navy: crewing the new larger vessels, which the service expected to have 650 to 850 sailors aboard.
    


            “The US Navy is not known for being at the forefront of automation and innovative solutions in terms of more compact crew management.”
    


            Doing so “will require a cultural shift – in light of other new classes being built – of no trifling proportions,” Patalano said.
    


            Should the Navy be able to get a fleet of Trump-class battleships into the water, there's still a question of whether they'll be suitable for the missions at hand.
    


            That's a question being posed of the current jewels of the US fleet – its aircraft carriers. Can the massive ships – about 1,100 feet long, the length of three football fields – survive a conflict with a peer adversary like China?
    


            The Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) boasts the DF-26 intermediate range ballistic missile, nicknamed the “carrier killer” because it was designed to take out the US flattops at distances far from the Chinese mainland well before the US carriers' fighter jets could engage Chinese targets.
    


            Some analysts say Washington should be focusing on large numbers of small naval vessels, capable of carrying a few missiles or drones each, and dispersing them across a vast range of waterways, negating Beijing's advantage in missile numbers by presenting too many targets to handle.
    


            A 2023 Defense Department factsheet notes how Washington is making its forces in the Pacific “more mobile, distributed, resilient, and lethal” to deter adversaries and reassure allies.
    


            Like the carriers, large battleships could be putting too much firepower on one platform, critics say.
    


            “The advantages of small battleships and unmanned systems are that the quantity can be increased at a relatively low cost and viability can be increased by dispersing risk across multiple platforms,” said Yu Jihoon, a research fellow at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses and former South Korean submarine officer.
    


            And large ships aren't only vulnerable to missiles, some say. There's also a question of how they can deal with drones, cheap unmanned platforms in the air and on and below the sea, that Ukraine has shown during its war with Russia can at least disable if not sink surface ships and submarines alike.
    


            China displayed an array of undersea naval drones at a military parade in Beijing in September, watched by leader Xi Jinping, who was flanked by Russian leader Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Writing on the website Naval News this month, analyst H I Sutton said large Chinese drones could be used to lay mines that could choke off US naval ports around the Pacific. If the proposed US battleships can't get to sea, they're not going to be able to bring their offensive firepower into play.
    


In a first, Ukraine says it struck Russian submarine in Black Sea port with underwater drones



            That's a long list of challenges to the proposed Trump-class battleship program, but analysts say Washington should not be counted out.
    


            After all, as Trump said in his speech on Monday, this is the country that ramped up military production enough during World War II to turn out multiple ships in a single day.
    


            Schuster sees a more recent example, from the 1960s.
    


            “I think Trump is trying to achieve a maritime equivalent to JFK's call for a space program. Remember, the Soviets seemed to be ahead of us in space, a direct threat to our national security” before Washington launched the Apollo program that saw an American walk on the moon on July 20, 1969.
    


            But Schuster doesn't think the US can do it alone this time. Allies are needed, something difficult to manage when it comes to the laws governing current US naval shipbuilding.
    


US Navy shipbuilding is ‘a mess.' South Korean companies think they can help fix it



            “The PLAN is nearing the ability to challenge our access to the Western Pacific, a direct and clear threat to our national security. Since it also poses a threat to Japan and South Korea, enlisting their help to meet that challenge is a necessary solution to the problem,” Schuster said.
    


            That allied cooperation is in early stages, but seeds have been planted. Trump on Monday praised South Korea's Hanwha Ocean, which is investing billions into the Philly Shipyard, which could be building future US Navy ships.

            Chinese-made drones have dominated the skies in the United States for years, with private owners, police departments, and firefighters deploying them nationwide. But a new rule by the Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday will make it impossible for US consumers to buy the next generation of these drones.
    


            The FCC banned the import and sale of all new drone models and critical equipment made by foreign manufacturers, including the world's largest drone maker DJI, by adding them into a so-called “Covered List” of entities deemed to “pose an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States.”
    


            The FCC decision, while excluding models already approved for sale and those currently in use, marks a culmination of years-long efforts to clamp down on Chinese drones, such as those produced by DJI and another major drone maker Autel Robotics.
    


            DJI has expressed disappointment over the decision, which could also irk many drone users in the country. DJI alone commands about 70% of the global market, according to data from market research firm Research and Markets. Beyond public sector use, Chinese drones have been widely deployed across the US for tasks including infrastructure and construction inspections, crop monitoring, as well as professional and hobbyist videographers.
    


            In June, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to accelerate the commercialization of drone technologies and scale up domestic drone production “against foreign control or exploitation.”
    


            “President Trump has been clear that his Administration will act to secure our airspace and unleash American drone dominance,” said FCC Chair Brendan Carr on X Monday.
    


            “We do so through an action today that does not disrupt the ongoing use or purchase of previously authorized drones and with appropriate avenues for excluding drones that do not pose a risk,” he added.
    


            The import, sale or use of existing device models the telecom regulator previously authorized will continue to be allowed and consumers can continue to use any drones previously purchased legally, the FCC said.
    


            The announcement this week came after the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act passed by Congress last year mandated a security review of equipment produced by DJI, Autel and other foreign drone makers by December 23, 2025.
    


            Over the past year, DJI has written letters to American officials, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, welcoming scrutiny and the necessary examinations of its products.
    


            “We stand ready to work with you, to be open and transparent, and provide you with the necessary information to complete a thorough review,” wrote Adam Welsh, DJI's Head of Global Policy, in his latest letter earlier this month.
    


            But instead of a comprehensive examination the industry and DJI had expected, the FCC said its decision was based on a determination by a White House-convened executive branch interagency body that concluded foreign made drones and components “could enable persistent surveillance, data exfiltration, and destructive operations over US territory.”
    


            A DJI spokesperson told CNN Monday that the company is “disappointed” by FCC's action, saying that “no information has been released regarding what information was used by the Executive Branch in reaching its determination.”
    


            The spokesperson reiterated their commitment to the US market and product safety backed by independent reviewers.
    


            “Concerns about DJI's data security have not been grounded in evidence and instead reflect protectionism, contrary to the principles of an open market,” the person added.
    


            CNN has reached out to Autel for comment.
    


            Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, called the FCC listing “discriminatory” on Tuesday, adding that Beijing opposes Washington's overgeneralization of national security.
    


            “The US should correct its erroneous practices and provide a fair, just, and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese companies to operate,” he said.
    


            Multiple Chinese companies, including tech and telecom giant Huawei and state-owned telecom firm ZTE, have already been included in the FCC's Covered List for similar national security risks.
    


            Concerns about Chinese made drones and DJI are not new. As early as 2017, the US Army banned the use of DJI drones due to cybersecurity vulnerabilities. That same year, the Department of Homeland Security warned in an internal memo that Chinese-made drones might be sending sensitive flight data to their manufacturers in China.
    


            In 2020, DJI was placed on the Commerce Department's economic blacklist, or so called Entity List, for the company's alleged involvement in human‑rights abuses and high‑technology surveillance against China's Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang and other minorities. The following year, the US Treasury Department also placed investment restrictions on DJI for similar reasons.
    


            In 2022, the Department of Defense added DJI onto a list of firms allegedly working with China's People's Liberation Army. Although DJI has rejected the Pentagon's characterization and sued for its removal, it lost the court bid in September this year.

            The Trump administration is suing the local government of Washington, DC, over its gun laws, alleging that restrictions on certain semiautomatic weapons run afoul of Second Amendment rights.
    


            The US Department of Justice filed its lawsuit Monday in US District Court in the District of Columbia, naming Washington's Metropolitan Police Department and outgoing Chief of Police Pamela Smith as defendants and setting up another potentially seismic clash on how broadly the courts interpret individual gun possession rights.
    


            “The United States of America brings this lawsuit to protect the rights that have been guaranteed for 234 years and which the Supreme Court has explicitly reaffirmed several times over the last two decades,” the Justice Department states.
    


            It's the second such lawsuit the administration has filed this month: The Justice Department also is suing the US Virgin Islands, alleging the US territory is obstructing and systematically denying American citizens the right to possess and carry guns.
    


            It's also the latest clash between the District of Columbia and the federal government, which launched an ongoing law enforcement intervention into the nation's capital over the summer, which was meant to fight crime. The district's attorney general is challenging the deployment of the National Guard to the city as part of the intervention in court.
    


            In Washington, Metropolitan Police Department spokesman Sean Hickman said the agency does not comment on pending litigation.
    


            The Justice Department asserts that the District is imposing unconstitutional bans on AR-15s and other semiautomatic weapons the administration says are legal to posses under the Supreme Court's 2008 Heller precedent, which also originated from a dispute over weapons restrictions in the nation's capital.
    


Supreme Court takes case that could allow more guns in malls and restaurants



            In that seminal case, the court ruled that private citizens have an individual right to own and operate weapons “in common use today,” regardless of whether they are part of what Second Amendment text refers to as a “well regulated militia.”
    


            “There seems to us no doubt, on the basis of both text and history, that the Second Amendment conferred an individual right to keep and bear arms,” the majority reasoned. The justices added a caveat: “Of course, the right was not unlimited, just as the First Amendment's right of free speech was not.”
    


            The Justice Department argues that the District has gone too far in trying to limit weapons possession under that caveat. Administration lawyers emphasize the Heller reference to weapons “in common use today,” saying it applies to firearms that District of Columbia residents cannot now register. Those restrictions in turn subject residents to criminal penalties for unregistered firearms, the administration asserts.
    


            “Specifically, the District denies law-abiding citizens the ability to register a wide variety of commonly used semi-automatic firearms, such as the Colt AR-15 series rifles, which is among the most popular of firearms in America, and a variety of other semi-automatic rifles and pistols that are in common use,” Justice Department lawyers write.
    


            “DC's current semi-automatic firearms prohibition that bans many commonly used pistols, rifles or shotguns is based on little more than cosmetics, appearance, or the ability to attach accessories,” the suit continues, “and fails to take into account whether the prohibited weapon is ‘in common use today' or that law-abiding citizens may use these weapons for lawful purposes protected by the Second Amendment.”
    


            The Justice Department does not include any individual plaintiffs from Washington, DC, alleging any violations of their constitutional rights. That's different from the Heller case, which is named for Dick Heller, a Washingtonian who filed a civil lawsuit challenging the city's handgun ban in 2003.
    


            The administration argues in the suit that it has jurisdiction to challenge current District laws under the sweeping federal crime law of 1994.

            Just call it Trump America.
    


            Come the next presidential inauguration on January 20, 2029, there might not be much left that is not emblazoned with the brander in chief's name.
    


            The president on Monday announced a new generation of battleships bristling with new missiles, nuclear weapons and lasers. Inevitably, these will be “Trump Class” vessels, extending his spree of naming things after himself.
    


            Last week, Donald Trump's handpicked new board of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts voted to put his name up alongside that of the assassinated former president. Trump unconvincingly confessed he was “surprised” by an honor he'd been hinting he craved for weeks.
    


            Not long before that, the president showed up at the newly named Donald J. Trump Institute for Peace. He'd previously gutted the now-Potemkin agency — which the law said was independent and federally funded, and not his to destroy.
    


            Next year, people will be able to buy pharmaceuticals from TrumpRx. Parents will be able to open “Trump Accounts” for newborns. Rich foreigners can buy Trump Gold Card visas. The president is building a new ballroom at the White House. It would be a shock if it's not eponymous.
    


            The “Trump class” ships are projected to take their place in the “Golden Fleet” as a maritime complement to the “Golden Dome” anti-missile shield that Trump also envisages to protect the denizens of the new “Golden Age” he says the country is enjoying.
    


            The case for the new battleships is likely to spark great debate. Trump is correct that the US Navy has been falling behind China in its inventory of vessels and that the procurement process for new ships is notoriously expensive and slow. If he can improve that, he'll leave a worthy endowment for the US on the high seas.
    


            Still, some experts believe massive ships are a romanticized relic of the past best left in the epic 1950s documentary “Victory at Sea,” which immortalized US World War II maritime heroism and which Trump mentioned on Monday. In an age when Ukrainian drone boats devastated the Russian Black Sea fleet and of hypersonic weapons, the US might benefit from smaller, faster and more nimble ships. Trump's wish to be in on the design of his battleships because he's an “aesthetic person” also seems like an odd way to run a navy.
    


            But to be fair to the president, he doesn't just see the new fleet as a personal tribute, but as “unmistakable symbols of national power” and a source for many US manufacturing jobs.
    


            Presidential legacies take decades to play out. So it's too early to say whether the Trump class of ships will redefine naval warfare and establish him as a visionary, or whether they might turn out to be costly flops like some business ventures and casinos that bore Trump's name or short-lived billionaire's toys — like the Trump Shuttle airline or the Tour de Trump pro cycling race?
    


            Trump's announcement in his winter palace at Mar-a-Lago said so much about him. It brimmed with hyperbole and obligatory tributes from subordinates. And, by etching his name in history again, he highlighted his personality cult.
    


            “These are the best in the world. They'll be the fastest, the biggest and by far, 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built,” Trump said.
    


            Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, meanwhile, argued that the new vessels would leave future Americans in his boss's debt. “For decades, for centuries, the American people will look back and thank President Trump for having the vision and the willingness to invest right now in capabilities we need.”
    


            It's not normal for presidents to name things after themselves. They usually have the modesty to wait for history's judgment and for a grateful nation to honor their service. Aircraft carriers named after John F. Kennedy and Gerald R. Ford were laid down years after they died. President Joe Biden announced in January that future carriers would be named for presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.
    


            The Navy has a long history of honoring its own.
    


            The type of ships that the Trump class will presumably help replace, the Arleigh Burke class, were named for a courageous admiral who led packs of US destroyers in the Pacific war, revolutionizing naval tactics. The Navy also has a ship that memorializes the naval heritage of one of Trump's greatest political foes, John McCain. The ship was originally named for the late Arizona senator's father and grandfather, both admirals. But it was later rededicated to add him as a namesake.
    


            In 2019, CNN reported that the White House asked the Navy to make sure the USS John S. McCain was not visible during a visit by Trump to Japan in his first term. The request was deemed impractical by top Navy brass.
    


            The second Trump administration had previously been more about taking names off ships. Hegseth stripped a Navy oiler of the name Harvey Milk, which honored a gay rights activist, as part of his campaign to eradicate “woke garbage” and to restore the “warrior ethos” to the armed forces.
    


            A man known for Trump Tower, Trump hotels and Trump golf resorts worldwide may have offered a clue to his talent for immortalizing himself in stone — and ships — during a tour of George Washington's Mount Vernon in 2018.
    


            “If he was smart, he would've put his name on it,” Trump said of the estate, according to a report by Politico. “You've got to put your name on stuff or no one remembers you.” Mount Vernon president and CEO Doug Bradburn reportedly then told Trump that the first president managed to get his name on the nation's capital, prompting him to laugh and concede a good point.
    


            Trump isn't waiting for history to render judgment on his two terms. His first year back in the White House has showcased his desperation to dominate attention in the present and apparent terror he won't be remembered in future.
    


            Often, however, this comes across as immodesty and hints at insecurity in the most powerful man in the world. Foreign leaders long ago worked out that the best way to please Trump is to feed his need for exaggerated shows of respect — hence the stream of lavish state dinners; compliments; made-up awards like the FIFA Peace Prize; and gifts that flow in a torrent, like a multimillion-dollar jumbo jet from Qatar.
    


            Some of Trump's critics also argue that his obsession with altering the landscape with grand architectural projects to immortalize his own name hints is a worrying sign in one who disdains democracy and idolizes despots. They decry his overhaul of the White House — including his tearing up of the Rose Garden to build a Mar-a-Lago-style patio and his demolition of the East Wing for his ballroom.
    


            Trump's new presidential walk of fame between the White House and the mansion, which includes gold framed portraits of his predecessors and plaques filled with juvenile social-media style insults about their records, have raised questions about the 79-year-old president's state of mind.
    


            And Trump's penchant for having his name everywhere is often jarring. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, for example, strangely offered “congratulations” to Kennedy, who was murdered in 1963, for having his name joined by Trump's on the outside of the Washington, DC arts center.
    


            But the outrage Trump stirs among liberals and the media is a classic tactic to delight the supporters who love him.
    


            More seriously, Trump's attempts to make his name ubiquitous are a window into his questionable view that the presidency grants him unfettered powers to do anything that he wants.
    


            And it has long been obvious that Trump partly sees the presidency and its vast powers as a vehicle to promote himself — even when it means putting his own name on another man's memorial.
    


            His naming binge also comes with political risks at a time when millions of Americans are struggling to cope with high prices for groceries, housing and health care. Trump is making it easy for his critics to argue that he's most concerned with his personal priorities and not those of Americans. This may explain his eroding approval ratings and the plunging public confidence in his economic management.
    


            Ultimately, Trump's affixing of his name on a new class of battleships is just one of the thousands of extraordinary twists in two terms that shattered expectations for how a president should behave.
    


            He could spend the next three years putting his name everywhere. But it will be just as easy for the next Democratic president to erase it from buildings and ships.
    


            Fine presidential legacies are forged in deeds. Washington's greatest legacy was not that he gave his name to his new country's capital, but that he consciously refused to behave like a king.

            As authorities investigate the motives behind last week's deadly Bondi Beach attack, leading criminologists note an unusual characteristic differentiating this mass shooting from others: the suspected gunmen were family members working together.
    


Sajid Akram and his son Naveed Akram are accused of killing 15 people at the iconic Sydney shoreline, a crime that could be “the first father-son combination of perpetrators ever” for such an attack, according to Dr. James Densley, a criminology professor and an expert in mass shootings at Metro State University in Minnesota.
    


            Mass killings are typically the work of lone actors. Less than 2% of mass shootings studied involved two or more perpetrators, according to research from the Rockefeller Institute of Government –– an even rarer act of violence when accounting for family ties.
    


            “When relatives commit mass violence together, the risk factors look different,” Densley told CNN, noting contrasts in motivations, power dynamics and logistics from lone attackers.
    


            Relatives who commit crimes together tend to be “less performative,” with trust and proximity replacing online networks that are often used by lone actors.
    


            “These attacks grow out of a shared worldview that's cultivated over time, rather than a single individual seeking notoriety or recognition,” Densley said. “Family members already share time, space, routines, and private conversations. They can test and rehearse ideas without social friction, providing mutual reinforcement.”
    


            Cases that demonstrate this include the 2022 Wieambilla shootings in Australia, where two brothers and a spouse acted together to kill three people, and the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attack in France by two brothers.
    


            Two of the bombers that carried out the 2019 Sri Lanka terror attacks were sons of a wealthy trader, meanwhile whole families moved to Syria and Iraq at the height of the Islamic State's self-declared caliphate. And the 2015 San Bernadino terror attack was carried out by a married couple.
    


            But a father-son led terror attack sets a new precedent.
    


            At Bondi Beach, police say Sajid Akram, 50, and Naveed Akram, 24, targeted a Jewish celebration, motivated by Islamic State ideology.
    


            The two traveled to the Philippines last month, visiting a region that has endured a painful history of Islamist extremism, and homemade Islamic State flags were found in their car after the attack.
    


            The pair are alleged to have recorded videos in which they shared views suggesting they adhered to “religiously motivated violent extremism ideology” and they also practiced shooting ahead of their attack in a rural part of Australia, according to an alleged statement of facts released by a magistrate Monday.
    


            Family hierarchy and dependency are also factors that can influence who initiates, who leads and who follows, according to Densley. That was most evident with the two brothers who orchestrated the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, detonating two pressure-cooker bombs near the finish line that killed three people and injured more than 260 others.
    


            “In that case, the older brother had a dominant role whilst the younger brother followed,” Densley said.
    


            Praise and approval are other social dynamics in father-son violence, according to Professor James Alan Fox, criminology professor at Northeastern University in Massachusetts.
    


            “The father praises his son for following his lead, and the son seeks the approval of the dad,” Fox told CNN. “To some extent the son is cooperating and participating in the killing in order to please his dad, but may not himself be committed to the mission.”
    


            Age often factors into these dynamics too, he adds. “Typically it is the older person as the leader, the general, and the younger as the follower, the foot soldier, if you will.”
    


            Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government confirmed Monday it would pursue increased criminal penalties for hate speech offenses and a new aggravated offense for adults who are found to be radicalizing children.
    


            “This unprecedented radicalization of our youth must stop. We will not allow extremists to groom and brainwash our children into hate or terrorism,” Attorney-General Michelle Rowland said.
    


            Logistics can change when an attack is carried out by more than one person, Densley explained. Having two people splitting tasks -–– scouting, planning, sourcing weapons, transport and surveillance –– allows for a more organized attack without a big external conspiracy.
    


            In a father-son attack, parents can also “remove practical barriers, especially if they control the money, transportation, or weapons,” Densley said.
    


            In the Bondi case, footage shows Naveed Akram shooting at crowds from a bridge overlooking the beach. The pair are also alleged to have conducted reconnaissance, visiting the site of the attack days in advance, according to court documents.
    


            Following the attack, police seized six guns owned by Sajid Akram who had a gun license.  Authorities confirmed he “met the eligibility criteria for a firearms license” and held a “recreational hunting license.”
    


            “This exposes a blind spot in Australia's otherwise strong gun laws because risk is relational, not just individual,” Densley suggested.
    


            “In a lone-actor case, the key question is usually ‘how did this person get the gun?' In a parent–child case, the question becomes ‘who controlled the environment where the gun was already present?'”
    


            This is highlighted by experts in the 2021 Oxford High School shooting in Michigan, where 15-year-old Ethan Crumbley gunned down four classmates and wounded six others and a teacher.
    


            His parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, became the first in the US to be held criminally responsible for a mass school shooting by their child, each sentenced for up to 15 years for manslaughter, while Ethan received life without parole for first-degree murder.
    


            Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Cheryl Matthews told the court that James Crumbley provided “unfettered access to a gun or guns as well as ammunition in your home,” while Jennifer Crumbley “glorified the use and possession of these weapons.”
    


            “One way of thinking about this is that a parent doesn't just supply a weapon, they supply legitimacy,” Densley added. “When firearms are legally owned, stored in the household, and normalized as part of everyday life, that dramatically lowers the barrier for entry for a younger family member.”
    


            In the US, mass shootings have decreased in 2025 but are still demonstrably higher than in other developed nations. In Australia, with some of the world's strictest gun laws, the reality is different. The Bondi Beach massacre marked the nation's deadliest mass shooting in almost 30 years.
    


            Naveed Akram now faces 59 charges including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act. Sajid was killed in a shootout with police at the scene.

A small Mexican Navy plane transporting a young medical patient and seven others crashed Monday near Galveston, killing at least five people and setting off a search in the waters off the Texas coast, officials said.

Air traffic controllers lost communication for about 10 minutes with a small Mexican Navy plane carrying a young medical patient and seven others before it crashed off the Texas coast, killing at least five people, Mexico's president said Tuesday.

Authorities initially believed the plane had landed safely at its destination in Galveston, near Houston, before learning it had gone down Monday afternoon, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said. The cause of the crash remains under investigation. A search-and-rescue operation in waters near Galveston pulled two survivors from the plane's wreckage, while one remained missing, Mexico's Navy said.

Four of the eight people aboard were Navy officers and four were civilians, including a child, Mexico's Navy said. Two of the passengers were affiliated with a nonprofit that helps transport Mexican children with severe burns to a hospital in Galveston.

“My condolences to the families of the sailors who unfortunately died in this accident and to the people who were traveling on board,” Sheinbaum said in her morning press briefing, without elaborating on a possible cause. “What happened is very tragic.”

U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Luke Baker said at least five aboard had died but did not identify which passengers. 




The plane crashed Monday afternoon in a bay near the base of the causeway connecting Galveston Island to the mainland. Emergency responders rushed to the scene near the popular beach destination about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of Houston.

Sky Decker, a professional yacht captain who lives about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from the crash site, said he jumped in his boat to see if he could help. He picked up two police officers who guided him through thick fog to a nearly submerged plane. Decker jumped into the water and found a badly injured woman trapped beneath chairs and other debris.

“I couldn't believe. She had maybe 3 inches of air gap to breathe in,” he said. “And there was jet fuel in there mixed with the water, fumes real bad. She was really fighting for her life.”

He said he also pulled out a man seated in front of her who had already died. Both were wearing civilian clothes.

It's not immediately clear if weather was a factor. The area was experiencing foggy conditions over the past few days, according to Cameron Batiste, a National Weather Service meteorologist. He said that at about 2:30 p.m. Monday a fog came in that had about a half-mile visibility.

Teams from the Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board were at the crash site Monday, the Texas Department of Public Safety said, and a spokesperson for the NTSB said the agency was gathering information about the crash. 

Mexico's Navy said the plane was helping with a medical mission in coordination with the Michou and Mau Foundation. In a social media post, the foundation offered condolences to the families and said it shared their grief “with respect and compassion.”

The charity was founded after a mother died trying to save her kids from a fire. One child succumbed to his injuries because he didn't receive highly specialized medical care, while another survived after receiving treatment at Shriners Children's Texas in Galveston. Over 23 years, the foundation has helped transfer more than 2,000 patients to that hospital and other medical facilities with burn expertise, according to charity's website. 

The charity's director didn't immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment. 

Shriners Children's Texas said in a statement that it learned of the crash with “profound sadness” but wasn't able to provide any information about the child's condition because the child hadn't yet been admitted. 

This latest crash comes amid a year of intense scrutiny on aviation safety after a string of high-profile crashes and the flight disruptions during the government shutdown driven by the shortage of air traffic controllers. 

The January mid-air collision between an Army helicopter and an airliner near Washington D.C. was followed by the crash of a medical transport plane in Philadelphia. This fall's fiery UPS plane crash only added to the concerns. Still, the total number of crashes in 2025 was actually down a bit from last year and experts say flying remains safe overall.

Patrick Hotze's three daughters made it home safe from Camp Mystic after July's catastrophic floods that killed 25 campers and two teenage counselors. He attended some of the funerals and says he understands the outrage over the Texas camp's plan to partially reopen next year.

He also intends to send his girls back.

“My heart is broken for them,” Hotze said of the parents whose girls died, including some he described as close friends. “I think it's different for each kid and each family.”

For the first time since the roaring flood, the 100-year-old all-girls Christian sleepaway retreat plans to sign up campers in January, forging ahead with a reopening that has divided families and stunned some lawmakers. Campers will start arriving in May, bunking on higher ground than the area where fast-rising waters on the Guadalupe River swept away two cabins.

Some families say the decision to let their daughters return is a vital step in their own healing from the disaster that is still under scrutiny. The floodwaters that worsened with terrifying quickness during the July Fourth holiday weekend killed at least 117 people in Kerr County alone. Two victims have still not been found, including an 8-year-old Camp Mystic camper.




Next year, Texas legislators are set to hold investigative hearings into the tragedy but have shown little appetite to assign blame. Local leaders in Kerr County, including two who were asleep when the waters started rising, remain in their jobs after defending their preparations and evacuation efforts. They are now steering a slow recovery while trying to expedite a new flood warning system before campers return.

“We recognize that returning to Camp Mystic carries both hope and heartache,” Camp Mystic's owners wrote in a letter to families this month. “For many of your daughters, this return is not simple, but it is a courageous step in their healing journey.”

It is unclear how many girls will return to Camp Mystic when the camp begins enrollment next month, but a spokesperson said there is “strong interest.” The camp's owner, Dick Eastland, died in the flood and his family has vowed to enhance safety measures before reopening, including two-way radios in every cabin and new flood warning river monitors.

The devastating July floods were hardly the first to strike the area known as “Flash Flood Alley,” where the limestone hills quickly gather water and funnel it into narrow river banks. This year was at least the fifth time in a century that flooding near the Guadalupe River has turned deadly. An attorney for Camp Mystic, Mikal Watts, said he and camp officials have contacted several former campers who witnessed previous floods and who told them they were nowhere near as high or as powerful as the flooding this year.

Those assurances have not quieted some parents of the 27 victims, who say the decision to reopen is insensitive and that the Eastland family has refused to take responsibility for its failures.

Lawsuits filed by some of the families allege camp operators failed to protect the children and even ordered girls and counselors in the cabins closest to the river to stay inside as floodwaters overwhelmed the property. Hundreds of 911 calls released by authorities this month included a woman who lived a mile downriver and said two of the campers had swept by.

“As parents of children who were killed at Camp Mystic last summer, we are deeply hurt but, sadly, not shocked by yet another insensitive announcement from Camp Mystic focused on enrollment,” the parents of six girls who died said in a public statement this month.

Some parents say Camp Mystic has played an instrumental role in their children's personal and spiritual development, and that eased their decision to allow their girls to return.

Liberty Lindley's 9-year-old daughter, Evie, was among those caught in the flooding. She was trapped with her campmates in a cabin dubbed Wiggle Inn, adjacent to the low-lying cabins that were quickly inundated by the flooded river.

Many of the girls Evie knew were swept to their deaths.

Yet despite the horror Evie endured, floating on mattresses with her friends in the pitch dark before being evacuated by helicopter, Lindley said her daughter didn't hesitate when asked if she wanted to return to Camp Mystic.

“I know some people don't understand that or think that's crazy,” she said of her decision to allow her daughter to go back.

She recalled talking with Evie — whose twin sister died of leukemia in 2024 — while washing her hair in the bathtub, right after her terrifying ordeal.

“She thought she was going to be seeing her sister that night in heaven,” Lindley recalled. “And she still looked at me with a smile and said, ‘Mom, I really hope next year at camp we do Mary Poppins again, because I still really want to be Bert.' That is just hours after the fact.”

Still, not all parents are eager to send their daughters back to Camp Mystic.

John Ball, an attorney in McAllen, Texas, whose daughter was at Camp Mystic during the flood, said he has serious reservations, especially after the poor communication from camp officials about his daughter's whereabouts.

Ball said he was out of town and didn't learn that his daughter was safe until more than 12 hours after the flooding, when she was able to borrow a cellphone and call him.

“That was the hardest part, not knowing,” Ball said.

“I think we're going to take this year off and see how it goes and what these changes look like that they're implementing,” he said, “and we'll go from there.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Communications Commission on Monday said it would ban new foreign-made drones, a move that will keep new Chinese-made drones such as those from DJI and Autel out of the U.S. market.

The announcement came a year after Congress passed a defense bill that raised national security concerns about Chinese-made drones, which have become a dominant player in the U.S., widely used in farming, mapping, law enforcement and filmmaking. 

The bill called for stopping the two Chinese companies from selling new drones in the U.S. if a review found they posed a risk to American national security. The deadline for the review was Dec. 23. 

The FCC said Monday the review found that all drones and critical components produced in foreign countries, not just by the two Chinese companies, posed “unacceptable risks to the national security of the United States and to the safety and security of U.S. persons.” But it said specific drones or components would be exempt if the Pentagon or Department of Homeland Security determined they did not pose such risks. 

The FCC cited upcoming major events, such as the 2026 World Cup, America250 celebrations and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, as reasons to address potential drone threats posed by “criminals, hostile foreign actors, and terrorists.”

Michael Robbins, president and chief executive officer of AUVSI, the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International, said in a statement that the industry group welcomes the decision. He said it's time for the U.S. not only to reduce its dependence on China but build its own drones.

“Recent history underscores why the United States must increase domestic drone production and secure its supply chains,” Robbins said, citing Beijing's willingness to restrict critical supplies such as rare earth magnets to serve its strategic interests.




DJI said it was disappointed by the FCC decision. “While DJI was not singled out, no information has been released regarding what information was used by the Executive Branch in reaching its determination,” it said in a statement.

“Concerns about DJI's data security have not been grounded in evidence and instead reflect protectionism, contrary to the principles of an open market,” the company said.

In Texas, Gene Robinson has a fleet of nine DJI drones that he uses for law enforcement training and forensic analyses. He said the new restrictions would hurt him and many others who have come to rely on the Chinese drones because of their versatility, high performance and affordable prices.

But he said he understands the decision and lamented that the U.S. had outsourced the manufacturing to China. “Now, we are paying the price,” Robinson said. “To get back to where we had the independence, there will be some growing pains. We need to suck it up, and let's not have it happen again.”

Also in Texas, Arthur Erickson, chief executive officer and co-founder of the drone-making company Hylio, said the departure of DJI would provide much-needed room for American companies like his to grow. New investments are pouring in to help him ramp up production of spray drones, which farmers use to fertilize their fields, and it will bring down prices, Erickson said.

But he also called it “crazy” and “unexpected” that the FCC should expand the scope to all foreign-made drones and drone components. “The way it's written is a blanket statement,” Erickson said. “There's a global allied supply chain. I hope they will clarify that.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has announced a bold plan for the Navy to build a new, large warship that he is calling a “battleship” as part of a larger vision to create a “Golden Fleet.”

“They'll be the fastest, the biggest, and by far 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built,” Trump claimed during the announcement at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

According to Trump, the ship, the first of which will be named the USS Defiant, will be longer and larger than the World War II-era Iowa-class battleships and will be armed with hypersonic missiles, nuclear cruise missiles, rail guns, and high-powered lasers — all technologies that are in various stages of development by the Navy.

The announcement comes just a month after the Navy scrapped its plans to build a new, small warship, citing growing delays and cost overruns, deciding instead to go with a modified version of a Coast Guard cutter that was being produced until recently. The sea service has also failed to build its other newly designed ships, like the new Ford-class aircraft carrier and Columbia-class submarines, on time and on budget.

Meanwhile, the Navy has struggled to field some of the technologies Trump says will be aboard the new ship. 

The Navy spent hundreds of millions of dollars and more than 15 years trying to field a railgun aboard a ship before finally abandoning the effort in 2021.




Laser technology has seen more success in making its way onto Navy ships in recent years, but its employment is still limited. One system that is designed to blind or disable drone sensors is now aboard eight destroyers after spending eight years in development.

Developing nuclear cruise missile capabilities or deploying them on ships may also violate non-proliferation treaties that the U.S. has signed with Russia.

A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing plans, told The Associated Press that design efforts are now underway for the new ship and construction is planned to begin in the early 2030s. 

Both Trump and Navy Secretary John Phelan spoke about the new Trump-class warship as a spiritual successor to the battleships of the 20th century, but historically that term has referred to a very specific type of ship — a large, heavily armored vessel armed with massive guns designed to bombard other ships or targets ashore. 

This type of ship was at the height of prominence during World War II, and the largest of the U.S. battleships, the Iowa-class, were roughly 60,000 tons. But after World War II, the battleship's role in modern fleets diminished rapidly in favor of aircraft carriers and long-range missiles. The U.S. Navy did modernize four Iowa-class battleships in the 1980s by adding cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles, along with modern radars, but by the 1990s all four were decommissioned.

According to a newly created website for the “Golden Fleet,” this new “guided missile battleship” is set to be roughly the same size as Iowa-class battleships but only weigh about half as much, around 35,000 tons, and have far smaller crews — between 650 and 850 sailors.

Its primary weapons will also be missiles, not large naval guns.

Trump has long held strong opinions on specific aspects of the Navy's fleet, sometimes with a view toward keeping older technology instead of modernizing.

During his first term, he unsuccessfully called for the return to steam-powered catapults to launch jets from the Navy's newest aircraft carriers instead of the more modern electromagnetic system.

He has also complained to Phelan about the look of the Navy's destroyers and decried Navy ships being covered in rust.

Phelan told senators at his confirmation hearing that Trump “has texted me numerous times very late at night, sometimes after one (o'clock) in the morning” about “rusty ships or ships in a yard, asking me what am I doing about it.”

On a visit to a shipyard that was working on the now-canceled Constellation-class frigate in 2020, Trump said he personally changed the design of the ship.

“I looked at it, I said, ‘That's a terrible-looking ship, let's make it beautiful,'” Trump said at the time.

He said Monday he will have a direct role in designing this new warship as well.

“The U.S. Navy will lead the design of these ships along with me, because I'm a very aesthetic person,” Trump said.

Phelan said the new USS Defiant “will inspire awe and reverence for the American flag whenever it pulls into a foreign port.”

Former Sen. Joe Manchin joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss President Donald Trump's energy and affordability agenda, U.S. oil and gas production and the national debt.

Congress' top fiscal hawk is back with his yearly government waste report card, this time uncovering over $1.6 trillion in spending on cocaine experiments on dogs, COVID-19 vaccine influencer campaigns and staggering yearly debt payments.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., unveiled his 11th annual ""Festivus Report"" on Tuesday, detailing the wonky ways that the federal government dumps taxpayer dollars into pet projects.

Paul has long been against Congress' spending habits, routinely voting against appropriations bills and spending packages for not trying to tackle the nation's growing debt problem. His report highlights that even with several lawmakers pounding their chests on Washington's spending problem, Congress can't help but spend more.

""No matter how much taxpayer money Washington burns through, politicians can't help but demand more,"" Paul said. ""Fiscal responsibility may not be the most crowded road, but it's one I've walked year after year — and this holiday season will be no different. So, before we get to the Feats of Strength, it's time for my Airing of (Spending) Grievances.""

He lauded moves taken by the Trump administration to slash government spending, like the nearly $9 billion rescissions package that slashed funding for public broadcasting and some foreign aid, Paul said that while the action was ""a good start, it's just a drop in the bucket.""

Paul noted that in the last year, the federal debt has skyrocketed to nearly $40 trillion, up from roughly $36 trillion.

""The Congressional Budget Office predicts we will add an average of $23.9 trillion in debt annually for the next decade. The U.S. government will add over $6.53 billion of debt every single day for the next ten years,"" Paul said. ""We borrow over $272 million every hour, we borrow $4.54 million every minute, and we borrow over $75,000 every second.""

""This year, I'm spotlighting a jaw-dropping amount of government waste — the kind that makes you wonder if anyone in Washington has ever heard the word ‘priorities,'"" he continued. ""A grand total of $1,639,135,969,608, which includes $1.22 trillion in interest payments on the debt.""

And several programs highlighted in the report that funneled taxpayer dollars to celebrities, drug experiments, diversity, equity and inclusion programs and several other obscure projects contributed to that staggering figure.

Among the highlights are over $40 million to social media influencers to promote getting the COVID-19 vaccine to racial and ethnic minority groups, over $5 million to dose dogs with cocaine, over $1 million to teach ""teenage ferrets to binge-drink alcohol,"" over $14 million to teach monkeys to play a ""Price is Right""-inspired game and roughly $13 million to continue experiments on beagles.

There's also the over $7 billion previously allocated by Congress to build electric vehicle charging stations nationwide — only 68 have been built so far, he noted — and schools receiving nearly $200 billion in COVID-19 relief funds that has been spent on ""rooms at Caesars Palace, renting out MLB stadiums, and ice cream trucks.""

The report highlighted several other programs, including over $1 million to hire celebrity influencers for anti-drug campaigns targeting ""Latinx"" communities, nearly $5 million total for studies looking at the effect of screen time on toddlers and mobile-phone obesity intervention for toddlers, and over $2 million for researchers to take saliva swabs at electronic dance music festivals in New York City.

'Couldn't be more selfless': Actor Rob Reiner praises Biden and his record at Democratic National Convention while defending anti-Israel protests.

Sally Struthers is looking back on her time working with Rob Reiner on ""All In the Family.""

During an interview with Woman's World, the 78-year-old actress shared the life-changing career advice she received from Reiner while they were working together on the hit '70s sitcom.

""If you can make the show itself more important than your own part, you will wind up offering to give up some of your lines,"" Struthers recalled Reiner telling her when she noticed her lines kept getting cut when filming the show.

The two played Gloria and Michael, a husband-and-wife pair in ""All In The Family"" playing the liberal counterparts to Struthers' on-screen conservative working-class parents, played by Carroll O'Connor and Jean Stapleton.

Both Struthers and Reiner left the show following its eighth season, when their characters moved to California with their son. When Struthers returned to the role of Gloria in the short-lived spin-off show, it was revealed that Michael left her and their son off-camera.

""Gloria Bunker Stivic would have remarried,"" she told Woman's World. ""Someone just as inspiring as her first husband, because Mike taught Gloria a lot.""

When news of Reiner's death broke, Struthers told Deadline: ""There are no words. This is beyond devastating and my heart is with their family.""

Reiner and Struthers previously reunited on stage at the 2024 Emmy Awards when the award show put together a tribute to Norman Lear, who created many popular shows, including ""All In the Family,"" ""Silver Spoons,"" ""The Jeffersons,"" ""Who's the Boss"" and many others.

""Sally and I were part of a unique television family: not just the Bunkers, but Norman Lear's extended family,"" Reiner said during the tribute. ""Over the decades, Norman brought us together, and he created groundbreaking television shows that depicted real people who made us laugh, made us think, made us feel.""

Following his time on ""All In the Family,"" Reiner went on to direct some of Hollywood's most beloved films, including ""When Harry Met Sally,"" ""Stand By Me,"" ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" ""The Princess Bride"" and many others.

Reiner and his wife Michele were found dead in their Brentwood home on Sunday, Dec. 14, with LAPD Assistant Police Chief Dominic Choi later confirming their bodies were found in their bedroom.

Early on in the investigation, the couple's son Nick was named as a person of interest and was later taken into custody. He was booked on Monday, Dec. 15 and was formally charged with double homicide on Tuesday, Dec. 16.

Following the murders, Nick's troubled past involving addiction and mental health issues resurfaced, and the family's neighbors began speaking with the media about his past erratic and violent behavior.

""Years ago, when he was young, he was on heroin and cocaine, and he went to rehab and did well and was apparently back to normal, but obviously, that wasn't the case,"" Maryanne Lewis, who has lived in the Brentwood neighborhood for over 50 years, told Fox News Digital. ""I heard nothing about him recently.""

Another neighbor told the New York Post, ""This is not the first time their son has been violent,"" adding, ""I know of another incident a few years back with Nick, but I won't say more than that. I just never thought it would ever get to this point.""

""Rob was always heartbroken that his son couldn't beat his addiction,"" the neighbor continued. ""I know they wanted him to get help, go to rehab, but he wanted to get help while at home — he did not want to get treatment at a facility.""

Sarah Krissoff said the Epstein files fall outside the regular review process that would normally determine what can be released to the public and what must remain in the dark.

If the Department of Justice (DOJ) wanted to release every Jeffrey Epstein-related document they had on file, they had the firepower to do so, a former assistant U.S. attorney argued.

The DOJ has faced bipartisan criticism over its initial release of heavily redacted Epstein files, which lawmakers argue fell short of the requirements of a recently passed transparency law.

""The Department of Justice has all the resources in the world, right? I mean if they wanted to put 1,000 lawyers on this to review the documents and get them ready for the production, they could have,"" Sarah Krissoff said.

""And they don't appear to have done that,"" she added.

The DOJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Krissoff, who worked as a prosecutor for almost 14 years in the Southern District of New York, described key differences between the Epstein files and the normal redaction process that attorneys grapple with. Those distinctions make it unclear who would have had final say about the information the DOJ released on Friday as the agency attempted to follow through on the requirements laid out by the Epstein Files Transparency Act. 

That law, passed by Congress last month and signed by President Donald Trump on Nov. 19, gave the DOJ just 30 days to make its documentation of Epstein public. It included some exceptions for protecting the identity of victims.

Despite the thousands of files that became publicly available at the end of last week, the DOJ's first trove sparked criticism from some lawmakers and viewers online outraged that the department hadn't released them all at once.

""They are hiding a lot of documents. That would be very helpful in our investigation,"" Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Va., a member of the House Oversight Committee, told CNN on Monday morning.

Although she remains skeptical of the department's effort, Krissoff noted that what the DOJ's been asked to do goes far outside the norm for disclosures.

""There is no real mechanism in the law that the public can just access documents because they're interested in them, right? In this case, this law is requiring the DOJ to make these things public because so many members of Congress are interested in this issue,"" Krissoff said.

In the cases she's been a part of, Krissoff said redactions usually came down to meticulous negotiations between the prosecution and the defense. Sometimes deliberations drilled into individual sentences or words.

""This situation is a little different because it's unclear, you know, who is still working on this from the original case team. And so, the question is: who at the Department of Justice reviewed these in connection with the redactions here?"" Krissoff said.

She said whole case files rarely get released to the public beyond what shows up in court filings — and what's there usually serves the narrow purposes of the prosecution. In Epstein's case, the public's interests extend beyond any potential conviction of Epstein himself. Epstein died in 2019 while incarcerated on suspicion of sex-trafficking minors. His death, ruled a suicide, cut short his prosecution and left behind questions about whether he facilitated illegal sexual encounters for his vast social network. 

Photos released by the DOJ last week lack context and do not, on their own, implicate anyone depicted in them of wrongdoing.

""The case file often implicates many other people that are not charged in the crimes. So, there may be 15 people charged in a drug ring. You've only charged one or two people; you don't want to impugn those other people who have not been charged by releasing information showing their involvement in this drug ring,"" Krissoff said.

""The last thing you want to do is put that neighbor's information or his name or even his statement out there,"" Krissoff said.

She believes that there's a danger in forcing disclosure of an ongoing case simply because of great public interest and setting a precedent for that to become a regular occurrence. In her view, it could disrupt ongoing investigations of the future that draw intense public interest.

The DOJ said it will continue to release its documents on Epstein on a rolling basis. It has not announced when they expect to continue their release of the Epstein files.

'Crunchy mom' Mary Kate Kilfoy weighs in on HHS Secretary RFK Jr.'s push to take action against microplastics and a key weed killer ingredient believed to be dangerous.

A study from Sweden's Uppsala University discovered a link between microplastics and multiple sclerosis (MS).

The research, published in the journal Environmental International, discovered that exposure to two common environmental contaminants, PFAS and PCBs, could increase the risk of the autoimmune disease.

PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as ""forever chemicals,"" are used in some common household products, such as non-stick cookware, textiles and cleaning products. They have also been found in drinking water throughout the U.S., according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

COMMON CLEANING CHEMICAL TIED TO SPIKE IN LIVER DISEASE ACROSS US, RESEARCHERS SAY

PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, are toxic industrial chemicals once widely used in electrical equipment before being banned decades ago, as stated by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.

The new study findings were based on blood samples of 1,800 Swedish individuals, including about 900 who had recently been diagnosed with MS, according to a university press release.

The first phase of the trial studied 14 different PFAS contaminants and three substances that appear when PCBs are broken down in the body. These were then investigated for a link to the odds of diagnosis.

'FOREVER CHEMICALS' FOUND IN US DRINKING WATER, MAP SHOWS 'HOT SPOTS' OF HIGHEST LEVELS

""We saw that several individual substances, such as PFOS and two hydroxylated PCBs, were linked to increased odds for MS,"" lead study author Kim Kultima said in a statement. ""People with the highest concentrations of PFOS and PCBs had approximately twice the odds of being diagnosed with MS, compared to those with the lowest concentrations.""

The researchers then examined the combined effects of these substances and found that the mixture was also linked to increased risk.

Fellow researcher Aina Vaivade noted that risk assessments should consider chemical mixtures, not just individual exposures, because people are typically exposed to multiple substances at the same time.

""We saw that several individual substances, such as PFOS and two hydroxylated PCBs, were linked to increased odds for MS,"" the lead study author said. (iStock)

The final phase of the study investigated the relationship between inheritance, chemical exposure and the odds of MS diagnosis, revealing that those who carry a certain gene variant actually have a reduced MS risk.

However, individuals who carried the gene and had higher exposure to PFOS — a singular type of chemical in the PFAS family — had an ""unexpected"" increased risk of MS.

""This indicates that there is a complex interaction between inheritance and environmental exposure linked to the odds of MS,"" Kultima said. 

""We therefore think it is important to understand how environmental contaminants interact with hereditary factors, as this can provide new knowledge about the genesis of MS and could also be relevant for other diseases.""

Multiple sclerosis is a disease that leads to the breakdown of the protective covering of the nerves, according to Mayo Clinic. (iStock)

Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel commented on these findings in an interview with Fox News Digital.

""MS is a complex disease that is somewhat autoimmune and somewhat post-inflammatory,"" said Siegel, who was not involved in the study. ""Epstein-Barr virus infection greatly increases the risk of MS.""

""There is every reason to believe that environmental triggers play a role, including microplastics, and this important study shows a correlation, but not causation — in other words, it doesn't prove that the microplastics caused MS.""

The study had some limitations, the researchers acknowledged, including that the chemical exposure was measured only once, at the time of blood sampling. This means it may not accurately represent participants' long-term or past exposure levels relevant to MS development.

""There is every reason to believe that environmental triggers play a role.""

Fox News Digital reached out to several industry groups and manufacturers requesting comment on the potential link between PFAS chemicals and multiple sclerosis. 

Several have issued public statements, including the American Chemistry Council, which states on its website that ""manufacturers and many users of today's PFAS are implementing a variety of practices and technologies to help minimize environmental emissions.""

In April 2024, the EPA enacted a new federal rule that sets mandatory limits on certain PFAS chemicals in drinking water, aiming to reduce exposure. The agency also aims to fund testing and treatment efforts.

The immune system's attack on these nerve sheaths can cause numbness, weakness, trouble walking and moving, vision changes and other symptoms, and can lead to permanent damage.

There is currently no cure for MS, Mayo Clinic reports, but treatment is available to manage symptoms and modify the course of the disease.

The Russian Foreign Ministry has reportedly begun evacuating the families of its diplomats from Venezuela as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's hold on power grows increasingly fragile.

Russia is one of Maduro's most important allies and has continually shown solidarity with the Latin American nation during the increasing pressure campaign directed against it by President Donald Trump. Outside of its public rhetoric, however, Moscow seems to be growing increasingly concerned with the situation. A European intelligence source told the Associated Press that Russia's Foreign Ministry began evacuating the wives and children of its diplomats working in Venezuela, presumably in preparation for the situation deteriorating further.

The official revealed that Russian Foreign Ministry officials assess the situation in Venezuela in “very grim tones.”

Moscow and Caracas enjoy a fairly close relationship, having recently ratified the Russia-Venezuela Strategic Partnership Treaty and providing mutual sanctions relief. However, Russia's options for assisting its ally if Trump decides to take military action are limited, as its military is focused on the war in Ukraine, and it has few means of projecting power into the Western Hemisphere, even in the best of circumstances.

Analysts have noted that the flailing Maduro regime, with little legitimacy and an imploding economy, ranks at the bottom of Russia and China‘s priorities. Russia's need to remain cordial with the Trump administration to try to negotiate an end to the costly war in Ukraine remains its priority with Washington.

Washington appears to believe the same. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Russia's relationship with Venezuela isn't playing into the U.S.'s calculus.

“We're not concerned about an escalation with Russia, with regards to Venezuela,” Rubio told reporters. “We've always expected them to provide rhetorical support for the Maduro regime … [but] it's not a factor in how we consider this whole thing.”

Despite this, Russia has continued to provide rhetorical support for Caracas. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov held a phone call with Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil on Monday, during which they expressed mutual support.

“The ministers expressed their deep concern over the escalation of Washington's actions in the Caribbean Sea, which could have serious consequences for the region and threaten international shipping,” Russia's Foreign Ministry said of the call.

RUSSIA WARNS OF ‘UNPREDICTABLE CONSEQUENCES' TO US OPERATIONS IN VENEZUELA: ‘FATAL MISTAKE'

“The Russian side reaffirmed its full support for and solidarity with the Venezuelan leadership and people in the current context,” it added.

Russian warnings against further escalation last week were brushed aside by Washington, with the Trump administration following through on its threat to blockade oil tankers carrying Venezuelan oil. The United States has seized several, while over 100 suspected drug traffickers have been killed in kinetic strikes on drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean since Sept. 2.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

TRUMP'S MOST IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENT. Experts estimate that during the Biden administration, around 9 million migrants crossed illegally into the United States and remained in the country. As illegal border crossers, they are what immigration officials call “removable,” that is, subject to expulsion from the country on the grounds that they entered without authorization.

The wild influx during the Biden years strained communities nationwide, burdened government budgets, caused social disruption, led to an alarming number of violent crimes, and, in general, made a mockery of U.S. immigration law. Plus, the situation is difficult to reverse; it would be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to find each illegal border crosser and remove him or her from the U.S.

But the administration of President Donald Trump has made extraordinary progress in addressing the problem. First, Border Patrol and other law enforcement officials have virtually stopped the flow of illegal crossers at the Mexico border. The best start is to stop making the problem worse.

Second, this month, the Department of Homeland Security announced the departure of more than 2.5 million migrants who were in the country illegally. “Since January 20, 2025, DHS enforcement operations have resulted in more than 605,000 deportations,” the department said in a statement. “DHS has prioritized removing the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens as part of the Trump administration's efforts to return law and order to the United States. Additionally, thanks to the comprehensive efforts of DHS law enforcement, 1.9 million illegal aliens have voluntarily self-deported since January 2025.”

The first number — 605,000 deportations — has astonished some immigration enforcement veterans. In the past, the government's deportations were in two categories. One was the number of illegal immigrants removed from the interior of the country, and the other was the number who were simply apprehended at the border and turned around back into Mexico. Obviously, the first category requires a lot more work for immigration enforcement.

Former immigration judge Andrew Arthur of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors tighter immigration controls, noted that the high-water mark of removals from the interior of the country was 237,941 in 2008-2009. (Arthur attributed that number, at the very end of the George W. Bush administration, to an effort by Bush to increase interior removals, appearing tough on immigration, in hopes of persuading Congress to approve an amnesty deal.) The total number of removals was then “padded,” in Arthur's words, by the number of illegal border crossers who had been turned around upon arrival at the border and sent back to Mexico.

Now, Trump has virtually stopped the flow of illegal crossers at the border, so the administration's number of deportations — 605,000 — is virtually all people removed from the interior. That is a huge number; Arthur called it “epic.”

Trump started with some advantages. First, due to the Biden administration's lax enforcement, by the end of 2024, there were 1.44 million illegal immigrants who had received final removal orders from a judge. They had full due process and could be deported as soon as they were found. So, that was a start.

In addition, under Trump, immigration judges added new deportation orders. And then Immigration and Customs Enforcement began to receive assistance from what Arthur called “enforcement-friendly jurisdictions that will identify and (to a degree) hold criminal aliens for the agency to pick up.”

“Long story short,” concluded Arthur, “Trump II has the will prior administrations lacked to enforce the law in the interior, has a large population of removable aliens to choose from (thanks to non-enforcement under Biden), has the detention space to hold them (thanks to the Big Beautiful Bill Act), and has willing federal and state partners to lend a hand. Consequently, it is setting removal records previously thought impossible.”

That is the deportation side. The much larger part of the total removal number, 1.9 million, is people who were in the U.S. illegally and decided to leave on their own — to self-deport. The two categories are closely related. Everyone agrees that the Trump administration's aggressive deportation efforts have caught the attention of the millions in the country illegally. They face a new reality that gives them three choices: 1) Find a way to get right with the law; 2) Do nothing and hope that enforcement officers do not find them; or 3) Leave.

So far, just in 2025, 1.9 million have taken the third option. If Trump's enforcement efforts continue, that number will continue to grow.

The total number of deportations, 2.5 million, is quite an achievement. But to put it in perspective, Trump's record number of deportations has reversed just one year of the number who entered the U.S. illegally during the Biden influx. That's a measure of how much there is to do.

Can the administration keep up its first-year pace for the rest of Trump's term? Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, believes it can. “Yes, ICE can maintain this pace,” she said. “They have an infusion of funding and Trump has been able to win some court challenges. If he increases workplace enforcement and continues the zero tolerance messaging, more people will see the writing on the wall and decide to return home. In addition, there will be fewer visa overstays because of the tightening of visa restrictions.”

Trump's efforts have met with significant public approval — majorities approve of removing illegal immigrants with criminal records, and also those who have simply entered the country illegally. But a few of ICE's more heavy-handed removal actions have given Democrats an issue to stage protests against the administration's “cruelty.” Several Democratic politicians, including presidential hopefuls Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) and JB Pritzker (D-IL), are doubling down on their opposition to enforcing U.S. immigration law.

The most important thing to remember is that Trump's work is intended to make life better for the people living legally in the U.S. “The benefit to the United States is that certain illegal aliens who are committing crimes and causing problems in American communities will no longer be living here,” says Vaughan. “American taxpayers will have less of a burden funding welfare, health care, and schooling for recent arrivals, and employers who were previously hiring illegal workers will have to start hiring U.S. workers. All of this is helpful to the quality of life and wage growth for struggling Americans.”

EXCLUSIVE — The Trump administration will soon install 900 miles of buoy barrier at the United States-Mexico border, marking the first time the U.S. government has used a water-based defense system to stop illegal immigration, the Border Patrol's national chief told the Washington Examiner.

Construction teams will start dropping the red-orange floating devices in the Rio Grande along Texas' southern border in early 2026, Border Patrol Chief Mike Banks said.

“We're going to start laying the first string of those buoys down in the Rio Grande Valley in the first part of 2026,” Banks said in a video interview on Dec. 19. “We've contracted over 500 miles of it. We're looking at probably, ultimately, around 900 miles in the river in Texas.”

The only buoys used in border security in national history stretched roughly one mile in length and were installed by Texas during the Biden administration. This hefty addition will link up with Texas's smaller project in Eagle Pass, and is expected to further reduce illegal border crossings, which are at 55-year lows.

The project was funded with money that Congress included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law in July.

The line of buoys is the latest flashy action that the Trump administration will take to carry out the president's campaign promise of regaining control of the southern border following the Biden-era border crisis. The buoys are intended to prevent migrants in Mexico from wading across the river and entering the United States illegally.

Trump is “very aware” of the buoy project and has endorsed the plan, Banks said. He also said it is backed by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. 

“I have never seen this much support from a president and a secretary,” Banks said. “The support is even greater than it was in his first administration, as he's continued to learn and grow in his understanding and knowledge on the border.”

The White House reiterated the president's support for the Border Patrol.

”There's no doubt that President Trump has expeditiously delivered on his promise to secure our border. While Biden let criminal illegals pour into our country and complained he couldn't do anything to stop it, President Trump immediately proved him wrong, and the American people are safer for it,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson wrote in an email Monday afternoon. “It's amazing what happens when you have a President who believes in empowering Border Patrol to do their job.”

Where the buoys will float

The Texas-Mexico border is 1,250 miles long, comprising three-fifths of the entire southern border. The installation of the 900 miles of buoys will come in phases.

A 500-mile stretch of buoys that has already been contracted out will be laid from where the Rio Grande meets the Gulf of America near Brownsville, Texas, and stretch westward. 

A second portion of 400 miles is still being finalized and will be installed on the south-central and southwestern sides of Texas.

The buoys will not be placed in areas that are too shallow to float; however, this could change in the coming months.

The Trump administration may greenlight additional buoys depending on the impact of Mexico's recent decision to begin releasing water into the river at the western end of the river that had been withheld from Texas by the Mexican government, according to the chief.

Banks plans to be present in Texas as the crew begins to install the buoys.

“It's very important. It's a huge milestone. And I think the, you know, talk about morale going up, Agents are really starting to see where all this planning has come to,” he said.

The forthcoming buoys are slightly smaller than the mile-long strand that Texas installed in 2023. The new ones will be up to six feet in diameter and cylinder-shaped, while the original buoys in Eagle Pass are round.

The buoys will be placed at the center of the river, right on the international boundary, unlike the physical border wall.

The buoys will also contain detection technology that will issue alerts for movement, effectively putting eyes in the water and allowing agents to patrol better.

The buoys serve as the initial barrier on the border line, while the existing physical steel wall on land will now serve as the second barrier. 

“The wall is several feet to as much as miles north of the border because of those floodplains along the river,” Banks said. “[The buoy barrier] allows us to put early detection and deterrence right down the center of the river on the actual international boundary line, and gives us that first point of detection of those trying to enter the country illegally.”

The buoys, in addition to the border wall, will give agents the chance to slow down anyone who can get over both. Several sections of the southern border feature a double wall in densely populated areas.

Selene Rodriguez, the campaign director for the Secure and Sovereign Texas campaign at the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation think tank, said the buoys are a critical part of border security.

“A key component of border security is deterrence. Infrastructure that discourages people from attempting to illegally enter the United States is a positive investment, but it must be accompanied by intelligence, technology, and personnel,” Rodriguez wrote in a text message Monday.

Border Patrol first began looking into a floating barrier during Trump's first term in office. It was designed, tested, and evaluated. But former President Joe Biden, who stopped all border wall construction projects on his first day in office in 2021, opposed fencing off the border to would-be illegal immigrants.

“We had signed contracts. We were prepared to start deploying those buoys, and the Biden administration came in and said, ‘That's infrastructure. We're not going to do that,” Banks said. 

The buoys are not a new concept to Banks. In January 2023, Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX) tapped the recently retired federal agent to oversee the state's border security operations as illegal border crossings surged during the Biden administration, and continued to spike through early 2024.

“When I left the Border Patrol and was appointed by Gov. Abbott to be the Texas border czar, we continued that project in Texas and started deploying those, and they did exactly what we thought they were going to do. They were a huge deterrent. They were almost impenetrable,” Banks said.

Although the Biden administration had killed the Border Patrol's plans for a buoy rollout, Texas was willing to finance the project in a border town that was the epicenter of illegal crossings in 2023. The state laid a 1,000-foot string of buoys between Eagle Pass and the Mexican city of Piedras Negras, Coahuila.

Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-TX) represents more than 800 miles of the border, including Eagle Pass. 

“Crossing the river is a deadly trek. Limited resources were diverted to dangerous rescue operations and, tragically, recovering bodies from the water,” Gonzales said in a statement. “Buoys are one more tool Border Patrol agents can use to deter illegal crossings, slow activity in the river, and prevent people from attempting to cross in the first place.”

However, the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee said taxpayer money should have been appropriated elsewhere.

“Obviously, the money for this vanity project would be better spent reducing healthcare premiums for Americans,” said Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-MS) in a statement.

Banks met with Trump in February 2024 when the presidential candidate visited Eagle Pass and spent time with Abbott's team. 

“[Trump] got to witness them firsthand,” Banks said. “He's been impressed with them. I tell you, one of the things that I'm most impressed with about our president is that he understands that the United States Border Patrol knows how to secure this border, and he listens to us, and he supports us.”

Trump, impressed with Banks as the Texas border czar, moved Banks into his administration as the head of Border Patrol in January.

Texas still legally owns the buoys in Eagle Pass, but Border Patrol plans to seamlessly link the new buoy to the existing mile-long strand in Eagle Pass, as well as steel wall projects on land, including several that Texas competed for during the Biden administration.

The federal government will eventually purchase Texas's portion.

A spokesman for Abbott told the Washington Examiner that the state has worked and will continue to work with the Trump White House on border security matters, such as this one.

“Texas finally has a partner in the White House, and Governor Abbott continues to work closely with the Trump administration to uphold our nation's immigration laws,” Abbott press secretary Andrew Mahaleris said in a statement. “The floating marine barriers deployed by Texas have been a resounding success, and Governor Abbott is proud to work with the Trump administration and Border Patrol to expand the program.”

Trump's first year of his second term has primarily focused on planning and the early stages of construction, with implementation expected to occur in 2026. 

“We're a little ahead of schedule, which I like,” Banks said, adding that if “[Trump is] happy, I'm happy.”

To date, more than 20 miles of steel wall have been installed in the ground since January. The Border Patrol is averaging two miles of wall installed per week, as of mid-December, and intends to increase this to 10 miles per week, according to Banks.

Banks said the item at the top of agents' wish lists is roads, due to the limited number of East-West roads along the border.

“All we need, and have proven time and time again to be effective where we have it, the most significant part, if you ask any Border Patrol agent, is being able to have that road that gives us that lateral access to rapidly deploy east and west along that border,” Banks said.

The forthcoming changes, Banks said, are already giving a boost to morale among Border Patrol's nearly 20,000 personnel.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Congress released a bipartisan report on Monday putting the U.S. Army at fault over the Jan. 29 mid-air collision of a civilian airliner and an Army Black Hawk helicopter.

Subcommittee on Military and Foreign Affairs Chairman William Timmons (R-SC) and ranking member Suhas Subramanyam (D-VA) released their report, “The DCA Incident: Assessing the Military's Role in the National Airspace Tragedy,” nearly 11 months after the crash. The report blamed a lack of communication between the Army and DCA and the neglect of several precautions on the fatal crash, several of which were the fault of the Army.

In a joint statement, Timmons and Subramanyam called for changes at the Army, saying the crash and investigation showed a need for vigilance.

“The tragic accident at DCA on January 29th and thirty near misses overall have revealed that the military's current operations fall woefully short of keeping both military personnel and American civilians safe in Washington, D.C. airspace. Several briefings on this issue have highlighted the pressing need for clearer military flight protocols, enhanced training, and regular audits of flight operations and capabilities within the DoD,” they said.

“It is crucial that military personnel are given the tools and training they need to navigate this complex airspace and prevent accidents and miscommunications like these from ever happening again,” the duo continued, adding that it was committed to the investigation and further oversight.

GOVERNMENT ADMITS FAULT IN REAGAN NATIONAL AIRPORT CRASH: ‘WHOLLY AVOIDABLE TRAGEDY'

Among the findings of the report was that the night vision goggles worn by the Black Hawk pilots obscured their vision, a key transponder in the Black Hawk was not broadcasting during the fateful flight, the Army's knowledge of DCA airspace is lacking, and that the DoD to DCA hotline was offline.

Earlier this month, the U.S. government admitted fault in the January crash. The Justice Department wrote that the United States “admits that it owed a duty of care to Plaintiffs, which it breached, thereby proximately causing the tragic accident on January 29, 2025.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Trump-class ships are about branding, not strategy.

Imagine the CEO of a car company telling his engineers and designers that he wants them to make a new line of automobiles. He knows nothing about cars and has no interest in how they're produced, but he knows one thing for certain: The line will be named after himself. Everyone claps—because of course they do—but no one really knows what comes next, except that the line needs to look sexy and sporty.

That's pretty much what the president did today when he announced that a new class of ship named after one Donald J. Trump would be added to the “Golden Fleet,” his name for a renewed U.S. Navy. (You might wonder about the propriety of a sitting president naming naval vessels, among other things, after himself. Pardon the expression, but that ship has sailed.)

Trump's press conference today was among his more haywire performances, and his slushy delivery and meandering answers will not halt speculation about his cognitive health. When asked for his endgame in the confrontation with Venezuela, for example, he launched into his usual lines about people being sent into the United States from prisons and mental hospitals, as if someone had hit the wrong button and played the wrong recording. He also reiterated that he wanted U.S. ships to be more attractive, noting that he would be involved in the design of the new vessels because “I am a very aesthetic person.”

(Apparently, no one has ever explained to him that sharp design does not equal military value. The B-52 bomber, the mainstay of the U.S. bomber force for decades, was affectionately called the BUFF by its crews. Big, ugly, fat … the rest you can figure out.)

Trump and Navy Secretary John Phelan did make some news today. (Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegeseth were also on hand, but they limited themselves to some standard-issue sycophancy.) First, we learned that the president of the United States clearly has no idea what battleships are. Second, the United States is going to invest in a new class of naval vessel. Third, America is going to reverse more than 30 years of wise policy by putting nuclear weapons back on U.S. Navy surface vessels.

Read: The pitiful childishness of Donald Trump

Trump announced that the new Trump-class ships will be “battleships,” but they seem to be supersize versions of the existing workhorse of the Navy, the Arleigh Burke–class destroyers; the first ship, called the Defiant, will be about three times the size of a Burke. The Navy has also announced the development of a new class of frigates. Destroyers and frigates, as the Navy knows (and as the commander in chief should know) are not battleships. Battleships are huge and powerful, and are meant to dish out —and withstand—serious punishment. Destroyers and frigates are less rugged, and perform missions that require more speed and agility than battleships can muster. But none of that matters: The goal, apparently, was to give a childlike president a new toy, named after himself, in exchange for gobs of money that the Navy will figure out how to spend later.

Indeed, defense investors cheered the announcement, but the spending will likely come much later, because the United States does not have the capacity to build vessels it hasn't even designed yet. Trump told a reporter today that he expects the first ship to arrive in two and a half years, which is possible if the Navy slaps some gold paint on a Burke class, adds some missiles, and then stencils USS TRUMP on the side. But the last time the Navy really tried to create a new kind of ship—the Zumwalt-class destroyer—the process took years and ended in failure.

The biggest news came today when Phelan said that the new Trump class will carry nuclear weapons. Why? Perhaps Phelan, who has no experience in, or with, the Navy, figured that Trump would want the new ships to have the biggest and best of everything. (Phelan did promise today that they would be the “best-looking” warships in the world.) But like everything else about this chaotic scheme, putting nuclear arms on destroyers or cruisers or “battleships” makes no sense in the 21st century—if it ever did.

During the Cold War, U.S. surface vessels carried all kinds of nuclear munitions for use against other ships, submarines, and land targets, because such was the logic of the Soviet-American standoff: World War III would be a final confrontation of two immense military forces, including nuclear duels at sea. In 1991, with the Soviet Union on its last legs, President George H. W. Bush ordered the removal of all such weapons from the surface fleet. Many Navy officers were relieved: I know from speaking with several at the time that they regarded nuclear weapons on their ships as a useless burden.

Today's Navy is not going to get into a nuclear showdown with the Soviet fleet. Nor, for that matter, is it likely to trade mushroom clouds at sea with the Chinese or Russian fleets. Carrying nuclear weapons on surface vessels—big, slow, exposed platforms—is not only strategically pointless but also a needless risk. George H. W. Bush and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, both defense hawks, knew this more than three decades ago.

As with all Trump vanity projects, no one seems to be asking what national purpose is served by these new plans. Does the Navy need new ships? What should it do with them if it gets them? Do they really need to be armed with nuclear weapons? The answer from the Trump administration, clearly, is: Who cares? As retired Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery told The Wall Street Journal, the Golden Fleet plan is “exactly what we don't need”—but, he added, no one is focused on America's maritime needs, because “they are focused on the president's visual that a battleship is a cool-looking ship.”

Read: This is what presidential panic looks like

Phelan might not know much about the Navy, but he knows Trump: He promised that the new Trump-class ships will inspire “awe and reverence” in any port they visit. But strategy is more than just giving lethal playthings to a president who has a simplistic understanding of ships. It is the art of making choices, an attempt to match means with ends. In a rational world, this would be the thinking driving the acquisition of weapons.

I taught military officers for more than two decades at the Naval War College. One thing I learned from conversations with my students was that the Navy really needs to invest more in its officers and sailors, and reduce the tempo of operations that are burning them out. The best ships in the world won't mean much if their crews are fatigued and poorly trained. As the defense analyst John Ferrari recently wrote, for years, the Navy has been “structurally compromised” because its people are exhausted, its ships are “aging faster than they could be repaired,” and the fleet's readiness is declining. These are serious problems that require serious work, but Trump has found a way around all of this irritating chatter by sticking his name on a new ship and telling the military to go build it.

At Mar-a-Lago today, Trump reiterated his demand that Greenland must become part of the United States. His plan for a fleet of Trump-branded battleships is only slightly more likely to happen than a victory parade in Nuuk—and neither is in the national interest of the United States.

The white-supremacist influencer cast a shadow over Turning Point USA's annual gathering.

When I rode the escalator into the lobby of the Phoenix Convention Center on Thursday, one of the first things I saw was a two-story-tall picture of Charlie Kirk with his arm reaching out to the sky. The late co-founder of Turning Point USA was an inescapable presence at AmericaFest, the organization's annual gathering. In the VIP area, a large screen played clips of Kirk on repeat. I watched people line up to get their picture taken next to a portrait of Kirk underneath a tent that read Prove Me Wrong on the front. It was a replica of the structure that Kirk toured the country with—and that he was sitting under when he was assassinated, in September.



AmericaFest has long been one of the biggest events on the right, but this year, the conference saw a record turnout of roughly 30,000. When I asked attendees why they had decided to come, they invariably told me that they were there “because of Charlie.” Many of the most prominent influencers and politicians in MAGA world spoke at the event, including Vice President J. D. Vance, Donald Trump Jr., and Steve Bannon. Almost all invoked his memory onstage. When Speaker of the House Mike Johnson spoke of erecting a statue of Kirk in the United States Capitol, the crowd broke out into “Charlie” chants. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton compared Kirk to Jesus.



But during my four days at AmericaFest, I noticed that something else was also casting a shadow over the conference. Everyone had come to unite around Kirk, but they kept fighting about Nick Fuentes. In the opening hours on the first night, Ben Shapiro took the stage and ripped into the prominent white-supremacist influencer. Fuentes, who did not attend the conference, is a “Hitler-apologist, Nazi-loving, anti-American piece of refuse,” Shapiro said. The crowd erupted in boos. At one point, I ran into the longtime GOP operative Roger Stone, who insisted that the debates over Fuentes and his staunch criticism of Israel were being inflated by the mainstream media. “I still haven't seen any polling showing that it's spilled over to voters,” he told me. The early MAGA influencer Mike Cernovich told me something similar: “If you ask most people here, ‘Do you think the war in Gaza is a genocide?,' I think most of us are like, ‘I don't really care,'” he said.

Read: I watched 12 hours of Nick Fuentes

Fuentes has tremendous sway over the young right, and his profile has risen to new heights since late October, when the former Fox News personality Tucker Carlson hosted him for a friendly podcast interview. Carlson “built Nick Fuentes up,” Shapiro said during his speech. “He ought to take responsibility for that.”



When Shapiro finished his speech, attendees lined up to ask him questions. Shapiro was immediately challenged by a student from Baylor University named Nicky Rudd. He asked about the USS Liberty, an American spy ship that the Israeli military accidentally sunk in 1967. Fuentes often talks about the incident on his nightly livestreams as part of his case against Israel and the Jewish people, peddling a conspiracy that the battleship was attacked on purpose. I tracked down Rudd after he finished questioning Shapiro. Rudd doesn't agree with everything Fuentes says, he told me. But, he said, “to deny the influence of Nick Fuentes is to deny what millions of Americans are thinking.”



Kirk had perhaps no greater antagonist than Fuentes. While Kirk debated college students and set up TPUSA chapters at campuses across the country, Fuentes built an army of young fans, whom he calls Groypers, by making extremely bigoted jokes. In 2019, during the “Groyper War,” Fuentes rallied his fans to confront Kirk and other establishment conservatives and ask them critical questions about Israel and other subjects. For years, Fuentes would continue to antagonize Kirk, claiming that he was influencing TPUSA from afar. “I took your baby, Turning Points USA, and I fucked it,” Fuentes bragged on a stream in August. (Fuentes declined to comment for this story.)



At AmericaFest, I kept running into young Fuentes fans. “Honestly, it's very controversial, but I love Nick Fuentes. I listen to him every day,” Vanessa Wright, a member of the TPUSA chapter at Utah Valley University, the college where Kirk was killed, told me. When I asked her about the demeaning things he's said about women (including that they “need to shut the fuck up”), she said that she appreciates his sense of humor. People take him too literally; he says things for “shock value,” she insisted.

Many Fuentes supporters I spoke with mentioned that they were especially interested in his steadfast criticism of Israel. After all, a majority of young Republicans now oppose aiding Israel. Although Fuentes's criticism of Israel is driven by gross anti-Semitism, he is one of the few prominent voices on the right who unequivocally criticizes the country. On Saturday, I ran into two college students from Florida who told me that they were Fuentes fans. (They wouldn't give me their names, citing the potential repercussions of being known as Fuentes supporters.) I had found them badgering people who were standing next to the booth for Generation Zion, an outreach and advocacy group for Jews and Christians who support Israel. The more talkative one, a man with blond hair nearly to his shoulders, said that he had been “watching Nick for a couple of years now.” The other said that he didn't like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but credited him as “one of the greatest leaders of our time.” He told me, “He's raping everybody. He's swinging his nuts everywhere.”



The conflict at AmericaFest over Fuentes and Israel, the blond-haired student said, is like a “Black funeral.” I asked him what he meant. “You know, like when a family member dies and all the family members go to the funeral, they just fight each other,” he said. I decided that it was time to go when one of their friends came up, wearing a wide-brimmed felt hat and a lapel pin with an American and a Confederate flag on it. “I've gotten a lot of compliments on it here!” he told me. He also wouldn't give me his name but said that he was a leader in Middle Tennessee State University's College Republicans chapter.

As I've previously written, the GOP's old guard has been late to recognize just how much influence Fuentes has over young swaths of the party. Even at AmericaFest, some denial still lingered. On a certain level, that instinct was correct. Many people seemed unconcerned with fights over right-wing policy and ideology. “I had no idea there was friction,” Daniel Fisher, an attendee in his 30s from Pennsylvania, told me about the fight over Fuentes. “I'm not too well aware of what's actually going on currently in the Republican political realm.” Many people seemed content to watch live versions of The Daily Wire and other conservative shows that were being taped in the main hall. When I spoke with the Turning Point USA spokesperson Andrew Kolvet this afternoon, he conceded that “there was family business being handled onstage.” He refused to talk directly about Fuentes and pointed me instead to a straw poll conducted by TPUSA. He emphasized that the results—AmericaFest attendees agree that Israel is the U.S.'s top ally—are evidence of unity within TPUSA.



But even the young people I spoke with who were opposed to Fuentes told me that he and his supporters are a serious problem for the future of the right. The Groypers have “taken over all of the TPUSA chapters in central California,” Adrian Ayub, a 28-year-old running for a spot in California's state assembly, told me. I tracked down leaders of several TPUSA chapters in California who were at AmericaFest, and they agreed that Fuentes is a problem. Dylan Frazin, the vice president of the Cal State Fullerton TPUSA, told me that he was a “free-market capitalist” and that he was sick of ascendant “National Socialists” on the right. “I know people that have direct ties to Nick Fuentes that have been showing up to Turning Point meetings at other chapters in the California area,” Frazin said.



Young anti-Fuentes attendees I spoke with also repeated the same sentiment about him to me: The Boomers don't get how much of a problem he is for the future of the right. “It's true the Groypers are here,” Dimas Guaico, a 29-year-old advocate with Generation Zion, told me. “I feel like a lot of the leadership here, including TPUSA leadership, haven't done enough to call Groypers out. Now I feel like it's too late.”





Even with its hundreds of chapters and get-out-the-vote efforts, TPUSA has always fundamentally been an online organization. Kirk was so successful in building TPUSA into a conservative juggernaut in part because he was better at marshaling the internet than other establishment groups were. His famous “Prove Me Wrong” events at colleges, for example, were perhaps more about producing viral clips for the internet than they were about showing up at any specific college. But the same dynamic now also helps illustrate why TPUSA is beset by infighting. To generate relevancy and influence, social-media algorithms demand spectacle, conflict, and edginess. Fuentes is a master of all three. He doesn't have the money or resources TPUSA does, but you don't need those things to go viral or to win hearts and minds online. And he didn't need to physically be at AmericaFest 2025 to be inside everyone's heads.

The vice president welcomes anti-Semites into the Republican coalition.

On Sunday, J. D. Vance was presented with the simplest moral test: denounce commentators who traffic in medieval blood libels, who deny the Holocaust, and who endlessly harp on evil Jewish cabals.

The test was forced on the vice president. By the time he addressed the Turning Point USA conference this past weekend, it had turned into a referendum on latter-day Father Coughlins who have acquired substantial and growing audiences on the right. Among them is Candace Owens, whose YouTube channel has 5.7 million followers. She argues that there is a powerful, secret sect within Judaism practicing pedophilia. Meanwhile, Tucker Carlson, who has 16.8 million followers on X, has shared his microphone with an unabashed fan of Adolf Hitler and with historians who minimize the Nazi dictator's evil.

Yair Rosenberg: What J. D. Vance—and many others—miss about American anti-Semitism

Their noxious theories about Jews became the defining question of the Turning Point confab. The podcaster Ben Shapiro denounced the anti-Semites. That prompted Steve Bannon, the former adviser to President Donald Trump, to cast Shapiro as a “cancer.” By conducting their argument in public, the two sides—those who criticize anti-Semitism and those who tolerate it—were essentially begging Vance, the headliner of the event, to render a verdict.

When presented with the simplest moral test, Vance failed. “We have far more important work to do than canceling each other,” he said, as if anti-Semitism were just one more woke fixation.

Strains of anti-Semitism have long festered on the American right. But in the second half of the 20th century, leaders of the Republican Party and the intellectual guardians of the conservative movement attempted to keep bigotry out of the mainstream. That's one reason William F. Buckley Jr. used his magazine, National Review, to foil the rise of the John Birch Society in the 1960s; it's why the GOP establishment rallied to stop Pat Buchanan's 1992 presidential campaign—and instructed elected officials to denounce the neo-Nazi David Duke. Even in Trump's first term as president, the party eventually stripped the Iowa congressman Steve King of his committee assignments after he defended the terms white nationalist and white supremacist. This wasn't an unblemished record of containing far-right views, but it was an effective one.

Read: The talented Mr. Vance

Trump has always struggled to denounce anti-Semitism, whether asked to comment on Kanye West or the tiki-torch carriers in Charlottesville. But that always seemed a product of his vanity; he couldn't stand to speak ill of acolytes. Vance's refusal or inability to denounce anti-Semitism is more craven—and therefore more disturbing. He's clearly made the calculation that anti-Semites are part of the Republican Party's base, and he can't afford to shunt them to the side as he plots his own presidential bid. So he's welcomed them into the mainstream of the coalition.

Not that long ago, the right dabbled in imagery that reeked of anti-Semitism but refrained from fully indulging it. Populists such as Bannon railed against “globalists” and cast the financier George Soros, who is Jewish, as the shadowy force behind the demise of white Christian civilization. This was vile stuff, but it was also coded—and it gave Republican politicians and commentators, at least those who would rather avoid anti-Semitism, enough latitude to ignore or dismiss it.

But hatred for Israel is now firmly planted on both sides of the political spectrum, and it has provided the anti-Semites on the right with cover to recycle dark theories about the Jews. Angry rants about Israel have curdled into broad conspiracies about powerful cabals that control American life—and theories about the maladies of the Jewish religion.

Through heavy-handed intimation, Owens and Carlson have blamed Israel for the murder of the Turning Point leader Charlie Kirk. According to this delusional version of events, Kirk upset Jewish donors with his questions about Israel's conduct of its war in Gaza. To tamp down his powerful voice, people “sitting around eating hummus,” in Carlson's telling, ordered his assassination. In this story, all of the classical hallmarks of anti-Semitism converge: big-money bankers with dual loyalties to a bloodthirsty state, making a martyr of a Christian saint.

Yair Rosenberg: ‘The more I'm around young people, the more panicked I am'

The fervor with which Owens pursues this theory doesn't just indicate a febrile mind. It likely suggests that she's struck algorithmic gold. As she has taken her anti-Semitic turn, her audience has grown, which suggests that it likes what it is hearing, so she keeps feeding it, transforming an ancient hatred into start-up success.

Over the past few months, arguments that would have once been roundly denounced have found traction within the movement. Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts backed Tucker Carlson after he hosted the unabashed anti-Semite Nick Fuentes on his podcast; Roberts attacked Carlson's critics as a “venomous coalition.” (Ultimately, he apologized for a video he released supporting Carlson.) Megyn Kelly, once the face of Fox News, has resolutely refused to say a negative word about Owens and Carlson. At the Turning Point conference, she accused Shapiro of trying to “excommunicate” heretics. This is the way the culture operates: Ideas travel from the fringe to the acceptable because gatekeepers give their winking assent to views they lack the courage to espouse themselves.

A dark chapter of American history is repeating itself. In the late 1930s, Father Charles Coughlin, a Catholic priest from Michigan, used his radio broadcasts to blame Jews for the plight of the American worker. His sermons inspired organized gangs that roamed the New York City subways shouting “Kill the kikes” at elderly Jews and barged into synagogue services in Washington Heights.

By failing to denounce anti-Semitism, Vance has emboldened its adherents to flaunt their prejudices more openly, to dehumanize Jews with greater abandon. He told the Turning Point audience that he doesn't want to “impose any purity tests” when, in reality, he was granting license to those who celebrate the most murderous purity test of all time.

And what she got wrong

On Sunday, CBS's flagship newsmagazine, 60 Minutes, opened as usual with the tick-tick-tick of its title sequence, a sound with Pavlovian resonance for millions of Boomers who have watched the show for most of their adult lives. This time the tick-tick-tick might as well have been a time bomb. Hours before the show aired, CBS News editor in chief Bari Weiss pulled a story about the Trump administration's deportation of hundreds of immigrants to CECOT, a notoriously harsh prison in El Salvador. CBS News correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi, who reported the story, said Weiss's decision was “political” rather than “editorial,” and that Weiss was trying to “shield an administration” from critique. “We are trading 50 years of ‘Gold Standard' reputation for a single week of political quiet,” Alfonsi wrote in a memo to colleagues, before declaring that she would fight to maintain 60 Minutes' good name.

The segment leaked anyway, thanks to Global TV, which carries 60 Minutes in Canada and apparently failed to remove the segment from its streaming line-up. I have now watched it and have read the dueling memos written by Alfonsi and, earlier, Weiss about the segment. Global TV may have been merely careless in letting the segment out, but since they are Canadian, I would not rule out treachery, and an effort to make Americans and their media look silly, no matter their political views.

The segment itself did not leave me salivating for more 60 Minutes reporting. It relied heavily on the testimony of a single Venezuelan deportee, Luis Muñoz Pinto, who described beatings, blood, vomit, pummeling of the genitals, and promises from Salvadoran prison officials that he would die there. These claims align with previous inmate accounts. The deportee is now in Colombia, and his story is buttressed by interviews with researchers and activists. The most dramatic and repulsive footage is from inside CECOT itself. The prisoners are shaved, given white pajamas, and warehoused in enormous rooms. They look like they have not seen daylight for a long time. Their pale faces peering through the bars resemble those of the expendable War Boys from Mad Max: Fury Road.

The problem with the segment is that many of the images it uses were released in March, not by some intrepid human-rights investigator but by El Salvador and by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, after her visit to CECOT. The previous reports came from Human Rights Watch and The New York Times, among others, and as Weiss complains in her memo, 60 Minutes will fail to “advance” the story of these “horrible conditions” if it simply repeats allegations already made, or indeed shows footage released with diabolical pride by the administration itself.

Weiss's main demand was that the segment's producers try harder to get administration officials on camera to explain why sending random tattooed Latinos to a gulag is in America's interest. The administration had ignored Alfonsi and her team's requests. Weiss suggested contacting Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller or border czar Tom Homan, both known talkers, and sent their phone numbers. She even suggested how Alfonsi might set the interview up, by bringing up all the blood and beatings and puke and asking Miller and Homan whether they feel even a tinge of remorse for having overseen this program.

“Their refusal to be interviewed is a tactical maneuver designed to kill the story,” Alfonsi wrote in her memo. “We have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch' for any reporting they find inconvenient.” Handing Miller anything that could be described as a “kill switch” sounds very bad. But in the memo, Weiss merely proposed to hand him a microphone, and get him to defend the “torture” that CBS's reporting had “revealed.” The memo does not say the segment should never run. It says that it needs more confrontation and drama, which is to say more of what Weiss was brought in to CBS three months ago to provide.

“Putting those accounts into the public record is valuable in and of itself,” Weiss wrote in her memo, with what I think was insincere praise. No one turns on CBS, or any other channel, to read or watch “the public record.” They turn it on to see anger, hatred, uncertainty, and conflict. For as long as 60 Minutes has existed, it has relied on these elements just as surely as the National Football League games that preceded it relied on some doubt over which team would win. In fact the tense but contrived interview with an administration official would have, in past seasons, been the very stuff of 60 Minutes' popularity. It would have furnished CBS clips of (say) Steve Kroft, narrowing his eyes and asking grave questions of a powerful man, in close-up and with a glistening scalp.

Weiss's intervention in the story was dramatic in its own bad way. Her underlings at CBS have all-but-openly denigrated her, and however reasonable her memo might have been, it evidently caused many of her employees to infer sinister motives. And 60 Minutes is, among news programs, one of the most patiently and slowly reported, so for a segment to undergo enormous changes at the last minute must feel unpleasant and invasive. CBS veteran Scott Pelley reportedly scolded Weiss for not giving her editorial advice earlier, after one of the several previous cuts of the segment. “It's not a part-time job,” Pelley said, according to The New York Times. Staffers are not used to having segments delayed in the final hours, least of all by a 41-year-old upstart richer and more successful than they are. Bosses need to know when their edits are unwelcome, and when their takeovers feel hostile. Weiss's drama-detector, so refined when seeking out news stories, seems to have failed her when avoiding it in her own newsroom.

The Court's overall docket is shrinking, even as it hears more and more cases dealing with Republican cultural grievances.

The Supreme Court for much of the last several decades has been a fairly technocratic body.

The Court, to be sure, has handed down its share of historic cases: Case names like Brown v. Board of Education (1954) and Roe v. Wade (1973) are familiar to most Americans, but such highly political and culturally salient cases have historically made up only a small percentage of the Court's work.

We live in a different world today. In its 2024-25 term alone, the Court is expected to gut what little remains of the Voting Rights Act, to legalize anti-LGBTQ “conversion therapy” in all 50 states, to permit states to bar transgender athletes from school sports, to give President Donald Trump near-total control over “independent agencies” that Congress insulated from the president, to expand gun rights, to decide whether Trump can unilaterally strip Americans of their citizenship, and to determine the fate of Trump's multitrillion-dollar tariffs.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

One way that the Court has changed is that the current panel of nine justices appears to be fixated on culture war issues such as religion, guns, LGBTQ issues, and abortion. Though these four issues do not exhaust the many cultural divides that drive much of US politics, they capture many of the Republican Party's current cultural grievances. And the current Court, which has a 6-3 Republican majority, now hears more than twice as many cases touching on these four issues than it did during, say, the Obama presidency.

During those eight years under President Barack Obama, the Court heard a dozen cases that focused on those issues. By contrast, in the five Supreme Court terms that began with Republicans controlling six votes on the Court (2021-present), it has heard 18 cases that focus on these issues. That works out to 3.6 cases per Supreme Court term, compared to 1.5 under Obama.

This is true even as the number of cases heard by the justices has been in steady decline since the 1980s. When Chief Justice John Roberts was a young attorney in the Reagan White House, he once quipped that it is reassuring that “the court can only hear roughly 150 cases each term.” But the Court hasn't heard anywhere near that number for years. In its 2024-25 term the Supreme Court decided just 62 cases that received full briefing and an oral argument.



So the justices are hearing more and more politically charged cases, even as their overall workload declines.

The Court's growing interest in cultural politics won't surprise anyone who has paid close attention to the Court. In the last few years, the Court's Republican majority appears to have been going down a checklist — identifying 20th-century precedents that are out of favor within the GOP, and overruling those decisions. This is the period when the Court abolished the constitutional right to an abortion, banned affirmative action on nearly all college campuses, and gave itself a veto power over the executive branch's policy decisions, among other things.

The shifting docket reveals a Court that sees — and is seizing — many opportunities to reverse, or at least reconsider, some of liberals' biggest cultural wins.

To assess just how the Court's attention has shifted, I looked at two separate periods.

I examined all eight of the Supreme Court terms that began while Obama was president, meaning the term that began in October of 2009 through the term that began in October of 2016. I also examined the 2021-22 through 2025-26 terms — the five full terms after Justice Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation in 2020.

Overall, I identified a dozen “culture war” cases that the Court decided during the Obama terms, and 18 that the Court decided (or will decide) in the five most recent terms. You can see the cases I identified in this spreadsheet.

I looked at cases concerning four issues — abortion, guns, LGBTQ rights, and religion. Here is how I defined those four categories:

One consequence of these definitions is that some high-profile cases are excluded. I did not code Snyder v. Phelps (2011) as either an LGBTQ case or a religion case, for example, even though that case concerned a church group that held up signs with anti-gay slurs outside a military funeral. The reason is that the legal question in Snyder neither involved the Constitution's religion clauses, nor did it involve the substantive rights of LGBTQ people. Instead, it was a free speech case and the Court almost certainly would have reached the same result if this church group had held up equally offensive signs that did not target gay people.

Similarly, I did not include Garland v. Cargill (2024), a statutory guns case that legalized “bump stocks,” devices that can convert a semiautomatic rifle into an automatic weapon, because that case did not raise a constitutional question.

In coming up with these lists of cases, I made several judgment calls. Although Justice Barrett was confirmed in late October 2020, for example, I did not look at the 2020-21 term because the Court typically decides which cases it will hear months in advance, so Barrett played no role in choosing many of the cases that the Court heard in that term. I wanted to compare the mix of cases the Court took before Trump made any changes in its membership to the mix of cases it took after all three of the justices he appointed joined the Court.

I also only included cases that received full briefing and oral argument, and excluded cases handed down on the Court's “shadow docket,” a mix of emergency motions and other matters the Court decides on an expedited basis and often without explaining its decision. (Had I included shadow docket cases, the numbers would show that the current justices are even more interested in weighing in on cultural grievances than their Obama-era counterparts, as the Court started deciding significantly more cases on its shadow docket under Trump.)

The cases I included all fit into at least one of four categories: abortion, guns, LGBTQ rights, or religion. If you want to know how I define these four categories, I explain it in a sidebar to this essay.

Although the Supreme Court now hears religion cases more often than it did under Obama — a trend that is even more pronounced if you include shadow docket cases — religion has always been an important part of many Americans' identity. So the Court has heard a steady diet of religion cases for quite some time.

Eight of the 12 culture war-related cases I identified from the eight Supreme Court terms that began under Obama are religion cases. So, even under Obama, the Court was hearing about one religion case each term, including very significant and politically contentious cases like Burwell v. Hobby Lobby (2014), which held that employers with religious objections to birth control may refuse to include contraception coverage in their employees' health plans.

By contrast, prior to Barrett's confirmation it was a fairly monumental event when the Supreme Court announced it would hear an abortion case. The Court decided only one such case, Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt (2016), during all eight years of the Obama presidency.

Since Republicans gained a supermajority on the Court, by contrast, they've handed down three abortion decisions: Whole Woman's Health v. Jackson (2021), Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization (2022), and Medina v. Planned Parenthood (2025). In each case, the Court ruled against the pro-abortion rights side.

Similarly, the Court decided only one Second Amendment case under Obama, McDonald v. Chicago (2010). Indeed, the Court used to hear Second Amendment cases so infrequently that Justice Clarence Thomas complained in a 2018 dissenting opinion about his Court's “continued inaction” on the right to own a gun.

By contrast, the Court's current majority has decided two such cases, and it plans to hear two more in its current term.

It's likely that the most important factor driving the Court's new focus is that the justices typically get to choose which cases they hear, and so justices in the majority can simply pick cases that advance their political and policy goals.

Republicans have campaigned against Roe v. Wade for decades; it makes sense that the Court took up Dobbs, the case that overruled Roe, less than a year after Republicans gained a supermajority on the Court.

Another factor is, as the Court's rightward majority becomes more secure, justices in that majority risk much less when they take up a contentious case. For many years, the Court was split between four anti-abortion justices, four who supported abortion rights, and Justice Anthony Kennedy, who voted to uphold many abortion restrictions but who also refused to overrule Roe. So it's likely that the eight justices with firm views on the right to terminate a pregnancy avoided abortion cases because they could never be sure if Kennedy would vote against them.

Now, by contrast, the six Republicans often vote as a bloc. And when one of them does dissent from their fellow Republicans, it is often on narrow grounds. In Dobbs, for example, Chief Justice John Roberts did not vote to overrule Roe, but he did vote to restrict abortion rights and his opinion largely argued that the Court should have taken a more incremental approach to dismantling Roe.

Another likely reason why the Court is hearing so many cases that focus on Republican cultural grievances is that both litigants and state lawmakers typically shift their behavior when they perceive the Court moving left or right. A 6-3 Republican Court means that anti-abortion laws that would have been blocked by judges just a few years ago will instead take full effect. And it also means that conservative causes that were laughed out of court for many decades can now prevail.

Federal courts, for example, have historically rejected claims by parents who seek to alter a public school's lessons or curriculum because they object to it on religious grounds — largely due to concerns that it would be impossible for a school to tailor its lessons to align with the religious views of every single parent. Last term, however, in Mahmoud v. Taylor (2025), the Republican justices held that public schools must give parents advance notice of lessons that offend their religious beliefs, along with an opportunity to opt their child out of the lesson.

A final factor that contributes to the Court's new fixation on culture war issues is that the Supreme Court often has to hand down decisions clarifying a new legal rule in the years after that rule is announced. This is especially true if the new rule is confusing or otherwise likely to spark disagreement among lower courts.

The justices in the Supreme Court's current majority are, to put it mildly, less skilled at judicial craftsmanship than previous generations of justices. One example: The Republican justices' decision in Bruen — which lays out their approach to Second Amendment cases — is so confounding that at least a dozen judges from both political parties have published opinions complaining that they cannot figure out how to apply it.

Bruen requires judges to ask if a modern-day gun law is “relevantly similar” to a gun regulation that existed centuries ago, and to strike down the modern-day law if it is not. But the justices who support Bruen have struggled to articulate just how similar the two laws must be, and lower court judges frequently disagree on how to apply Bruen to a particular case. That means that the Supreme Court will have to spend an unusual amount of its time resolving these disputes until Bruen is scrapped for a more workable standard.

All of which is a long way of saying that the Court's new interest in cultural grievances was easy to predict after Barrett's confirmation.

It is reasonably likely that, if Republicans maintain firm control of the Supreme Court in the future, that the Court's fixation on cultural issues will end. Given enough time in power, Republican justices are likely to exhaust the list of precedents they wish to overrule and clarify many issues that currently confuse lower court judges. So culture war politics may fade from the Court's docket as Republicans entrench their victories on these issues.

But, for the moment, at least, the six Republican justices appear quite eager to put their mark on US cultural politics. And they don't appear likely to back away from these cultural grievances any time soon.

The global debt crisis works like your credit card — but much, much worse.

Like many Americans, most countries are in a lot of debt.

Developing countries, alone, carry nearly $31 trillion worth of debt. Enough debt to give everyone in the world a check for $3,750. Or to pay for Jeff Bezos to throw a $50 million wedding in Venice every weekend for the next 11,900 years. Or, at least in theory, to solve world hunger with trillions to spare.

But instead, many countries across Africa, Asia, and Latin America are saddled with so much debt that today more than 3 billion people — over one-third of humankind — live in nations that spend more on interest payments than they do on health care or education. This is nothing new. But it's gotten far worse in recent years as part of a vicious cycle that will be all too familiar to most Americans who've ever fallen behind on a credit card bill or a student loan payment.

You take out a new credit card to pretend you can pay the old one. No matter how much you pay off each month, somehow the amount you owe seems to grow larger each year. And if a disaster strikes at the absolute worst possible moment — be it a hurricane or a medical emergency — then forget it.

For poor countries, as with people, debt twists into a financial hole with no end in sight.

“It's like the Hotel California,” said Penelope Hawkins, senior economic affairs officer at the United Nations focusing on debt and development finance. “You can check out any time you want, but you can never leave.”

And when the crisis gets deep enough, indebted countries stop building hospitals, just like deeply indebted Americans forgo health care and trips to the dentist. The nations defund their schools. Their economies slow. And their credit rating tanks, meaning that any future loans will be even more expensive.

“These aren't just statistics,” said Joel Curtain, director of advocacy at Partners in Health, which has been pushing for reform to the system for resolving runaway debt. “This crisis is embodied in sickness, ill health, and death.”

To understand a pernicious piece of how this all works, look no further than the handful of Manhattan hedge funds that effectively control the financial fate of some entire countries — just like they may control your mortgage and your own highly profitable credit card debt.

The terms of most countries' debt contracts — also known as sovereign bonds — are not handled by some international body or within the debtor country, but rather, are split between the jurisdiction of judges in the two largest financial hubs in the world, New York and London. After all, that's where the money is.

And thousands of miles away, it is ordinary people who face the hidden but profound consequences of that debt deal gone wrong. They are the ones who will hurt the most when the government cuts kick in, when the price of bread doubles, their kids' classrooms size balloons, and the hospitals go dark.

But as poor countries face down a broader shortage of funding for critical development projects driven by sweeping foreign aid cuts, some activists see a real opening for relief.

Starting on Wall Street.

There is nothing inherently wrong with having some debt.

It costs money to get ahead. If you want a well-paying job, you probably have to go to college. And if you don't have family who can cover the bill, then you probably need to take out loans.

The same is true for countries. If you want to grow your economy, you've got to build schools, staff hospitals, and invest in infrastructure. And if your country is not wealthy to begin with — if you got the short end of colonialism's stick — then the only way to pay for that is to take out loans.

“No country has grown without some debt,” Hawkins said. “No country has developed without debt.”

Vietnam, for example, was once one of the poorest countries in the world. But a series of economic reforms in the late ‘80s — accompanied by $26 billion in World Bank loans since 1993 — literally catapulted the country into the global middle class, nearly eradicating extreme poverty in the process.

The problem is, the loans that poor countries take out these days have become so expensive — and the growth they're supposed to fuel is often so sluggish — that they can never pay them back. The interest adds up before the returns come in.

And yikes, has that bill added up over the years.

Developing countries have seen their total debt balloon by almost 160 percent over the past decade. More than 60 of those countries now spend more than 10 percent of their government revenues on interest payments.

Since you're a responsible news-consuming citizen, this is the moment when you might be wondering: Doesn't the US owe gazillions of dollars to its creditors, too?

Yes, in fact, it absolutely does.

While Americans say they care about the debt, they don't vote like they do, though they probably should! But they don't, largely because a rich country like the United States gets to borrow in its own currency and it can almost always take out more cheap loans to pay off the old ones.

This means that the national debt rarely affects the lives of ordinary Americans. The US does not need to cut Social Security or stop paying for road maintenance to indefinitely manage its debt. Not yet, at least.

But poorer countries lack that luxury.

Just like low-income Americans often contend with backbreaking interest rates if they want to borrow cash, so too do low-income countries. African nations pay an average of 10 percent interest on their loans, whereas interest rates for rich countries like the US are typically under 3 percent.

And this is where we get to Wall Street. Because private creditors like hedge funds and insurance companies increasingly hold the bulk — about 60 percent in 2023 — of low- and middle-income countries' external debt, a trend that has been rising since 2010.

That wasn't always the case. For much of the 20th century, when a developing country needed finance, it usually turned to the Paris Club, an informal grouping of Western creditor countries, or newly formed Western-controlled multilateral institutions like the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, while working more sporadically with private creditors like banks.

But in the early 2000s, the Paris Club pulled back on lending after a protest campaign endorsed by Bono and the Vatican caused it to forgive billions of dollars in poor countries' debt. Then, boom — the Great Recession hit and interest rates plummeted, forcing private creditors to start looking for a new way to earn cash.

They found it in poor countries, where they could charge much higher interest rates than they could in rich countries. In fact, bonds became so unprofitable in places like Germany that they entered negative territory a few years after the financial crisis, whereas interest rates across Africa hovered above 5 percent. The modern sovereign debt business was born. And these private companies made a killing on those high-interest loans.

“It's good business to lend,” said Martín Guzmán, an economist and former economy minister of Argentina. “Almost too good of a business.”

Few countries know that as well as Argentina does. After years of debt drama, a slew of neoliberal reforms compelled by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and a debilitating economic crisis, the country stopped paying off its $100 billion debt on Christmas Eve 2001.

It was the second-largest sovereign debt default in history, one that sent its creditors — from Wall Street barons to pension funds — into a tailspin. Fear of exactly this worst-case scenario illustrates why loans are so expensive for low- and middle-income countries: The higher the risk, the higher the interest rates demanded by lenders. In Argentina's case, chronic overspending and cycles of inflation have made borrowing especially expensive.

Almost nobody benefits when a country defaults. Lenders have to take a haircut on their loans, while the debtor country has to make painful cuts and becomes a sort of pariah in the global financial world. But there are exceptions.

Most creditors eventually accepted new discounted terms to Argentina's debt, but others, hoping to make a quick buck and wash their hands of the crisis, sold off their Argentine bonds — or loan contracts — for pennies to the dollar to vulture funds, investors that specialize in hounding debtors for what they're owed.

You can imagine what came next. The vultures who bought up Argentina's loans pounced, the most notorious of them being the hedge fund Elliott Management. Elliott sued the bejeezus out of Argentina for nonpayment, even seizing an Argentine naval ship ported in Ghana in an attempt to recoup the loans in 2012.

Creditors who lend to poor and middle-income countries “want to charge high interest rates, but they also demand to be repaid in full when risks happen,” said Tim Jones, policy director of the longstanding advocacy group Debt Justice. “They want to have their cake and eat it too.”

In the end, Elliott won. After a 15-year battle in New York state court — since about half of all sovereign debt is litigated on Wall Street's turf — Elliott managed to score a highly profitable $2.4 billion settlement, a 392 percent return on the original value of the bonds, but since Eliott paid very little for those bonds, the company earned a profit of 10 to 15 times what it initially paid.

At the time, Elliott's CEO, Paul Singer, blamed Argentina for its own “sad path” to financial crisis as a “once very impactful country economically” coming out of World War II. “They are imposing damage on themselves way out of proportion to the cost of paying the debt,” he said.

It's true that Argentina was in part a victim of its own mistakes. But it's also true that Argentina, which was once one of the wealthiest countries in the world, has never fully recovered. And it was ordinary Argentinians, not those who were making the decisions, who paid the price.

There is no shortage of reasons that poor and middle-income countries fail to pay off their loans, including the most obvious: overspending.

When the southern African country of Zambia defaulted on its debt in 2020, the IMF and other analysts blamed it on years of unsustainable borrowing, corruption, and poorly targeted infrastructure projects underwritten mostly by private creditors and, increasingly, China. There were also factors mostly outside of Zambia's control, like a drought the year prior that strained the country's finances to its breaking point, and an extractive economy based around copper mining that developed under colonialism that forces the country to take out more loans when the price of the commodity drops..

“There is a school of thought that whenever a country is in default, it is all the fault of the lenders, and that is usually not the case,” said Gregory Makoff, a self-professed sovereign debt obsessive, author of Default: The Landmark Court Battle Over Argentina's $100 Billion Debt Restructuring, and a fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation.

As a result, 3.4 billion people now live in the 46 developing countries that spend more — $921 billion in 2024, a 10 percent increase from 2023 — on interest payments alone than they do on health or education, according to the United Nations.

“It is usually the fault of the borrower,” he said, because the borrower is the one who makes the decision to take out a loan, the one who “uses the funds and has to take responsibility for itself.”

But for every handful of nations that stop paying their loans, dozens dutifully take out new loans to pay off their old ones each year.

One reason that debt burdens are so high today is the Covid-19 pandemic, which forced many countries to take out additional loans to keep their economies and healthcare systems afloat.

Another is interest rates. Remember when the Federal Reserve hiked the price of borrowing to try to quell inflation in the US? That didn't just impact your mortgage rates — it made borrowing that much more expensive for poor countries too.

Add in the war in Ukraine, which drove up energy and food prices globally, and increasingly frequent climate disasters that force countries to borrow even more just to rebuild, and you've got a recipe for the worst sovereign debt crisis in decades.

But even as countries' debt balloons, defaults like Argentina's are relatively rare these days, largely because nobody wants to be chased by a vulture fund or find themselves locked out of global financial markets. Instead, many countries are digging deep into whatever savings or spending cuts they can muster to pay off those loans.

“Countries are not defaulting on debts,” Guzmán said. “But they're defaulting on development.”

Developing countries spent $741 billion more on paying back their loans than they received in new finance between 2022 and 2024, the largest gap in 50 years. But despite these payments, their debt has just grown larger, rising at twice the rate of rich countries.

If you're an austerity hawk, that might sound like a good thing.

These kinds of cuts are compelled by the IMF not because that institution is mean-spirited, but because it's a way to bring countries closer to eventually paying off their loans and finding a stronger financial footing in the long term.

If your uncle is “drunk and always is running up his credit card and running personal bankruptcy, are you going to blame his credit card lenders and his mortgage provider for his problems?” Makoff asked. “Or maybe he made some bad decisions.”

At the end of the day, the IMF is brought in to “do math” for countries that have “generally made a lot of bad decisions,” said Makoff. “They make sure the money [that comes] in and out adds up” and do their best to avoid catastrophic social spending cuts in the process.

But for billions of people around the world, this kind of fiscal responsibility can also mean hospitals that don't get built. Schools that don't get textbooks. Roads that don't get paved.

Every dollar of interest lining the pockets of Wall Street's Bonobos pants and fleece-lined vests is a dollar less for development.

“Western governments tend to only see it as a crisis when people stop paying,” Jones said, but “the real crisis is the fact that they are paying and the cost that's happening through cuts” to service these debts, which he described as “catastrophic for the future.”

And this is more or less by design. For decades, the US-dominated IMF has required countries looking to restructure their debt to impose cuts to social services.

So Malawi's government has taken out loans. A lot of loans, many of which carry very high interest rates, because lenders don't trust that the impoverished country will be able to pay them back. Over the past several years, Malawi's total public debt has soared to above 80 percent of its GDP or around $12 billion, up from 35.5 percent of GDP — under $3.2 billion — a decade ago.

Take Malawi, for example. The landlocked southeast African country, the world's third poorest per capita, is in the midst of the worst economic crisis in its history. Since 2019, it has faced back-to-back climate disasters, including the region's worst drought in a century, which has plunged over half of Malawians — most of whom are subsistence farmers — into profound food insecurity.

Long story short, if you want to understand the dystopian and often surreal reality of global debt financing, look at Malawi's budget for the coming fiscal year. The country will spend just over $440 million — $20 per person — on health care. It will spend just over $770 million on education.

And it will spend over $1.25 billion, more than what it spends on health and education combined, on interest payments. Again, these are just interest payments, which go straight into the pockets of commercial banks and foreign investors who own them.

Given that 75 percent of Malawians live on less than $3 per day, the government can hardly rely on tax revenue, so it will need to borrow even more money to make those payments on time.

And so the cycle continues, and ordinary Malawians suffer the most.

“We don't have enough doctors. We don't have enough nurses,” said Makhumbo Munthali, director of partnerships at Partners in Health's office in Malawi. In Malawi, he said, a generation of trained local health professionals can't get jobs because the “government is trying to meet austerity measures” imposed by the IMF. Most end up moving abroad for work, leaving the country with just two physicians for every 100,000 people.

“The IMF has been saying that there will be some sort of pain for a while and then later on things will stabilize,” he said. “But that has not been the case.”

Malawi is far from alone. Almost half of low-income countries are now in or at high risk of debt distress, meaning they're struggling to pay their loans.

To make matters more complicated, sweeping foreign aid cuts have left many countries scrambling to fill funding gaps this year. Many poor countries normally rely on foreign donors — chief among them, the United States — to subsidize the majority of health and education programs in their country. The United States previously subsidized at least half of all annual health spending in Afghanistan, Somalia, South Sudan, and Malawi. Countries like Nigeria have already begun taking out new loans to keep their health systems afloat.

And so far, it appears that Trump's new foreign policy prerogative will mean that when the US does choose to fund development, it will increasingly be in the form of loans, rather than grants. China, an increasingly important lender for poor countries — especially in Africa — also conducts much of its foreign aid this way, and has also faced its own criticism for leading nations into debt spirals.

One of Trump's first actions upon taking office was to stop all US funding to a program that helped vulnerable countries prepare and adapt to climate change. Many of those countries have no choice but to regularly take out enormous new loans in the aftermath of every new disaster, like Hurricane Melissa in Jamaica. It's a burden that seems to grow every year.

These countries “are piling on debt not to build infrastructure, not to grow, not to develop like other countries,” said Ritu Bharadwaj, a climate finance and resilience expert at the International Institute for Environment and Development, but simply “to rebuild and bring the economy back on track” when disaster strikes.

Sri Lanka, for example, was recently forced to ask the IMF for a multimillion-dollar loan to fuel its recovery in the aftermath of Cyclone Ditwah last month, even as the country continues to recover after defaulting on its loans in 2022.

At the time, Sri Lanka's debt crisis forced schools to cancel exams because they ran out of paper. Hospitals canceled surgeries because they ran out of medication. Fuel shortages forced doctors to stitch wounds in the dark and food prices rose by 90 percent, leaving over a quarter of people food insecure.

But if there is one silver lining to the aid cuts, it is that countries struggling widely with debt burdens have gained a powerful new moral argument for changing the system.

If wealthy countries are unwilling to help subsidize what it costs for poor countries to adapt to climate change, Bharadwaj said, then “we really need to at least provide them a fair chance to do it themselves,” because most developing countries spend far more on interest payments than they've ever received in foreign aid.

Even some private creditors are calling for change. At recent meetings with bondholders, UNCTAD's Hawkins said, some acknowledged that pushing countries to keep paying unsustainable debts ultimately hurts everyone — including creditors who want borrowers to stay solvent enough to keep doing business.

For some activists, the solution starts on Wall Street. Over the past few years, organizers in the financial hubs of New York and London have been exploring changes to local law that could shield vulnerable countries from the most egregious debt litigation.

We're talking about Elliott Management in Argentina. Or more recently, an entity called Hamilton Reserve Bank, which has refused to agree to a debt restructuring plan for Sri Lanka, instead suing the country for $250 million in a lawsuit still ongoing in New York.

The proposed New York state law would offer countries a framework for obtaining relief and restructuring their debt, with provisions against private creditors that attempt to hold out on a deal. Amid a concerted lobbying effort from Wall Street firms, the deal failed to move forward this year, but will be coming up for a vote again in the year ahead.

Even if this bill — and a similar one in London — passes next year, it's not going to transform the problem overnight. There's no silver bullet for dismantling the debt vortex that so many poor countries find themselves in — especially if it doesn't involve significant loan forgiveness.

But anything that makes it easier for countries to renegotiate their debt — which both the New York and London bills aim to do — would be a big win. Unlike individuals or companies, countries don't have the option of declaring bankruptcy. So when a nation like Sri Lanka can no longer pay its loans, its only option is to head back to the negotiating table with its creditors.

And even when there are no supervillainous vulture funds involved, such renegotiations are “just a monstrous process for a debtor to go through,” said Jones of Debt Justice, citing Zambia, a neighbor of Malawi that defaulted on its loans in 2020 and has been renegotiating its debt ever since.

”My daughter was born around the time the Zambian process started, and she can now read and write,” he said, noting that if New York or London manages to eke out a restructuring bill, then more countries will feel empowered to apply for debt relief.

Without it, they'll just keep borrowing, often from multilateral organizations like the World Bank, whose loans are ineligible for restructuring and contingent on painful policies that can stifle development in the long run.

And without comprehensive structural reform and genuine debt forgiveness, those countries will never escape. Every “extension of term” on loan repayments may give them a “breather,” said Hawkins, but only delays the inevitable for countries made insolvent by deals that were often rotten to begin with.

“This idea that we can continue to kick the can down the road” is no longer tenable, she said. “That horizon is coming very much closer to us.”

Understanding Ghislaine Maxwell, the heir who went on to abuse children.

Last Friday — and then again this Tuesday — the Justice Department released the Epstein files. The documents were incomplete and heavily redacted, angering the Congress members who'd pushed for the release for months. Among the thousands of documents were the grand jury records from the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for aiding Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of hundreds of girls over the course of years.

Barry Levine, the author of The Spider: Inside the Tangled Web of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, traced Maxwell's path into Epstein's orbit — from favored daughter of a media tycoon to the accomplice to hundreds of crimes. Levine spoke with Today, Explained host Noel King about Maxwell's life story and what her relationship with President Donald Trump might mean for her in the coming years. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

What was Maxwell's upbringing like? 

Well, Ghislaine grew up in England in a mansion with 50 or 60 rooms. Her father, of course, was Robert Maxwell, the famous Fleet Street media tycoon. She was the youngest of their nine children.

It was a very strange upbringing in the sense that her father was extremely explosive, and he demanded a great deal of his children. Ghislaine's mother, Elizabeth, later, in her autobiography, said that her husband Robert would fly into these rages and subject the children to humiliation and harsh treatment, including corporal punishment.

So she grew up privy to a life of obscene luxury. However, it was a very difficult life growing up under her father,

Has she expressed hostility or resentment towards her father in the years since?

No. In fact, she embraced [her role]. She was daddy's little girl in [every] sense. And not only were they close as she was growing up, but [her father] also wanted to groom her for the family business.

When Robert Maxwell acquired Macmillan Publishing in 1988, along with the New York Daily News, the person that he brought with him from England was his daughter Ghislaine. She was well-known and had a tremendous Rolodex of contacts of the rich and famous. And so Robert Maxwell wanted to tap into that.

Her father's story ended in tragedy, is that right?

Her father and his sons — Kevin and Ian — had a battle with the Bank of England for defaulting on close to 75 million in loans.

[During that episode,] he was on a yacht off the coast of the Canary Islands, his yacht — which was named after Ghislaine, the Lady Ghislaine — and he was seen on the deck early that morning, and then he had fallen overboard.

His body was found 12 hours later in the Atlantic Ocean by Spanish fishermen. An autopsy interestingly revealed that there were no signs of foul play. The people around the Maxwell family believed it to be a suicide.

What did Ghislaine think?

Ghislaine didn't want to believe that her father would take his life. So she said this was a result of a dark conspiracy involving [Israeli special forces] renegades and Sicilian contract killers who were responsible for her father's death.

How did Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein meet? 

Ghislaine and Jeffrey Epstein never specifically cited where they in fact met. It was very mysterious how the two of them came together at that time. And then, of course, they show up together at a fashion show in Paris in 1992.

You have to remember at the time that Ghislaine was really not herself. She was extremely distraught after her father's death. People who I interviewed for my book said she was constantly crying. She was constantly breaking down. She was really not in any type of good graces. She moved into a small New York apartment, really just kind of wondering what her future was going to be.

And then all of a sudden she's with Jeffrey Epstein, and she is spending time at his townhouse mansion on the Upper East Side. Jeffrey Epstein was able to provide this type of super wealthy lifestyle that she had become accustomed to.

How did Ghislaine Maxwell become part of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse?

Well, about two years into their relationship, Jeffrey Epstein invited Ghislaine Maxwell to travel with him to northern Michigan in the spring of 1994. There was a music camp there called the Interlochen School. Jeffrey Epstein had studied there as a young student from Brooklyn, New York, after he made his money. The school erected a Jeffrey Epstein Scholarship Lodge in his honour because Jeffrey Epstein gave the music school financial gifts.

So Ghislaine Maxwell goes with Jeffrey in 1994 to this music school, and Jeffrey Epstein met a 13-year-old girl there who is identified in court documents as a Jane Doe. And Jeffrey Epstein approached this girl and said, “You have talent. I would like to bring you to Palm Beach, Florida where I live, and I want to provide for you private voice lessons — and myself and Ghislaine — [and] we will take care of you. We will put you up in a nice place to live.”

They met the girl's mother and invited the girl's mother to their Palm Beach estate. And Ghislaine played the role of Jeffrey Epstein's love interest, really legitimising the deal for the mother, seeming that this was a couple that was going to take care of [her] daughter, and it was a teenager's dream to hang out in a mansion, be lavished with clothing and gifts.

But then it went to the dark side. Ghislaine was instructed by Jeffrey Epstein to groom this 13-year-old girl into learning about sexual positions. This was, to me, the rubber hitting the road in the sense that Ghislaine Maxwell was now becoming a co-conspirator to Jeffrey Epstein and basically feeding this young child to the wolf.

How did Maxwell's role in the abuse change or evolve with time?

When they returned to Palm Beach, Ghislaine Maxwell was instructed by Jeffrey Epstein to begin finding other girls.

Ghislaine Maxwell would recruit girls from the local schools, from local parks. She would have Jeffrey Epstein's driver drive around. She would spot a girl. She would say, “Would you like to make a couple hundred dollars giving my friend a massage?” Of course that was code for the sexual abuse that would take place. And then they would pay these girls $200, $300, and the girls were asked to recruit other girls that they knew.

Ghislaine was in charge of overseeing this entire operation. She would present herself as this big sister, even a motherly type of individual to welcome these young girls. It boggles the mind why she would do this, why she would destroy the childhoods of these minors.

Where is Maxwell now? 

Well, Ghislaine has been moved to a minimum-security dorm-like facility in Texas from the federal facility lockup that she was in Florida. And this had to do with the fawning interview that she gave recently to [United States Deputy Attorney General] Todd Blanche that she never witnessed any wrongdoing involving Donald Trump while he was friends with Jeffrey Epstein, [and that] he didn't know anything about any of this.

Ghislaine, as a reward, I believe, was moved to this minimum-security facility. She's working on asking for clemency from the President.

Do you think Maxwell could receive a pardon from President Trump?

Donald Trump knew Ghislaine Maxwell going back to the late 1980s. I don't think it's far-fetched that Donald Trump could do this.

It would be to the absolute horror of the Epstein and Maxwell survivors for Ghislaine to be pardoned. I think that [it] would cause traumas for [her victims] today if Ghislaine Maxwell was pardoned. She belongs behind bars for the remainder of her sentence.

﻿2025 has felt brutal for climate policy in the US — but the bigger picture is surprisingly promising.

It's been a rough year if you care about climate change policy in the United States.

In Washington, the second Trump administration has moved quickly to dismantle the scaffolding of federal climate action: pulling the US out of the Paris Agreement (again), freezing or clawing back clean energy funding, fast-tracking fossil fuel projects, and even threatening the legal foundation of federal climate regulation itself.

With the help of Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, whole climate, science, and conservation programs have been gutted, public servants fired, and climate language scrubbed from federal websites. And just last week, the administration moved to dismantle the National Center for Atmospheric Research — arguably the world's most crucial climate-science research institution that touches nearly every corner of US weather and climate forecasting, from wildfire modeling to the computational backbone universities rely on.

So when we published Escape Velocity back in April — a project arguing that the clean energy transition had gathered enough economic and technological momentum to become effectively unstoppable — it was fair to wonder whether that thesis could survive this onslaught.

The past eight months suggest it can.

Looking back at the period since we published the project, what's surprised me most isn't how much went wrong — it's how much progress kept happening anyway. Here are seven developments from 2025 that have me feeling hopeful for our future.

• Even with the Trump-era rollbacks, clean energy continued to expand because it's now cheaper, faster, and structurally difficult to stop.

• Around the world, solar, wind, batteries, and EVs are winning on cost — which means adoption no longer depends on climate virtue or friendly governments.

• The world isn't waiting for the US. China, Europe, and emerging markets are driving the transition forward, whether Washington participates or not.

• But even in the US, red and blue states alike have kept expanding clean power — often for purely economic reasons.

• This shift is sticky. Projects breaking ground now will shape the grid for decades, locking in progress that future administrations can't easily undo.

In 2025, the clean energy transition crossed a line that will be hard to uncross. For the first time, renewables overtook coal as the world's leading source of electricity. In the first half of the year, solar, wind, and hydropower generated 34.3 percent of global electricity, edging past coal's 33.1 percent — a quiet but historic turning point. Just as striking, solar and wind didn't merely grow alongside rising demand — they met it entirely. As global electricity use rose about 3 percent, solar and wind expansion covered 100 percent of that increase, with solar alone supplying more than 80 percent.

The pace of change has been startling. The world added 380 gigawatts of new solar capacity in just six months — a 64 percent jump from the same period in 2024 — putting 2025 on track to shatter records yet again. What once felt like “alternative energy” is now the cheapest, fastest power humanity has ever built.

Bill McKibben captures this inflection point in his 2025 book Here Comes the Sun, arguing that the real breakthrough isn't a new technology, but the realization that the energy transition is finally running on economics, not idealism. The sun, it turns out, is doing exactly what it always has — and at last, we're ready to use it.

If Reason 1 is that the transition crossed a threshold, Reason 2 is who pushed it there: China has turned clean energy into the default global option.

China is now the single most important force in the global clean energy transition. It is installing vast amounts of solar, wind, and battery storage at home — but just as importantly, it has driven manufacturing costs so low that clean energy is affordable almost everywhere else. (Let's also be clear that this is all happening as China continues to take more of an all-of-the-above approach — boosting coal and natural gas capacity, too.)

That's why rooftop solar is spreading rapidly across Europe, South Asia, and the Global South. It's why batteries are getting cheaper. And it's why many countries no longer face a stark choice between climate action and energy access.

A global transition only matters if it shows up in the hardest places. In 2025, it did.

Poland, one of Europe's most coal-dependent countries, generated more electricity from renewables than from coal for the first time in June. Coal also fell below 50 percent of Poland's electricity mix for an entire quarter — a symbolic and material break from the past.

Meanwhile, in the UK, coal has all but disappeared from the grid, while wind has become the country's single largest power source. Unfortunately, in the US, however, the Trump administration is trying anything it can to save coal, which is beginning to modestly slow down its rate of decline here.

Coal demand still reached a record high in 2025, but it's clear that we are at or nearing the peak. The future prognosis is terminal: Coal is dying simply because it's losing the math.

Despite aggressive rhetorical and policy attacks on renewables, solar continues to dominate new electricity generation in the United States. And solar energy is the star of 2025: By early December, solar accounted for roughly 75 percent of all new generation installed this year, far outpacing wind, gas, and nuclear.

We can thank the states for that.

In 2025, states passed clean energy affordability laws, modernized grids, invested in transit, expanded solar access, repealed coal bailouts, launched heat-pump rebates, and defended projects under federal attack.

From Illinois and Maine to Nebraska, Ohio, and Oregon, progress came not from sweeping national legislation but from dozens of smaller — and arguably more durable wins.

And where it gets really interesting is in Trump country. This year, 80 percent of US solar manufacturing investment went to Republican-held districts, and most of the top solar-installing states now vote red. Texas leads as solar expansion in the state is on track to produce more electricity on the state's power grid than coal for the first time. Florida, Georgia, Arkansas, and others are close behind. Of the 20 states that installed the most solar capacity since 2024, 14 of them voted for President Donald Trump last year, and there is now more solar capacity installed in Trump states than in states that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris.

All of this means that, ironically, we're actually in the midst of a development sprint.

States across the country are racing to fast-track wind and solar projects before Trump's rollback of federal clean energy tax credits takes full effect. The credits, created under the Inflation Reduction Act, cut project costs by 30 to 50 percent, making them “the financial backbone of nearly every renewable energy project currently in the pipeline,” said Patty O'Keefe of Vote Solar.

Since Trump ended the credits in July, states including Colorado, Maine, California, New York, Oregon, and Minnesota have accelerated permitting, procurement, and grid connections to help developers break ground before the July 4, 2026, construction deadline.

Those projects will keep generating power for decades, meaning today's scramble will permanently tilt the energy system slightly more toward renewables, regardless of what happens in Washington next.

This year, more than one in four new cars sold globally was at least partially powered by an electric motor.

That surge wasn't led by the United States or even Europe, but by emerging markets — especially in Southeast Asia — where EVs are becoming the obvious choice for new buyers. Globally, more than 25 percent of new cars sold so far this year were either an EV or plug-in hybrid.

According to a new report published this week by global energy think tank Ember, which analysed available monthly data for 60 countries, new markets are making a rapid switch to plug-in vehicles, putting to bed the theory that EV adoption would stall outside of Europe and China.

In the US, the story is messier, with policy uncertainty slowing adoption of more efficient cars. But globally, the direction is clear: automakers are designing for an electric future because that's where the customers are.

For years, critics dismissed wind and solar as unreliable. In 2025, battery storage finally made that argument feel outdated.

The US hit record-breaking storage installations this year, with utility-scale batteries strengthening grids and soaking up cheap renewable power when it's abundant — then delivering it when it's needed. Developing technologies are already extending lifespans and cutting costs; solar combined with battery storage and wind with battery storage as a combo deal are even on track to undercut fossil fuels in cost worldwide before the end of the decade.

This is what makes renewables infrastructure, not just energy sources.

Okay, okay — by this point in the story, I know what you're thinking: What about data centers???? Isn't the insatiable buildout of AI going to derail any positive developments?

It's true that data centers are sprouting up across the American landscape like weeds. As of November 2025, the US had built 5,427 data centers — with capacity up by more than 40 percent since the start of 2025 — making it the world's largest data center market by a significant margin. As data center demand explodes, companies increasingly rely on renewables like solar and wind through power purchase agreements — but because those sources are intermittent, developers are pairing them with battery storage and, more often, natural gas plants to provide round-the-clock reliability. In practice, that means data centers are pulling heavily on clean energy where available, while leaning on fossil fuels, especially gas, to guarantee constant power as grids and storage struggle to keep up.

But there's even a silver lining here: As the grid needs more and more energy, grid operators are increasingly looking to build out overall capacity with renewable energy sources because they are so cheap.

And then there's also something interesting happening that makes me feel hopeful about climate activism: As AI-driven data centers spread across the U.S., community backlash is growing — and fast. This feels like a purpose that the environmental movement, which has seemed unmoored for quite some time now, could glom onto. In places like suburban Philadelphia, Michigan, Georgia, and Virginia, residents are organizing against massive data centers over concerns about rising electricity bills, pollution, and noise.

Power prices are already spiking for American consumers, and community opposition has delayed or canceled nearly $100 billion in projects so far. What's striking is how bipartisan and local the resistance is — and how politically potent it's becoming. Data centers are turning abstract climate and energy issues into tangible, neighborhood-level fights, offering climate activism a new, concrete target with broad public appeal.

And just last week, Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, proposed a moratorium on new data centers because he says artificial intelligence is coming along too quickly and we need time for “democracy to catch up.”

None of this means the climate fight is won. Clean energy is growing fast, but not yet fast enough to avoid serious harm. Infrastructure bottlenecks remain. Inequities persist. And US political sabotage carries real costs.

But the clean energy transition no longer depends on a single election, a single country, or a single president. It's being driven by economics, technology, and global demand — forces that are far harder to reverse than a regulation.

The United States may be choosing to give up its head start. The rest of the world isn't waiting.

And every megawatt we build anyway still matters — because every fraction of a degree we avoid is lives saved, futures preserved, and disasters that never happen.

﻿The US has had a bad track record of building nuclear on time and on budget. But that could change.

The town of Oswego, New York, has three nuclear power plants within 10 miles — and it wants another one. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul recently announced a commitment to add a gigawatt of nuclear power to the New York state grid, partially to meet the electricity demands of the booming AI industry. And Oswego is vying to be chosen as a site for this new power plant.

To find out more about why Oswego is so eager for nuclear — and what would happen next if it's chosen — Vox video producer Nate Krieger traveled there to meet with the mayor of Oswego and see the nuclear power plants up close.

There are a lot of benefits to adding more nuclear energy to the grid. The average US nuclear power station can provide enough electricity to support 1.4 million homes. Nuclear power operates 24/7 and doesn't generate carbon emissions or traditional air pollution. Plus, these plants create hundreds of jobs.

But disasters like Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima Daiichi loom large in the public imagination. Many people don't want nuclear power in their backyard, understandably wary of possible disasters and the issue of nuclear waste. Nuclear power plants in the US store their waste in dry casks, which is a relatively safe method but is not designed to be permanent. And other opponents of building a new nuclear plant upstate cite issues of cost and the length of the construction project.

Even if Oswego is chosen to be the site of the next nuclear power plant in New York state, it would likely take over a decade before it gets to reap those rewards. The United States has not had a great track record of building nuclear on time and on budget. The most recent power plant built in the US was Vogtle, Georgia, which was years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget. 

This video looks into the country's history with nuclear power, trying to figure out why the US fell so far behind and what building clean and efficient power could look like in the future, especially for the town of Oswego.

In this article

ServiceNow will acquire cybersecurity startup Armis in a cash deal valued at $7.75 billion, the company said Tuesday.

Shares fell about 3%.

The enterprise software company said the deal will bolster its cybersecurity capabilities in the age of artificial intelligence and more than triple its market opportunity for security and risk solutions. 

""This is about making a strategic move to accelerate growth, and we see the opportunity for our customers,"" CEO Bill McDermott told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" on Tuesday. ""In this AI world, especially with the agents, you're going to need to protect these enterprises [because] every intrusion is a multimillion-dollar problem.""

ServiceNow said the deal is expected to close in the second half of next year, financed by a combination of cash and debt. 

The company has been on an acquisition spree in 2025 as it sought to accelerate growth, McDermott  said. 

ServiceNow announced a deal for AI agent platform Moveworks for $2.85 billion in March, and at the beginning of December, said it would acquire identity security platform Veza.

""ServiceNow will have the only AI control tower that drives workflow, action and business outcomes across all of these environments,"" McDermott added. 

Bloomberg first reported earlier this month that Armis was exploring a possible $7 billion deal with ServiceNow. 

In November, the California-based company, which helps businesses protect internet-connected devices from cyber risks, said it had raised $435 million at a $6.1 billion valuation.

At the time, co-founder Yevgeny Dibrov told CNBC that Armis was looking to go public in 2026 or 2027, but his main objective was to surpass $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. 

""The need for what Armis is doing and what we are building, in this cyber exposure management and security platform, is just increasing,"" he said, adding that there's ""very unique and huge"" demand for its tools. 

Many companies have opted to stay private for longer or get acquired as a turbulent initial public offering market has begun to rebound. Large companies such as Stripe and Databricks have found an influx of capital in private markets.  

In the age of AI, companies are spending more on cybersecurity to protect against increasingly sophisticated threats. 

This year has also been significant for major cybersecurity deals as companies look to enhance their threat protection capabilities. That includes Google's $32 billion acquisition of cloud security startup Wiz and Palo Alto Networks' $25 billion deal for CyberArk. 

ServiceNow said Armis has topped $340 million in annual recurring revenue with 50% year-over-year growth, up from $300 million disclosed in August.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Epstein files: Latest batch from DOJ includes a personal letter, emails and heavily redacted documents","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/23/epstein-files-doj-release-trump.html","Tue, 23 Dec 2025 13:38:16 GMT","



The Department of Justice on Tuesday released another batch of files related to deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

The latest documents appear to contain court records, emails, and some heavily or completely redacted files.

In a Tuesday morning post to X, the DOJ announced the latest drop and claimed to have released ""nearly 30,000 more pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein."" The post also refers to claims made against President Donald Trump in the latest release. 

""Some of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,"" the post states. ""To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.""

Trump, who was largely unmentioned in the initial batch of files released by the DOJ on Friday, is a former friend of Epstein's and has long denied any wrongdoing related to the disgraced New York financier. Epstein died by suicide while in detention in 2019.

Included in the latest batch from the DOJ is a handwritten letter Epstein wrote to convicted sex offender Larry Nassar from the Manhattan Correctional Center that appears to reference Trump. In the letter, which appears similar to a letter described in a 2023 report by the Associated Press, Epstein says, ""Our president shares our love of young, nubile girls."" Trump was president at the time the letter was written. 

""When a young beauty walked by he loved to 'grab snatch,' whereas we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system. Life is unfair,"" Epstein wrote. 

CNBC has not independently confirmed the authenticity of the letter or the claims made in it. The envelope is stamped three days after Epstein's jailhouse suicide. In the letter, Epstein tells Nassar, ""As you know by now, I have taken the 'short route' home.""

Another reference to Trump appears in the latest release, in a 2020 email from an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York whose name is redacted.

The prosecutor wrote that Trump ""traveled on Epstein's private jet many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware)."" Trump is listed as a passenger on at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996, according to the email.

Trump and Epstein were the only two listed passengers on a 1993 flight, according to the email, and Trump, Epstein and a then-20-year-old (whose name is redacted) were the lone passengers on a second flight.

""On two other flights, two of the passengers, respectively, were women who would be possible witnesses in a Maxwell case,"" the prosecutor wrote. 

Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite, was convicted in 2021 of procuring underage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. Last week, Maxwell filed a long-shot petition to vacate her conviction.

When asked about Trump's appearance in the files, a White House spokesperson referred CNBC to the DOJ's statement.

This is the second major release of files since Friday, when all documents were required under the Epstein Files Transparency Act to be made public with minimal redactions.

In a letter to Congress on Friday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told lawmakers that ""due to the volume of materials,"" the DOJ would release the documents on a ""rolling basis"" through the end of the year, defying the law's requirement to release the files in their entirety by Dec. 19.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on Monday that he would force the Senate to vote on suing the DOJ for the full release of files.

Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., who co-sponsored the House bill that ordered the DOJ to release the Epstein files, are among congressional lawmakers considering holding federal officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, in contempt for the handling of the files. 

Khanna also threatened to begin impeachment proceedings against Bondi and Blanche if the DOJ continues to flout the law.

A group of Epstein survivors on Monday joined the call for congressional oversight in a statement. Nineteen survivors signed the letter, which urged ""hearings, formal demands for compliance, and legal action, to ensure the Department of Justice fulfills its legal obligations.""

The survivors also noted that many of the released documents were heavily redacted. 

""At the same time, numerous victim identities were left unredacted, causing real and immediate harm,"" the group wrote.

The DOJ also raised eyebrows over the weekend when several photos — including one that contained images of Trump's face — were quietly removed from the online database for the Epstein files. The photo was later restored.

The Justice Department has maintained that it is working to review and redact material required by the law to protect the privacy of Epstein's victims. 

""This is an arduous process, as each document and photograph must be individually reviewed by the DOJ and the Southern District of New York for potential redactions to protect victims or potential victims,"" the DOJ said in a fact sheet.

Former President Bill Clinton, who featured prominently in the photos released on Friday, has notably called for the complete release of the files.

Clinton's spokesman, Angel Urena, on Monday issued a statement urging the DOJ to ""immediately release any remaining materials referring to, mentioning, or containing a photograph of Bill Clinton.""

""What the Department of Justice has released so far, and the manner in which it did so, makes one thing clear: someone or something is being protected. We do not know whom, what or why. But we know this: We need no such protection,"" Urena wrote.

Clinton has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.

Europe is pressing ahead with plans to ban Russian gas imports by the end of 2027, effectively capping Moscow's energy future in the region and leaving a bevy of stranded assets in its wake.

The dual Nord Stream 1 and 2 subsea pipelines were early casualties of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the infrastructure being sabotaged in late 2022 and the latter pipeline — costing $11 billion to build and aimed at doubling cheap Russian gas flows to Germany — never being certified for use.  

There had been speculation that the major energy infrastructure could eventually be resurrected if, or rather when, the war between Russia and Ukraine ends and there's a peace agreement between the parties. 

However, talks to try to establish the grounds for a ceasefire have been moving at a snail's pace with neither side willing to cross ""red lines"" regarding the permanent surrender of territory, be it sovereign or occupied. Speaking with British news website UnHerd, Vance said Monday that while the U.S. is going to ""try to get this thing solved,"" he ""wouldn't say with confidence that we're going to get a peaceful resolution."" 

Hopes of a deal have led to questions over what economic and energy links between Russia and the rest of the world could be re-established and, when it comes to Europe, whether a ceasefire could lead to a reintegration of Russian gas and the resurrection of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. 

Such a move would be highly contentious and divisive on the continent, given Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and attempts in the region to wean itself off cheaper Russian gas. 

In 2021, before the war, Russian imports accounted for about 45% of the European gas consumption. This year, estimates expect imports of 13%. 

Ukraine would be outraged by any move that benefited its invader, and Poland has called for the pipelines — one of which has never been used — to be ""dismantled.""  

That said, Ukraine itself benefited from an older pipeline that passes through the country as it collected transit fees. The Russia–Ukraine gas transit agreement expired at the end of 2024, with the two countries opting not to renew it given the war. The Nord Stream pipelines were specifically designed to circumvent Ukraine and avoid such fees, but the transit agreement could be one of many levers to use during negotiations if the tap is turned back on.  

The U.S. would likely baulk at the return of Nord Stream as it has hoped to muscle out Moscow and increase its market share of liquefied natural gas (LNG) sales to Europe. But Germany, which is directly connected to the pipeline and whose industries are struggling with high energy costs, might find the lure and return of Russian gas supplies hard to resist. 

The European Council and Parliament in December struck a provisional agreement on regulation to phase out imports of Russian gas. It is set to implement a full ban on liquefied natural gas (LNG) and pipeline gas imports from the end of 2026 and autumn 2027, respectively. 

The Danish Energy Agency in January granted permission for Nord Stream 2 to carry out preservation work on its damaged pipelines that are located within Denmark's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the Baltic Sea.

""The purpose of the works is to prevent further gas blowout and the ingress of oxygenated seawater, that could potentially lead to corrosion,"" the agency told CNBC, although the preservation works on Nord Stream 2 have not commenced yet. 

The permit has been granted on a number of conditions, the agency said, that are intended to ensure safe operation of the pipeline. It added that, among other conditions, the company must submit an annual plan for the pipeline facility ""so that the Danish Energy Agency can continuously monitor the company's plans for the facility's future."" 

""Furthermore, all conditions in such permits would have to be fulfilled before the pipelines can be put into operation. The Danish Energy Agency has not received any such applications,"" it said. 

But are the Norstream pipelines even salvageable now? 

Sergey Vakulenko, senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, told CNBC that the pipeline that was damaged in the sabotage incidents would need replacing in part, and the remaining undamaged one would not cost ""much money at all"" to resurrect. 

""I think they're still repairable, salvageable. So you could have to cut a few miles of [the damaged] pipeline and replace it. But this could be done,"" he told CNBC in October.  

""It could easily cost $1 billion or something like that, but there's still one [pipeline] at operational strength so that could be used,"" he said. Asked if the pipelines — which are filled with stagnant gas — are being looked after currently, Vakulenko said: ""They're not looked after at all."" 

Whether Europe could resume purchases from Russia again is the big question. 

""Each of the Nord Streams [pipelines] were 55 million cubic meters. So that one remaining is 27.5 million cubic meters ... and that's probably the top of what Europe would be prepared to buy from Russia,"" Vakulenko said.

He said that if there was a change of government in Russia and Putin was no longer president, Europe would be ""quite willing to buy some Russian gas,"" but not if the same amounts it was buying before. 

""Then Nord Stream would come in handy. But that's [a] very big 'IF,'"" he added.  

""On the one hand, Europe, or at least there are parties [countries] in Europe, who wouldn't mind having at least some Russian gas in the European energy mix for a number of reasons, to not be too reliant on U.S. supply. Russia is the lowest cost supplier to Europe,"" he said.  

The continent has not fully recovered from the energy crisis stemming from the full-scale invasion of its neighbour. The Dutch Title Transfer Facility, Europe's main benchmark for natural gas prices, was double its pre-war prices in early 2025, per the IEA. Energy constraints are compounded further by the AI race, which has shifted public narratives from energy transition to energy addition. 

""So if you're not too squeamish to buy Russian gas, if you don't have to hold your nose too tight by buying it, then sure, there's a lot of commercial and economic reasons as to why [to do it]. If it becomes politically, ethically palatable, then there will be quite a lot of stimuli to do so, but that's again for the time when there is indeed some rapprochement between Russia and Europe, and that's [a] big 'if',"" Vakulenko said. 

However, Tancrede Fulop, utilities and renewables analyst at Morningstar, told CNBC that it would be too difficult to reintegrate Russian gas, at least in the short term, because of the fresh European legislation. He noted, however, that the legislation does include some exceptions for Hungary and Slovakia in emergency situations.

The policy shift was also rooted in a drive for energy independence after Russia's ""weaponisation of gas supplies,"" the EU said. As a result, member states are likely to stay clear of an overreliance on one state going forward and instead invest in boosting overall domestic capacity. 

Whether Russia would want to sell its gas to Europe is another looming question.

""Everybody thinks the energy crisis started with war in Ukraine, but it actually started in 2021,"" Fulop said, noting several drivers of a cold winter, low wind speeds, and therefore high gas consumption.

Adding to the crisis was the fact that the EU was late to clear Nord Stream 2 for operations. ""And so Russia started to reduce the flows of gas sent to the EU,"" before the war started, he said. This suggests that the move from Russia may have been intended to add pressure on Europe to pick up the pace with Nord Stream 2. 

On the other hand, ""Russia is not in a very strong negotiating position,"" according to Vakulenko. ""For Russia, that gas is a stranded resource. So you could expect [that Europe] could negotiate a good deal.""

Russia has also looked to Asia as an alternative partner to Europe and has deepened ties with China via the Power of Siberia pipeline.  

Even if a peace deal with Ukraine is reached, ""the message is quite alarming"" around another potential conflict with Russia, Fulop said, given the flouting of European airspace in recent months.  

Ultimately, a renewed embrace of Russian gas ""doesn't seem like the most realistic scenario.""

It helps that gas prices have fallen lately, he added, perhaps with market watchers pricing in a peace deal. The EU will also benefit from the new export terminals in the U.S.  

""This is bearish for gas prices, positive for Europe, and that could offset the end of Russian gas imports,"" Fulop said.

In this article

Novo Nordisk shares received a much-needed end of the year boost as the Wegovy maker became the first drugmaker to secure approval of a GLP-1 pill for weight loss, in what one analyst called a ""redemption for the investors"" after the stock's worst year ever. 

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval of Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 pill gives the Danish pharmaceutical giant a head start over U.S. rival Eli Lilly, which has also filed for FDA approval for its oral weight loss drug orforglipron.

""As the first oral GLP-1 treatment for people living with overweight or obesity, the Wegovy pill provides patients with a new, convenient treatment option that can help patients start or continue their weight loss journey,"" said Novo CEO Mike Doustdar in a statement late Monday.

Shares closed 9.2% higher Tuesday.

Novo plans to launch oral Wegovy, or ""Wegovy-in-a-pill,"" in the U.S. – by far its largest market– in early January 2026. The company has also submitted the pill for approval to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other regulatory authorities.

Wegovy's starting dose of 1.5 milligrams will be available in pharmacies and via select telehealth providers with savings offers for $149 per month, Novo said.

Cash-paying patients can access it for the same price via President Donald Trump's direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx, according to the deal Novo Nordisk struck with his administration last month. Drug pricing has been top of mind this year as the U.S. looks to reduce the costs paid by consumers.

The approval caps a turbulent year for Novo, which has been marked by multiple guidance cuts, mass layoffs, dramatic leadership shakeups, and a high-profile public bidding war against U.S. rival Pfizer.

Novo's latest news ""is a redemption for the investors,"" Danish Jyske Bank analyst Henrik Hallengreen Laustsen told CNBC, especially after a year in which shares halved in value as confidence faltered in Novo's ability to compete with Eli Lilly and others.

""A welcome 'Christmas gift' for Novo investors — and for patients as New Year weight-loss resolutions typically kick in — given that Novo expects to launch the product in early January 2026,"" Hallengreen Laustsen said.

""The Wegovy pill represents a key growth driver over the coming years and a critical competitive tool versus Eli Lilly, which is expected to receive approval for its oral obesity drug in March–April 2026,"" he said, adding that the Wegovy pill's approval covers both weight management and reducing the risk of adverse cardiovascular events such as strokes and heart attacks. 

Novo's clinical data looks ""fantastic,"" Rajesh Kumar, who heads up European life Sciences and healthcare equity research at HSBC, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday.

""Efficacy-wise, Novo's product, on the clinical trials at least, looks better,"" Kumar said. ""Tolerability looks quite attractive compared to [Lilly's orforglipron].

The Wegovy pill has so far shown that it can help patients lose on average 16.6% of their body weight over about a year. Meanwhile, Lilly's pill resulted in 12.4% weight loss in a late-stage clinical trial.

""Novo actually might have an edge, and it will entirely depend on how they execute,"" he added. Even so, oral Wegovy must be taken on an empty stomach, and that might make it easier for doctors to prescribe orforglipron — which doesn't have the same restrictions — to patients because of compliance, Kumar noted. 

Novo has said it doesn't see oral Wegovy's food restriction as a significant barrier, as it can be taken in the morning on an empty stomach and then only requires patients to wait about 30 minutes before eating.

Lilly reported positive findings from a maintenance trial where patients switched directly from taking the company's injection Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's rival shot Wegovy. This may help Lilly ""keep a bit of market share,"" Kumar said. ""That's the thing we have to watch,"" he added. 

Even as analysts and investors alike are mostly optimistic about the Wegovy pill U.S. launch, investors will be watching how Novo and its new pill will fare in relation to Lilly's oral version. A first-mover advantage is no guarantee for future sector dominance and success.

Ozempic, which contains the same active ingredient semaglutide as Wegovy but is approved for treating type 2 diabetes, had a four-year head start on Lilly rival Mounjaro. Still, Lilly has now overtaken Novo in terms of U.S. prescriptions as Novo has struggled to meet demand, allowing a market for compounding pharmacies to flourish. Lilly's jabs have also been shown to lead to greater weight loss.

It has led Novo shares to plummet about 50% in 2025, in the stock's worst year on record.

Investors have also voiced concerns about Novo's pipeline and how it might not stack up to Lilly's and other hopeful market entrants such as heavyweights Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Roche.

Shares of South Korean firm Hanwha Ocean surged 10% Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the firm would help build new frigates for the country's Navy. 

Speaking at a press conference, Trump said that the warships will be built at the Hanwha Philly Shipyard in Philadelphia, acquired by the South Korean company in 2024, and in which it has pledged to invest $5 billion as part of South Korea's $150 billion shipbuilding pledge. 

The shipbuilding pledge is part of the broader U.S.-South Korea trade deal that saw tariffs reduced on South Korean exports to 15%, in exchange for a $350 billion investment pledge from Seoul, among other concessions. 

Hanwha Ocean is one of South Korea's major shipbuilding firms, having expertise in building commercial ships such as LNG carriers, as well as and military naval platforms including submarines and surface vessels. 

South Korean defense stocks have been on a roll this year, with major defense players such as Hanhwa Aerospace and Hyundai Rotem gaining over 170% and 270%, respectively year to date. Hanhwa Ocean has surged more 220% so far this year. 

Last week, the U.S. Navy announced the FF(X) class of ships — smaller combatant ships — which it said will complement larger, multi-mission warships and enhance operational flexibility around the globe. Secretary of the Navy John Phelan said the new frigate class would be part of Trump's envisioned ""Golden Fleet.""

Trump on Monday stateside said that the U.S. Navy will build two new ""Trump-class"" battleships, and may expand the count to as much as 25 such ships. 

The U.S. president described the ships as ""some of the most lethal surface warfare ships,"" adding that the they will ""help maintain American military supremacy, [and] inspire fear in America's enemies all over the world.""Describing them as ""the fastest, the biggest, and by far, 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built,"" the Trump-class battleships are envisioned to be equipped with hypersonic weapons, lasers, cruise missiles, and nuclear weapons, according to the U.S. President.

Gold touched a record high on Tuesday, ‍just shy of breaching ‍the $4,500 per-ounce threshold, as ‍a weaker dollar and persistent geopolitical uncertainty boosted demand for the safe-haven metal, while silver continued its rally to an all-time peak.

Spot gold rose 0.72% to $4,477.45 per ounce after hitting a record $4,497.55 earlier ​in the session. U.S. gold futures for February delivery rose 0.92% to $4,509.10, after hitting a fresh intraday high of $4,530.80.

""Expectations for a dovish Fed, markets losing confidence in the greenback, geopolitical tensions, central bank buying.... Investors' lust of gold remains ⁠massive, due to a mix of all factors above,"" said Carlo Alberto De Casa, external analyst at banking group Swissquote.

The U.S. dollar extended losses to a second day and was on course for its biggest annual fall since 2017.

On the geopolitical front, U.S. President Donald Trump last week ordered a ""blockade"" of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela, and said he was not ruling out the possibility of war with the country.

Meanwhile, markets are currently pricing in two interest rate cuts for 2026 as reports of Trump naming a new Federal Reserve chair early next year reinforce expectations for dovish monetary policy.

Bullion has climbed more than 70% this ‍year as investors seek refuge amid global tensions and lower interest rates.

Spot ‌silver crossed $70 for the first time, advancing 2.13% to $70.4932 per ounce.

The white metal has risen more than 140% year-to-date on supply deficits, industrial demand, and investment inflows.

""Both gold and silver continue ‍to attract buying strength. This behavior suggests that $4,500 and $70 are being treated less as hard ceilings and more as reference points within ongoing trends, leaving both metals firmly supported for now and over the holidays,"" said Ahmad Assiri, research strategist at Pepperstone.

Raised in a humble home in Casablanca, Morocco, without running water or electricity, Ilham Kadri's journey to becoming CEO of Syensqo is a story of strength. 

""I was abandoned by my father. My mother left the country, so my grandmother raised me,"" Kadri told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick on the ""Executive Decisions"" podcast. 

""She was told she had two exits in her life: the first to her husband's home and the second to the grave,"" Kadri explained. 

Kadri credits her grandmother with instilling the belief that education could be her ""third exit"" — a way out of poverty and into possibility. That mindset propelled her from public schools in Morocco to a scholarship at a French university, and eventually to a Ph.D. in macromolecular physical chemistry. 

""I never dreamed of being a CEO. For me, each step was already a victory,"" Kadri said. 

Her career spans global giants like Shell and Dow, and leadership roles at Diversey and Solvay, where she spearheaded a historic split of the 160-year-old company. After 11 years leading Solvay and then Syensqo, Kadri is ready for her next chapter. 

""You need to have the courage to lead and transform, and you need to have the wisdom to leave when your successor is ready. That's a great legacy as well,"" she said.

Bitcoin faced a turbulent Q4 in 2025, with December seeing a nearly 9% drop and record volatility since April, yet VanEck's mid-December “ChainCheck” report notes improving liquidity and resetting speculative leverage, providing cautious optimism for long-term holders.

It's been a turbulent and volatile fourth quarter for Bitcoin in 2025. BTC has endured a turbulent December, with prices dropping nearly 9% and volatility spiking to levels not seen since April 2025.

In its latest mid-December “ChainCheck” report, VanEck's digital asset analysts painted a nuanced picture: while on-chain activity remains weak, liquidity conditions are improving, and speculative leverage appears to be resetting, offering cautious optimism for long-term holders.

The firm highlighted the contrasting behaviors between different investor groups. Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) have been actively buying the dip, accumulating 42,000 BTC — their largest addition since July — bringing aggregate holdings above one million BTC. 

This contrasts with Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) investors, who have reduced exposure, underscoring a shift toward corporate accumulation over retail-led speculation. 

Analysts at VanEck noted that some DATs are exploring alternative financing methods, including issuing preferred shares rather than common stock, to fund purchases and operations, reflecting a more strategic, long-term approach.

Onchain data also revealed a divergence between medium- and long-term holders. Tokens held for one to five years have seen significant movement, suggesting profit-taking or portfolio rotation, while coins held for more than five years remain largely untouched. 

VanEck interprets this as a signal that cyclical or shorter-term participants are offloading assets, whereas the oldest cohorts maintain conviction in Bitcoin's future.

Miners, meanwhile, have faced a particularly challenging environment. Network hash rates fell 4% in December, says VanEck — the sharpest decline since April 2024 — as high-capacity operations in regions such as Xinjiang reduced output amid regulatory pressures. Breakeven electricity costs for major mining rigs have also dropped, reflecting tighter profit margins. 

Historically, however, VanEck notes that falling hash rates can serve as a bullish contrarian indicator: periods of declining network power have often preceded positive 90- to 180-day forward returns.

The VanEck team frames its analysis within the GEO (Global Liquidity, Ecosystem Leverage, Onchain Activity) framework, designed to assess Bitcoin's structural health beyond daily price fluctuations. 

Under this lens, improving liquidity and the accumulation by DATs provide a counterweight to softer on-chain metrics, including stagnating new addresses and declining transaction fees.

Broader macro trends add complexity to Bitcoin's outlook. The U.S. dollar has weakened to near three-month lows, rallying precious metals, but Bitcoin and other crypto assets have remained under pressure. 

In parallel, the evolving financial ecosystem may offer new support. Market observers point to the rise of “everything exchanges,” platforms aiming to integrate stocks, crypto, and prediction markets, leveraging AI-driven trading and settlement systems. 

Just last week, Coinbase made an ‘everything exchange' like move and launched an expansion of its platform, introducing stock trading, prediction markets, futures, and other features. Companies entering this space — ranging from traditional brokerages to crypto-native firms — are vying for market share, potentially increasing Bitcoin's liquidity and utility over time, VanEck says. 

Despite this, volatility remains a defining feature. While Bitcoin has doubled in value over the past two years and nearly tripled over three, the absence of extreme blow-off tops or drawdowns has tempered expectations. Future bitcoin moves may be more measured, with midterm investors likely to see smaller cyclical peaks and troughs rather than the dramatic swings of prior cycles.

VanEck said the broader market is in correction. Short- to medium-term speculative activity is retreating, long-term holders are holding steady, and institutional accumulation is rising. Coupled with signs of miner capitulation, subdued volatility, and macroeconomic dynamics, the firm frames the current environment as one of structural recalibration. 

As 2025 draws to a close, Bitcoin may be in a period of consolidation that reflects broader market maturation, VanEck said. This may result in some strong positive price moves in the first quarter of next year.

Both funds offer regulated crypto exposure, but bitcoin and ethereum behave differently in volatility and capital flows, shaping how each ETF fits inside a portfolio

The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) and the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) both offer single-asset crypto exposure at identical costs, but differ sharply in asset size, historical volatility, and underlying asset focus.

Both ETHA and IBIT are designed for investors seeking direct access to leading cryptocurrencies via familiar ETF wrappers, without the complexity of wallets or direct crypto trading. This comparison highlights crucial differences in cost, recent returns, risk, and portfolio composition to help investors clarify which may appeal more depending on risk appetite and crypto outlook.

Beta measures price volatility relative to the S&P 500; beta is calculated from five-year weekly returns. The 1-yr return represents total return over the trailing 12 months.

Both funds charge the same expense ratio, making cost a non-factor between them. Only IBIT commands a much larger pool of assets under management, which may appeal to those seeking scale and liquidity.

IBIT is a pure-play vehicle giving 100% exposure to bitcoin, with no meaningful allocations to cash or other assets. The fund has been available for 2.0 years and holds a single security: Bitcoin (AMEX:BTC). This structure means returns, volatility, and drawdowns directly mirror those of bitcoin itself, with no sector or diversification tilts. Over the past year, IBIT's share price has fluctuated between $42.98 and $71.82.

ETHA, in contrast, is a single-asset trust fully invested in Ether (AMEX:ETH), offering exposure exclusively to the ether cryptocurrency. ETHA's sector classification is entirely in financial services, but in practice, risk and return are driven by the price of ether. Both funds lack quirks like leverage, ESG screens, or currency hedging, and neither tracks a traditional index.

For more guidance on ETF investing, check out the full guide at this link.

An ETF simplifies access to crypto, but it does not simplify the risk you take on. IBIT and ETHA give investors access to two very different crypto identities using the same regulated wrapper. IBIT tracks bitcoin, which many investors treat as the anchor asset of the crypto market. ETHA tracks ether, whose price tends to move with shifts in network activity and risk appetite across the ecosystem. The choice reflects what role crypto is meant to play in a portfolio.

That difference becomes clear in volatility and how positions are sized. Bitcoin has attracted deeper pools of capital, often making it the first allocation investors turn to when adding crypto exposure through ETFs. Ethereum has historically produced sharper swings, which can make it better suited for smaller, more tactical positions. Both funds hold the spot asset in custody rather than using futures, so performance differences are driven by the underlying asset and ongoing fees, not tracking mechanics.

For investors, IBIT fits those seeking a simpler, more established way to hold crypto through a regulated fund. ETHA fits investors willing to accept wider swings in pursuit of higher conviction tied to Ethereum's growth. Both simplify access, but neither softens price movement. The real choice is whether you want crypto exposure that holds its ground in rough markets or one that moves more aggressively with momentum.

                            As Bitmine continues its Ethereum accumulation journey, are Tom Lee's bullish price predictions getting closer?                         

Bitmine, the world's largest corporate holder of Ethereum, has increased its Ethereum holdings beyond 4 million tokens following its latest purchase.

The company now holds 4,066,062 ether, worth over $12 billion at current market prices, according to company disclosures.

Tom Lee, chairman of Bitmine, has remained heavily bullish on Ethereum's long-term price, recently predicting it could surge as high as $62,000 — but is it possible?

According to on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, Bitmine's most recent purchase on Dec. 22 saw the company acquire  13,412 ETH for approximately $40.6 million.

Over the past week, Bitmine added 98,852 ether to its balance sheet, bringing its total holdings to 4,066,062 ETH.

The company said the tokens were acquired at an average price of $2,991 per ether.

Congrats @BitMNR  on exceeding 4 million $ETH !!!! https://t.co/ttoydQ8R5x 

— Thomas (Tom) Lee (not drummer) FSInsight.com (@fundstrat) December 22, 2025 



“Bitmine continues to add steadily to its ETH holdings, adding 98,852 ETH in the past week, and Bitmine holdings now exceed the crucial 4 million ETH tokens,” Lee said in a statement.

Bitmine began accumulating Ethereum in June and has become the largest corporate holder of the asset in less than six months.

“We are making rapid progress towards the ‘alchemy of 5%' and we are already seeing the synergies borne from our substantial ETH holdings,” Lee said.

At the beginning of the month, Lee said Ethereum was positioned to benefit from tokenization and was currently “grossly undervalued.”

“Ethereum this year is having its 1971 moment,” Lee said, comparing the current transition to the end of the gold standard for the U.S. dollar.

“In 2025, we're tokenizing everything — stocks, bonds, real estate — and Wall Street is going to create products on a smart contract platform,” he said.

“The vast majority of that infrastructure is being built on Ethereum.”

Tom Lee says #ethereum  is going to $62,000 within a few months pic.twitter.com/2QY9LXsOQH 

— Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDaily) December 4, 2025 



He added that Ethereum at $3,000 was “grossly undervalued.”

Lee said that if Ethereum returns to its long-term average valuation relative to Bitcoin, its price could reach approximately $12,000.

In a higher-ratio scenario, he said  Ethereum trading at 0.25 relative to Bitcoin would see a price near $62,000.

With Bitmine making progress toward accumulating 5% of the total Ethereum supply, CCN asked ChatGPT and Grok whether Lee's bullish price predictions could become reality.

When asked to assess Ethereum's outlook, OpenAI's ChatGPT highlighted the asset's structural advantages.

“Ethereum's long-term investment case is supported by network effects, institutional adoption, and its central role in tokenization infrastructure,” the model said.

However, ChatGPT noted that price appreciation of the magnitude outlined by Lee would likely require sustained demand growth and a significant shift in risk sentiment.

“In the near term, Ethereum may continue to face resistance. It would require a huge, momentous change for Lee's predictions to come into play,” it said.

“Ethereum, Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies can achieve massive growth in short spans of time, but at some point predictions have to be grounded in realism,” it added.

Grok, the AI chatbot developed by xAI, was more openly skeptical of the bullish projections.

“Ethereum has one of the best narratives in crypto — and one of the most patient markets ignoring it,” Grok said.

The model said large price projections often underestimate how long markets can remain indifferent.

“People have been calling Ethereum ‘undervalued' for years,” Grok said. “That doesn't make them wrong, but it does make timing their victory extremely painful.”

Grok added that institutional accumulation alone is not enough to drive prices higher.

“One company buying millions of ETH doesn't magically flip market structure,” it said.

“Until leverage, volume, and risk appetite line up, Ethereum can stay boring longer than bulls can stay confident.”

While Grok acknowledged Ethereum's role in tokenization, it cautioned against extrapolating that into near-term price action.

“Ethereum can be the backbone of finance and still trade sideways. Markets care about liquidity first, vision second,” it said.

According to CCN's analysis, Ethereum's recent lack of upside follow-through has coincided with weakening on-chain and derivatives indicators.

“The Seller Exhaustion Constant has fallen to 0.027, its lowest level since June,” said CCN analyst Victor Olanrewaju.

“Such a low value suggests that sellers have not yet reached a point of exhaustion, meaning supply continues to meet—or outweigh—demand,” he added.

From a technical perspective, Ethereum continues to trade within a descending channel, Olanrewaju reported.

“If current conditions persist, Ethereum could drift toward the $2,740 region,” he said.

However, he added that a slowdown in selling pressure may “allow Ethereum's price to reassert itself above the upper boundary of the descending channel.”

“In that scenario, a move toward $3,163 would come back into focus, though such a breakout would require confirmation from momentum and volume,” Olanrewaju concluded.

At the time of reporting, Ethereum was trading  at around $2,967, up over 4% in a month, but down 3.15% in 24 hours. The asset remains extremely volatile.

The past 24 hours saw the broader cryptocurrency market continue its choppy price action, with the majority trading in the red.

This follows multiple unsuccessful attempts on behalf of Bitcoin, as well as most other leading altcoins, to reclaim pivotal technical levels going into the last few days of 2025.

As we reported yesterday, Bitcoin was trying to breach $90,000 on what seemed like the first sign of sustainable gains in the past few days. Those attempts were for not, unfortunately.

At the time of this writing, BTC has retraced by roughly 2.5% in the past 24 hours, currently trading around $87,5000.

The total liquidations for the same period stand at around $250 million, marking an increase of 27% compared to the previous day. Naturally, almost $200 million of those were long traders, according to data from Coinglass.

The crash came following the push above $90,000, as the price reached as high as $90,536 (on Bitstamp).

At this rate, Bitcoin is set to close the fourth quarter of 2025, charting a loss of around 22%. This would mark its weakest Q4 performance since the bear market in 2018. On-chain signals, macro pressure, as well as a notably fading speculative activity, all point to a fragile phase, at least in the short term.

Most of the leading altcoins are trading well in the red. Ethereum also failed to sustain its price above $3,000 and is currently located at around $2,950, charting a loss similar to that of BTC.

SOL, TRX, DOGE, ADA, XRP, BNB, and many others are down between 1.5% and 2%, while Zcash (ZEC) and Monero (XMR), both privacy-oriented coins, are down a more sustainable 6% on the day. Hyperliquid's HYPE is also down by 4.4%.

Today's biggest gainer is Provenance Blockchain's HASH token, which is up 8.4% in the past 24 hours, followed by Rain (up 6.5%).

On the other hand, Midnight (NIGHT) lost the most, as the token plunged by a whopping 21%. Next in line is PUMP – the native cryptocurrency of the popular token issuance platform on Solana – Pump.fun. It's down 13% over the same period.

Yes, tokenization of real-world assets is rapidly becoming a key trend in modern finance. It turns physical or traditional assets like real estate, private credit, or government bonds into digital tokens that can be traded and managed more easily. This makes investing more open, transparent, and flexible for both large institutions and everyday people. If you are exploring future skills in this space, blockchain technology courses are a smart way to start.

Tokenization means representing ownership of a real-world asset with digital tokens on a blockchain. Each token acts like proof of ownership. For example, instead of needing to buy an entire property, you could own just a small fraction through tokens.

This approach makes expensive or illiquid assets available to more people. It also creates new ways to trade, track, and manage investments without relying on slow or outdated systems.

The market for tokenized assets is growing quickly. In 2022, it was worth about 5 billion dollars. By mid-2025, it had already grown to nearly 24 billion dollars. Forecasts suggest this number could rise into the trillions by the end of the decade, depending on regulation and adoption.

Real estate stands out as a big opportunity. Deloitte projects that tokenized real estate in the United States could reach 4 trillion dollars by 2035. Private credit and tokenized U.S. treasuries are also among the leading categories right now.

Several drivers explain why tokenization has become so important:

Banks and asset managers are already experimenting with tokenized money market funds and treasuries. Big players like Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon are taking part.

Some governments are offering clearer rules or regulatory sandboxes that reduce legal risk for businesses.

Advances in blockchain, smart contracts, custody, and interoperability are making tokenization more practical.

Investors can buy fractions of assets, making them more accessible. Asset owners can also unlock capital that was tied up.

Transactions are recorded on the blockchain, providing traceability. Settlement can be faster and cheaper with fewer intermediaries.

Even with rapid growth, tokenization faces hurdles:

Here are some of the most active areas for tokenization today:

Here's a table that helps explain how tokenization changes the picture for investors and institutions:

Traditional Assets vs Tokenized Assets

Many experts believe tokenization will integrate with both traditional finance and decentralized finance. Institutions will use it to issue and trade assets in a more efficient way, while individuals gain new access to markets that were once out of reach.

The biggest question is how regulation and secondary markets evolve. Liquidity will determine if tokenization is a real revolution or just a niche. If standards, trust, and global rules catch up, then tokenization could reshape finance at scale.

If you are in finance, marketing, or technology, tokenization is not just theory. It is already happening with bonds, credit, and real estate. This makes it important to upskill and learn how to apply these tools in practice.

For people interested in careers at the intersection of finance and AI, the Data Science Certification is useful to understand how data powers tokenized markets. If you are aiming to lead in business transformation, the Marketing and Business Certification will help you learn how to drive adoption of new technologies.

Tokenization of real-world assets is not a distant future. It is already here and growing fast. From treasuries to real estate, billions of dollars in value are now tokenized and traded. The benefits are clear: more access, faster settlement, and greater transparency. The challenges are also real: regulation, trust, and liquidity.

Whether tokenization becomes the backbone of finance will depend on how quickly these hurdles are addressed. But all signs point to a future where assets live on blockchain and are easier for everyone to own and trade.

Residential News » Miami Edition | By WPJ Staff | December 23, 2025  7:27 AM ET



Digital currencies like Bitcoin, long associated with volatile trading and speculative finance, are increasingly being examined for a more utilitarian role in one of the world's oldest and least digitized asset classes: real estate. From cross-border property purchases to fund settlements and rental payments, proponents argue that blockchain-based currencies could eventually streamline transactions that today remain slow, fragmented, and costly.

Real estate is uniquely exposed to the shortcomings of legacy financial infrastructure. Property deals often involve multiple intermediaries, manual escrow processes, jurisdictional compliance hurdles, and international wire transfers that can take days or weeks to settle. For global investors, foreign-exchange costs and capital controls further complicate participation. These inefficiencies have prompted a new wave of experimentation around digital currencies designed specifically for real estate rather than for general consumer payments.

One emerging concept is the use of stablecoins--digital tokens pegged to traditional currencies--as settlement rails for property transactions. In theory, a dollar-backed stablecoin could function as digital cash, allowing buyers, sellers, lenders, and service providers to move funds instantly, with full auditability and without exposure to price volatility.

A frequently cited example is TransactionCOIN, an emerging USD-backed stablecoin designed explicitly for real estate transactions. Unlike cryptocurrencies that fluctuate in value, TransactionCOIN would be fully collateralized by U.S. dollar reserves and used primarily for payments, escrow, and settlement across the real estate lifecycle. In practice, that could mean earnest money deposits placed on-chain, closing proceeds released automatically once contractual conditions are met, or rent and mortgage payments settled in real time rather than through batch-processed banking systems.

The implications extend beyond individual property sales. Cross-border real estate investing--already a multi trillion-dollar market--could be materially altered if capital could move frictionlessly while remaining denominated in dollars. Investors in Asia or the Middle East, for example, could deploy funds into U.S. or European assets without navigating correspondent banks or currency conversion, while still maintaining dollar exposure. Proponents argue that this could broaden the global investor base and lower the cost of capital for property owners.

Stablecoins also intersect with another developing trend: the tokenization of real estate assets. Tokenization refers to representing ownership interests, debt, or income streams as digital tokens that can be issued, traded, and settled on blockchain networks. While the concept has attracted attention for years, liquidity and settlement challenges have limited adoption.

That is where projects such as RealEstateCOIN, an AI-managed global real estate token fund proposed by World Property Bank, come into focus. The fund concept envisions institutional-grade exposure to tokenized real estate debt, equity, credit, and derivative instruments across global markets. Portfolio allocation and risk management would be managed by AI-driven systems, with issuance and trading conducted on emerging real estate token exchanges such as World Property Exchange, and other existing tier-1 crypto exchanges.

In this model, a stablecoin such as TransactionCOIN serves as the connective tissue of the ecosystem, acting as the native settlement currency for buying and selling RealEstateCOIN and other institutional-grade real estate tokens, distributing rental income or dividends, and redeeming investor capital. By standardizing settlement around a single digital dollar, proponents argue the system can reduce operational complexity while enhancing transparency for both investors and regulators.

Mortgage finance, private credit and real estate debt markets represent another potential use case. Loan origination, servicing and payoff processes remain heavily manual and geographically siloed. Digital currencies could enable near-instant loan funding, automated interest and principal payments, and real-time reporting for investors in mortgage-backed instruments. For lenders, that could translate into faster capital turnover; for borrowers, quicker access to financing.

Operational payments represent a more incremental but arguably more immediate application. Property managers, developers, and owners handle recurring payments to contractors, utilities, insurers, and tax authorities. Using programmable digital dollars, these payments could be automated, reconciled instantly, and recorded immutably, reducing administrative overhead and disputes.

Still, significant hurdles remain. Regulatory clarity varies widely by jurisdiction, and real estate transactions are among the most heavily regulated financial activities in the world. Any digital currency used at scale would need robust know-your-customer and anti-money laundering controls, clear governance frameworks, and transparent reserve management. Institutional adoption will likely depend less on technological novelty and more on trust, compliance, and integration with existing legal systems.

Supporters of real estate-focused digital currencies argue that the goal is not to bypass regulation but to modernize it. By embedding compliance rules directly into programmable payment systems, they say, regulators could gain better visibility into transactions rather than less.

As concepts like TransactionCOIN and RealEstateCOIN move toward deployment and seek broader adoption, what is increasingly clear is that the conversation around digital currencies in real estate is shifting. Instead of speculative trading, the focus is moving toward digital infrastructure -- how money moves, settles, and is accounted for in the world's largest asset class: Real Estate.

World Property Bank founder Michael Gerrity says, ""If that shift continues, digital currencies may not replace traditional real estate finance overnight. But they could quietly become the rails beneath it, digitally moving trillions of dollars annually and reshaping how property is bought, sold, leased, financed, and financially managed on a global scale.""

SYDNEY, Dec. 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Immutable, the leading platform for next-generation games, today announced the official launch of Mintory, a new game economy community designed to support player-driven growth, engagement, and rewards across connected game experiences. Mintory debuts on Immutable with its first featured title, Ragnarok: Sharing Hero NFT, expanding the global reach of the long-running Ragnarok franchise.

Built to complement modern online games, Mintory introduces social, progression, and collectible systems that extend player engagement beyond gameplay. Through Immutable Play, players will soon be able to participate in launch events, earn in-game rewards, compete on leaderboards, and access limited collectible drops tied to participating titles.

Ragnarok: Sharing Hero NFT Brings Large-Scale Faction Battles to the Ragnarok Universe

The first title to join Mintory is Ragnarok: Sharing Hero NFT, a new entry in the Ragnarok series focused on large-scale, real-time faction warfare. Players compete across Midland PvP and MVP ranking battles as two opposing forces, Cosmos and Chaos, vie for control of the battlefield.

The balance of power shifts dynamically based on player activity, directly influencing territory control and reward distribution. To maintain competitive integrity, automated systems prevent long-term dominance by a single faction through measures such as character creation limits, ensuring a fair and evolving competitive environment.

The game combines these large-scale systems with the hallmarks of the Ragnarok franchise, including:

Cooperative Progression Through Character Sharing

At the core of Ragnarok: Sharing Hero NFT is a new Character Sharing System, enabling players to lend and utilize characters outside traditional party structures. This system allows groups to form powerful knight squads capable of taking on Demon Lord raids, Kingdom missions, and progression challenges.

Players who share characters receive in-game rewards, while those borrowing characters gain access to new strategic options. The result is a cooperative system designed to encourage teamwork, long-term progression, and community-driven play.

Community Features, Galleries, and Collectible Rewards

Mintory extends the game experience with community-focused features that allow players to showcase their in-game assets through a Gallery system, interact with other players, and climb social rankings tied to participation. To celebrate the onboarding of Ragnarok: Sharing Hero NFT, Mintory will also host a limited-time collectible figure event, blending the Ragnarok brand with premium physical collectibles.

A developer representative said:

""With real-time faction shifts and the new Character Sharing system, players can expect deeper strategy and more meaningful cooperation than ever before.""

Robbie Ferguson, Co-founder & President of Immutable, added:

""Mintory represents a strong example of how connected game communities can expand player engagement, and we're excited to support its launch on Immutable.""

Funigloo Named as Mintory's First Development Partner

Mintory's first development partner is Funigloo, a global game studio founded in 2008 with more than 17 years of experience. The studio is known for titles including Dragonica Mobile, Seal Mobile, and LaTale W, and previously collaborated with Gravity on Ragnarok Labyrinth NFT.

VERACITY IN GAMING

VERACITY IN GAMING

Based on Sega's Code of Jokers arcade TCG, the new title was planned to launch outside of Japan in late 2025.

Developer Jokers, a company founded by former Sega staff, announced on December 22 that it has halted development of Code of Jokers Evolutions, a blockchain mobile game it had been working on under official license from Sega. 

Originally announced in March this year, Code of Jokers Evolutions was unveiled as a digital card game based on Sega's arcade trading card game IP. The arcade version of Code of Jokers was in circulation from 2013 to 2019, and it received a short-lived mobile version called Code of Jokers Pocket (also developed by Sega) in 2017, which ended services the following year. 

The new Code of Jokers Evolutions was announced as a revival of the franchise, inheriting key features of the original Code of Jokers while integrating new gimmicks like user-to-user trading using blockchain technology. Development was originally underway with an international release planned for 2025 and a domestic release planned by the end of 2026. However, in its new announcement, developer Jokers says it has decided to cancel the title “after considering recent changes in the Web3 game market environment.” While the company doesn't go into the details, the decision seems consistent with current tendencies in the Japanese game industry. While it happened a bit later than overseas, Japan's NFT game fad appears to be fizzling out even in the eyes of the people making them. 

As mentioned, Jokers is a game company founded by former Sega staff Yasuhiro Nishiyama (producer of the original Code of Joker, Sangokushi Taisen) and Wataru Sato (Bakugan producer at Sega Toys). With the announcement of Code of Jokers Evolutions's cancellation, the developer says it will be accepting buybacks from users who purchased the collaboration NFT pack released ahead of the game's launch via this portal.

Statement on the introduction of the Cyber Security and Resilience (Network and Information Systems) Bill in the House of Commons 

12 November 2025: John Edwards, UK Information Commissioner, said: 

“We welcome the introduction of the Cyber Security and Resilience (Network and Information Systems) Bill in the House of Commons and look forward to seeing it progress through the parliamentary process. This is an important piece of legislation that will strengthen the country's cyber resilience and ultimately better protect people's data.""

“Our response to the bill will be published in due course.” 

23 December 2025: We have now published our response to the Cyber Security and Resilience Bill.

A joint investigation has been launched by Information Commissioner's Office and the Data Protection authorities of Jersey, Guernsey, and Isle of Man into the cyber incident that compromised data of the trade union Prospect Custodian Trustees Ltd (Prospect) in June 2025. 

We have fined password manager provider LastPass UK Ltd £1.2 million following a 2022 data breach that compromised the personal information of up to 1.6 million of its UK users.

It is important for your customers to receive timely and relevant information to support decisions about their finances, while having their direct marketing preferences and data protection rights respected. This is crucial in order for customers to trust the information they receive, helping them to make informed decisions and pursue their financial goals.

We have called for urgent improvements across UK local authorities and Health and Social Care Trusts in Northern Ireland after warning that people trying to access their own care records are being let down.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has provided an update on its action to tackle cookie compliance, which has brought the vast majority of the UK's most used websites into compliance with rules on the use of advertising cookies. 

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has issued a series of enforcement notices and practice recommendations to several public authorities after identifying significant failures to comply with the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act 2000.

The ICO yesterday announced that they will be scrutinising how popular mobile games played by children in the UK protect their online privacy.

As a regulator, sometimes we need to intervene directly with organisations to drive change. But our goal is always broader: to raise standards across entire sectors. That means choosing the right regulatory tools to hold decision-makers accountable, set clear expectations, and secure lasting improvements.

We are calling for views on new guidance setting out how we approach investigations and take enforcement action. ","{'href': 'https://www.wired-gov.net', 'title': 'Wired Gov'}","cryptocurrency"

Solstice YieldVault Mechanics

Solstice's YieldVault is a permissionless, on-chain yield-generating engine on Solana that provides institutional-grade, delta-neutral returns using the protocol's synthetic stablecoin USX.

It democratizes access to sophisticated trading strategies typically reserved for hedge funds, with a proven track record of consistent positive returns, no negative months over multi-year backtests and live performance, ~11-21% APY depending on market conditions, high Sharpe ratio.

The base synthetic stablecoin, fully overcollateralized backed by fiat-stablecoins like USDC/USDT initially, pegged 1:1 to USD. It's designed for velocity—swaps, payments, and DeFi composability—while maintaining stability.

eUSX: The yield-bearing token. A non-rebasing, appreciating asset that represents your proportional share of the YieldVault's net asset value (NAV). Lock USX into the YieldVault via the app at solstice.finance. You receive an equal amount of eUSX, 1:1 mint ratio initially.

Your USX is deployed into the vault's strategies. The vault uses delta-neutral strategies to generate returns independent of crypto price direction. Long spot assets while shorting perpetual futures or vice versa across multiple exchanges and pairs. Collects funding payments every ~8 hours from market imbalances, perps traders pay spot holders when crowded.

Hedged staking/positions: Balanced exposure to capture premiums without net directional risk. Spread across multiple CEXs/DEXs for scale and efficiency, with automated rebalancing.

Yield is dripped back into the vault as additional USX rewards. eUSX appreciates over time relative to USX exchange rate increases periodically, auto-compounding yields without rebasing. Your principal USX enters a cooldown period to ensure fairness and prevent gaming epochs/rewards.

During cooldown: No further yield accrual. After cooldown: Withdraw full USX (principal + accrued yield reflected in the improved eUSX: USX ratio). Zero net directional exposure. Strict caps per strategy, collateral buffers, and automated monitoring. Battle-tested for all market cycles.

eUSX is liquid and usable in Solana DeFi like lending on Kamino, LP on Raydium/Orca, yield trading on Exponent while still earning base vault yield + partner rewards. Performance highlights is around 11.5% average, 21.5% in 2024, 3-year Sharpe ~7.

No negative months; stable baseline yield. Earn Flares (points) for deposits, convertible to $SLX governance token. Multipliers for longer holds or partner integrations. Smart contract risks audited, but not zero.

While delta-neutral minimizes price risk, funding rates can fluctuate; extreme events could impact. Cooldown on withdrawals reduces instant liquidity. Market/volatility risks in underlying perps/spot trades.

YieldVault turns idle stables into productive capital with minimal user intervention. For hands-on access: Mint USX > Deposit in YieldVault > Hold/use eUSX. Always DYOR; yields vary with markets.

The Council of the European Union, an EU body that amends legislation and commits national governments to adopting the bloc's laws, said it backs the European Central Bank's plan to explore an official digital currency, calling it an evolution of money and a tool for financial inclusion.

In a Friday post on its website, the Council, however, said the ECB will need to set limits on the total value that can be held in online accounts and digital wallets at any one time to “avoid the digital euro being used as a store of value” to prevent it from having any impact on financial stability.

The Council comprises government ministers from the 27 nations in the bloc and shapes EU law with the European Parliament. Its endorsement signals broad national alignment around the central bank digital currency' design, increasing the likelihood that forthcoming legislation will reflect the ECB's approach.

“The holding limits are not just about abstract financial stability,” Edwin Mata, co-founder and CEO of tokenization platform Bricken, told CoinDesk. “They are about preventing the digital euro from competing directly with bank deposits. If people could hold unlimited digital euros, deposits could shift instantly from commercial banks to the ECB, especially during periods of stress, effectively accelerating bank runs.”

The ECB has warned about similar risks posed by stablecoins. Its officials have pointed to dollar-pegged assets, such as Tether's USDT and Circle Internet's (CRCL) USDC, cautioning that “significant growth in stablecoins could cause retail deposit outflows, diminishing an important source of funding for banks and leaving them with more volatile funding overall.”

The ECB's concern goes beyond vague “financial stability, "" Pedro Birman, CEO of Quadra Trade, said.

“In the euro system, most money is created by commercial banks through lending,” he said in an interview. “If digital euros could be freely held as a store of value, large-scale migration from bank deposits into self-custodied ECB money would shrink banks' deposit bases. That would directly constrain credit creation, raise funding costs for banks, and act as an unintended monetary tightening, especially in stress periods.”

That concern is echoed by others who see the caps as a necessary design tool to protect the balance of the financial system.

“The message is clear: the digital euro is being designed as a payments rail, not a balance sheet, and the ceilings are there to make sure it never becomes one,” said Amber Ghaddar, founder and managing director at The 200Bn Club and Nexera.

According to Ghaddar, large digital-euro balances would also risk weakening monetary-policy transmission, potentially forcing the ECB into difficult decisions, such as whether to pay interest on retail central-bank money or accept reduced control over interest rates.

Still, others remain skeptical. While the ECB frames its policy around financial stability, the effect is also to shield banks from new forms of competition, said Jonatan Randin, senior market analyst at PrimeXBT.

He pointed to ECB analysis published in February 2024 that said holding limits are designed to preserve the economic function of commercial banks and protect the corporate deposit base. A Copenhagen Economics study estimated such a move could cut banks' net interest income by 7% on average, rising to 13% for smaller lenders.

“Banks profit from holding customer deposits and lending that money out,” Randin said. “A digital euro without strict limits would give citizens a risk-free alternative, reducing banks' access to cheap funding.”

Arthur Breitman, founder of the Tezos blockchain, made a similar point. He said the measure is intended to prevent sudden deposit flight from commercial banks into what would effectively be riskless central-bank money. While that protects banks' funding models, he added, it also reflects how dependent the current system is on commercial banks to extend credit.

Charles d'Haussy, CEO of the dYdX Foundation, pointed to the contrast in global approaches. “Europe is heavily committed to a sovereign digital CBDC, which is the digital euro, to maintain monetary control and privacy in a fully regulated framework,” he said. “Much of the rest of the world, especially the U.S. and dollar-centric regions, favors private stablecoins for their speed, innovation, and global scale.”

At its core, the debate reflects a tension at the heart of central bank digital currency design: how to offer the public a trusted, modern payment tool without undermining the financial system that already exists. The ECB and EU policymakers see holding limits as a necessary guardrail to maintain that balance. Critics, meanwhile, warn that those same limits may cap the digital euro's usefulness, and protect incumbents from meaningful competition.

Both companies announced stablecoin ventures in the past week.

Buy now, pay later company Klarna Group and payment processor Shift4 Payments are embarking on ventures involving stablecoins as they seek to capitalize on the digital currency trend.

London-based Klarna said it is developing the capacity to raise funding with the digital assets through a partnership with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. Separately, Allentown, Pennsylvania-based Shift4 announced Monday the launch of a stablecoin settlement platform available to the company's merchant customers.

Stablecoins are tied to the value of a fiat currency such as the U.S. dollar or the euro, which theoretically makes them more stable in value than more volatile digital cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. 

Klarna, which is licensed as a bank in the European Union, ""plans to raise short-term funding from institutional investors denominated in USDC utilizing Coinbase's digitally native infrastructure,"" the company said in a Friday news release.

The process is still in development, the release said. A Klarna spokesperson declined to provide more information on the timeline.

USDC is a stablecoin pegged to the value of the dollar and is issued by Circle Internet Group.

Meanwhile, digital rival Shift4 said in a Monday news release that its new stablecoin platform will give merchants the ability to settle transactions involving digital assets outside of normal banking hours. 

That is one of several practical applications for stablecoins that payments executives have discussed in recent months.

A Shift4 spokesperson did not respond to a message asking when the company's merchant customers will be able to use the platform to send and receive payments using digital currencies.

The passage of the Genius Act, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump in July and creates a regulatory framework for stablecoins, is largely expected to turbocharge the use of the digital assets. 

The two firms are hardly alone in taking an interest in stablecoins. Payment processors such as PayPal Holdings and Fiserv have both introduced their own stablecoins and Stripe introduced stablecoin payments for subscriptions in October.

Residential News » Miami Edition | By WPJ Staff | December 23, 2025  7:27 AM ET



Digital currencies like Bitcoin, long associated with volatile trading and speculative finance, are increasingly being examined for a more utilitarian role in one of the world's oldest and least digitized asset classes: real estate. From cross-border property purchases to fund settlements and rental payments, proponents argue that blockchain-based currencies could eventually streamline transactions that today remain slow, fragmented, and costly.

Real estate is uniquely exposed to the shortcomings of legacy financial infrastructure. Property deals often involve multiple intermediaries, manual escrow processes, jurisdictional compliance hurdles, and international wire transfers that can take days or weeks to settle. For global investors, foreign-exchange costs and capital controls further complicate participation. These inefficiencies have prompted a new wave of experimentation around digital currencies designed specifically for real estate rather than for general consumer payments.

One emerging concept is the use of stablecoins--digital tokens pegged to traditional currencies--as settlement rails for property transactions. In theory, a dollar-backed stablecoin could function as digital cash, allowing buyers, sellers, lenders, and service providers to move funds instantly, with full auditability and without exposure to price volatility.

A frequently cited example is TransactionCOIN, an emerging USD-backed stablecoin designed explicitly for real estate transactions. Unlike cryptocurrencies that fluctuate in value, TransactionCOIN would be fully collateralized by U.S. dollar reserves and used primarily for payments, escrow, and settlement across the real estate lifecycle. In practice, that could mean earnest money deposits placed on-chain, closing proceeds released automatically once contractual conditions are met, or rent and mortgage payments settled in real time rather than through batch-processed banking systems.

The implications extend beyond individual property sales. Cross-border real estate investing--already a multi trillion-dollar market--could be materially altered if capital could move frictionlessly while remaining denominated in dollars. Investors in Asia or the Middle East, for example, could deploy funds into U.S. or European assets without navigating correspondent banks or currency conversion, while still maintaining dollar exposure. Proponents argue that this could broaden the global investor base and lower the cost of capital for property owners.

Stablecoins also intersect with another developing trend: the tokenization of real estate assets. Tokenization refers to representing ownership interests, debt, or income streams as digital tokens that can be issued, traded, and settled on blockchain networks. While the concept has attracted attention for years, liquidity and settlement challenges have limited adoption.

That is where projects such as RealEstateCOIN, an AI-managed global real estate token fund proposed by World Property Bank, come into focus. The fund concept envisions institutional-grade exposure to tokenized real estate debt, equity, credit, and derivative instruments across global markets. Portfolio allocation and risk management would be managed by AI-driven systems, with issuance and trading conducted on emerging real estate token exchanges such as World Property Exchange, and other existing tier-1 crypto exchanges.

In this model, a stablecoin such as TransactionCOIN serves as the connective tissue of the ecosystem, acting as the native settlement currency for buying and selling RealEstateCOIN and other institutional-grade real estate tokens, distributing rental income or dividends, and redeeming investor capital. By standardizing settlement around a single digital dollar, proponents argue the system can reduce operational complexity while enhancing transparency for both investors and regulators.

Mortgage finance, private credit and real estate debt markets represent another potential use case. Loan origination, servicing and payoff processes remain heavily manual and geographically siloed. Digital currencies could enable near-instant loan funding, automated interest and principal payments, and real-time reporting for investors in mortgage-backed instruments. For lenders, that could translate into faster capital turnover; for borrowers, quicker access to financing.

Operational payments represent a more incremental but arguably more immediate application. Property managers, developers, and owners handle recurring payments to contractors, utilities, insurers, and tax authorities. Using programmable digital dollars, these payments could be automated, reconciled instantly, and recorded immutably, reducing administrative overhead and disputes.

Still, significant hurdles remain. Regulatory clarity varies widely by jurisdiction, and real estate transactions are among the most heavily regulated financial activities in the world. Any digital currency used at scale would need robust know-your-customer and anti-money laundering controls, clear governance frameworks, and transparent reserve management. Institutional adoption will likely depend less on technological novelty and more on trust, compliance, and integration with existing legal systems.

Supporters of real estate-focused digital currencies argue that the goal is not to bypass regulation but to modernize it. By embedding compliance rules directly into programmable payment systems, they say, regulators could gain better visibility into transactions rather than less.

As concepts like TransactionCOIN and RealEstateCOIN move toward deployment and seek broader adoption, what is increasingly clear is that the conversation around digital currencies in real estate is shifting. Instead of speculative trading, the focus is moving toward digital infrastructure -- how money moves, settles, and is accounted for in the world's largest asset class: Real Estate.

World Property Bank founder Michael Gerrity says, ""If that shift continues, digital currencies may not replace traditional real estate finance overnight. But they could quietly become the rails beneath it, digitally moving trillions of dollars annually and reshaping how property is bought, sold, leased, financed, and financially managed on a global scale.""

With digital assets increasingly entering the mainstream, the threat of cyberattacks is on the rise, putting investor trust in cryptocurrencies at risk. The recent Kuaishou cyberattack serves as a wake-up call, exposing the vulnerabilities that lurk within digital platforms. As the fintech world evolves, we need to grasp the crucial role of cybersecurity in protecting investments. In this post, I'll break down the fallout from such attacks on cryptocurrency markets, share some best practices for boosting cybersecurity in fintech, and discuss how regulation is shaping the future of crypto businesses. Let's dive into this urgent call for stronger defenses against cyber threats.

On December 22, 2025, Kuaishou Technology, a major player listed in Hong Kong, faced a cyberattack that hit its live streaming feature. They confirmed the attack, which temporarily disrupted the function but did not impact their other services. Thanks to a swift response and the activation of a contingency plan, Kuaishou managed to limit the potential fallout, allowing the streaming service to gradually return to normal. Despite a decline in stock prices, the incident highlighted just how important cybersecurity is in today's digital landscape, especially for companies in fintech.

Cyberattacks can deal a serious blow to investor trust in cryptocurrency systems. High-profile attacks, like the one on Kuaishou, shine a light on the weaknesses that can lead to market fluctuations. When faith in digital platforms takes a hit, investors often react by selling their assets or pulling out of the market completely, which can send shockwaves through the broader market. Research suggests that the indirect losses from plummeting token values frequently outstrip the direct theft amounts, underscoring the necessity for strong cybersecurity measures to protect investor interests.

To bolster cybersecurity, fintech startups need to take the initiative. Here are a few practices to consider:

Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): This adds an additional security layer, requiring users to provide various forms of verification before accessing their accounts.
Utilize End-to-End Encryption: Safeguard sensitive data in transit and at rest with military-grade standards, like AES-256.
Conduct Regular Security Audits: Frequent evaluations of security protocols can uncover weaknesses and ensure adherence to industry standards.
Adopt a Zero-Trust Model: This approach recognizes that threats could come from anywhere, necessitating constant verification of user identities and device security.
Educate Employees on Cyber Hygiene: Regular training on identifying phishing attempts and other cyber threats can empower employees to serve as the first line of defense.

While the Kuaishou cyberattack wasn't directly linked to cryptocurrency, it could lead to regulatory scrutiny of tech security protocols in the fintech sector. As cyber threats develop, regulatory standards must keep up. Companies should remain vigilant about compliance requirements and adjust their security measures as needed. This increased focus on protecting digital platforms could usher in stricter regulations, particularly for financial markets, highlighting the need for robust cybersecurity frameworks.

As the fintech landscape continues to change, the significance of cybersecurity cannot be ignored. The Kuaishou cyberattack serves as a reminder of the vulnerabilities that exist in digital platforms and their potential impact on investor confidence in cryptocurrencies. By adopting best practices for cybersecurity and staying up-to-date with regulatory shifts, fintech startups can better shield themselves from cyber threats. The future of cybersecurity in fintech hinges on proactive measures, continuous enhancement, and a commitment to protecting digital assets.

The U.S. dollar index (DXY) index is lower again on Tuesday, trading not far above its 2025 low.

After a strong gain in the weeks following the November 2024 election of Donald Trump, the greenback declined sharply throughout the first half of 2025 and has remained in a choppy pattern near multi-year low levels for the past few months.

The dollar's large 2025 drop initially was mostly accompanied by expected broader market reaction, with things like stocks, gold and bitcoin BTC$87,497.82 all rising sharply to new records. 

The story since October, though, is somewhat different — stocks and other hard assets have continued to surge — in fact, gold, silver and copper all rose sharply again on Tuesday to reach new record highs — but bitcoin and broader crypto markets have endured brutal bear moves.

The DXY index is now trading just above a major long-term support level that extends back to the 2008 global financial crisis. This level has been tested and held multiple times, most recently in July and September of this year.

As several foreign central banks, including the Bank of Japan, move toward tighter monetary policy, the U.S. Federal Reserve is facing growing pressure, most notably from President Trump, to lower interest rates. This divergence raises the possibility that the dollar could fall below that major support.

While the weak dollar this year hasn't yet had any salutary effect on bitcoin, perhaps a break of that long-term support could be the news that finally spurs a reversal of crypto's downtrend.

This is a technical analysis post by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

Bitcoin's BTC$87,497.82 late-year attempt to regain poise ran into a price ceiling Monday, forcing prices back below $88,000.

That ceiling is defined by a descending trendline drawn from October's record high above $126,000, connecting the peaks of subsequent shallow recoveries—most notably the $116,400 high.

This trendline swatted back attempts to establish a foothold above $90,000 on Monday, reinforcing the ""staircase-down"" pattern that has plagued the largest cryptocurrency throughout the fourth quarter. By failing to clear this hurdle, BTC has printed another ""lower high,"" signaling a resurgence of sellers near the resistance line and stalling the momentum needed to challenge the six-figure mark.

Consequently, the immediate outlook remains bearish as long as prices hold below the trendline. The latest rejection shifts focus toward the $84,000–$84,500 support zone, followed by the November low near $80,000.

To revive the bullish outlook, BTC must overcome the trendline resistance. Such a breakout, especially against the backdrop of a sliding dollar index, could accelerate gains toward the $100,000 mark.

The U.S. federal banking watchdog signaled a regulatory shift that could fundamentally reshape competition in trading services across the United States.

That shift became apparent today, after Bloomberg reported that JPMorgan is exploring crypto trading services for institutional investors, marking one of the clearest indications yet that Wall Street banks are preparing to move beyond experimentation and into execution. CoinDesk contacted JPMorgan and they declined to comment on Bloomberg's article.

The report follows a statement by a JPMorgan spokesperson, who previously told CoinDesk the bank was “digesting and assessing” recent guidance from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), confirming national banks can engage in crypto trading services.

The guidance, issued in an OCC Dec. 9 interpretive letter, confirmed that financial institutions may facilitate so-called “riskless principal” crypto-asset transactions, effectively allowing them to broker crypto trades without holding inventory or taking market risk.

The OCC statement suggests the regulator is intent on pulling crypto activity deeper into the regulated banking system, and on ensuring banks participate rather than sit on the sidelines, because, as experts say, if they do not move into crypto trading services now, others will.

“The market consequences will be significant,” said Burçak Ünsal, ÜNSAL Attorneys at Law managing partner. He said that “armed with regulatory legitimacy and the trust that accompanies it, banks are poised to absorb a meaningful portion of retail order flow.""

""Stand-alone crypto exchanges that lack banking licenses will feel competitive pressure, particularly at the entry-level consumer segment,"" Ünsal added

Even before the OCC's latest clarification, several large U.S. banks had begun laying groundwork for crypto execution and distribution, often quietly and through intermediaries.

JPMorgan Chase has developed blockchain-based settlement infrastructure via its Kynexis platform and JPM Coin, while also offering crypto-linked products to institutional clients. Goldman Sachs has restarted its crypto trading desk, offering bitcoin and ether derivatives, as well as structured products to hedge funds and asset managers. BNY Mellon launched digital asset custody services for select institutional clients, integrating crypto into its existing custody and settlement stack.

More recently, banks, including Fidelity-affiliated entities and regional lenders, have partnered with crypto market makers and exchanges to provide execution, custody, or fiat rails, arrangements that could now expand into direct brokerage models under the OCC's interpretation.

“This is a green light for banks to offer crypto brokering, but not a free pass to run full exchanges or offer every asset to every customer,” said Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics and former senior analyst at eToro. “Banks can now broker crypto trades, and that means a lot of everyday users will prefer to buy their bitcoin from their bank instead of, for example, Binance.”

Crypto sector lawyers and market participants broadly agree that the OCC's framework is designed to let banks profit from crypto activity while minimizing exposure to volatility.

“Allowing regulated banks to facilitate crypto execution gives consumers more trust and removes friction that has slowed mainstream adoption,” said Ilies Larbi, founder of Ouinex Exchange. “But it also means banks could become dominant distribution channels for basic crypto exposure, putting pressure on retail-focused exchanges whose core revenue comes from spot trading and custody.”

Larbi noted that banks' ability to perform “riskless principal” execution gives them a structural advantage. “They can earn fees and provide crypto exposure without holding inventory or taking market risk,” he said.

That dynamic puts pressure on U.S.-focused retail exchanges, such as Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken, according to Keneabasi Umoren, a crypto market analyst and Web3 researcher.

“Wall Street can now legally rival crypto exchanges in the most profitable, low-risk part of the market,” Umoren said. “It won't kill exchanges, but it will squeeze U.S. spot-trading and custody revenue and push exchanges further into derivatives, DeFi and global markets.”

Kevin Lee, chief business officer at Gate, echoed that view, describing the OCC letter as “validation rather than disruption,” noting that “some volumes that would have gone to standalone platforms will migrate to bank channels over time.”

This would also help the traditional wealth management firms meet the demand of their clients for crypto-related financial services. “For mainstream retail and wealth-management clients, many customers will understandably prefer to transact inside their existing banking relationship,” Lee said.



The move follows a recent survey by Swiss software firm Avaloq found that the traditional wealth sector is under mounting pressure to deliver digital assets to wealthy clients.

In the UAE, for instance, 63% of ultra-rich investors have switched managers or are considering doing so, according to that survey.



Still, many observers expect banks to move cautiously.

“Banks are likely to focus on a small basket of highly liquid assets, bitcoin, ether, and regulated stablecoins, rather than the full spectrum of tokens and products crypto-native exchanges support,” Gate's Lee said. “Rollouts will be conservative and incremental.”

While experts called the moment a turning point, they stressed that the competition is unlikely to be a zero-sum game. Many banks will still rely on crypto-native firms for liquidity, pricing, routing and infrastructure, creating opportunities for partnerships rather than outright displacement.

“Exchanges that are well-capitalized, compliant and global will adapt by powering the plumbing,” Lee said, “instead of only competing at the front end for every retail ticket.”

The OCC has not designated banks as crypto exchanges. But it has essentially declared them open for crypto brokerage business, and in a sector where regulatory credibility is scarce, that alone may prove transformative.

“Wall Street basically just got the green light to step onto the field,” Alex Mavashev, founder of ScalerX, said. “Banks can now sit in the middle of crypto trades with regulation and trust behind them. That's a real threat to exchange margins.”

Spectacular Cosmic Collision Captured in New Hubble Image

NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured asteroids crashing into one another in a nearby planetary system around a star some 25 light-years away

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

When the solar system began to form, everything was chaos. A slew of rocky material was smashing together in a maelstrom that would eventually become the baby protoplanets, comets and asteroids that make up our cosmic neighborhood.

And now NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has captured a similar violent clash occurring around another star some 25 light-years away. The star, Fomalhaut, stands out as one of the brightest in the night sky and is known to be shrouded in bands of dust and debris.

Back in 2008 astronomers examining Fomalhaut discovered a potential planet orbiting the star—subsequent observations, however, showed that the orb was fading, leading some to question whether it was a planet or the debris left over from a collision between two smaller objects. By 2014 it had disappeared. And in a new study published in Science, astronomers describe how, in 2023, they found a different point of light that resembles the previously discovered object.

Its sudden appearance—and the proposed planet's disappearance—suggests both are the remnants of violent collisions between two massive objects. The observations cut against older hypotheses about such crashes, according to Paul Kalas, an astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley, and a co-author of the new study.

“Previous theory suggested that there should be one collision every 100,000 years, or longer. Here, in 20 years, we've seen two,” Kalas said in a statement. “If you had a movie of the last 3,000 years, and it was sped up so that every year was a fraction of a second, imagine how many flashes you'd see over that time. Fomalhaut's planetary system would be sparkling with these collisions.”

In the future, Kalas and his colleagues hope to use the James Webb Space Telescope to glean the composition of the dust left over from the crash, including any evidence it contains water ice. These and other observations of Fomalhaut and its surrounding debris could offer new clues to how planetary systems like our own coalesce and evolve.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","A Hidden Energy Source Was Found Underneath Texas","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/energy/a69849445/geothermal-us-border-energy-source/","Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:36:00 GMT","

The untapped reservoir has the potential to provide reliable renewable power.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

When talking about renewable energy, solar, wind, and even hydropower grab more attention in the U.S. than geothermal energy. However, it's worth noting that the U.S. is actually the world's leader in geothermal electricity generation at 4 gigawatts. 

Sounds good, right? Well, those numbers are relative to the country's overall energy output, which places geothermal at around only 0.4 percent. Compare that to, say, Iceland, which uses geothermal sources to generate 66 percent of its primary energy. It certainly seems like the U.S. has room for growth when it comes to geothermal power. 

One of those areas, according to an extensive report from the Bureau of Economic Geology (BEG) at the University of Texas at Austin, is near the town of Presidio in southwestern Texas. After receiving $15,000 for a feasibility study from the Presidio Municipal Development District in mid-2023, the researchers studied the area for nine months before concluding that it's ripe for geothermal development. And it's not just Presidio—it's the entire county, including towns like Marfa to the north.

“Bottom line is, the immediate area in Presidio, but the whole county, looks like a really good development target,” said UT Austin's Ken Wisian, who led the study. “As good or better than areas that are already being developed in Texas.”

That's largely due to new developments in geothermal energy. Usually, geothermal energy is best where hot water is available via permeable rock—the Geysers in California are a good example of this. However, techniques from the oil and gas industry (primarily hydraulic fracturing, or fracking) could potentially allow geothermal power to be generated by instead injecting water into areas with hot subsurface rock and letting the rocks heat the water before pumping through turbines. 

According to the report by UT Austin, this area along the Rio Grande—in the Permian basin north of the county, which doesn't have oil and gas wells—does have some of the “hottest subsurface rock east of the Rocky Mountains,” according to Marfa Public Radio. While the area isn't exactly a population center, this untapped resource could bring industry and other jobs to the area. It could also give oil and gas industries a renewable transition, as many existing technologies can be used in geothermal production. 

Of course, fracking for geothermal energy doesn't come risk free. 

In 2018, South Korea experienced the second largest earthquake in its modern history due to a geothermal plant, because water injection can cause tremors similar to fracking. While local leaders are still excited by the idea, according to Marfa Public Radio, next steps for a possible geothermal project along the U.S.-Mexico border won't be discussed until later this year.

Blinking is something people do automatically, much like breathing, without giving it much thought. While most scientific research on blinking has focused on eyesight, a new study from Concordia University explores a different connection. The research looks at how blinking relates to cognitive processes, including how the brain filters out background noise so we can focus on speech in busy environments.

The findings were published in the journal Trends in Hearing. In the paper, researchers outline two experiments designed to observe how blinking behavior changes when people are exposed to different listening conditions.

Fewer Blinks Signal Greater Mental Effort

The researchers discovered that people tend to blink less when they are working harder to understand speech in noisy settings. This reduction in blinking appears to reflect the mental effort involved in listening closely during everyday conversations. Importantly, the pattern stayed the same regardless of lighting conditions -- participants blinked at similar rates whether the room was bright, dim, or dark.

""We wanted to know if blinking was impacted by environmental factors and how it related to executive function,"" says lead author Pénélope Coupal, an Honours student at the Laboratory for Hearing and Cognition. ""For instance, is there a strategic timing of a person's blinks so they would not miss out on what is being said?""

The results showed that blinking does appear to be timed in a purposeful way.

""We don't just blink randomly,"" says Coupal. ""In fact, we blink systematically less when salient information is presented.""

Measuring Blinks During Challenging Listening Tasks

The study included nearly 50 adult participants. Each person sat in a soundproof room and focused on a fixed cross displayed on a screen. They listened to short spoken sentences through headphones while the level of background noise changed. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ranged from very quiet to highly distracting.

Participants wore eye-tracking glasses that captured every blink and recorded exactly when each blink occurred. Researchers divided each listening session into three phases: before the sentence played, while it was playing, and immediately afterward.

Blink rates dropped most noticeably during the sentences themselves, compared to the moments before and after. The decrease was strongest when background noise was loudest and speech was hardest to understand.

Lighting Does Not Explain the Effect

In a second experiment, the team tested blinking behavior again while changing the lighting conditions. Participants completed the listening tasks in dark, medium, and brightly lit rooms, across different SNR levels. The same blink suppression pattern appeared each time.

This consistency showed that the effect was driven by cognitive demands rather than changes in how much light entered the eyes.

Although individuals differed widely in how often they blinked overall -- some participant blinked as little as 10 times per minute, while others may have blinked 70 times per minute -- the overall trend was clear and statistically meaningful.

Blinks as a Tool for Studying Brain Function

Earlier research linking eye behavior to mental effort mostly relied on pupil dilation (pupillometry). In many cases, blinks were treated as unwanted interruptions and removed from the data. In contrast, this study revisited existing pupillometry data and focused directly on blink timing and frequency.

The researchers say the results support using blink rate as a simple and low-effort way to measure cognitive function, both in controlled laboratory experiments and in real-world situations.

""Our study suggests that blinking is associated with losing information, both visual and auditory,"" says co-author Mickael Deroche, an associate professor in the Department of Psychology.

""That is presumably why we suppress blinking when important information is coming. But to be fully convincing, we need to map out the precise timing and pattern of how visual/auditory information is lost during a blink. This is the logical next step, and a study is being led by postdoctoral fellow Charlotte Bigras. But these findings are far from trivial.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","MIT scientists strip cancer of its sugar shield","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251222044058.htm","Tue, 23 Dec 2025 13:56:20 GMT","

A research team from MIT and Stanford University has developed a new technique designed to push the immune system to go after tumor cells. The strategy is aimed at helping cancer immunotherapy succeed in far more patients than it does today.

At the center of the work is a way to undo a built in ""brake"" that tumors can trigger to keep immune cells from attacking. That brake is tied to sugars called glycans, which sit on the surface of cancer cells.

The scientists found that blocking these glycans with proteins known as lectins can greatly strengthen immune activity against cancer cells. To do this in a targeted way, they built multifunctional molecules called AbLecs that pair a lectin with an antibody that homes in on tumors.

""We created a new kind of protein therapeutic that can block glycan-based immune checkpoints and boost anti-cancer immune responses,"" says Jessica Stark, the Underwood-Prescott Career Development Professor in the departments of Biological Engineering and Chemical Engineering. ""Because glycans are known to restrain the immune response to cancer in multiple tumor types, we suspect our molecules could offer new and potentially more effective treatment options for many cancer patients.""

Stark, who is also a member of MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, led the study as the paper's lead author. Carolyn Bertozzi, a Stanford professor of chemistry and director of the Sarafan ChEM Institute, served as the senior author. The findings were published in Nature Biotechnology.

How Cancer Uses Immune Brakes

One of the biggest goals in cancer treatment is teaching the immune system to spot tumor cells and eliminate them. A major group of immunotherapy drugs called checkpoint inhibitors works by interrupting the interaction between two proteins, PD-1 and PD-L1. By blocking that connection, these medicines remove a brake that tumors use to keep immune cells such as T cells from killing cancer cells.

Checkpoint inhibitors that target the PD-1 PD-L1 pathway are already approved for several cancers. For some people, they can produce long lasting remission. For many others, however, they provide little benefit or none at all.

Because of that gap, researchers are searching for other ways tumors suppress the immune system. One promising target involves interactions between tumor glycans and receptors on immune cells.

Siglecs, Sialic Acid, and a Sugar Based Checkpoint

Glycans appear on nearly all living cells, but cancer cells often carry versions not found on healthy cells. Many of these tumor specific glycans include a sugar building block called sialic acid. When sialic acids attach to lectin receptors on immune cells, they can switch on an immune dampening pathway. The lectins that recognize sialic acid are called Siglecs.

""When Siglecs on immune cells bind to sialic acids on cancer cells, it puts the brakes on the immune response. It prevents that immune cell from becoming activated to attack and destroy the cancer cell, just like what happens when PD-1 binds to PD-L1,"" Stark says.

So far, no approved medicines directly target the Siglec sialic acid interaction, even though many approaches have been explored. One idea has been to create lectins that bind to sialic acids and block their contact with immune cells. But this has struggled because lectins typically do not bind strongly enough to build up in large numbers on the surface of cancer cells.

AbLecs Combine Antibodies and Lectins

To solve that problem, Stark and her team used antibodies as delivery vehicles to bring more lectins to tumors. The antibody portion targets cancer cells, and once it arrives, the attached lectin can bind sialic acid. That blocks sialic acid from engaging Siglec receptors on immune cells, which lifts the immune brake and lets immune cells including macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells attack the tumor.

""This lectin binding domain typically has relatively low affinity, so you can't use it by itself as a therapeutic. But, when the lectin domain is linked to a high-affinity antibody, you can get it to the cancer cell surface where it can bind and block sialic acids,"" Stark says.

A Plug and Play Design Tested in Cells and Mice

For this study, the researchers built an AbLec using trastuzumab, an antibody that binds to HER2 and is approved for treating breast, stomach, and colorectal cancers. To create the AbLec, they replaced one arm of the antibody with a lectin, choosing either Siglec-7 or Siglec-9.

In lab experiments with cultured cells, this AbLec changed how immune cells behaved, pushing them to attack and kill cancer cells.

The team also tested the AbLecs in mice engineered to express human Siglec receptors and human antibody receptors. After the mice were given cancer cells that formed lung metastases, treatment with the AbLec led to fewer lung metastases than treatment with trastuzumab alone.

The researchers also demonstrated that the approach is flexible. They could swap in different tumor targeting antibodies such as rituximab, which targets CD20, or cetuximab, which targets EGFR. They could also exchange the lectin portion to target other immunosuppressive glycans, or use antibodies that target checkpoint proteins such as PD-1.

""AbLecs are really plug-and-play. They're modular,"" Stark says. ""You can imagine swapping out different decoy receptor domains to target different members of the lectin receptor family, and you can also swap out the antibody arm. This is important because different cancer types express different antigens, which you can address by changing the antibody target.""

Next Steps and Funding

Stark, Bertozzi, and colleagues have launched a company called Valora Therapeutics to develop lead AbLec candidates. They aim to start clinical trials in the next two to three years.

Funding for the work came in part from a Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Award at the Scientific Interface, a Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Steven A. Rosenberg Scholar Award, a V Foundation V Scholar Grant, the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, a Merck Discovery Biologics SEEDS grant, an American Cancer Society Postdoctoral Fellowship, and a Sarafan ChEM-H Postdocs at the Interface seed grant.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists find a weak spot in deadly fungus that shut down hospital intensive care units","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251223043934.htm","Tue, 23 Dec 2025 13:34:20 GMT","

Scientists have identified a genetic mechanism that could point to new ways of treating a rare but deadly fungal infection that has forced multiple hospital intensive care units to shut down. The finding offers early hope against a pathogen that has been difficult to control and nearly impossible to treat once it spreads.

Candida auris is especially dangerous for people who are already critically ill, leaving hospitals highly exposed to outbreaks. Although the fungus can exist on the skin without causing symptoms, patients who depend on ventilators face a much greater risk. Once infection occurs, about 45 percent of patients die, and the fungus is resistant to all major types of antifungal drugs. This resistance makes treatment extremely challenging and allows the pathogen to persist in hospital wards.

A global health threat with mysterious origins

The infection was first detected in 2008, and its origin is still unknown. Since then, outbreaks have been reported in more than 40 countries, including the UK. Candida auris, also called Candidozyma auris, is now recognized as a serious global health threat and appears on the World Health Organization's critical priority fungal pathogens list. In the UK, reported cases have continued to rise steadily.

Studying infection in a living model

Researchers at the University of Exeter have now taken a major step forward by examining how genes are activated during Candida auris infection. This marks the first time such genetic activity has been studied in a living host using an approach based on fish larvae. The study was published in the Nature portfolio journal Communications Biology and was supported by Wellcome, the Medical Research Council (MRC), and the National Center for Replacement, Reduction and Refinement (NC3Rs).

The researchers say the results could help identify a biological target for new antifungal treatments or even allow existing drugs to be reused, if the same genetic behavior is confirmed during infection in humans.

The project was co-led by NIHR Clinical Lecturer Hugh Gifford of the University of Exeter's MRC Center for Medical Mycology (CMM). He said: ""Since it emerged, Candida auris has wreaked havoc where it takes hold in hospital intensive care units. It can be deadly for vulnerable patients, and health trusts have spent millions on the difficult job of eradication. We think our research may have revealed an Achilles heel in this lethal pathogen during active infection, and we urgently need more research to explore whether we can find drugs that target and exploit this weakness.""

Why traditional research models fell short

One of the biggest obstacles in studying Candida auris has been its ability to survive high temperatures. When combined with its unusually strong tolerance for salt, this has led some researchers to suggest it may have originated in tropical oceans or marine animals. These traits also made it difficult to study using conventional laboratory models.

To overcome this, the Exeter team developed a new infection model using Arabian killifish. The eggs of this species can survive at temperatures similar to the human body, making them suitable for observing infection in conditions that closely resemble real illness.

Genetic activity reveals possible vulnerabilities

During the experiments, researchers observed that Candida auris can change its shape by forming elongated fungal structures known as filaments. These structures may help the fungus search for nutrients while infecting a host.

The team also analyzed which genes were activated or switched off during infection to identify possible weak points. Several of the genes that became active are responsible for producing nutrient pumps that capture iron-scavenging molecules and transport iron into fungal cells. Because iron is essential for survival, this process may represent a critical vulnerability.

Co-senior author Dr. Rhys Farrer of the University of Exeter's MRC Centre for Medical Mycology said: ""Until now, we've had no idea what genes are active during infection of a living host. We now need to find out if this also occurs during human infection. The fact that we found genes are activated to scavenge iron gives clues to where Candida auris may originate, such as an iron-poor environment in the sea. It also gives us a potential target for new and already existing drugs.""

Hope for future treatments

Dr. Gifford, who also works as a resident physician in intensive care and respiratory medicine at the Royal Devon & Exeter Hospital, emphasized the clinical importance of the findings. He said: ""While there are a number of research steps to go through yet, our finding could be an exciting prospect for future treatment. We have drugs that target iron scavenging activities. We now need to explore whether they could be repurposed to stop Candida auris from killing humans and closing down hospital intensive care units.""

The Arabian killifish larvae model was developed with support from an NC3Rs project grant as an alternative to using mouse and zebrafish models, which are commonly used to study interactions between pathogens and their hosts. Dr. Katie Bates, NC3Rs Head of Research Funding, said: ""This new publication demonstrates the utility of the replacement model to study Candida auris infection and enable unprecedented insights into cellular and molecular events in live infected hosts. This is a brilliant example of how innovative alternative approaches can overcome key limitations of traditional animal studies.""

The paper is titled 'Xenosiderophore transporter gene expression and clade-specific filamentation in Candida auris killifish (Aphanius dispar) infection' and is published in the Nature portfolio journal Communications Biology.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Dinosaur bones found almost on top of each other in Transylvania","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251222044100.htm","Tue, 23 Dec 2025 13:34:20 GMT","

The Hațeg Basin in Transylvania has long been known around the world for its dinosaur fossils, uncovered at dozens of sites over the last hundred years. Even so, complete dinosaur discoveries are usually uncommon across the region. That pattern changed with the identification of a newly studied site where scientists documented more than 100 vertebrate fossils per square meter, including large dinosaur bones lying almost directly on top of one another.

Years of Fieldwork Lead to an Exceptional Fossil Find

For more than five years, the Valiora Dinosaur Research Group, made up of Hungarian and Romanian paleontologists, has been carrying out fieldwork in the western Hațeg Basin. The rocks examined there date back to the Upper Cretaceous and capture the final few million years before dinosaurs disappeared. Excavations have revealed fossil-rich deposits containing thousands of remains from amphibians, turtles, crocodiles, dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and mammals.

Among all the sites explored, one location known as K2 stands out. From an area measuring less than five square meters, researchers recovered more than 800 vertebrate fossils, making it the richest site documented so far. The full scientific analysis of this discovery was recently published in the journal PLOS ONE.

A Defining Moment in the Field

""In 2019, during our first field survey in the Hațeg Basin, we almost immediately came across the K2 site. It was a defining moment for us -- we instantly noticed dozens of large, exceptionally well-preserved black dinosaur bones gleaming in the grey clay layers exposed in the streambed. We immediately began our work, and through several years of excavation we collected an extraordinarily rich vertebrate assemblage from the site,"" explained Gábor Botfalvai, assistant professor at the Department of Paleontology, Eötvös Loránd University, and leader of the research group.

How Ancient Floods Created a Bone-Rich Landscape

About 72 million years ago, the region that is now the Hațeg Basin experienced a warm, subtropical climate shaped by temporary river systems. These rivers flowed from higher terrain toward the basin and frequently spilled over their banks during heavy rainfall. As floodwaters surged downstream, they gathered animal carcasses from the surface, along with living creatures and skeletal remains caught in their path.

""Detailed study of the rocks at the K2 site indicates that a small lake once existed here, which was periodically fed by flash floods carrying animal carcasses. As the flow of the rivers slowed rapidly upon entering the lake, the transported bodies accumulated in the deltaic environment along the shore, producing this exceptionally high bone concentration,"" said Soma Budai, researcher at the University of Pavia and co-author of the publication.

Rare Dinosaur Skeletons Reveal New Scientific Insights

The K2 site produced far more than scattered bones. Researchers also identified several partial dinosaur skeletons that remained associated with one another. These fossils represent two separate plant-eating dinosaur species. One group belongs to a roughly two-meter-long dinosaur from the Rhabdodontidae family, a species commonly found in the Hațeg Basin that likely moved mainly on two legs.

The second group of skeletons marks a major breakthrough. These remains belong to a titanosaurian sauropod, a long-necked dinosaur for which no comparably well-preserved skeletons had ever been discovered in Transylvania. Ongoing analysis of these fossils is expected to improve scientists' understanding of how this dinosaur fits into the broader evolutionary family tree.

The Oldest Known Vertebrate Accumulation in the Basin

""Besides the remarkably high bone concentration, another key significance of this newly described site is that it represents the oldest known vertebrate accumulation in the Hațeg Basin. Studying this fossil assemblage allows us to look into the earliest composition of the Hațeg dinosaur fauna and trace the evolutionary directions and processes leading toward the dinosaurs known from younger Transylvanian sites -- revealing how these Late Cretaceous ecosystems were similar or different from one another,"" added Zoltán Csiki-Sava, associate professor at the University of Bucharest and Romanian leader of the research team.

Reconstructing Dinosaur Life in Ancient Europe

The fossils described in this study, together with discoveries still emerging from ongoing excavations in the Hațeg Basin, are helping scientists refine their understanding of how dinosaur communities evolved across (Eastern) Europe during the Late Cretaceous. These finds provide valuable clues about how ancient ecosystems formed, changed, and responded to environmental forces near the end of the age of dinosaurs.

The axon initial segment (AIS) is the site of action potential generation and exhibits structural and functional plasticity upon adaptation of neuronal excitability and disease. Performing in vivo longitudinal two-photon imaging of AIS in the medial prefrontal cortex of male mice, we reveal dynamic AIS remodeling during associative fear learning and extinction. These results demonstrate that AIS plasticity is not only crucial for homeostatic adaptation but also a hallmark of memory formation.

Learning and memory are fundamental to adapt behavioral strategies in new environmental circumstances. Behavioral changes are supported by functional plasticity at the neuronal circuit level, which correlate with neuronal morphology changes1,2,3. Hence, revealing the mechanisms of experience-dependent structural plasticity in neuronal subtypes and pathways in vivo is crucial to understand the principles that link adaptive behaviors with cellular and neural circuit mechanisms of memory formation4,5.

The axon initial segment (AIS) is a specialized neuronal compartment responsible for action potential initiation, which is supported by high ion channel density6,7 rendering the AIS the final site of synaptic integration8. In addition, the AIS plays a crucial role in homeostatic maintenance of neuronal excitability and network function during sensory processing and learning9,10,11.

Ex vivo and in vitro studies identified the AIS as a site of neuronal plasticity. Changes in AIS location and length correlate with changes in neuronal excitability10,12,13. In contrast to synapse-specific weight adjustments, AIS plasticity rescales the global input–output function of a neuron, providing a fundamental, computationally distinct, synapse-independent plasticity mechanism during development14,15, aging16, sensory stimulation or deprivation11,17,18,19 and disease states20,21,22,23,24,25,26. In addition to homeostatic adjustments, AIS remodeling could be crucial for plasticity during learning and memory or the recruitment of individual neurons to subnetworks of shared excitability as well as memory engrams, given that AIS length adapts during NMDA receptor-mediated plasticity27. However, it remains unclear if structural AIS plasticity occurs during associative learning and memory formation in vivo due to the lack of AIS-specific longitudinal imaging techniques. We hypothesized that changes in AIS length act as a cellular mechanism of associative learning in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a brain area involved in adaptive threat behavior and memory formation28,29,30,31,32. Using a new longitudinal live imaging approach designed to monitor AIS in vivo, we aimed to test if AIS of mPFC neurons are plastic during fear learning and extinction.

To visualize AIS morphological changes in vivo, we used a transgenic mouse line expressing a cre-dependent Ankyrin-G-GFP (AnkG-GFP) fusion protein to label the AIS. AnkG is a scaffolding protein enriched at the AIS33, thus allowing for detailed analysis of AIS geometry (for example, length) in the AnkG-GFP mouse line34. AnkG-GFP mice were intercrossed with Cre-dependent tdTomato mice (Ai9) to visualize AIS and neuronal structures in mPFC excitatory neurons via viral expression of CaMKII-dependent Cre recombinase (Fig. 1a). Ex vivo immunofluorescence verified that the AIS label (GFP) colocalized with AnkG and Nav1.6 channels across its entire length (Fig. 1b, stimulated emission depletion (STED) imaging to verify the overlap of AnkG and Nav1.6 in the mPFC of wild-type mice; Extended Data Fig. 1). AnkG and sodium channel 1.6 (Nav1.6) channels are both enriched at the AIS35, verifying the specificity of the approach34. To monitor the same AIS longitudinally in vivo during associative learning, we used two-photon imaging through an aberration-corrected gradient refractive index (GRIN)-lens-based endoscope36,37 together with auditory fear conditioning and extinction as well as steady-state days where mice were not exposed to the behavioral paradigm or any changes as a control for plasticity effects (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 2).

Mice underwent a four-day fear conditioning and extinction paradigm in which they learned to associate a mild foot shock (unconditioned stimulus, US) with an auditory cue (conditioned stimulus, CS+). During fear extinction, animals were reexposed to repeated CS+ resulting in extinction of conditioned freezing behavior. Each freely moving fear conditioning and extinction session was followed by head-fixed two-photon imaging to visualize and track AIS length of mPFC neurons, while the final 3 days of steady-state two-photon imaging were devoid of any cues or contextual elements to test for potential learning-unrelated changes in AIS length (Fig. 1c). Two-photon volume scans were performed in mPFC (Fig. 1d, predominantly the infralimbic subdivision, N = 6 mice) and individual AIS were longitudinally visualized across the learning paradigm (Fig. 1e).

Next, we measured AIS length in vivo (Methods) across habituation and extinction days 1 and 2 to test how AIS length changes with learning (Fig. 2a). AIS were sampled from different imaging planes and depth similarly for all mice (Fig. 2b). Before learning during the habituation day, AIS length did not differ between mice (number of AIS: 2.06 ± 0.12 AIS per imaging plane per mouse, Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 3; mean normalized AIS length change: −0.002 ± 0.017, Fig. 2c, Methods and equation (1)). Upon fear conditioning, animals acquired a freezing response to the CS+ (CS+ freezing: 68.7 ± 9.7%, CS− freezing: 30.1 ± 12.2%, N = 6 mice, Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 1c). Upon CS+ reexposure during the first fear extinction session, mice showed initially high CS+ selective freezing levels indicating fear memory consolidation (Extinction 1 early CS+ freezing: 42.6 ± 2.5% versus CS− freezing: 10.2 ± 1.3%, P = 1.12 × 10−5, Mann–Whitney U test, N = 6 mice, Extended Data Fig. 1b), which extinguished during consecutive CS+ presentations and consolidated overnight (Extinction 1 early versus Extinction 1 late: P = 1.04 × 10−4, Extinction 1 early versus Extinction 2 early: P = 4.59 × 10−4, Extinction 1 early versus Extinction 2 late: P = 2.83 × 10−5, Kruskal–Wallis test (P = 4.47 × 10−5) with Dunn's post hoc correction, Fig. 2d). After each behavioral training session (except fear conditioning), AIS were visualized under a two-photon microscope to relate behavioral changes with AIS length changes. At the population level, AIS significantly elongated following the second day of fear extinction learning relative to habituation day (Habituation versus Extinction 1, P = 0.938, Habituation versus Extinction 2, P = 0.0072, Extinction 1 versus Extinction 2, P = 0.024, Kruskal–Wallis test (P = 0.0034) test with Dunn's post hoc correction, Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 4). During subsequent nonlearning, steady-state imaging days, where animals were not exposed to any learning session, average AIS length returned to its original size and remained steady throughout subsequent imaging days (Habituation day before fear conditioning versus Steady-state days 1, 2 and 3: P = 0.978, Kruskal–Wallis test, Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 4). Taken together, this indicates that following fear extinction learning, the average AIS length in mPFC increases, while AIS are stable outside of the conditioning paradigm, suggesting that structural changes at the AIS are a cellular correlate of learning-related plasticity in mPFC.

To investigate the dynamics of individual AIS across fear learning and extinction, we subsampled AIS that could be longitudinally tracked throughout all imaging sessions (60 out of an average of 268 daily imaged AIS, 22%) and measured their length relative to the habituation session (Fig. 3a). K-means clustering revealed four distinct clusters of dynamic changes of AIS length (Fig. 3b). The largest group (43.3%), termed elongated cluster, increased in length (36.4 ± 5.3% relative length change to habituation after Extinction 2) following fear extinction learning, which was in line with the general population average. However, opposed to the average population dynamics (Fig. 2), AIS length did not return to baseline after extinction consolidation but maintained its elongated state (Elongated cluster Habituation versus Steady-state day 1: P = 3.24 × 10−5, Habituation versus Steady-state day 2: P = 2.56 × 10−4, Habituation versus Steady-state day 3: P = 6.21 × 10−5, Kruskal–Wallis test (P = 2.04 × 10−6) with Dunn's post hoc correction, Fig. 3b).

A second, smaller cluster contained AIS (16.7%, shortened cluster) that exhibited a decrease in length (−15.8 ± 4.3%) following fear extinction. This decrease was less pronounced relative to the change observed for the elongated cluster and AIS tended to return to their original length during steady-state sessions. Additionally, we observed two stable clusters. These clusters exhibited initially slight decreases (stable cluster 1: relative change: −3.6 ± 2.0%, 21.6% of AIS) or increases in length (stable cluster 2: relative change: 10.9 ± 2.6%, 18.3% of AIS) after conditioning. However, these AIS reverted to their original length and maintained it throughout subsequent sessions. The across-day length change during learning for stable clusters was not significantly different to the total change across days during steady-state sessions, indicating that the length change observed for stable clusters was not different to changes in length that AIS undergo during nonlearning conditions. However, the change in length was significantly different between steady-state days and elongated or shortened plastic clusters (Steady state versus Stable 1: P = 0.99, Steady state versus Stable 2: P = 0.99, Steady state versus Elongated: P = 2.23 × 10−7, Steady state versus Shortened: P = 0.011, Kruskal–Wallis test (P = 7.28 × 10−11), Dunn's post hoc correction, Fig. 3c). Overall, we observed diverse plasticity of AIS length following fear extinction learning (Extended Data Fig. 5). AIS of mPFC excitatory neurons exhibited significant learning-dependent length changes relative to preconditioning states. The elongated cluster contained both the highest AIS number and maintained an increase in length throughout all imaging days. Finally, tracking AIS plasticity cluster composition by initial length revealed that elongated and shortened AIS clusters originate from the pool of shortest or longest AIS, respectively (Fig. 3d, P = 7.44 × 10−4, Mann–Whitney U test), suggesting that AIS length changes occur within a predetermined physiological dynamic range in mPFC, beyond which elongation or shortening does not result in additional changes to neuronal excitability38,39.

To test if AIS length is linked to neuronal activity, we combined two-photon calcium imaging of mPFC excitatory neurons with post hoc AIS length measurements. Mice were exposed to the fear learning and extinction paradigm as described. Following the second day of extinction, spontaneous neuronal activity of mPFC neurons was measured with the red-shifted calcium indicator R-GECO and AIS length measured subsequently in horizontal brain slices ex vivo (Fig. 4a–d). Thirty-eight neurons from three mice could be matched between in vivo two-photon imaging and post hoc ex vivo fluorescence microscopy. Interestingly, in vivo calcium event rates of individual neurons did not significantly correlate with AIS length (Extended Data Fig. 6). However, AIS length positively correlated with the area under the curve of individual calcium events (Fig. 4e) indicating that increased AIS length is associated with bursts of high frequency action potentials in mPFC neurons.

Finally, we tested if AIS length is associated with memory allocation. Mice were exposed to the fear conditioning and extinction paradigm (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 7a) and subsequently perfused. This approach prevented us following individual AIS in vivo, yet provided access to large numbers of neurons. Strikingly, we found that AIS of c-Fos+ neurons (Fig. 4g) exhibited a large distribution of AIS lengths, including neurons with very short and very long AIS in infralimbic cortex after fear extinction (Fig. 4h). In contrast, this difference could not be observed in prelimbic cortex, a brain area thought to be involved in fear recall40 (Fig. 4i and Extended Data Fig. 7b,c). These findings suggest that dynamic changes in infralimbic cortex AIS length upon fear extinction occur in c-Fos-activated ensembles, which are enriched with shortened and lengthened AIS. These changes in AIS length will allow for neuronal output adjustments during engram formation upon extinction memory recall, a function that was previously associated with infralimbic cortex39. Additionally, this effect is brain area- and learning-specific, given that differences in AIS lengths of c-Fos+ neurons could not be observed in prelimbic cortex after extinction learning (see above), yet emerged after fear recall training (Extended Data Fig. 7). This supports the notion that AIS length is dynamic upon learning and plasticity-inducing events in an engram- and brain area-specific fashion.

mPFC pyramidal neurons have previously been identified as a site of functional plasticity during extinction learning41. Using an AIS marker line and GRIN-lens-based two-photon imaging, we visualized and tracked AIS length longitudinally across a 4-day fear conditioning and extinction paradigm. We identified population level changes in AIS length upon fear extinction learning. Overall, increased AIS length was associated with fear extinction learning. Nevertheless, at the single cell level, distinct clusters of mPFC neurons with elongated or shortened AIS emerged upon extinction learning, suggesting that AIS length changes could map onto distinct populations of mPFC pyramidal neurons42,43,44,45 recruiting them into opposing functional ensembles with increased or decreased excitability. Therefore, bidirectional AIS plasticity could be a mechanism to counterbalance the weight between distinct mPFC subnetworks, for example, neurons of functionally distinct output pathways or opposing engrams for the formation and extinction of associative memories41,44,46.

Indeed, neurons of the elongated cluster did not revert their AIS length post-extinction learning, suggesting that persistent AIS elongation of this cluster is associated with elevated excitability and supports long term extinction memory in mPFC networks41,47,48,49.

Interestingly, before associative learning, AIS recruited into the elongated cluster tend to be shorter while those recruited to the shortened cluster tend to be longer, suggesting that AIS length changes occur most dynamically at the extreme ends of the length distribution within a defined dynamic range and structural limitation, where they might exert their strongest impact on action potential initiation and excitability38,39. Prelearning AIS length might thus be a hallmark of availability for neuronal plasticity of mPFC pyramidal neurons and their recruitment to memory engrams. This is further supported by our finding that infralimbic c-Fos+ neurons exhibit a broader AIS length distribution than c-Fos− neurons following fear extinction learning, suggesting that fear extinction engrams are linked to both, elongation and shortening of AIS clusters. AIS length-dependent up- or downregulation of neuronal excitability within c-Fos+ engrams would be crucial to mediate distinct mPFC-output pathways that drive learning-specific behaviors. In contrast, c-Fos− neurons are typically not considered part of an engram and exhibited a narrower AIS length distribution after learning. This could result from both, neurons that did not change their AIS length and neurons that adjusted their AIS length toward the mean of the c-Fos− population, which might be a potential homeostatic mechanism balancing activity and dampening output of the non-engram network. Together, our findings support the notion that learning is dependent on bidirectional control of AIS length and in turn adaptive neuronal activity within the memory engram to balance the activity of neuronal types with distinct functions.

Here we have shown that dynamic changes in AIS length occur during associative learning and extinction in vivo and might be a cellular mechanism of plasticity regulation during memory formation. Together with recent ex vivo studies, this suggests that AIS length changes might be a general mechanism for plasticity regulation and memory formation in other brain areas and behaviors beyond mPFC and fear learning, respectively11,27,50,51. Furthermore, AIS dynamics could contribute to both the formation of specific cue-driven changes in the input–output function of tuned neurons as well as the regulation of excitability in behavior-specific neuronal ensembles or memory engrams driving behavior and memory recall in a state-dependent fashion52,53,54,55. Given that the AIS is perturbed in a number of neurological diseases21,23,24,25,26, including neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease56, maladaptation of AIS plasticity might play an important role in disorders of memory loss, cognitive decline and behavioral changes long before neuronal cell loss occurs.

Experiments were performed in accordance with the institutional guidelines of the University of Basel (Tierschutz) and the German Center for Neurodegenerative Disorders, and were approved by the Cantonal Veterinary Office of Basel-Stadt and the Landesamt für Natur-, Umwelt- und Verbraucherschutz NRW. Experiments were conducted in 9–15-week-old male C57Bl/6 J, AnkG-GFP or AnkG-GFP::Ai9 mice. Cre-dependent AnkG-GFP mice (B6;129SV-ank3tm1DCI/HD) were provided by Maren Engelhardt, Johannes Kepler University Linz34. AnkG-GFP mice were crossed with Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter (Ai9) mice (Gt(ROSA)26Sortm9(CAG-tdTomato)Hze, JAX: IMSR_JAX:007909 (ref. 57)) to generate the AnkG-GFP::Ai9 mice. Mice were housed on a 12-hour light/dark cycle and had ad libitum access to food and water.

Systemic analgesia (0.1 mg kg−1 buprenorphine, subcutaneous (s.c.)) was provided 30 min before the start of the surgery. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (4% induction, 1.5–2.0% maintenance, Henry Schein) in oxygen-enriched air (95%, Oxymat III, Weinmann). Stereotactic surgeries were performed with a high-precision stereotaxic apparatus (Model 1900, Kopf Instruments). Body temperature was maintained at ca. 36 °C (Rodent warmer, 53800 M, Stoelting) and eyes were covered with a protective cream (Bepanthen, Bayer). Local analgesia was provided s.c. above the skull before incision of the skin (Lidocain (10 mg per kg) and Ropivacain (Naropin, 3 mg per kg)). Viral vectors (250 nl AAV2/retro.mCaMKII.iCre.WPRE-hGHp(A), VVF Zurich and 250 nl, AAV1.Syn.NES-jRGECO1a.WPrE.SV40, Addgene 100854-AAV1 for in vivo recordings of neuronal activity) were injected at coordinates AP 1.8, ML −0.35, DV −2.0 mm with the help of a hydraulic micropositioner (Model 2650, Kopf) with a pulled glass pipette (2-000-0001, Drummond Scientific) and a pressure ejection system (Picospritzer, Parker). Meloxicam (Metacam, 5 mg per kg, s.c.) was injected as postoperative analgesia once a day for 3 consecutive days after surgery.

An aberration-corrected GRIN lens (diameter 0.5 mm, length 4.07 mm, focal length in water immersion 200 µm)36,37 was implanted during a second surgery (anesthesia and analgesia as previously described). A small craniotomy was drilled (Kyocera) above the virus injection coordinates, and a small track was cut with a 0.7 mm sterile needle (22 G, Terumo). The GRIN lens was then slowly advanced into the brain (DV −2.2 mm) and fixed to the skull with ultra violet light curable glue (Loctite 4305, Henkel). The skin was sealed with Scotchbond (3 M). A stainless-steel head bar (custom made) was attached to the skull to fix the animal during imaging sessions by using Vetbond (3 M) and dental acrylic (Paladur, Kulzer).

Behavioral experiments were performed during the animal's light period. Mice were acclimatized to the experimenter, two-photon scanning and head fixation for 3 days. Next, a 4-day auditory fear conditioning paradigm was performed in a habituation/test context (days 1, 3 and 4) and a fear conditioning context (day 2). During the habituation session (30 min), mice were presented with 5 intermingled CS+ and CS− (5 each, 12 kHz and 6 kHz, respectively) in a round plexiglass context (low light conditions, 1% acetic acid isoamyl ester). CSs were composed of 27 tone pips (200 ms, 75 dB) presented at a rate of 1.1 Hz (Tucker Davis Technologies, RZ6). Fear conditioning was performed in a 25 cm-square plexiglass box with a shock grid floor (Coulbourn, Noldus, bright light conditions, 70% ethanol smell, 0 min). Five CS+ were terminated by a 2 s, 0.65-mA foot shock immediately after the last tone pip and intermingled with five CS− presentations. During fear extinction learning sessions (days 3 and day 4, 35 min), mice were presented with 4 CS− and 12 CS+ in the habituation context. Immediately after each behavioral session, except for fear conditioning, mice were head fixed under a two-photon microscope for a structural scan of AIS. Steady-state sessions (days 5–7) were conducted after the fear extinction days during which mice were imaged similarly to the habituation and learning days. Fear conditioning experiments were performed using Ethovision XT 14 (Noldus). Behavioral tracking was conducted using DeepLabCut58. Freezing was detected automatically based on periods of absence of movement (threshold: 1 s) and checked manually for non-freezing episodes (for example, grooming) post hoc.

In vivo two-photon imaging was performed using a custom-built two-photon microscope (Independent NeuroScience Services). Mice were head fixed with a custom-designed head bar system and placed on a running wheel during imaging. The microscope was equipped with a resonant scanning system (CRS08K, Cambridge Technology) and a pulsed Ti:sapphire laser (Chameleon Vision S, Coherent) and controlled by ScanImage software (Version 5.7, Vidrio Technologies). We used a water dipping objective lens (N16XLWD-PF - 16X CFI LWD, 0.80 NA, Nikon) to focus on the back end of the aberration-corrected GRIN endoscope36,37. The light path included a dichroic mirror (T565lpxr, long pass, Chroma), barrier filters (green: ET510/80 m, red: ET630/75 m, Chroma) and photomultiplier tubes (PMT2101, Thorlabs). For both fluorescence channels, images were acquired at a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels, with 940 nm excitation and 30 frames per second. For calcium imaging experiments, the spontaneous activity of mPFC excitatory neurons was recorded via two-photon imaging of the calcium indicator R-GECO, over 10 min, following the second day of fear extinction learning. Images were acquired at a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels, with 1,020 nm excitation and 30 frames per second. All mice were habituated to the experimenter, head restraint and two-photon imaging in the same imaging setup for several days before the imaging experiments.

Corrected GRIN lenses were used to reduce effects of optical aberrations36,37. Two-photon z-stack dual-color images (green or red) were acquired along a volume of ~400 µm (5-µm step, 250 frames per plane). After acquisition, the images were motion corrected using Matlab code adapted from Suite2P59. The images of each channel were mean projected and merged to create dual-color images using ImageJ (Version 2.0). Signal intensities in both green and red channels were adjusted in ImageJ for visualization purpose by saturating the brightest 35% of the pixels per channel, per imaging plane to maintain an unbiased transformation between planes. Using Simple Neurite Tracer (SNT, ImageJ 2.0), AIS visible on the green channel but not red channel (Extended Data Fig. 8 shows examples of visual differences) were manually marked on each of the green channel images and a fitted path was applied to allow the measurement of AIS length. For GRIN-2P in vivo imaging, AIS start and end were visually defined by the experimenter as a sharp change of fluorescence in the in vivo 2P image. mPFC AIS typically start at the soma indicated by a sharp rise in fluorescence (Extended Data Fig. 9). For individual mice, in vivo imaged AIS were aligned manually across a number of days. For ex vivo confocal imaging, AIS intensity data was filtered using a Savitzky-Golay filter. The AIS location was defined as a rigid 80% drop from the peak fluorescence for confocal images. Analysis and measurement of the AIS (in pixels) were performed in a blinded manner by several experimenters with the identity of mice and experimental day unknown during AIS measurements. Only AIS whose entire length was fully contained in a single optical plane (that is, individual z-stack frame) were tracked for further analysis. For calcium imaging experiments, Suite2p was used to extract calcium traces of individual neurons. False positives were discarded and cells were defined manually if these were not detected automatically. Neuropil signal around each cell was multiplied by 0.7 and subtracted from the calcium trace with the result considered as the calcium signal of a single neuron. For ex vivo imaging of c-Fos expression and AIS length, images were acquired with an LSM900 confocal microscope (Zeiss). Confocal images were postprocessed with ImageJ (Version 2.0). For quantification and thresholding of c-Fos expression, the ImageJ plugin Quanty-cFOS60 was used, and the SNT61 plugin was utilized to track AIS.

For in vivo–ex vivo alignment experiments, matching between two-photon fields of view and ex vivo horizontal mPFC images was achieved by performing a 2D z-projection in ImageJ of manually selected confocal planes. The planes were manually selected by identifying topological hallmarks present in both the two-photon and the confocal images.

Finally, for super-resolution imaging, a STED microscopy setup was used (Facility Line, Abberior Instruments). The setup is built on a motorized inverse microscope body (IX83, Olympus) and equipped with a pulsed 775-nm depletion laser and 405-nm, 485-nm, 561-nm and 640-nm excitation lasers. Spectral detection was performed using single-photon-counting avalanche photodiode detectors. Acquisition was normalized to 5–15 photons per pixel and μs with a pixel dwell time of 5 μs. Channel-specific line accumulation was individually adapted to reach a photon count above 100 within the brightest pixels per field of view. Spectral windows were set to 410–470 nm for Alexa405Plus, 510–600 nm for 460 L, 600–630 nm for StarOrange and 650–725 nm for StarRed fluorophors. Images were acquired using a ×60 oil immersion objective (1.45 NA, UPLXAPO60XO, Olympus) and a set lateral pixel size of 20 nm.

Due to the internal magnification of GRIN lenses and optical nonuniformities62,63, in vivo AIS lengths are provided as relative changes to themselves, providing an accurate way of comparing AIS across different planes and samples. The start and the end of the AIS were defined visually by the experimenter in two-photon in vivo images. To compare changes in AIS length relative to the first imaging session (habituation, Fig. 2d) the mean of AIS length during the habituation session was calculated per mouse. Next this value was subtracted from each individual AIS length per mouse and the result divided by the same mean value using equation (1) as follows:

To calculate the mean change in AIS length within steady-state sessions versus the change in length within the learning phase for each plasticity cluster (Fig. 3c), the normalized AIS length (the relative length change to habituation session) was summed across steady-state sessions and across the learning phase of each plasticity cluster per individual AIS (i) and divided by the number of sessions according to equation (2):

where for the learning phase n equals Extinction session 1 and n + 1 equals Extinction session 2 and for the steady-state phase n equals Steady day 1 and n + 1 equals Steady day 2. The resulting session change values were averaged per cluster.

Following completion of behavioral experiments, mice were transcardially perfused with around 5 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS, ThermoFisher) followed by 20 ml 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS (pH = 7.4). Brains were removed and stored overnight in 4% PFA. Coronal slices (150 μm) were prepared using a vibratome (Leica Biosystems VT1000S) and immunostained for AnkG and Nav1.6 using the following solutions and protocol: carrier solution: 1% normal horse serum (Vector Laboratories) with 0.5% Triton (ThermoFisher) in PBS (ThermoFisher), blocking solution: 10% normal horse serum with 0.5% Triton in PBS, PBST solution: 0.1% Triton in PBS. After 3 rounds of PBS washes, slices were blocked for 2 h at room temperature and incubated in primary antibodies in carrier solution (guinea pig anti-AnkG, 1:500, Synaptic Systems, cat. no. 386005; rabbit anti-Nav1.6, 1:150, Alomone, cat. no. ASC-009) overnight at 4 °C. Slices were washed again 3 times in PBST and incubated for 2 h at room temperature in secondary antibodies in carrier solution (goat DyLight405 anti-guinea pig, 1:400, Jackson ImmunoResearch, cat. no. 160-475-003; goat AlexaFluor467 anti-rabbit, 1:400, Invitrogen, cat. no. A21244). After 3 final washes, slices were mounted on slides and cover slipped using 22 × 50 mm, 0.16–0.19-mm-thick cover glass (FisherScientific). Images were acquired with an LSM700 upright confocal microscope (Zeiss). Confocal images were postprocessed with ImageJ (Version 2.0). The confocal tile scan overview image in Fig. 4d was adjusted for differences in contrast and brightness of different planes at tile edges in a plane-by-plane manner. This adjustment was not required for the quantification of individual AIS at high magnification.

For c-Fos experiments, timed perfusions were carried out 90 min after the start of the behavior for each animal, which included a 20-min home cage period after the end of the behavioral session. Brain tissue was kept in 4% PFA. Coronal sections of mPFC of 100 µm were prepared with a Leica VT1000S vibratome. Antibody staining protocols were the same as described. Antibodies: c-Fos: rat anti-c-Fos, 1:1000, Synaptic Systems, cat. no. 226017; secondary antibody: Alexa Fluor Plus 555 donkey anti-rat, 1:1000, Invitrogen, cat. no. A48270. AnkG was co-stained as described.

For the experiments where in vivo neural activity was matched to ex vivo AIS length, tissue sectioning was performed in the horizontal plane (200 μm thickness). The immunostaining procedure to label AnkG was the same as described.

For 2D-STED microscopy, tissue after perfusion was embedded in OCT compound (Tissue Tek, Sakura Finetek) and lowered into −160 °C isopentane for quick, unidirectional freezing. Coronal slices (40 μm) were prepared using a cryostat (Leica Biosystems CM3050 S) and transferred directly into 2% PFA for 10 min. After washing in PBS, slices were incubated in blocking buffer (1% BSA, 0.2% fish skin gelatine, 0.1% Triton in 0.1 M PBS) for 60 min and subsequently incubated in primary antibodies (guinea pig anti-AnkG, 1:1,000, Synaptic Systems, cat. no. 386005; rabbit anti-Nav1.6, 1:500, Alomone, cat. no. ASC-009; rabbit anti-c-Fos, 1:500, Cell Signaling, cat. no. 2250; chicken anti-NeuN, 1:1,000, cat. no. 266006, Synaptic Systems) overnight at 4 °C. After 3 rounds of PBS washes, slices were incubated for 2 h in secondary antibodies (Alexa 405 Plus goat anti-chicken, 1:1000, Invitrogen, cat. no. A48254; Star 460 L goat anti-rabbit, 1:1,000, Abberior, cat. no. ST460L-1002; StarOrange goat anti-mouse, 1:1,000, Abberior, cat. no. STORANGE-1001; StarRed goat anti-guinea pig, 1:1,000, Abberior, cat. no. STRED-1006) at room temperature. Slices were washed again 3 times in PBS, mounted in an aqueous embedding medium (Abberior Mount Solid Antifade, Abberior GmbH) and cover slipped using precision cover glasses with a thickness of 0.170 mm ± 0.05 mm (Paul Marienfeld GmbH).

Statistical analysis was performed using Matlab (Mathworks) and Python (Version 3.8, Python Software Foundation including SciPy and scikit-learn). Normality was tested using the D'Agostino and Pearson's test. To identify groups of AIS with distinct length dynamics, k-means clustering using the k-means+ plus initialization method (Python and scikit-learn) and a restriction to four clusters was applied. Additional attempts at increasing the number of clusters resulted in the formation of subclusters that were still part of the four primary ones. For analysis of AIS length comparing c-Fos+ and c-Fos− cells, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and CDF analysis were used. Values are presented as mean ± s.e.m. unless stated otherwise. Box and whisker plots indicate mean (dot) and median (horizontal line), interquartile range as well as the minimum to maximum value of the distribution. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications in the field. Animals were randomly added to experimental groups without preselection. All animals with visible AIS were included in the experiments and analysis, except one mouse which only had two visible AISs. Micrographs in Fig. 1a could be repeated in N = 10 mice. Micrographs in Fig. 1b could be repeated for n = 5 AIS from N = 1 mouse (Extended Data Fig. 1. The overlap of AnkG and Nav channels was established previously34). Statistical tests are given in the text or figure legends. *, ** and *** indicate P values smaller than 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001, respectively.

Transition metal complexes have found many applications in the modern world ranging from catalysts, luminescent materials to bioactive compounds and more. However, methods for the systematic synthesis and evaluation of large numbers of metal compounds at a time are still limited. Here, a high-throughput combinatorial approach using copper(I)-catalyzed alkyne–azide cycloaddition chemistry is implemented to make 192 bidentate pyridyl-1,2,3-triazole ligands. This ligand library is coordinated to five metal scaffolds under mild conditions to yield 672 metal compounds, allowing for an accelerated exploration of the transition metal complex chemical space. The prepared libraries are showcased for compound discovery in antimicrobial applications through a “Direct-to-Biology” approach, with selected libraries further tested for catalytic and photophysical properties. Six promising metalloantibiotics are identified and re-synthesized, exhibiting activity against Gram-positive bacteria in the nanomolar range with favorable therapeutic windows. Two iridium complexes are selected from a transfer hydrogenation screening assay and re-synthesized, with one showing high catalytic activity. This methodology represents a significant step forward in the field of metal-based combinatorial chemistry and its application towards the systematic coverage of vast chemical spaces in the search for molecules with optimized properties.

The Copper(I)-catalyzed Alkyne–Azide cycloaddition (CuAAc Click) reaction to form substituted 1,2,3-triazoles (hereafter referred to as “triazoles”) is one of the cornerstones of modern chemistry1,2,3,4. Functional group tolerance, bio-compatible coupling conditions and high yields make it a powerful transformation. Although mostly used as a convenient way of linking molecular fragments together, it is possible for the resulting triazole unit to bind to metal centers as a ligand. This coordination opens up avenues for catalysis and complexes with highly tunable photophysical properties5,6. Incorporation of a pyridine or other lone pair donating group to the triazole compound enables formation of bidentate ligands, which are able to chelate metal centers effectively via 5- and 6-membered metallocycles (Fig. 1)7. The binding modes of these ligands can be varied by switching the substitution site on the triazole ring (through different pyridine/azide structures), giving ligands with substantially different chemistries8. Coordination tends to occur through the more electron rich N3, giving more stable complexes, while coordination through the more electron deficient N2 is much rarer and can cause instability in complexes (Fig. 1)9. Triazoles can also coordinate to metals as N-heterocyclic carbenes rather than through the N donors10.

(Top) pyridyl-triazole ligand potential building blocks, numbering convention used in this paper and coordination modes to metal centres8. 1-R-1,2,3-triazole-4-(2-pyridine) = Tz-4-P, 4-R-1,2,3-triazole-1-(2-pyridine) = Tz-1-P, 4-R-1,2,3-triazole-1-(2-methylpyridine) = Tz-1-MP. (Bottom) Previous examples of pyridyl-triazole metal complexes for a range of applications; A Re-based sulfonamide anchored complex15; B tris(homoleptic) Ru complexes16; C tis(homoleptic) mer-Os complex17; D Mn(CO)3-Clotrimazole complex19; E RuCy complex with a coordinated sugar derivative20; F cyclometallated IrCN complex21.

From our perspective, the coordination chemistry of these triazole ligands holds great promise for the development of metal-based antibiotics11. This area is becoming increasingly relevant due to the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to the current arsenal of antibiotics, which has been designated by the WHO as one of the top global health threats12,13. Concurrently, there are very few antibiotics being developed, with only 19 antibacterial drugs being approved for use between 2013 and 2023, and of these only 2 represent a new chemical class14.

There have been several examples of bidentate pyridyl-triazole ligands being used for therapeutic applications, from using CuAAc-formed triazoles to anchor sulfonamide drugs to metal centers (increasing activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Fig. 1A)15, to using bidentate triazole ligands directly in forming tris-homoleptic ruthenium [Ru(L)3]2+ complexes (showing broad spectrum antibiotic properties, Fig. 1B)16, tris-homoleptic osmium mer-[Os(L)3]2+ complexes (photoactive against MRSA, Fig. 1C)17 and rhenium(I) carbonyl complexes (displaying activity vs. both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria)18. Additionally, similar bidentate pyridyl-triazoles have been coordinated to a manganese(I) tricarbonyl scaffold, utilizing Clotrimazole as an axial ligand, and were demonstrated to be active against Gram-negative bacteria (Fig. 1D)19. In terms of other therapeutical applications, a ruthenium(II) arene (Fig. 1E) scaffold was coordinated to derivatized sugar pyridyl-triazole ligands (selective activity against ovarian cancer cells)20, and pyridyl-triazole ligands were used to coordinate cyclometallated iridium(III) scaffolds, generating several compounds with photoluminescence properties (Fig. 1F)21. These could be relevant for photodynamic therapy applications against either bacteria or cancer cells, similar to recent work on cyclometallated complexes by Kench et al. 22,23. Platinum compounds containing triazole ligands or linkers have also been investigated for anticancer therapy24. Although an impressive array of compounds has been made utilizing triazole ligands25, it should be noted is that in almost all cases, only a handful of individual complexes have been synthesized and tested for their intended applications. One of the reasons for this is the synthesis of the triazole ligand, which requires an azide to be generated as a precursor. Azide formation typically occurs in batch via a reaction between sodium azide and an aryl/alkyl bromide, requiring forcing conditions and undesirable solvents, and can generate significant impurities26,27.

Recent developments by Meng et al.28 have opened the door to high-throughput synthesis of this class of ligands through sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEx) chemistry under ambient conditions, efficiently generating azides in situ from virtually any primary amine (Fig. 2). We envisaged that this methodology could be used to generate substantial and varied libraries of pyridyl-triazole based ligands. Notably, these ligands offer stability benefits over Schiff-base type counterparts, which are prone to hydrolysis and degradation in the presence of acid or base. Coordination of this library to various metal scaffolds in a similar vein to previous work by our group and others using combinatorial chemistry approaches with Schiff-base ligands29,30,31 would allow us to create libraries of complexes. These could in turn be screened for antibacterial hits, toxicity towards mammalian cells and other potential areas of discovery such as catalysis and photophysical applications.

To rapidly cover and focus in on the vast chemical space represented by this chemistry, we have turned to a “Direct-to-Biology” screening approach, which has been successfully used across academia and industry22,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41. This approach involves the high-throughput synthesis and characterization of compound libraries, followed by biological testing of reaction crudes without purification. Concurrently, the reaction components (in our case metal scaffolds and ligands) are tested to support that any observed biological activity is likely from the putative metal complex. There are potential issues with impurities having an outsized effect in these assays, so high yielding reactions, such as those typically used in combinatorial chemistry are favored29,30,31. As a result, while it is possible to get false positives with a Direct-to-Biology approach, false negatives are rare. The final step is hit validation, where target compounds which showed promising properties in the crude-screening are re-synthesized and purified, and finally re-tested to confirm their biological activity. Overall, Direct-to-Biology represents a powerful screening technique that allows for coverage of a large amount of chemical space quickly, reduces time wasted in making inactive compounds, and funnels down to a small number of compounds with desirable properties. A similar approach can also be taken with photophysical and catalytic testing42,43.

We began by optimizing the conditions described by Meng et al.28 for the in situ generation of azides from primary amines, followed by CuAAc Click reactions with 2-alkynepyridines. Initially, significant alcohol impurities were observed, but this was remedied by changing the copper ligand from tris-hydroxypropyltriazolylmethylamine (THPTA) to tris(2-benzimidazolylmethyl)amine (BimH)3. Additionally, we found that the reported phosphate buffer was not required in our system, and low catalyst/ligand loadings of 2.5 mol% were sufficient. With the optimized conditions in hand, we used an Opentrons liquid handling robot to generate a library of 96 triazole-4-pyridine (Tz-4-P) compounds (24x amines, 4×2-alkynepyridines, Fig. 3A). The success of these couplings was verified by Liquid Chromatography coupled Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS, Fig. 4). A further library of 96 triazole-1-methylpyridine (Tz-1-MP) compounds (12x alkynes, 8×2-picolylamines, Fig. 3B) was prepared using the same method. Under the same conditions, we also attempted to couple 2-aminopyridine with alkynes to generate a Tz-1-P library, but this was unsuccessful.

Overview of amine and alkyne building blocks utilized for the Tz-4-P (A) and Tz-1-MP (B) libraries and synthetic schemes and conditions for the coordination of Tz-4-P and Tz-1-MP libraries to metal scaffolds to form the metal complex libraries. Sol = solvent, Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, BeMeIm = 1-methylbenzimidazole, ppy = 2-phenylpyridine.

Purity as ascertained by peak area% of the total from LC-MS data (254 nm). Compound peaks were identified automatically using the mass of the target ion and the corresponding UV peak was automatically integrated by custom Python scripts (Supporting Information Section 2.9). RuCy library conversions were normalized to 100% due to low UV response at 254 nm, and the conversions of IrCp* libraries is an aggregate of the parent ion (M+) and the MeCN adduct (M2+) peaks.

The average conversion efficiency (as determined by automated LC-MS chromatogram integration at 254 nm)44 was 75 ± 16%, showing that despite the structural diversity of the amines a generally high conversion efficiency was observed (Fig. 4). In terms of trends across the formation of this library, the electron withdrawing ester group on M11 tended to lead to lower conversions (both for the initial click reaction, and for subsequent coordination), although other electron deficient amines (M13, M17) seem to form ligands in high yielding reactions comparable to electron rich systems (M12, M19). As such, it does not appear that the electronics of the amine building blocks have a significant effect on the outcome of the initial CuAAc reaction. The LC-MS traces of ligands containing 7-aminocephalosporanic acid and ampicillin (M15, M16, respectively) were not as clean as the others, and it was found that these ligands and their metal compounds slowly degrade over time in solution (See Supporting Information (SI) Figs. S24, 25). However, it was decided to include them in further testing as they represented more complex structures with β-lactam motifs, and ideally the coordination of these derivatives to metal centers would enhance their biological effects45. On a practical level, it was discovered that several of the target ligands were poorly soluble in DMSO and tended to precipitate or crystallize out of solution. This was especially prevalent among Y4 ligands, where the pyridyl bromine group seems to have significantly affected solubility. This was remedied by pulverizing the affected samples through sonication and aspirating the mixture to homogenize it before dispensing the ligands for further reactions.

Similarly, the Tz-1-MP library was synthesized with a high average conversion efficiency (77 ± 12 %), with no noticeable degradation of the products (Fig. 5). Initial tests included two aliphatic alkynes (cyclohexylacetylene and cyclopropylacetylene), but the products of these reactions were not observable by LC-MS. As these alkynes also exhibited problematic volatility, the building blocks were restricted to aromatic alkynes only. These were in turn limited to relatively simple derivatives, which demonstrates a limitation of using aromatic alkynes (Tz-1-MP) compared to primary amines (Tz-4-P) for triazole formation. Conversely, the use of picoline-derived amines allowed for a substantially larger variety in the pyridine fragment of the ligand compared to the Tz-4-P library, with several halogenated derivatives included. Although the structural variety of the Tz-1-MP library is not as broad as Tz-4-P, the overall conversion is comparable, with only A3 (highly electron-deficient p-nitro group) and P4 showing consistently lower conversions. No solubility issues were observed with the Tz-1-MP library.

Purity as ascertained by peak area% of the total from LC-MS data (254 nm). Compound peaks were identified automatically using the mass of the target ion and the corresponding UV peak was automatically integrated by custom Python scripts (Supporting Information Section 2.9). RuCy library conversions were normalized to 100% due to low UV response at 254 nm, and the conversions of IrCp* library is an aggregate of the parent ion (M+) and the MeCN adduct (M2+) peaks.

After test coordination reactions using M4Y1 to optimize conditions, the entire Tz-4-P library was coordinated to the following metal scaffolds (Fig. 3A): [Ir(ppy)2Cl]2 (ppy = 2-phenylpyridine, IrCN), [IrCp*Cl2]2 (IrCp*), [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2 (RuCy), Re(CO)5Cl (Re(CO)3) and Mn(CO)5Br (Mn(CO)3). These scaffolds were chosen due to their previously demonstrated biological activities and their amenability to combinatorial chemistry19,23,30,31. Both manganese and rhenium scaffolds were pre-activated with silver triflate, and solvent libraries without 1-benzyl-2-methylimidazole (BeMeIm) as the axial ligand were also generated as controls. The reaction mixtures for the five different metal complex libraries were set up simultaneously in a semi-automated high-throughput manner using the Opentrons OT2 liquid handling robot.

Coordination of the Tz-4-P library to the IrCN scaffold was achieved under conditions far less forcing than current literature procedures, which require toxic, high boiling point solvents, temperatures >150 °C, or microwave conditions22,42. In our procedure, high conversion was achieved by heating the ligands and [Ir(ppy)2Cl]2 dimer in a 1:1 mixture of DMSO:H2O at 60 °C for 18 h. IrCp* and RuCy libraries were generated in good purity under ambient conditions. The IrCp* library is being explored in an ongoing project for biological activity, so will not be discussed further here.

For the Re(CO)3 library, poor conversion to the target complexes was initially obtained (1:2 MeOH/DMSO, 70 °C, 18 h). After addition of an excess of MeOH, the reaction crudes were left standing for one week at room temperature to allow for the solvent to evaporate, giving significantly improved product formation. This is likely due to DMSO solvent competitively binding with the rhenium scaffold instead of BeMeIm. A similar effect was observed for the Mn(CO)3 library, as when conversion is low, the byproduct is often the solvent adduct (e.g. Mn(CO)3M2Y3, see Supporting Information Figs. S26, 27). Previously, our group has shown that manganese(I) carbonyl complexes with solvent as the axial ligand tend to have low antibacterial activity31. Manganese(I) tricarbonyl complexes are often light-sensitive, so this library was prepared, handled, tested and stored in the dark.

Test coordination to the same scaffolds using Tz-1-MP (P1A1) implied that DMSO bound competitively with all metal centers, preventing coordination in many situations, even at elevated temperatures. The exception to this was the [IrCp*Cl2]2 scaffold, which yielded product and led to the creation of an IrCp* library (Fig. 3B). In addition, excess EtOH with [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2 gave the desired complexation with P1A1 in high yields, so the corresponding RuCy library was prepared with the Tz-1-MP ligands (Fig. 3B).

The poor complexation of the Tz-1-MP library could be due to the greater flexibility imparted by the methyl linker, forming 6-membered metallocycles rather than 5-membered metallocycles formed by the more rigid Tz-4-P library. Generally, rigid 5-membered rings are significantly more stable than 6-membered rings due to fewer degrees of freedom and a more optimum “bite angle” (the angle between the donor groups and the metal center)46. More specific examples involving Tz-1-MP scaffolds from Urankar et al. show that under certain coordination conditions, these ligands can bind in a monodentate fashion through the triazole ring (to palladium) rather than a chelating effect47. Maisonial et al. similarly demonstrated that for triazoles with a pendant primary amine, 5-membered chelates were significantly more stable when coordinated to platinum than 6-membered metallocycles48.

Typically for metal-based combinatorial synthesis, libraries are only partially characterized (either random representative samples or predetermined subsets, e.g. using 19F NMR for fluorine containing compounds) to reduce the time-consuming characterization step to a more practical level29,42,43. In our case, the charged nature of the metal complexes makes them amenable to characterization by LC-MS, a technique that itself can be highly automated both in collection and assessment of the data (see Supporting Information Section 2.9). Therefore, the purity and identity of all compounds were assessed and the processed LC-MS spectra, target complex percentage conversion and retention times are supplied as Supplementary Data 1 with this article.

For Mn(CO)3, and to a lesser extent the Re(CO)3 library, Y2 containing ligands were consistently poor at coordination. This could be due to steric clashing of the pyridine methyl group with the axial ligands during coordination. Similarly, Y4 containing ligands performed poorly, possibly due to the lower solubility of the ligands, or electron withdrawing effect of the pyridyl para-bromine. Generally, ligands formed from simple aryl amines such as M8, M10 and M17 tended to coordinate most efficiently. Our data also indicates that M group sterics do not affect the yields, likely due to these groups being spatially removed from the metal center. Electronic effects seem to be more consequential, with strong electron donating units such as methoxy- and methyl-groups favored. Aliphatic groups from building blocks such as M1, M2 and M3 also coordinated well, again implying the prevalence of electronic effects on coordination over steric influences.

For the Tz-1-MP library, coordination of the P6 variants was consistently poor, likely due to the gem-dimethyl groups on the methyl linker. As well as being a useful functionality in medicinal chemistry49, it was envisaged that the Thorpe-Ingold effect would be beneficial to coordination, both increasing rotational barriers and decreasing the bite angle of the ligand50. Instead, it appears that the steric bulk of the gem-dimethyl groups effectively inhibits chelation in P6 containing ligands. In most other cases, coordination of this library to the metal centers was reasonably successful, and the general high yielding formation of this ligand library by CuAAc reaction is a testament to the robustness of the optimized Click conditions.

Taking inspiration from the work by Kench et al., we investigated the photophysical properties of the crude IrCN library with the aim of exploring the possibility of photodynamic therapy applications22. A range of fluorescence intensities was observed, but the maximum emission wavelength (λmax) was evidently dependent on the Y alkyne substituent (see Supporting Information, Fig. S18). This indicates that chemical modifications on the pyridine (Y) are generally more electronically impactful than the amine modifications (M, affecting the triazole). Information about the excited state identity and lifetime can be inferred from the shape of the emission spectra42. The typical excitation and decay cycle of cyclometallated iridium(III) complexes involves excitation from the ground state to a singlet metal/ligand-ligand charge transfer excited state (MLLCT, dπ → π* transition), followed by intersystem crossing to a triplet 3MLLCT excited state. The decay of this pure excited state is often rapid and is a single peak with a roughly Gaussian distribution, such as observed in Y2 and Y4 complexes. Mixing of the 3MLLCT state with a ligand-centered triplet state (3LC) can also occur, giving a longer-lived excited state. This is characterized by a peak with a significant shoulder (Y1 and Y3). The longevity of the excited state can have significant impacts on the photophysical properties of molecules, including on the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

To ascertain whether ROS was generated by the IrCN library, irradiation at 405 nm with ROS scavengers (ABDA (anthracenediyl-bis(methylene) dimalonic acid) and RNO/histidine (p-nitrosodimethylaniline)) was undertaken. ABDA was observed to degrade in the DMSO:PBS media, a previously reported effect upon irradiation below 450 nm51. Significantly less ROS was detected for all compounds compared to the Ru(bpy)32+ (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridyl) control using the RNO/histidine assay52. This suggests that ROS generation for these IrCN compounds is occurring at a lower rate. Altering the cyclometallated ligand may result in complexes with higher ROS-production rates.

Following combinatorial work on ruthenium arene Schiff-base complexes by Weng et al., we tested the crude RuCy libraries for transfer hydrogenation (TH) catalysis using the Coumarin-N3 assay developed by the same group43. As Coumarin-N3 is hydrogenated to the amine, it becomes fluorescent, so the formation of the product can be monitored over time (Fig. 6A). The rationale behind this reaction is to take advantage of high formate concentrations in E. coli and S. aureus to hydrogenate azide pro-drugs in bacteria53. As can be seen in Fig. 6B, C, which shows the change in fluorescence (∆fl) intensity from TH catalyzed by the RuCy libraries, RuCy(Tz-4-P) type compounds (Fig. 6C) are generally more active than the RuCy(Tz-1-MP) library (Fig. 6B), with 3 compounds (M11Y2, M13Y2, M24Y2) all having a ∆fl > 15000 arb. units, comparable with active compounds reported by the Ang group. Interestingly, the most active compounds all contain the Y2 motif with an electron donating methyl group in the 2-position, which seems crucial for activity.

Heatmaps show the change in fluorescence over 24 h for the reactions (product formation, λex = 350 nm, λem = 455 nm), with large dark brown circles showing intensity change >15000 A.U.; B RuCy(Tz-1-MP) library; C RuCy(Tz-4-P) library.

Traces and values are an average of 3 replicate reactions for each set of conditions. PBS = phosphate buffered saline, Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl.

We additionally tested the crude IrCp* libraries for transfer hydrogenation in an assay adapted from Miller et al. for evaluating the activity of iridium-based artificial metalloenzymes using harmaline (Fig. 6D–F)54. Iridium-based TH systems tend to be the most active compared to other transition metal catalysts55, and for the harmaline assay this was demonstrated to be the case. Preliminary testing with the RuCy(Tz-1-MP) library showed no activity, while several of the IrCp*(Tz-4-P) (Fig. 6F) complexes showed high conversions of the harmaline starting material to product (measured by a change in absorbance (∆abs) at 384 nm corresponding to harmaline consumption, confirmed by LC-MS, Figs. S10, 11). In the cases where good conversions were observed, the electron donating methyl and methoxy groups (Y2, M14, M23) as well as bromine groups were present (Y4). This is in line with previous work in the field where small changes in ligands can have dramatic effects on the activity of the catalyst56. This can be ascribed to a complicated interplay of steps in TH, which first require abstraction of the coordinating chloride, formation of a hydride species (favored by electron rich ligands)57, substrate coordination (aided by labile ligands, often electron poor)58 and concurrent transfer of hydride (enhanced by electron rich ligands). Upon testing the IrCp*(Tz-1-MP) library (Fig. 6E), it became apparent that these catalysts were significantly more active than their Tz-4-P counterparts. As 6-membered chelates, they are more labile while remaining electron donating, which could explain the higher catalytic activity47,48. Additionally, the IrCp*(Tz-1-MP) library tended to have a greater proportion of MeCN adduct (M2+) peaks in the LC-MS traces than the IrCp*(Tz-4-P) library, indicating that halide abstraction is easier.

As such, we decided to resynthesize and re-test two of the most active complexes, IrCp*(P1A7) and IrCp*(P4A11). The lability of 6-membered chelates meant that for both compounds, some free ligand was observed in solution by NMR spectroscopy even after purification. In the harmaline assay, only IrCp*(P4A11) demonstrated activity, on par with its crude. Upon examination of the crude LCMS of IrCp*(P1A7), there were a couple of significant impurities including free ligand and an unknown iridium(III) dimer, suggesting that the parent complex was not the catalytically relevant species. In contrast, the crude LCMS of IrCp*(P4A11) only showed the parent complex and the [solvato-iridium]2+ species (See Supporting Information Section 2.6 for LC-MS traces and kinetic graphs). Interestingly, both purified catalysts were active in the coumarin-N3 assay, with IrCp*(P4A11) displaying superior activity. Both catalysts surpassed the activity of the best crude RuCy catalysts (Table 1, ∆fl = 46056, 31295, 16505 arb. units for IrCp*(P4A11), IrCp*(P1A7) and RuCy(M13Y2), respectively)

We further investigated the effect of exogenous chloride by testing the two pure catalysts in PBS 1X / H2O co-solvents with tBuOH, with and without halide extraction by AgOTf (Fig. 6G–I). As can be seen in Table 1, removing excess chloride accelerates the reaction in all cases, likely due to biasing the equilibrium towards the complex required for catalysis58. For IrCp*(P1A7), pre-activation with AgOTf did indeed accelerate the reaction (1.4x faster), even in the presence of exogenous chloride (1.1x faster) in the harmaline assay, suggesting that initial chloride abstraction is the key energetic barrier for this catalyst. On the contrary, in the same assay, IrCp*(P4A11) did not benefit from pre-activation in both water (no change) and PBS (1.4x slower), suggesting that a different part of the mechanistic cycle is the turnover-limiting step. We envisage that these catalysts could be applied to molecular uncaging in bacteria or even in mammalian cells43,56,59, but further mechanistic analysis and assay development would be required, which is beyond the scope of this work.

Overall, we have demonstrated that these metal complex libraries can be rapidly assessed for photophysical and catalytic properties using 96 well plate-based assays under ambient conditions. We envisage that any property-screening assay that is amenable to a well plate format could be adapted to test these and other combinatorial metal complex libraries to identify ideal compounds. We are currently exploring further optimization of metal scaffolds in this area.

With the main focus of our group being the exploration of transition metal complexes as antimicrobial agents, we advanced all the prepared libraries to an initial biological assessment, using a “Direct-to-Biology” approach. In a primary screening, all crude reaction mixtures were evaluated against two bacterial strains, one Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and one Gram-negative (Escherichia coli). As hit-rates against Gram-negative strains are generally much lower60, we decided to evaluate compounds against E. coli at 50 µM and against S. aureus at 12.5 µM and 50 µM to be able to better differentiate the level of activity. Metal-based compounds have a reputation of being generally toxic, although recent reports have questioned this assumption, at least in the realm of in vitro assays11. We therefore tested compounds against human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) at 50 µM. Amongst the 192 Tz-4-P and Tz-1-MP ligands, only one reduced the average viability of HEK293T cells below 50% (M12Y3, 45 ± 7% cell viability), showing that the ligands on their own are generally non-toxic (Fig. 7A, B). None of the ligands showed any significant activity against E. coli, and only four showed growth inhibition against S. aureus: M7Y1 (50 µM), M16Y2 (12.5 µM), M16Y3 (12.5 µM), and M23Y3 (50 µM). As M16 contains the broad-spectrum antibiotic ampicillin and the reactions to form those compounds had relatively lower conversion, the observation of some antibacterial activity is unsurprising. We conducted dose-dependent testing of these crudes against S. aureus to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the putative ligands and found them to be 50 µM for M7Y1 and M23Y3, while lower MICs of 12.5 µM and 3.13 µM were observed for the ampicillin containing triazole compounds. Preliminary testing on the metal complex precursors ([Ir(ppy)2Cl]2, [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2, Re(CO)5Cl, Mn(CO)5Br) showed that only [Ir(ppy)2Cl]2 had an MIC of 50 µM against S. aureus., with the rest having a values > 50 µM. Overall, almost all the ligands showed no significant antibacterial or cytotoxic properties, and alongside the lack of activity of the metal scaffolds, this allows us to assign any biological effects observed on the metal complex crudes to the putative metal complex with high confidence.

For A–E, average % growth of HEK293T cells refers to the toxicity of the compounds at 50 µM (single dose, 2 biological and 2 statistical repeats). Any compounds under 50% (dashed line) are labelled as “toxic”. The circles on these graphs refer to whether the compounds had an MIC of ≤ 6.25 µM against S. aureus. The MIC heatmaps show at what concentration the compounds fully inhibit growth of S. aureus (2 biological and 2 statistical repeats). For F, G, only single dose response bacterial data were collected due to low activity, with OD600 (optical density at 600 nm) referring to the concentration of bacteria present after incubation (a low value is classed as “active”).

All but one of the IrCN complexes showed antibacterial activity against S. aureus (Fig. 7C). However, none showed any appreciable effect on the growth of E. coli. This finding aligns with the general difficulty across the field of (metallo)antibiotic drug discovery to find compounds able to effectively penetrate the double-membrane and evade the efflux pumps of these pathogens61,62. Dose-dependent screening of the IrCN libraries against S. aureus revealed high antibacterial activity. The lowest MIC measured was 0.39 µM for four compounds which is comparable to the standard-of-care antibiotic vancomycin (MIC = 0.42 µM), which was used as a control. Overall, 59 out of 96 compounds displayed an MIC < 5 µM.

A crucial parameter of any antibiotic is its selectivity for bacterial cells over healthy human cells, often denoted by the Therapeutic Index (TI). Unfortunately, most of the IrCN also significantly reduced human cell viability at 50 µM. However, given the very high level of antibacterial activity and the observation that the inhibition of a significant portion of the compounds was in the 25–50% range, we identified several compounds with a potentially viable therapeutic index of >10.

The Re(CO)3 compounds similarly showed high levels of antibacterial activity in S. aureus, with 61 compounds completely inhibiting bacterial growth at 50 µM or lower (Fig. 7D). The MICs were generally higher than for the IrCN library, but the compounds were consistently less toxic. Most caused less than 50% growth inhibition in the HEK293T cells, while still having MICs as low as 0.78 µM.

Comparing the Re(CO)3 and IrCN libraries, there is a clear mirroring of activity for individual ligands. Generally, if a Re(CO)3 complex with a given ligand is active, then the corresponding IrCN will be equally or more active. This is noteworthy as the ligands themselves are demonstrably not active and the two metal scaffolds are clearly distinct. We speculate that the arrangement of the ligand in an octahedral geometry and the occupation of the coordinating nitrogen atoms with the metal scaffold may be the cause for this.

For the Re(CO)3 library, there is a correlation between its activity and conversion efficiency. The same was not observed for the IrCN library. In terms of specific trends, Y2 and Y4-derived ligands are much less active for Re(CO)3 than IrCN, which can be ascribed to lower conversion efficiency in the former. Y1 and Y3-derived ligands are the most active for Re(CO)3, with active compounds having similar activity in both metal libraries. Indeed, M17–22 for Y3 shows almost identical activity for both Re(CO)3 and IrCN, which suggests that the identity of the metal scaffold is not necessarily important for activity. M5 (enantiopure (S)-1-phenyl-ethylamine)-derived ligands are the overall most active for Re(CO)3, and are similarly highly active for IrCN, while there was no or very low activity for: M2 (pendant amide, despite high conversions), M11 (phenyl-ester, which showed good activity for IrCN despite low conversions), M15 (β-lactam, poor conversions), and M23 (biaryl, also poor conversions).

By contrast, the Mn(CO)3 compounds generally showed lower to no significant antibacterial properties than its congener library (Fig. 7E). Only 21 compounds showed any antibacterial activity against S. aureus and only 4 had an MIC < 10 µM. Nevertheless, the overall hit-rate of 21% is comparable to the hit-rate we previously observed in Mn(CO)3 Schiff-base libraries of 15.3%31. The hit-rate is also still much higher compared to what is generally found in purely organic molecule screening campaigns (~1%)62. At the same time, this compound class showed similar rates of cytotoxicity to rhenium, with half of all compounds causing cellular growth inhibition of less than 50% at 50 µM, and a handful causing greater than 75% growth inhibition.

Lastly, the RuCy libraries with both Tz-4-P and Tz-1-MP ligands (Fig. 7F, G) showed the lowest level of antibacterial properties. Only a few of the RuTz-4-P compounds inhibited growth against S. aureus at 12.5 µM. This is in slight contrast to previous work on ruthenium p-cymene Schiff-base compounds, which have shown high hit-rates and significant antibacterial activity30,38,43,63.

Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR, see Supporting Information Section 4) analysis was performed on the data gathered to gain insights into what features contribute most to activity and toxicity. A strong correlation between the retention time (RT) of the Tz-4-P library by LC-MS and calculated cLogP values for the ligands indicates that RT is a good descriptor for lipophilicity in these libraries. For the Re(CO)3 library, the active compounds tended to have a tighter range of RTs than non-active compounds, and the molecular weight (MW) was also important (low MW compounds tending to be more active). This is in line with guidance for organic antibiotics, which indicates that lighter and more polar molecules have better uptake in bacteria64. Conversely, a weak trend between MW and toxicity suggests that heavier compounds are less toxic. An analysis of the fraction of carbon sp3 character suggested that there is an optimum window that imparts high activity, which can be rationalized by the ligand structure affecting uptake into bacteria. There was also a clear correlation between the antimicrobial activity and toxicity of this library, with more active compounds being more toxic. However, at MIC 6.25 µM, most compounds are in the 50% viability range for HEK293T cells at 50 µM, so there is a good potential therapeutic window.

For the IrCN library, the trends were not as clear, but there was a weak correlation between MW and activity, with more active compounds being lighter, as well as between MW and toxicity. There is also a weak positive correlation between activity and toxicity. For a given ligand, the IrCN complex tended to be significantly more active than the same Re(CO)3 compound, which was in turn more active than the Mn(CO)3 complex. This suggests that for a given ligand, the identity of the metal scaffold has a larger effect on the biological activity of the resultant compound than the identity of the ligand.

Some further insights into more concrete structural contributors to antimicrobial activity in metal complexes were obtained by training a support vector machine machine learning (SVM-ML) model on the antibacterial activity data. The structures of rhenium and iridium metal complexes (which had the most interesting levels of antibacterial activity) were converted to a 598-bit ELECTRUM fingerprint based on our recent work65. Due to the limited dataset size of 192 compounds, we converted the antibacterial activity data into binary classification data (a compound was labelled active (“1”), if MIC value was ≤ 6.25 µM or inactive (“0”) otherwise), which is commonly done even for larger datasets of antimicrobial compounds66. The SVM-ML model was trained with 5-fold cross validation, and the trained model showed strong performance in predicting compound bioactivity. It achieved a mean AUC of 0.83 ± 0.05, indicating good ability to discriminate between active and inactive compounds. The mean precision was 0.80 ± 0.09, demonstrating that roughly 80% of compounds predicted to be active were truly active. Similarly, the mean recall was 0.87 ± 0.06, showing that the model successfully identified the majority of active compounds. Overall, the balance between precision and recall is reflected in a mean F1 score of 0.83 ± 0.07, suggesting reliable and consistent hit prediction across cross-validation folds. This suggests that detailed molecular structural features within the compounds correlate with their biological activity. We further analyzed the feature importance through the support vectors of the SVM. Structural features that correlated to antibacterial activity against S. aureus included: amide bonds, fluorine substituents and higher substitution patterns around the metal coordination site (Fig. S46). Conversely, ether groups and alkyl amines correlated with inactive compounds (Fig. S47)

In summary, we have efficiently evaluated 192 ligands and 480 metal complexes for their antibacterial and cytotoxic properties (an additional 768 IrCp compounds are currently undergoing evaluation in ongoing work). This “Direct-to-Biology” methodology allows us to rapidly narrow our focus on potentially interesting compounds with a desirable therapeutic index, and the combination of single-dose response and full MIC assays on crude reaction mixtures provides key insights into activity trends across metal libraries.

Based on the MIC and single dose response toxicity data of the crude reaction mixtures, 6 complexes were chosen for re-synthesis, full characterization and re-testing (2x Re(CO)3, 2x IrCN and 2x Mn(CO)3). The criteria for choosing these was based primarily on antimicrobial activity, with the most active complexes identified (no compounds with an MIC higher than 6.25 µM were considered). Of these, the least toxic compounds were selected. For the IrCN library, as almost all compounds caused less than 50% cell viability, the least toxic compounds with MIC of 1.56 µM were chosen. The Re(CO)3 appeared to provide a good balance of active compounds with low apparent toxicity, so again the most active and least toxic compounds were chosen. For the Mn(CO)3 library, only four compounds had an MIC of 6.25 µM, so the purest compounds by LC-MS were selected for re-synthesis.

The synthesis of all compounds was achieved by first making the ligands using the scaled-up procedure for generating ligand libraries, changing the solvent from DMSO to DMF to enable a more feasible workup and purification. The ligands were then reacted with the metal in high-yielding reactions. After purification by flash column chromatography, the pure compounds were fully characterized. Single crystals of Mn(CO)3(M19Y1), Re(CO)3(M1Y1), and Re(CO)3(M20Y3) were obtained by slow vapor diffusion (CHCl3/Et2O, DCM/n-hexane, and DCM/Et2O respectively), with the X-ray diffraction structures (Fig. 8) clearly showing the bidentate binding mode of the pyridine-triazole ligands.

CDCC Deposition numbers 2504789, 2455425, 2504788.

Stability assays on the pure compounds were undertaken, with biologically relevant solvents and mixtures tested (DMSO, H2O, 1X PBS and a combination of DMSO with H2O and 1X PBS). The stability was ascertained by measurement of UV absorbance (320 nm) at 37 °C over 21 h. Most compounds demonstrated good overall stability with less than 10% difference in the spectra over this period; however, the Mn(CO)3 complexes exhibited significant changes in their overall UV-Vis spectra in H2O and 1X PBS over 2–8 h. This could be due to anion exchange (in the case of PBS) or water competitively binding with the complex in the axial position. However, this did not seem to be detrimental to the antibacterial activity of these compounds (vide infra).

Biological studies were undertaken on the purified compounds to confirm activity against bacteria (MIC assays) and ascertain toxicity (CC50 measurements against HEK293T cells). Almost no activity was observed against E. coli at the measured concentrations, with the exception of Re(CO)3(M1Y1) and Mn(CO)3(M22Y1) (MIC = 100 µM, see Supporting Information Table S5). However, perturbation of the outer membrane by polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN) resulted in significant activity against E. coli for all compounds (see Supporting Information Table S6)67. PMBN has no inherent antibacterial activity, but damages and weakens the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria by interacting with the anionic lipopolysaccharide molecules. This permeabilizes the membrane to antibiotics, suggesting that uptake into Gram-negative bacteria is the issue for these compounds and they are not necessarily Gram-positive specific68.

For the Gram-positive strains, high activity was observed in almost all cases. A comparison of activity between the crude reaction mixtures and re-synthesized compounds against S. aureus gives an increase in activity in all cases, with very low MICs (5/6 compounds active in the nanomolar range, similar to the vancomycin control MIC = 0.42 µM, Table 2). This confirms that in all cases it is the putative metal complex in the crudes that is responsible for the observed activity, validating our methodology of pre-screening large crude libraries (Table 2). It should be noted that in several cases (Re(CO)3(M1Y1), IrCN(M12Y1), Mn(CO)3(M19Y1)) there were larger increases ( > 16x, >4x, and >8x more active respectively) in antibacterial activity than expected from the increase in purity due to re-synthesis (crude purity by LC-MS of 43%, 72%, 41% respectively). This suggests that our methodology in fact underestimates the activity of the complexes in the synthesized libraries.

The other tested Gram-positive strains showed generally good activity, with slightly higher MICs against Enterococcus faecalis in most cases. The exception was the manganese complexes, which were significantly less active. Enterococcus faecium showed very low growth in the Mueller-Hinton (MH) growth medium that was typically used, so Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) growth medium was used instead. This gave measurable MICs, but a comparison with E. faecalis (which was tested in both MH and TSB) indicates that TSB results in a significant rise in MIC values. As such, although the MICs for E. faecium are higher than S. aureus, there is still good activity in most cases (Table 2). Generally, Re(CO)3(M20Y3) and IrCN(M12Y1) show exceptional activity across the tested Gram-positive (and sensitized Gram-negative) bacterial strains, with often nanomolar MICs. The fact that the compounds showed very low MICs against E. coli upon permeabilization suggests that further structural optimization targeted at improving Gram-negative bacterial uptake could result in pan-active metalloantibiotics. As the antibacterial activity of the pure compounds increased compared to the crude, the same trend was also observed for their cytotoxicity. Indeed, most of the compounds displayed CC50 in the range of 10 µM. However, due to their high level of antibacterial activity, all compounds except Mn(CO)3(M22Y1) still displayed a favorable therapeutic index >10. The best ratio of antibacterial activity and toxicity was determined for IrCN(M8Y4) showcasing a therapeutic index between 49–99. Overall, these values are comparable and in several cases superior to that of other recently reported metal-based antibiotics16,23,31.

Additional toxicity testing in the form of haemolysis was undertaken. For human red blood cells, the concentration at which 10% of them have lysed (HC10) was low to moderate for the two Re complexes (HC10 = 36 ± 6 µM and 73 ± 29 µM, respectively), mirroring their toxicity against mammalian cells. This was also true for IrCN(M12Y1) and Mn(CO)3(M22Y1), which also caused haemolysis, albeit at higher concentrations (HC10 = 81 ± 4 µM and 87 ± 7 µM respectively). Interestingly, both IrCN(M8Y4) and Mn(CO)3(M19Y1) showed no haemolysis at any of the tested concentrations (HC10 > 200 µM). For IrCN(M8Y4), this is especially encouraging, as it is highly active against Gram-positive strains, has the highest CC50 tested and is not haemolytic. For all compounds, the HC10 values are significantly higher than the MIC concentrations against Gram-positive strains, so there is still a potential therapeutic window available.

From a methodology perspective, the single dose toxicity assay was used as a guide to select the most active and least toxic compounds for re-synthesis. It is clear from the CC50 data that although the single dose assay mirrors the true toxicity, it can underestimate the cytotoxicity of the pure compounds. For the IrCN compounds, it was expected that they would have significant toxicity based on recent work, and the single dose assay did indeed indicate that22. More surprising is the Re(CO)3 data, which was significantly more toxic than expected from the preliminary assay. As such, the high throughput assay does successfully indicate toxicity, but more stringent conditions on selecting active and non-toxic compounds will be used in future work, such as increasing the toxicity threshold above 50% cell viability. It should be noted that cell-based assays can only provide so much information and hit compounds will have to undergo more stringent testing before a conclusion can be made about their safety.

In summary, we have presented a combinatorial methodology to generate large libraries of pyridyl-triazole bidentate ligands formed by CuAAc Click reactions. These libraries have been demonstrated to coordinate efficiently to a number of metal scaffolds, generating 672 well-characterized complexes under mild conditions. We have showcased some applications of our metal libraries for catalytic and photophysical applications, including synthesizing and testing two iridium complexes in transfer hydrogenation assays. We have successfully screened all compounds for antimicrobial activity and toxicity in a high-throughput “Direct-to-Biology” approach, and, using the available data, have re-synthesized several highly active metalloantibiotics, with MICs as low as 200 nM against S. aureus. We have also demonstrated that the single-dose antibacterial and toxicity assays are a reliable indicator of the properties of the pure compounds from crude reaction mixtures, even for low-yielding reactions. However, care must be taken when it comes to single-dose toxicity assays as they tended to indicate that compounds are less toxic than they turned out to be upon re-synthesis.

We have identified one complex by our Direct to Biology approach, IrCN(M8Y4), which has good activity against Gram-positive strains and relatively low toxicity against HEK293T cells, giving it a favorable therapeutic index ( > 49 against S. aureus). Additionally, it has been shown to be non-haemolytic and demonstrates good stability in a variety of relevant solvents. These properties make it a potential candidate as an antibiotic against systemic infections. Further testing will involve advanced toxicity and stability studies, efficacy against a broader panel of Gram-positive bacteria, and potential in vivo testing.

Although promising activity against Gram-positive bacteria has been reported here for a number of different metal complexes, activity against Gram-negative strains has been lacking. Improved activity in the presence of the PMBN sensitizer suggests that the low original activity is in part due to poor uptake of the synthesized metal complexes. However, thanks to the combinatorial and versatile ligand architecture there is now scope to significantly vary the ligands to explore and include motifs to improve uptake into bacteria69,70.

Screening crude reaction libraries for catalytic applications has also been demonstrated, with 384 complexes evaluated across two different transfer hydrogenation assays. These assays are amenable to high-throughput reaction monitoring under ambient conditions in 96-well plates and allowed us to identify and resynthesize two promising IrCp* catalysts. One of them, IrCp*(P4A11), was highly active in both assays and shows promise for further catalytic testing, including pro-drug unmasking in cells. Work in our group is currently ongoing with derivatives of IrCp* and IrCN libraries to explore photophysical properties, photodynamic therapy, and catalytic applications.

The potential scope of this ligand chemistry is somewhat limited by the availability of 2-alkyne pyridines (for the Tz-4-P library). However, this limitation is more than made up for by the capacity to use practically any primary amine to generate bidentate ligands, and hence a large number of metal complexes are now obtainable. Additionally, as the ligand architecture is highly variable around a fixed core motif, this methodology lends itself well to potential machine learning applications to enable the discovery of highly optimized compounds30. In terms of other biological applications, assays for any disease-based screening would in principle be possible on these libraries or derivatives of them.

We believe there is much scope to expand the types of chemistry that are amenable to the combinatorial generation of ligand structures described here. Additionally, we have only scratched the surface of the periodic table in terms of explored metal scaffolds. While each metal may require slightly different conditions and not all of them will be amenable to this type of chemistry, we believe that the field of combinatorial metal complex synthesis is only just at its beginning.

A further 150 µL of MeCN was used to wash the Falcon tube and ensure efficient transfer of material, with this also being added to the reaction mixture. The mixture was stirred vigorously at 0 °C with the lid loosely screwed on top for 15 min, then allowed to settle at r.t. for 30 min. The upper organic layer was decanted and diluted with 3 mL DMSO, giving a solution of FSO2N3 of ~173 mM.

Method adapted from Meng et al.28. The following procedure assumes a concentration of 173 mM for FSO2N3 and describes the addition to 1 well of a Paradox® 96 well plate (700 µL glass vial) using an Opentrons OT2 liquid handling robot (P300 Gen2 300 µL pipette and P20 Gen2 20 µL pipette). To the reaction well, sat. KHCO3 solution (11 µL, 4 equiv., nominally 3 M), followed by DMSO (65 µL), was added, then amine stock solution (100 µL, 80 mM, 1 equiv.). FSO2N3 stock solution was then added (48 µL, 173 mM 1.05 equiv., Note: the pipette was aspirated 3 times to equilibrate solvent vapor pressure). The reaction vials were then sealed, and shaken at 800 rpm for 18 h at r.t. Sodium ascorbate solution (80 µL, 50 mM, 0.5 equiv.) was added and the reaction shaken for a further 15 min at r.t. To each reaction well, alkyne stock solution (100 µL, 80 mM, 1 equiv.) was added, followed by (BimH)3 solution in DMSO (10 µL, 20 mM, 2.5 mol%), then CuSO4 solution in water (10 µL, 20 mM, 2.5 mol%). The reaction was sealed and shaken at 800 rpm for 18 h at r.t.

The plate was sealed and heated at 70 °C (600 rpm) for 18 h. After this, 240 µL of MeOH was added to each well, and the plate was left unsealed for one week, allowing for the MeOH to evaporate off (giving 60 µL of 10 mM complexes).

(Note: Mn complexes are light sensitive, so all steps were done in darkness. The pre-activation of Mn was performed under N2, but other steps were done under ambient conditions). Mn(CO)5Br (38.5 mg, 0.14 mmol) and AgOTf (36 mg, 0.14 mmol. Note: hydroscopic, light-sensitive) were placed in a 50 mL 2-necked round bottomed flask fitted with a condenser, and evacuated/backfilled with N2 three times. Dry THF (7 mL) was added, and the mixture was refluxed under N2 at 70 °C for 45 min. After cooling, the supernatant was used as a stock solution of Mn(CO)3(THF)3OTf (20 mM). Ligand stock solution (30 µL, 20 mM) was dispensed into 700 µL glass vials, with 30 µL of Mn(CO)3(THF)3OTf stock solution added to each well. After 2 h at r.t., 1-methylbenzimidazole stock solution (30 µL, 20 mM, DMSO) was added, and the plate was left shaking at r.t. (600 rpm) for 72 h, allowing for the THF to evaporate off (giving 60 µL of 10 mM complexes).

di-μ-chloro-bis[chloro(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)iridium(III)] (49.4 mg, 0.062 mmol) was dissolved in DMSO (6.2 mL, 10 mM).

FSO2N3 was synthesized as before and diluted with DMF to approx. 200 mM in 1:1 MTBE:DMF (by volume). The desired amine (0.56 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) was charged into a 50 mL polypropylene Falcon tube, followed by DMF (7 mL). Sat. KHCO3 solution (0.8 mL, approx. 2.4 mmol, 4 equiv. in water) was added, followed by FSO2N3 solution (1.05 equiv.). The resulting mixture was stirred at r.t. for 18 h. Sodium ascorbate solution (5.6 mL, 50 mM, 0.5 equiv. in water) was added, and the mixture was stirred for a further 10 min. 7 mL of DMF was added, followed by alkyne (0.56 mmol, 1.0 equiv.), then (BimH)3 solution (0.7 mL, 20 mM, 2.5 mol% in DMF) and CuSO4 solution (0.7 mL, 20 mM, 2.5 mol% in water). The resulting mixture was stirred for a further 18 h at r.t. The crude reaction mixture was analyzed by LCMS, then 100 mL of deionized water was added. The mixture was extracted with 3:1 CHCl3: isopropyl alcohol (3 × 30 mL), followed by EtOAc (2 × 30 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with 5 wt% LiCl solution (5 × 25 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered, and the solvent evaporated. The residue was redissolved in EtOAc (40 mL) and washed with more LiCl solution (3 × 20 mL). The organic layers were dried (MgSO4), filtered, and the solvent evaporated to give the crude product. Purification was achieved by flash column chromatography.

Re(CO)5Cl (50 mg, 0.138 mmol, 1 equiv.) and AgOTf (35.5 mg, 0.138 mmol, 1 equiv., Note: hydroscopic, light-sensitive) were charged to a 5 mL microwave vial, followed by MeOH (2 mL). The vial was sealed and heated in a microwave reactor at 120 °C for 30 min. The colorless solution was filtered through celite (with an additional 1 mL of MeOH) into a second 5 mL microwave vial containing the target ligand (0.152 mmol, 1.1 equiv.) and 1-methylbenzimidazole (BeMeIm, 20 mg, 0.152 mmol, 1.1 equiv.). The vial was sealed and heated in a microwave reactor at 120 °C for 1 h. The solvent was removed to give the crude compound as a pale yellow solid, which was purified by crystallization (approx. 2 mL DCM, layered with approx. 15 mL n-hexane, and stored at 5 °C overnight) or flash column chromatography.

All reaction vessels and containers were covered in aluminium foil and handled in the dark to prevent degradation by light. Mn(CO)5Br (91 mg, 0.33 mmol, 1 equiv.) and AgOTf (85 mg, 0.33 mmol, 1 equiv., Note: hydroscopic) were charged to a 10 mL microwave vial, which was evacuated and backfilled with N2. Dry THF (4.5 mL) was added, and the vial was sealed under N2 and heated at 75 °C for 45 min, after which it was allowed to cool. The pressure was released by piercing the seal with a N2 balloon when cool, and 2 mL of the yellow solution (0.15 mmol Mn complex) was decanted into a second 10 mL microwave vial containing target ligand (0.155 mmol, 1.05 equiv.) and 1-methylbenzimidazole (BeMeIm, 21 mg, 0.155 mmol, 1.05 equiv.) under N2. The vial was sealed and heated at 75 °C for 2 h. The solvent was removed in vacuo to give the crude compound as a yellow solid, which was purified by flash column chromatography.

To a 100 mL round bottom flask fitted with an air condenser, IrCN dimer (40 mg, 0.037 mmol, 1 equiv.) and target ligand (0.074 mmol, 2 equiv.) were added. CHCl3 (30 mL) and MeOH (10 mL) were added, and the resulting solution was stirred rapidly at 40 °C for 18 h. The solvent was removed in vacuo, and the residue was purified by flash column chromatography.

To a 7 mL glass vial, di-μ-chloro-bis[chloro(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)iridium(III)] (40 mg, 0.05 mmol, 1 equiv.) and target ligand (0.10 mmol, 2 equiv.) were added. DCM (2 mL) and MeOH (2 mL were added, and the reaction mixture stirred overnight at room temperature. The mixture was transferred to a 20 mL vial and the solvent was evaporated in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in DCM (2 mL), to which Et2O (10 mL) was slowly added to precipitate the complex. The fine precipitate was isolated on a glass sinter and washed with Et2O (3 ×20 mL). The precipitate was dissolved in DCM, collected and the solvent removed in vacuo. Et2O (2 mL) was added to the residue and dried in vacuo, yielding the target complex as a yellow solid.

Coumarin-N3 (10 mg, 0.05 mmol) and sodium formate (34 mg, 0.5 mmol) were dissolved in a mixture of 1:1 tBuOH / 1X PBS solution (25 mL) to give a solution of 2 mM coumarin-N3. In a polystyrene 96 well plate, 165 μL of 1:1 tBuOH /1X PBS solution was added, followed by coumarin-N3 / sodium formate mix (25 μL). 10 μL of RuCy catalyst stock solution at 5 mM was added to initiate the reaction. The reaction was monitored by fluorescence (generation of Coumarin-NH2) using a plate reader (λex = 350 nm, λem = 445 nm) over 21 h at 25 °C, with 2 min of shaking (400 rpm) and 13 min delay between data points.

IrCp* catalyst samples were diluted to a stock solution of 750 µM (50:50 DMSO/H2O). Separately, stock solutions of harmaline (4.3 mg, 0.02 mmol, 2 mM) and sodium formate (136 mg, 2 mmol, 200 mM) were dissolved in mixtures of 1:1 tBuOH / 1X PBS solution (10 mL). In a polystyrene 96 well plate, 135 uL of 1:1 tBuOH /1X PBS solution was added, followed by the harmaline stock solution (20 µL, 1 equiv.), then sodium formate stock (25 µL, 125 equiv.), and finally 20 uL of IrCp* catalyst stock solution at 750 µM was added to initiate the reaction. The reaction was monitored by UV-Vis absorbance (consumption of harmaline) using a plate reader (λ = 374 nm) over 48 h at 25 °C, with 2 min of shaking (400 rpm) and 3 min delay between data points.

5 µL of each compound in the IrCN library (5 mM) was diluted with 200 µL DMSO. Of this, 50 µL was taken and diluted with a further 150 µL DMSO in a polystyrene 96 well plate (31.3 µM). The UV-Vis absorbance (270–600 nm, 25 flashes) and fluorescence (λex = 406 nm, λem = 450–700 nm, and λex = 380 nm, λem = 450–700 nm, 25 flashes) of these compounds were then measured using a plate reader.

The following bacterial strains were used for testing: Enterococcus faecalis CCUG 19916 T (Gram positive), Enterococcus faecium CUG 19434 (Gram positive), Staphylococcus aureus CCUG 19434 (Gram positive), Escherichia coli NCTC 13476 (Gram negative). Bacterial stock solutions were prepared as follows. Single bacterial colonies were grown on Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB, Gram positive) or Miller's LB Broth (LB, E. coli) agar. A single colony was removed and placed in the relevant growth medium (5 mL, TSB or LB) and incubated overnight at 37 °C (200 rpm). 100 µL of this overnight culture was added to 5 mL of the same growth medium, and the day culture was incubated at 37 °C (200 rpm) until the OD600 was 0.4–0.9 (~4 h). A sample of this culture was diluted with Mueller Hinton (MH) broth to OD600 = 0.022, at which point the bacterial cultures were added to plates for testing. For all testing, samples were incubated with bacteria for 16–20 h at 37 °C, after which the absorbance at 600 nm was measured using a plate reader. Antibiotic controls were Vancomycin (stock solution at 1 mg/mL in water, MIC beginning at 20 µg / mL) for Gram positive bacteria, and Polymyxin B (stock solution at 1 mg / mL in water, MIC beginning at 20 µg / mL) for E. coli. Unless stated otherwise, 2 biological repeats per sample were recorded, with each having 2 technical repeats. Polystyrene 96 well plates from TPP and CytoOne were used in all cases (sterile, DNA, DNase, RNase, pyrogen free). DMSO and other solvents were kept below 5% volume in the final solutions for biological testing.

Samples were diluted to 750 µM using DMSO/H2O (to give a 50:50 stock solution). Of these stock solutions, 20 µL (for 50 µM) or 5 µL (for 12.5 µM) per sample was added to 96 well plates. MH growth media was added to each well (making up the volume to 290 µL), followed by the relevant bacteria in MH growth media (10 µL). The plates were incubated for 16–20 h at 37 °C, after which the absorbance at 600 nm was measured using a plate reader.

Stock solutions of samples were diluted with DMSO/H2O (to give a 50:50 stock solution) so that 6 uL of stock solution can be added to 300 µL of MH growth media to give an initial concentration of either 50 µM (crude compounds) or 100 µM (pure compounds). These solutions were serially diluted (150 µL into 150 µL) 7 times (crude compounds) or 11 times (pure compounds) to give solutions of 150 µL. To these, 5 µL of the relevant bacterial strain was added in MH growth media. The plates were incubated for 16–20 h at 37 °C, after which the absorbance at 600 nm was measured using a plate reader. Pure compounds were tested with 2 biological repeats per sample, with each having 3 technical repeats.For testing with Polymyxin B nonapeptide, a solution of 300 µg / mL was prepared, and 5 µL of this was added to each well immediately before the addition of E. coli.

The human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 T cell line was cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium high glucose (DMEM) (Sigma Aldrich, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 μg/mL streptomycin and 100 Units/mL penicillin, and 2 mM L-glutamine. The cells were maintained in a 5% CO2 environment, at 37 °C and the culture media were replaced with fresh media every 72 hours.

HEK-293T cells were seeded at 10000 cells per well and incubated overnight to enable adhesion. Thereafter, the cells were treated with either the negative control (0.1%-0.28% DMSO depending on the concentration of the crude complexes) or the crude complexes at 50 µM for 24 h. To quantify cell viability, the cells were treated with the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) salt (Apollo Scientific, UK) according to the procedure described by Mosmann71. The absorbance at 590 nm was measured using a TECAN well plate reader instrument M1000. Two biological repeats in duplicate were performed for this study, and the recorded absorbances were adjusted for the respective crudes and growth media.

HEK-293T cells were seeded at 10000 cells per well and incubated overnight to allow adhesion. 5 mM stock solutions of pure compounds were prepared in 1:1 DMSO: PBS 1X. In a 1.5 mL 96 well dilution plate, starting concentrations of 150 µM and 200 µM of each compound were made in growth media (1 mL). 500 uL of these were serial diluted into 500 uL of media 11 times. 500 uL of media was then added to each well added to make 1 mL of each concentration (starting at 75 µM and 100 µM). 100 uL of these solutions were added into wells containing the pre-counted cells and treated for 24 h. Thereafter, the MTT assay was used to quantify viable cells and at least three biological repeats in triplicate were conducted from which the CC50 was determined using GraphPad Prism v8.0.2 (GraphPad Software, California, USA). The absorbance at 590 nm was measured using a TECAN well plate reader instrument M1000. 4 biological repeats in triplicate were done for this study (12 data points). For the Mn complexes, 2 biological repeats in triplicate (6 data points) were used.

Blood samples were obtained from healthy volunteers through Hull York Medical School. The haemolysis assay was adapted from a previously reported procedure72. Whole blood (5 mL) was centrifuged (Thermo Scientific SL 8 R) at 4500 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C, and the plasma was discarded. The remaining human red blood cell (hRBC) pellet was washed three times with PBS 1X (pH 7.4): for each wash, PBS was added up to 15 mL, followed by centrifugation at 4500 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. After the final wash, the cells were resuspended in PBS to a final volume of 35 mL. The stock solutions for the samples to be tested were 2.5 mM in PBS:DMSO (60:40). For the determination of HC₅₀ and HC₁₀ values, test compounds were diluted in PBS to give a concentration range from 200 µM down to 5 µM, giving a total volume of 125 µL. Dilutions were prepared in 20 µM decrements with the final points at 10 and 5 µM. Each plate included a blank medium control (PBS) and a haemolytic activity control (1% SDS in PBS). The hRBC suspension (125 µL) was incubated with the samples in PBS in a V-shaped 96-well plate for 4 h at 25 °C. After incubation, 60 μL of supernatant was carefully pipetted to a flat bottom, clear 96-wells plate. Haemolysis was measured by absorbance at 540 nm using a plate reader (TECAN M1000). The percentage of haemolysis at each concentration was determined and the HC10 and HC50 were calculated by inhibitor vs. normalized response fit (Prism). The minimum haemolytic concentration (MHC) was determined by visual assessment of the wells after incubation. The MHC was defined as the lowest compound concentration at which visible haemolysis (red coloration of the supernatant and/or loss of intact red pellet) could be observed compared to the PBS control. Each experiment was repeated in triplicate (3 biological and 3 statistical replicates).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Google's and OpenAI's Chatbots Can Strip Women in Photos Down to Bikinis","https://www.wired.com/story/google-and-openais-chatbots-can-strip-women-in-photos-down-to-bikinis/","Tue, 23 Dec 2025 11:30:00 GMT","

Some users of popular chatbots are generating bikini deepfakes using photos of fully clothed women as their source material. Most of these fake images appear to be generated without the consent of the women in the photos. Some of these same users are also offering advice to others on how to use the generative AI tools to strip the clothes off of women in photos and make them appear to be wearing bikinis.

Under a now-deleted Reddit post titled “gemini nsfw image generation is so easy,” users traded tips for how to get Gemini, Google's generative AI model, to make pictures of women in revealing clothes. Many of the images in the thread were entirely AI, but one request stood out.

A user posted a photo of a woman wearing an Indian sari, asking for someone to “remove” her clothes and “put a bikini” on instead. Someone else replied with a deepfake image to fulfil the request. After WIRED notified Reddit about these posts and asked the company for comment, Reddit's safety team removed the request and the AI deepfake.

“Reddit's sitewide rules prohibit nonconsensual intimate media, including the behavior in question,” said a spokesperson. The subreddit where this discussion occurred, r/ChatGPTJailbreak, had over 200,000 followers before Reddit banned it under the platform's “don't break the site” rule.

As generative AI tools that make it easy to create realistic but false images continue to proliferate, users of the tools have continued to harass women with nonconsensual deepfake imagery. Millions have visited harmful “nudify” websites, designed for users to upload real photos of people and request for them to be undressed using generative AI.

With xAI's Grok as a notable exception, most mainstream chatbots don't usually allow the generation of NSFW images in AI outputs. These bots, including Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT, are also fitted with guardrails that attempt to block harmful generations.

In November, Google released Nano Banana Pro, a new imaging model that excels at tweaking existing photos and generating hyperrealistic images of people. OpenAI responded last week with its own updated imaging model, ChatGPT Images.

As these tools improve, likenesses may become more realistic when users are able to subvert guardrails.

In a separate Reddit thread about generating NSFW images, a user asked for recommendations on how to avoid guardrails when adjusting someone's outfit to make the subject's skirt appear tighter. In WIRED's limited tests to confirm that these techniques worked on Gemini and ChatGPT, we were able to transform images of fully clothed women into bikini deepfakes using basic prompts written in plain English.

When asked about users generating bikini deepfakes using Gemini, a spokesperson for Google said the company has ""clear policies that prohibit the use of [its] AI tools to generate sexually explicit content."" The spokesperson claims Google's tools are continually improving at ""reflecting"" what's laid out in its AI policies.

In response to WIRED's request for comment about users being able to generate bikini deepfakes with ChatGPT, a spokesperson for OpenAI claims the company loosened some ChatGPT guardrails this year around adult bodies in nonsexual situations. The spokesperson also highlights OpenAI's usage policy, stating that ChatGPT users are prohibited from altering someone else's likeness without consent and that the company takes action against users generating explicit deepfakes, including account bans.

Online discussions about generating NSFW images of women remain active. This month, a user in the r/GeminiAI subreddit offered instructions to another user on how to change women's outfits in a photo into bikini swimwear. (Reddit deleted this comment when we pointed it out to them.)

Corynne McSherry, a legal director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, sees “abusively sexualized images” as one of AI image generators' core risks.

She mentions that these image tools can be used for other purposes outside of deepfakes and that focusing how the tools are used is critical—as well as “holding people and corporations accountable” when potential harm is caused.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Chinese Crypto Scammers on Telegram Are Fueling the Biggest Darknet Markets Ever","https://www.wired.com/story/expired-tired-wired-chinese-scammer-crypto-markets/","Tue, 23 Dec 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

When black markets for drugs, guns, and all manner of contraband first sprang up on the dark web more than a decade ago, it seemed that cryptocurrency and the technical sophistication of the anonymity software Tor were the keys to carrying out billions of dollars worth of untouchable, illicit transactions online.

Now, all of that looks a bit passé. In 2025, all it takes to get away with tens of billions of dollars in black-market crypto deals is a messaging platform willing to host scammers and human traffickers, enough persistence to relaunch channels and accounts on that service when they're occasionally banned, and fluency in Chinese.

The ecosystem of marketplaces for Chinese-speaking crypto scammers hosted on the messaging service Telegram have now grown to be bigger than ever before, according to a new analysis from the crypto tracing firm Elliptic. Despite a brief drop after Telegram banned two of the biggest such markets in early 2025, the two current top markets, known as Tudou Guarantee and Xinbi Guarantee, are together enabling close to $2 billion a month in money-laundering transactions, sales of scam tools like stolen data, fake investment websites, and AI deepfake tools, as well as other black market services as varied as pregnancy surrogacy and teen prostitution.

The crypto romance and investment scams regrettably known as “pig butchering”—carried out largely from compounds in Southeast Asia staffed with thousands of human trafficking victims—have grown to become the world's most lucrative form of cybercrime. They pull in around $10 billion annually from US victims alone, according to the FBI. By selling money-laundering services and other scam-related offerings to those operations, markets like Tudou Guarantee and Xinbi Guarantee have grown in parallel to an immense scale.

“When you consider illicit use of crypto assets, there really isn't anything larger right now,” says Tom Robinson, Elliptic's cofounder and chief scientist.

In fact, these criminal trading zones aren't simply the biggest online black markets of the moment, but the biggest in history. AlphaBay was once the biggest dark-web market for drugs, stolen data, and hacking tools. Described by the FBI as 10 times the size of the original Silk Road dark-web drug market at its peak, AlphaBay facilitated more than $1 billion in transactions over its two and a half years online. Hydra, a Russian dark-web market that also offered money-laundering services to cryptocurrency thieves and ransomware groups, did more than $5 billion in transactions over its seven years of operation.

By comparison, Huione Guarantee, the Chinese-language, Telegram-based market used largely by crypto scammers, facilitated a stunning $27 billion in transactions from 2021 to 2025, according to Elliptic, dwarfing every online black market before it, even as it operated in full public view on Telegram's messaging platform. Elliptic has called it simply “the largest illicit online marketplace to have ever operated.”

WIRED reached out on Telegram to administrators of both Tudou Guarantee and Xinbi Guarantee for comment but didn't receive a response.

In May, Telegram seemed to finally take action, banning Huione Guarantee—which had rebranded as Haowang Guarantee—after it was named as a money-laundering operation by the US Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. But since then, Tudou Guarantee, in which Haowang Guarantee owns a stake, has grown to fill that same position. Elliptic now measures its transactions at $1.1 billion a month, close to Haowang's $1.4 billion a month. The second-biggest crypto scam market, Xinbi Guarantee, has meanwhile grown to $850 million a month—despite also being banned in May and relaunching—adding up to more total market volume than ever. And those two black markets are just two of around 30 that Elliptic tracks, together carrying out tens of billions of dollars in annual transactions.

When WIRED wrote to Telegram in June to point out how these markets had rebuilt their criminal empires in plain sight—in fact, a WIRED reporter had even been present in a Telegram channel where Elliptic shared its findings about Tudou Guarantee's and Xinbi Guarantee's rebound with Telegram corporate contacts—the company responded that it had decided not to ban the markets again, arguing that they offered an outlet for Chinese users looking for financial freedom from “capital controls” that “often leave citizens with little choice but to seek alternative avenues for moving funds internationally.” “We assess reports on a case-by-case basis and categorically reject blanket bans—particularly when users are attempting to circumvent oppressive restrictions imposed by authoritarian regimes,” Telegram's June statement to WIRED continued. “We remain unwavering in our commitment to safeguarding user privacy and defending fundamental freedoms, including the right to financial autonomy.”

But Elliptic and other scam-industry analysts have rejected that argument, pointing out that the vast majority of activity in markets like Tudou Guarantee and Xinbi Guarantee is criminal. Aside from scam-related services, they also sell prostitution—posts on Xinbo include suggestions of sex trafficking of minors in posts advertising “lolita” or “young girl” sex workers. The scam operation customers they service, too, are widely documented to use forced laborers in often brutal, modern slavery compounds.

“They have the ability to shut down a scam economy and the trafficking of human beings. Instead, they're hosting Craigslist for crypto scammers,” says Erin West, a former Santa Clara County, California, prosecutor who now leads the Operation Shamrock anti-scam organization. “These are bad guys enabling bad-guy business on their bad-guy platform.”

Aside from Telegram, the cryptocurrency Tether also plays a key role in scam markets—the popular “stablecoin” is the preferred tool for all of the markets' money-laundering transactions. Unlike most crypto, Tether has a centralized structure that would allow the company—also called Tether—that backs that digital currency to seize or freeze funds at will, yet it has rarely interfered with the vast money flows it enables.

Neither Telegram nor Tether responded to WIRED's requests for comment on their roles in enabling Tudou Guarantee and Xinbi Guarantee's black market transactions.

Tether and Telegram's efforts to combat the ballooning scam industry's use of their tools is comparable to Southeast Asian law enforcement's minimal, often performative shows of raiding scam compounds, only to allow them to rebuild and resume operation, argues Jacob Sims, a visiting fellow at Harvard's Asia Center who focuses on transnational crime. “There is impunity on all levels that prevents any meaningful disruption,” says Sims.

Sims argues that only focused and cooperative international government and law enforcement pressure, comparable to the global effort to combat terrorism or drug trafficking, will change that lax approach, including from companies that are facilitating the scam epidemic.

The response to this ballooning scam industry “hasn't risen to that level of coordination and urgency yet,” Sims says. “And it needs to before we see this thing prioritized at the level that is actually commensurate with the damage it's causing.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Big Balls Was Just the Beginning","https://www.wired.com/story/expired-tired-wired-doge/","Tue, 23 Dec 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Since the beginning of the Trump administration, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the brainchild of billionaire Elon Musk, has gone through several iterations, leading periodically to claims—most recently from the director of the Office of Personnel Management—that the group doesn't exist, or has vanished altogether.

But DOGE isn't dead. Many of its original members are in full-time roles at various government agencies, and the new National Design Studio (NDS) is headed by Airbnb cofounder Joe Gebbia, a close ally of Musk's.

Even if DOGE doesn't survive another year, or until the US semiquincentennial—its original expiration date, per the executive order establishing it—the organization's larger project will continue. DOGE from its inception was used for two things, both of which have continued apace: the destruction of the administrative state and the wholesale consolidation of data in service of concentrating power in the executive branch. It is a pattern that experts say could spill over beyond the Trump administration.

“I do think it has altered the norms about where legislative power ends and where executive power begins simply by ignoring those norms,” says Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan. “This is not necessarily going to be limited to Republican administrations. There are going to be future Democratic presidents who will say, ‘Well, DOGE was able to do this, why can't we?'”

The earliest days of DOGE were characterized by a chaotic blitz in which small teams of DOGE operatives, like the now infamous Edward “Big Balls” Coristine, were deployed across government agencies, demanding high-level access to sensitive data, firing workers, and cutting contracts. And while these moves were often radical, if not appearing to be illegal, as matters of bureaucratic operation, they were in service of what had been the Trump administration's agenda all along.

Goals like cutting discretionary spending and drastically reducing the size of the federal workforce had already been championed by people like vice president JD Vance, who in 2021 called for the “de-Ba'athification” of the government, and Russell Vought, now the head of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). These goals were also part of Project 2025. What DOGE brought wasn't the end, but the means—its unique insight was that controlling technical infrastructure, something achievable with a small group, functionally amounted to controlling the government.

“There has never been a unit of government that was handed so much power to fundamentally upend government agencies with so little oversight,” says Moynihan.

Under the Constitution, the authority for establishing and funding federal agencies comes from Congress. But Trump and many of the people who support him, including Vought and Vance, adhere to what was until relatively recently a fringe view of how government should be run: the unitary executive theory. This posits that, much like the CEO of a company, the president has near complete control over the executive branch, of which federal agencies are a part—power more like that of a king than of the figure described in the nation's founding documents.

“The unitary executive theory has animated a lot of what DOGE has done at a lot of different places,” says George Foote, outside general counsel to the US Institute of Peace (USIP), an independent nonprofit funded by Congress. Though USIP is an independent organization, the Trump administration asserted that USIP was part of the executive branch and, therefore, should be brought under control by DOGE. “DOGE was certainly a tool that the people in the White House and OMB used to impose that sort of control,” Foote adds.

With efficiency and innovation as justifications—and with access to all unclassified systems in the executive branch, per the terms of the executive order establishing it—DOGE was able to spread across the government, quickly executing some of the main priorities of the administration.

“I'll say they wanted to bring artificial intelligence and advanced computer capabilities. And there's plenty of room for that in government,” says Foote. “But at USIP and at some of the places, that was just covering up. It was pure pretense. They smashed things up.”

“President Trump pledged to cut the waste, fraud, and abuse in our bloated government, and the Administration is committed to delivering on this pledge for the American people,” said White House spokesperson Davis Ingle in response to a request for comment.

DOGE focused its efforts on gaining access to sensitive systems, like the payments mechanism at a Treasury agency, normally manned by apolitical federal employees, as a way to execute the administration's political agenda. WIRED first reported in February that DOGE operative Marko Elez gained access to Treasury systems within the first two weeks of the Trump administration. At the same time, DOGE operatives were being granted access to other federal payroll systems.

In March, WIRED reported that accessing the Treasury's payment systems was part of DOGE and the administration's preliminary plan to cut off funding to the US Agency for International Development (USAID). Instead of going to Congress—the entity legally allowed to create and shutter an agency—DOGE could act now, no questions asked or approval needed.

With access to servers allowing them to send out government-wide emails, DOGE operatives sent out blasts demanding to know what federal workers were doing, and asking them to resign en masse. At the Department of Veterans Affairs, then-DOGE operative Sahil Lavingia built an AI tool to “munch” contracts and assess which ones to cut.

“They were cutting out contracts and firing people. Full stop,” says Foote.

At the Social Security Agency (SSA), a DOGE team attempted to add immigrants who were still alive to what's known as the “master death file” in order to essentially shut off their social security numbers.

“You just go to the data systems, you go to payroll systems, you figure out where the contracts are going out the door and you take control of those. From there, you can just make sure people don't get paid, or you can eliminate a contract, or you could pull together different data sources,” says Moynihan. “That's a different mode of operating from how even people like Russ Vought or Stephen Miller, people who are fairly sophisticated in thinking about bureaucracy, were operating in the past.”

The DOGE teams also began the process of knitting together disparate datasets housed across agencies in a way that had never been done before, as authorized by another executive order. In April, WIRED reported that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was building a master database with data from the SSA, at least two state voter rolls, and the Internal Revenue Services (IRS). Shortly after, DHS announced that DOGE had helped with its creation—all without the legally required documentation to do so.

According to a whistleblower disclosure filed by former SSA chief data officer Chuck Borges, DOGE operatives copied the sensitive Numerical Identification System (NUMIDENT) database, which contains records of social security claims as well as personal data on all Americans, storing it in a cloud environment “that apparently lacks any security oversight from SSA or tracking to determine who is accessing or has accessed the copy of this data.”

“I absolutely think the data consolidation piece or prioritization of this administration is tied to DOGE and will be part of DOGE's legacy,” says Nikhel Sus, deputy chief counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. CREW is helping represent several plaintiffs, including naturalized citizens, who are suing the government, claiming it is unlawfully sharing sensitive information across agencies. “Just running roughshod over legal requirements and violating the law is not how you run things in a constitutional democracy.”

When Musk left government in May, DOGE's operations appeared to have ramped down. There were no more sudden entrances into buildings or overnight demands for access to sensitive data. But the work started by DOGE continued.

On the administrative side, contracts are still being cut, and Vought continues to try—sometimes unsuccessfully—to fire more and more federal employees. The DHS database to track immigrants has only been formalized and expanded. There is no indication that the copied NUMIDENT database has been removed or restricted. Though a judge ruled that the rapid dismantling of USAID “likely violated the United States Constitution,” the agency remains in limbo, neither fully operational nor killed off entirely. (Major cuts to USAID were, in fact, part of Project 2025's plan for the agency.)

Similarly, despite a federal judge's ruling that DOGE's takeover of USIP was “unlawful,” the organization's building was renamed after President Trump, and the majority of its staff remains barred from accessing it. “What happened at USIP is a transition from the DOGE ‘wrecking team' to more of an institutionalized part of the government, part of the State Department, part of the White House foreign policy operation,” says Foote. “It's completely contrary to the USIP Act and completely out of bounds with everything the USIP has done.”

Moynihan says that DOGE's actions will likely permanently change the US government. “There will be a whole bunch of additional ramifications in specific policy areas that flow from just the massive loss of capacity,” he says. “I think somewhere around 200,000 employees will be gone from the federal government.” The loss of USAID, some researchers have estimated, has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths around the world.

For his part, Sus says he believes that there are paths to undoing the damage that DOGE has wrought. “While we think that this is fixable, it will require a significant amount of work,” says Sus. “And it will require a significant amount of diligence by executive branch officials going forward and from the courts.”

                                What happens here matters everywhere

SUMNER, Wash. — At Amazon's Packaging Innovation Lab  south of Seattle, boxes are dropped from different heights, jiggled for hours to simulate truck transport, and crushed under weights designed to replicate the pressure of stacked cargo. 

The goal: to ensure that products arrive undamaged — without the benefit of plastics and extra bulky boxes.

The e-commerce giant says it's working to phase out plastic from the envelopes, bags, boxes and cushioning it uses to ship everything from bobby pins to bicycles. A recent tour of the Sumner facility and an adjacent fulfillment center featured robotic assembly lines making paper bags and trimmed-down boxes to facilitate that transition.

Amazon says it favors paper because there's better infrastructure in place for customers to easily recycle the material and for it to be turned back into usable items.

“We're shifting towards all-paper packaging material,” confirmed John Sly, Amazon's senior lab and field manager at the Sumner site.

An Amazon spokesperson wouldn't commit to a target date, saying only that the company is working toward the goal and tracking progress in its annual sustainability reports. 

The shift follows lobbying by the nonprofit Oceana and some Amazon shareholders to reduce plastic use, and as Amazon pursues ambitious net zero climate emissions targets. 

But despite the packaging wins, the bigger picture reveals much harder challenges. Amazon reported a 6% increase in its carbon footprint for last year, driven by data center expansion. And while it's deploying electric vans for last-mile deliveries, promises of faster shipping are pushing emissions up, according to new research.



A key strategy for making packaging more sustainable is incorporating robotics that speed and customize the process.

One solution is an automated system that folds lightweight boxes around individual items. It uses thinner, more sustainable corrugated paper than found in traditional boxes. It's pliable enough to wrap around products as they move along a conveyor — cutting to size, folding and sealing without requiring added cushioning.

Another technology uses repurposed machines that formerly made plastic bags, swapping in paper. One of the upsides to the solution is fulfillment centers are already built to fit the devices, so the machines just need to be retrofit to handle and seal paper edges instead of plastic.

On a recent morning, Todd Grasser, an Amazon process assistant, was feeding in products including a box of probiotic supplements and a Bluey character coloring set. 

The machine's estimated top speed is 500 items an hour, Grasser said. “Personally, I do about 475.”

The automated packaging solutions are currently limited to single items, which can apply when someone's order is sourced from different fulfillment centers or if it includes just one product.

The company is also partnering with manufacturers to ship items in their original packaging. That avoids, say, putting a boxed blender inside a bigger box when it doesn't need additional protection. As part of that initiative, Amazon has worked with Proctor & Gamble to make boxed versions of Tide detergent and Playmobil sets that are offered in brown shipping boxes that can be flipped inside out after delivery to reveal colorful toy photos.  

Moving to more sustainable packaging requires testing its properties to ensure that goods arrive to customers undamaged.

The shift means balancing multiple needs, Sly said, that include “prioritizing for protection and minimizing packaging material needed, while also still hitting the delivery speed that we promised.”

The company can move fast in adopting more sustainable packaging and it has in adopting paper bags and paper filler, “but we have to get the right solution,” Amazon spokesperson Saige Kolpack added. “There's implications down the entire network that we have to consider.”

Pirate activist group Anna's Archive says it has scraped the entirety of Spotify's music library and plans to release it through torrents.

Spotify has around 256 million tracks, and the Anna's Archive collection contains metadata for an estimated 99.9% of them. The group archived approximately 86 million music files, accounting for roughly 99.6% of all listens, with a total size of nearly 300 terabytes. So far, only metadata has been released, not any actual music.

“This Spotify scrape is our humble attempt to start such a ‘preservation archive' for music,” the group wrote in a blog post. “Of course Spotify doesn't have all the music in the world, but it's a great start.”

Spotify told TechCrunch that it has identified and disabled the user accounts involved in the scraping.

“We've implemented new safeguards for these types of anti-copyright attacks and are actively monitoring for suspicious behavior,” a Spotify spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Since day one, we have stood with the artist community against piracy, and we are actively working with our industry partners to protect creators and defend their rights.”

Anna's Archive says it normally focuses on text, like books and papers, but its mission to “preserve humanity's knowledge and culture doesn't distinguish among media types.”

Across Uzbekistan, a network of about a hundred banks of high-resolution roadside cameras continuously scan vehicles' license plates and their occupants, sometimes thousands a day, looking for potential traffic violations. Cars running red lights, drivers not wearing their seatbelts, and unlicensed vehicles driving at night, to name a few.

The driver of one of the most surveilled vehicles in the system was tracked over six months as he traveled between the eastern city of Chirchiq, through the capital Tashkent, and in the nearby settlement of Eshonguzar, often multiple times a week.

We know this because the country's sprawling license plate-tracking surveillance system has been left exposed to the internet.

Security researcher Anurag Sen, who discovered the security lapse, found the license plate surveillance system exposed online without a password, allowing anyone access to the data within. It's not clear how long the surveillance system has been public, but artifacts from the system show that its database was set up in September 2024, and traffic monitoring began in mid-2025.

The exposure offers a rare glimpse into how such national license plate surveillance systems work, the data they collect, and how they can be used to track the whereabouts of any one of the millions of people across an entire country.

The lapse also reveals the security and privacy risks associated with the mass monitoring of vehicles and their owners, at a time when the United States is building up its nationwide array of license plate readers, many of which are provided by surveillance giant Flock. Earlier this week, independent news outlet 404 Media reported that Flock left dozens of its own license plate reading cameras publicly exposed to the web, allowing a reporter to watch themselves being tracked in real time by a Flock camera. 

Sen said he found the exposed Uzbek license plate surveillance system earlier this month, and shared details of the security lapse with TechCrunch. Sen told TechCrunch that the system's database reveals the real-world locations of the cameras, and contains millions of photos and raw camera video footage of passing vehicles.

The system is run by the Department of Public Security in Uzbekistan's Ministry of Internal Affairs in Tashkent, which did not respond to emails requesting comment about the security lapse during December.

Representatives of the Uzbek government in Washington, D.C. and New York also did not respond to TechCrunch's emails about the exposure. Uzbekistan's computer emergency readiness team, UZCERT, did not respond to an alert about the system, except for an automated reply acknowledging receipt of our email.

The surveillance system remains exposed to the web at the time of writing. 

The system refers to itself as an “intelligence traffic management system” by Maxvision, a Shenzhen, China-based maker of internet-connected traffic technologies, border inspection systems, and surveillance products. In a video on LinkedIn, the company says its cameras can record the “entire illegal process,” and can “display illegal and passing information in real-time.”

According to its brochure, Maxvision exports its security and surveillance tech to countries across the globe, including Burkina Faso, Kuwait, Oman, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and Uzbekistan.

TechCrunch's analysis of the data inside the exposed system revealed at least a hundred cameras located across major Uzbek cities, as well as busy junctions and other important transit routes. 

We plotted the GPS coordinates of the cameras, and found banks of license plate readers in Tashkent, the cities of Jizzakh and Qarshi in the south, and Namangan in the east. Some of the cameras are located in rural areas, such as on routes near the once-disputed parts of the borders between Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.

In Tashkent, the country's largest city, the cameras can be found at more than a dozen locations. Some of these cameras are even visible on Google Street View.

The cameras, some which watermark their footage with the name of the Singapore camera maker Holowits, capture video footage and still images of vehicles violating rules in 4K resolution.

The exposed system allows access to its web-based interface, which contains a dashboard allowing operators to examine footage of traffic violations. The dashboard contains zoomed-in photos and the raw video footage of violations, as well as surrounding vehicles. (TechCrunch redacted the license plates and vehicle occupants prior to publication.)

The exposure of Uzbekistan's national license plate reading system is the latest example of a security lapse involving road surveillance cameras. 

Earlier this year, Wired reported that more than 150 license plate readers around the United States and the real-time vehicle data they collect were exposed to the internet without any security. 

Exposed license plate readers are not a new phenomena. In 2019, TechCrunch reported that over a hundred license plate readers were searchable and accessible from the internet, allowing anyone to access the data within. Some had been exposed for years, despite security researchers warning law enforcement agencies that these systems could be accessed from the web.

Developers and companies are increasingly deploying AI agents and chatbots within their apps, but so far they've mostly been restricted to text. Digital avatar generation company Lemon Slice is working to add a video layer to those chats with a new diffusion model that can create digital avatars from a single image.

Called Lemon Slice-2, the model can create a digital avatar that works on top of a knowledge base to play any role required of the AI agent, like addressing customer queries, helping with homework questions, or even working as a mental health support agent.

“In the early days of GenAI, my co-founders started to play around with different video models, and it became obvious to us that video was going to be interactive. The compelling part about tools like ChatGPT was that they were interactive, and we want video to have that layer,” co-founder Lina Colucci said.

Lemon Slice says this is a 20-billion-parameter model that can work on a single GPU to livestream videos at 20 frames per second. The company is making the model available through an API and an embeddable widget that companies can integrate into their sites with a single line of code. After an avatar is created, you can change the background, styling, and appearance of a character at any point.

Besides human-like avatars, the company is also focusing on being able to generate non-human characters to suit different needs. The startup is using ElevenLabs' tech to generate the voices of these avatars.

Founded by Lina Colucci, Sidney Primas, and Andrew Weitz in 2024, Lemon Slice is betting that using its own general-purpose diffusion model (a type of generative model that learns to work backwards from noisy training data to generate new data) for making avatars will set it apart from competitors. 

“The existing avatar solutions I've seen to date add negative value to the product,” Colucci said. “They are creepy, and they are stiff. They look good for a few seconds, and as soon as you start interacting with them, it feels very uncanny, and it doesn't put you at ease. The thing that has prevented avatars from really taking off is that they haven't been good enough.” 

To fund that effort, the company on Tuesday said it has raised $10.5 million in seed funding from Matrix Partners, Y Combinator, Dropbox CTO Arash Ferdowsi, Twitch CEO Emmett Shear, and The Chainsmokers.

The company says it has guardrails in place to prevent unauthorized face or voice cloning, and that it uses large language models for content moderation.

Lemon Slice would not name the organizations using its technology, but said the model is being put to work for use cases like education, language learning, e-commerce, and corporate training.

The startup faces stiff competition from video generation startups like D-ID, HeyGen, and Synthesia, as well as other digital avatar makers Genies, Soul Machine, Praktika, and AvatarOS.

Ilya Sukhar, a partner at Matrix, thinks that avatars will be useful in areas where videos are prominent. For instance, people like learning from YouTube rather than reading long blocks of text. He noted that Lemon Slice's technical prowess and its own will give it an edge over other startups.

“It's a deeply technical team with a track record of shipping ML products, not just demos and research. Many of the other players are bespoke to particular scenarios or verticals, and Lemon Slice is taking the generalized “bitter lesson” scaling approach (of data and compute) that has worked in other AI modalities,” he said.

Y Combinator's Jared Friedman believes that using a diffusion-style model allows Lemon Slice to generate any kind of avatars as compared to some other startups that are focused on either human-like or game character-like avatars.

“Lemon Slice is, I believe, the only company taking the fundamental ML approach that can eventually overcome the uncanny valley and break the avatar Turing test. They train the same type of model as Veo3 or Sora: a video diffusion transformer. Because it is a general-purpose model that does the whole thing end-to-end, it has no ceiling on how good it can get; the others top out below photorealistic. It also works for both human and non-human faces and requires only an image to add a new face,” he said.

The startup currently has eight employees, and plans to use the funds to hire engineering and go-to-market staff, along with paying the compute bills to train its models.

Move over, Santa. Now there's another magical character for kids to track: the tooth fairy.

After making a personalized tooth fairy video for his nephew, Oliver Finel noticed a gap. While there are plenty of Santa trackers, nothing similar existed for the tooth fairy. Recognizing that Generation Alpha is growing up with interactive online experiences at their fingertips, he set out to create a new kind of adventure that families everywhere could enjoy.

Tooth Fairy Tracker features Kiki the Tooth Fairy as its central character. When a child loses a tooth, parents can visit the website and enter their email to receive notifications as Kiki begins her mission. Throughout the evening, children receive a series of video updates showing Kiki preparing for her journey, departing from headquarters, and traveling to collect the tooth. These updates may include flight speed information, vlog-style check-ins, and cute selfies.

The experience is hosted entirely on the site, with countdowns to each new video, making it feel like an exciting daylong event that builds anticipation for bedtime. Plus, Finel believes the evening updates help motivate children to brush their teeth and prepare for sleep. Then the final update takes place in the morning, when the child is congratulated and can check their special gift under their pillow.

Launched in October, the website is gearing up to launch a redesign soon. Finel explains that while the core experience will remain unchanged, the site will feature “a more playful design and a few added details to make it more immersive for kids.”

Looking ahead to 2026, Finel is preparing to launch a revamped version of the tracker featuring even more personalization. Kiki will say each child's name, mention their hobbies, and include their photo in every video. Kids will also receive custom certificates for each lost tooth. Another upcoming feature entails oral-care videos where Kiki teaches children healthy brushing habits.

The enhanced experience will be available via a new subscription for $20, which includes six Kiki visits.

Additionally, Finel plans to adapt the product for families in Latin America and Western Europe, making it more culturally relevant. For example, while the tooth fairy is most popular in the U.S., the Tooth Mouse is popular in France, Spain, and Russia.

He also hopes to partner with pediatric dentists, so dental offices can offer the Kiki the Tooth Fairy experience to young patients. Pre-appointment videos can help ease anxiety, while post-visit rewards encourage kids to return to the dentist and make the experience more positive.

Other long-term roadmap plans include branded toothbrushes and toothpaste, each accompanied by a personalized video of Kiki choosing the bristles for the toothbrush, picking colors, and assembling it just for the child.

The tooth fairy tracker is free to use and requires no app or account.

In June, U.S. insurance giant Aflac disclosed a data breach where hackers stole customers' personal information, including Social Security numbers and health information, without saying how many victims were affected. 

On Tuesday, the company confirmed it has begun notifying around 22.65 million people whose data was stolen during the cyberattack.

In a filing with the Texas attorney general, Aflac said that the stolen data includes customer names, dates of birth, home addresses, government-issued ID numbers (such as passports and state ID cards) and driver's license numbers, and Social Security numbers, as well as medical and health insurance information.

And, in a filing with the Iowa attorney general, Aflac said that the cybercriminals responsible for the breach “may be affiliated with a known cyber-criminal organization; federal law enforcement and third-party cybersecurity experts have indicated that this group may have been targeting the insurance industry at large.”

Given that Scattered Spider, an amorphous collective of primarily young English-speaking hackers, was targeting the insurance industry at the time of the breach, it's likely that this is the group Aflac is referring to. 

A spokesperson for Aflac did not respond to TechCrunch's request for comment. 

The company says it has around 50 million customers according to its official website. 

Aflac was one of several insurance companies hacked at around the same time, including data breaches at Erie Insurance and Philadelphia Insurance Companies.

Nick Donahue's parents were in the business of building houses, which means he spent his childhood hearing about the U.S. construction industry. His dad built homes for major developers, and his mom sold to big-box builders across the East Coast. 

Donahue was particularly interested in why designing a custom home cost a fortune and took forever, and why most people had to settle for whatever the developers were offering that year. So when he dropped out of NC State and moved to the Bay Area, he eventually did what you might expect a college drop-out to do in San Francisco: he started a company to fix it.

That effort, Atmos, went through Y Combinator, raised $20 million from investors like Khosla Ventures and Sam Altman, and tried to use tech to streamline the custom home design process. It had designers on staff who worked with clients while software handled the back-end. It grew to 40 people and $7 million in revenue, and they designed $200 million worth of houses, and built 50.

All that sounds great until you hear Donahue describe it. “It became this extremely operational business,” he told me on a Zoom call last week. “Kind of like a glamorized architecture firm.”

It never quite replaced the humans, in other words. Then the Federal Reserve started jacking up interest rates, and suddenly clients who'd spent months designing their dream homes couldn't afford them anymore. Nine months ago, Donahue shut it down. 

Here's where most founders would take a break, maybe write a few LinkedIn posts about what they learned. Instead, Donahue regrouped and started another company.

Drafted is now nearly five months old, and it's everything Atmos wasn't. No designers on staff. No operational complexity. Just AI-driven software that generates residential floor plans and exterior designs in minutes. You tell it what you want – bedrooms, square footage, whatever – and it spits out five designs. Don't like them? You can generate five more and keep going until something clicks.

Right now, Drafted has six employees, four from Atmos, and it's raised $1.65 million at a $35 million post-money valuation from Bill Clerico, Stripe's Patrick Collison, Jack Altman, Josh Buckley, and Warriors player Moses Moody.

Clerico led the round because he'd also been an angel investor in Atmos, and had watched Donahue will houses into existence despite rising interest rates. When Donahue told him about the new company over coffee, Clerico didn't need convincing. “Nick, please take our money,” he apparently said repeatedly over a two week period until Donahue agreed.

The pitch is straightforward. Right now, if you want a custom home, you've got two options: hire an architect (expensive, slow), or buy a template plan online (cheap, inflexible). Drafted sits in the middle, offering customization at template prices. A complete plan costs between $1,000 and $2,000. 

The economics work because Drafted built its own AI model, trained on real house plans from homes that were built and passed permitting. Practical constraints are considered, and Donahue says the specialized model costs almost nothing to run: two-tenths of a penny per floor plan, compared to 13 cents for general-purpose AI.

Drafted only does single-story homes right now, but multi-story and lot-specific features are coming. The bigger question is whether there's actually a market for this.

The numbers aren't huge. Of the million new homes built in America each year, only 300,000 are custom designed. Most people buy existing homes or pick from whatever tract homes the big builders are offering. 

Clerico's argument is that this is a chicken-and-egg problem. Make custom design cheap and fast enough, and many more people will do it. Donahue compares it to Uber, which didn't just replace taxis but made on-demand car service something that nearly everyone uses. “There's really no reason in the future why everyone shouldn't have a totally custom designed home,” Clerico says.

Or maybe most Americans will keep being price-conscious buyers who take what's available. The housing market has a long track record of rebuffing disruption.

There's also the “moat” question. Asked what's to keep an LLM player or even another vertical player from buying similar data sets and creating the same product, Donahue talks about brand, pointing to his friend David Holz, who founded the video and image generating AI outfit, Midjourney. Despite the plethora of new image-generation models being launched, Midjourney's usage barely moves, Holz has told Donahue; its customers keep coming back to make AI images. 

Similarly, Donahue thinks if they move fast enough and please enough customers, Drafted can become the place for people to design houses.

Time will tell. Since opening to the public, the outfit has begun seeing about 1,000 daily users. Not huge numbers, but they show steady growth for such a young product.

In the meantime, Donahue has something pretty valuable that could give Drafted an edge: deep knowledge of a problem and the insights gleaned from taking a crack at it once already.

She went on to found a center right online publication. Then she was named the head of CBS News. She's arguably less qualified than most, but she's not as unqualified as others claim she is.All of this has gotten people really worked up about her.It's worth noting, I guess, that she's also a lesbian. I only say that because I've noticed that it's most often people who have the ""right"" social characteristics that get the most aggressive responses. The people criticizing her wouldn't expect a white male to do anything else, but those that step out like Weiss often get the most pushback.

Two of those reasons are a kind of self-censorship for political reasons tied to who is in power. Democracy needs journalism that's ready to stand up to the people in power or we become a state like North Korea where people can't speak the truth.

Speaking with popular AI content creators convinces me that “slop” isn't just the internet rotting in real time, but the early draft of a new kind of pop culture.

Lately, everywhere I scroll, I keep seeing the same fish-eyed CCTV view: a grainy wide shot from the corner of a living room, a driveway at night, an empty grocery store. Then something impossible happens. JD Vance shows up at the doorstep in a crazy outfit. A car folds into itself like paper and drives away. A cat comes in and starts hanging out with capybaras and bears, as if in some weird modern fairy tale.

This fake-surveillance look has become one of the signature flavors of what people now call AI slop. For those of us who spend time online watching short videos, slop feels inescapable: a flood of repetitive, often nonsensical AI-generated clips that washes across TikTok, Instagram, and beyond. For that, you can thank new tools like OpenAI's Sora (which exploded in popularity after launching in app form in September), Google's Veo series, and AI models built by Runway. Now anyone can make videos, with just a few taps on a screen. 

If I were to locate the moment slop broke through into popular consciousness, I'd pick the video of rabbits bouncing on a trampoline that went viral this summer. For many savvy internet users, myself included, it was the first time we were fooled by an AI video, and it ended up spawning a wave of almost identical riffs, with people making videos of all kinds of animals and objects bouncing on the same trampoline. 

My first reaction was that, broadly speaking, all of this sucked. That's become a familiar refrain, in think pieces and at dinner parties. Everything online is slop now—the internet “enshittified,” with AI taking much of the blame. Initially, I largely agreed, quickly scrolling past every AI video in a futile attempt to send a message to my algorithm. But then friends started sharing AI clips in group chats that were compellingly weird, or funny. Some even had a grain of brilliance buried in the nonsense. I had to admit I didn't fully understand what I was rejecting—what I found so objectionable. 

To try to get to the bottom of how I felt (and why), I recently spoke to the people making the videos, a company creating bespoke tools for creators, and experts who study how new media becomes culture. What I found convinced me that maybe generative AI will not end up ruining everything. Maybe we have been too quick to dismiss AI slop. Maybe there's a case for looking beyond the surface and seeing a new kind of creativity—one we're watching take shape in real time, with many of us actually playing a part. 

“AI slop” can and does refer to text, audio, or images. But what's really broken through this year is the flood of quick AI-generated video clips on social platforms, each produced by a short written prompt fed into an AI model. Under the hood, these models are trained on enormous data sets so they can predict what every subsequent frame should look or sound like. It's much like the process by which text models produce answers in a chat, but slower and far more power-hungry.

Early text-to-video systems, released around 2022 to 2023, could manage only a few seconds of blurry motion; objects warped in and out of existence, characters teleported around, and the giveaway that it was AI was usually a mangled hand or a melting face. In the past two years, newer models like Sora2, Veo 3.1, and Runway's latest Gen-4.5 have dramatically improved, creating realistic, seamless, and increasingly true-to-prompt videos that can last up to a minute. Some of these models even generate sound and video together, including ambient noise and rough dialogue.

These text-to-video models have often been pitched by AI companies as the future of cinema—tools for filmmakers, studios, and professional storytellers. The demos have leaned into widescreen shots and dramatic camera moves. OpenAI pitched Sora as a “world simulator” while courting Hollywood filmmakers with what it boasted were movie-quality shorts. Google introduced Veo 3 last year as a step toward storyboards and longer scenes, edging directly into film workflows. 

All this hinged on the idea that people wanted to make AI-generated videos that looked real. But the reality of how they're being used is more modest, weirder—and arguably much more interesting. What has turned out to be the home turf for AI video is the six-inch screen in our hands. 

Anyone can and does use these tools: a report by Adobe released in October shows that 86% of creators are using generative AI. But so are average social media users—people who aren't “creators” so much as just people with phones. 

That's how you end up with clips showing things like Indian prime minister Narendra Modi dancing with Gandhi, a crystal that melts into butter the moment a knife touches it, or Game of Thrones reimagined as Henan opera—videos that are hypnotic, occasionally funny, and often deeply stupid. And while micro-trends didn't start with AI—TikTok and Reels already ran on fast-moving formats—it feels as if AI poured fuel on that fire. Perhaps because the barrier to copying an idea becomes so low, a viral video like the bunnies on trampoline can easily and quickly spawn endless variations on the same concept. You don't need a costume or a filming location anymore; you just tweak the prompt, hit Generate, and share. 

Big tech companies have also jumped on the idea of AI videos as a new social medium. The Sora app allows users to insert AI versions of themselves and other users into scenes. Meta's Vibes app wants to turn your entire feed into nonstop AI clips.

Of course, the same frictionless setup that allows for harmless, delightful creations also makes it easy to generate much darker slop. Sora has already been used to create so many racist deepfakes of Martin Luther King Jr. that the King estate pushed the company to block new MLK videos entirely. TikTok and X are seeing Sora-watermarked clips of women and girls being strangled circulating in bulk, posted by accounts seemingly dedicated to this one theme. And then there's “nazislop,” the nickname for AI videos that repackage fascist aesthetics and memes into glossy, algorithm-ready content aimed at teens' For You pages.

But the prevalence of bad actors hasn't stopped short AI videos from flourishing as a form. New apps, Discord servers for AI creators, and tutorial channels keep multiplying. And increasingly, the energy in the community seems to be shifting away from trying to create stuff that “passes as real” toward embracing AI's inherent weirdness. Every day, I stumble across creators who are stretching what “AI slop” is supposed to look like. I decided to talk to some of them.

Like those fake surveillance videos, many popular viral AI videos rely on a surreal, otherworldly quality. As Wenhui Lim, an architecture designer turned full-time AI artist, tells me, “There is definitely a competition of ‘How weird we can push this?' among AI video creators.”  

It's the kind of thing AI video tools seem to handle with ease: pushing physics past what a normal body can do or a normal camera can capture. This makes AI a surprisingly natural fit for satire, comedy skits, parody, and experimental video art—especially examples involving absurdism or even horror. Several popular AI creators that I spoke with eagerly tap into this capability. 

Drake Garibay, a 39-year-old software developer from Redlands, California, was inspired by body-horror AI clips circulating on social media in early 2025. He started playing with ComfyUI, a generative media tool, and ended up spending hours each week making his own strange creations. His favorite subject is morbid human-animal hybrids. “I fell right into it,” he says. “I've always been pretty artistic, [but] when I saw what AI video tools can do, I was blown away.”

Since the start of this year, Garibay has been posting his experiments online. One that went viral on TikTok, captioned “Cooking up some fresh AI slop,” shows a group of people pouring gooey dough into a pot. The mixture suddenly sprouts a human face, which then emerges from the boiling pot with a head and body. It has racked up more than 8.3 million views.

AI video technology is evolving so quickly that even for creative professionals, there is a lot to experiment with. Daryl Anselmo, a creative director turned digital artist, has been experimenting with the technology since its early days, posting an AI-generated video every day since 2021. He tells me that uses a wide range of tools, including Kling, Luma, and Midjourney, and is constantly iterating. To him, testing the boundaries of these AI tools is sometimes itself the reward. “I would like to think there are impossible things that you could not do before that are still yet to be discovered. That is exciting to me,” he says.

Anselmo has collected his daily creations over the past four years into an art project, titled AI Slop, that has been exhibited in multiple galleries, including the Grand Palais Immersif in Paris. There's obvious attention to mood and composition. Some clips feel like something closer to an art-house vignette than a throwaway meme. Over time, Anselmo's project has taken a darker turn as his subjects shift from landscapes and interior design toward more of the body horror that drew Garibay in. 

His breakout piece, feel the agi, shows a hyperrealistic bot peeling open its own skull. Another video he shared recently features a midnight diner populated by anthropomorphized Tater Tots, titled Tot and Bothered; with its vintage palette and slow, mystical soundtrack, the piece feels like a late-night fever dream. 

A post shared by Daryl Anselmo (@darylanselmo)

One further benefit of these AI systems is that they make it easier for creators to build recurring spaces and casts of characters that function like informal franchises. Lim, for instance, is the creator of a popular AI video account called Niceaunties, inspired by the “auntie culture” in Singapore, where she's from.

“The word ‘aunties' often has a slightly negative connotation in Singaporean culture. They are portrayed as old-fashioned, naggy, and lacking boundaries. But they are also so resourceful, funny, and at ease with themselves,” she says. “I want to create a world where it's different for them.” 

Her cheeky, playful videos show elderly Asian women merging with fruits, other objects, and architecture, or just living their best lives in a fantasy world. A viral video called Auntlantis, which has racked up 13.5 million views on Instagram, imagines silver-haired aunties as industrial mermaids working in an underwater trash-processing plant.  

There's also Granny Spills, an AI video account that features a glamorous, sassy old lady spitting hot takes and life advice to a street interviewer. It gained 1.8 million Instagram followers within three months of launch, posting new videos almost every day. Although the granny's face looks slightly different in every video, the pink color scheme and her outfit stay mostly consistent. Creators Eric Suerez and Adam Vaserstein tell me that their entire workflow is powered by AI, from writing the script to constructing the scenes. Their role, as a result, becomes close to creative directing.

These projects often spin off merch, miniseries, and branded universes. The creators of Granny Spills, for example, have expanded their network, creating a Black granny as well as an Asian granny to cater to different audiences. The grannies now appear in crossover videos, as if they share the same fictional universe, pushing traffic between channels. 

In the same vein, it's now more possible than ever to participate in an online trend. Consider  “Italian brainrot,” which went viral earlier this year. Beloved by Gen Z and Gen Alpha, these videos feature human–animal–object hybrids with pseudo-Italian names like “Bombardiro Crocodilo” and “Tralalero Tralala.” According to Know Your Meme, the craze began with a few viral TikTok sounds in fake Italian. Soon, a lot of people were participating in what felt like a massive collaborative hallucination, inventing characters, backstories, and worldviews for an ever-expanding absurdist universe. 

“Italian brainrot was great when it first hit,” says Denim Mazuki, a software developer and content creator who has been following the trend. “It was the collective lore-building that made it wonderful. Everyone added a piece. The characters were not owned by a studio or a single creator—they were made by the chronically online users.” 

This trend and others are further enabled by specialized and sophisticated new tools—like OpenArt, a platform designed not just for video generation but for video storytelling, which gives users frame-to-frame control over a developing narrative.

Making a video on OpenArt is straightforward: Users start with a few AI-generated character images and a line of text as simple as “cat dancing in a park.” The platform then spins out a scene breakdown that users can tweak act by act, and they can run it through multiple mainstream models and compare the results to see which look best.

OpenArt cofounders Coco Mao and Chloe Fang tell me they sponsored tutorial videos and created quick-start templates to capitalize specifically on the trend of regular people wanting to get in on Italian brainrot. They say more than 80% of their users have no artistic background. 

The current use of the word “slop” online traces back to the early 2010s on 4chan, a forum known for its insular and often toxic in-jokes. As the term has spread, its meaning has evolved; it's now a kind of derogatory slur for anything that feels like low-quality mass production aimed at an unsuspecting public, says Adam Aleksic, an internet linguist. People now slap it onto everything from salad bowls to meaningless work reports.

But even with that broadened usage, AI remains the first association: “slop” has become a convenient shorthand for dismissing almost any AI-generated output, regardless of its actual quality. The Cambridge Dictionary's new sense of “slop” will almost certainly cement this perception, describing it as “content on the internet that is of very low quality, especially when it is created by AI.”   

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the word has become a charged label among AI creators. 

Anselmo embraces it semi-ironically, hence the title of his yearslong art project. “I see this series as an experimental sketchbook,” he says. “I am working with the slop, pushing the models, breaking them, and developing a new visual language. I have no shame that I am deep into AI.” Anselmo says that he does not concern himself with whether his work is “art.”

Garibay, the creator of the viral video where a human face emerged from a pot of physical slop, uses the label playfully. “The AI slop art is really just a lot of weird glitchy stuff that happens, and there's not really a lot of depth usually behind it, besides the shock value,” he says. “But you will find out really fast that there is a heck of a lot more involved, if you want a higher-end result.” 

That's largely in line with what Suerez and Vaserstein, the creators of Granny Spills, tell me. They actually hate it when their work is called slop, given the way the term is often used to dismiss AI-generated content out of hand. It feels disrespectful of their creative input, they say. Even though they do not write the scripts or paint the frames, they say they are making legitimate artistic choices. 

Indeed, for most of the creators I spoke to, making AI content is rarely a one-click process. They tell me that it takes skill, trial and error, and a strong sense of taste to consistently get the visuals they want. Lim says a single one-minute video can take hours, sometimes even days, to make. Anselmo, for his part, takes pride in actively pushing the model rather than passively accepting its output. “There's just so many things that you can do with it that go well beyond ‘Oh, way to go, you typed in a prompt,'” he says. Ultimately, slop evokes a lot of feelings. Aleksic puts it well: “There's a feeling of guilt on the user end for enjoying something that you know to be lowbrow. There's a feeling of anger toward the creator for making something that is not up to your content expectations, and all the meantime, there's a pervasive algorithmic anxiety hanging over us. We know that the algorithm and the platforms are to blame for the distribution of this slop.”

And that anxiety long predates generative AI. We've been living for years with the low-grade dread of being nudged, of having our taste engineered and our attention herded, so it's not surprising that the anger latches onto the newest, most visible culprit. Sometimes it is misplaced, sure, but I also get the urge to assert human agency against a new force that seems to push all of us away from what we know and toward something we didn't exactly choose.

But the negative association has real harm for the earlier adopters. Every AI video creator I spoke to described receiving hateful messages and comments simply for using these tools at all. These messages accuse AI creators of taking opportunities away from artists already struggling to make a living, and some dismiss their work as “grifting” and “garbage.” The backlash, of course, did not come out of nowhere. A Brookings study of one major freelance marketplace found that after new generative-AI tools launched in 2022, freelancers in AI-exposed occupations saw about 2% decline in contracts and a 5% drop in earnings. 

“The phrase ‘AI slop' implies, like, a certain ease of creation that really bothers a lot of people—understandably, because [making AI-generated videos] doesn't incorporate the artistic labor that we typically associate with contemporary art,” says Mindy Seu, a researcher, artist, and associate professor in digital arts at UCLA. 

At the root of the conflict here is that the use of AI in art is still nascent; there are few best practices and almost no guardrails. And there's a kind of shame involved—one I recognize when I find myself lingering on bad AI content. 

Historically, new technology has always carried a whiff of stigma when it first appears, especially in creative fields where it seems to encroach on a previously manual craft. Seu says that digital art, internet art, and new media have been slow to gain recognition from cultural institutions, which remain key arbiters of what counts as “serious” or “relevant” art. 

For many artists, AI now sits in that same lineage: “Every big advance in technology yields the question ‘What is the role of the artist?'” she says. This is true even if creators are not seeing it as a replacement for authorship but simply as another way to create. 

Mao, the OpenArt founder, believes that learning how to use generative video tools will be crucial for future content creators, much as learning Photoshop was almost synonymous with graphic design for a generation. “It is a skill to be learned and mastered,” she says.

There is a generous reading of the phenomenon so many people call AI slop, which is that it is a kind of democratization. A rare skill shifts away from craftsmanship to something closer to creative direction: being able to describe what you want with enough linguistic precision, and to anchor it in references the model is likely to understand. You have to know how to ask, and what to point to. In that sense, discernment and critique sit closer to the center of the process than ever before.

It's not just about creative direction, though, but about the human intention behind the creation. “It's very easy to copy the style,” Lim says. “It's very easy to make, like, old Asian women doing different things, but they [imitators] don't understand why I'm doing it … Even when people try to imitate that, they don't have that consistency.”

“It's the idea behind AI creation that makes it interesting to look at,” says Zach Lieberman, a professor at the MIT Media Lab who leads a research group called Future Sketches, where members explore code-enabled images. Lieberman, who has been posting daily sketches generated by code for years, tells me that mathematical logic is not the enemy of beauty. He echoes Mao in saying that a younger generation will inevitably see AI as just another tool in the toolbox. Still, he feels uneasy: By relying so heavily on black-box AI models, artists lose some of the direct control over output that they've traditionally enjoyed.

For many people, AI slop is simply everything they already resent about the internet, turned up: ugly, noisy, and crowding out human work. It's only possible because it's been trained to take all creative work and make it fodder, stripped of origin, aura, or credit, and blended into something engineered to be mathematically average—arguably perfectly mediocre, by design. Charles Pulliam-Moore, a writer for The Verge, calls this the “formulaic derivativeness” that already defines so much internet culture: unimaginative, unoriginal, and uninteresting. 

But I love internet culture, and I have for a long time. Even at its worst, it's bad in an interesting way: It offers a corner for every kind of obsession and invites you to add your own. Years of being chronically online have taught me that the real logic of slop consumption isn't mastery but a kind of submission. As a user, I have almost no leverage over platforms or algorithms; I can't really change how they work. Submission, though, doesn't mean giving up. It's more like recognizing that the tide is stronger than you and choosing to let it carry you. Good scrolling isn't about control anyway. It's closer to surfing, and sometimes you wash up somewhere ridiculous, but not entirely alone.

Mass-produced click-bait content has always been around. What's new is that we can now watch it being generated in real time, on a scale that would have been unimaginable before. And the way we respond to it in turn shapes new content (see the trampoline-bouncing bunnies) and more culture and so on. Perhaps AI slop is born of submission to algorithmic logic. It's unserious, surreal, and spectacular in ways that mirror our relationship to the internet itself. It is so banal—so aggressively, inhumanly mediocre—that it loops back around and becomes compelling. 

To “love AI slop” is to admit the internet is broken, that the infrastructure of culture is opportunistic and extractive. But even in that wreckage, people still find ways to play, laugh, and make meaning. 

Earlier this fall, months after I was briefly fooled by the bunny video, I was scrolling on Rednote and landed on videos by Mu Tianran, a Chinese creator who acts out weird skits that mimic AI slop. In one widely circulated clip, he plays a street interviewer asking other actors, “Do you know you are AI generated?”—parodying an earlier wave of AI-generated street interviews. The actors' responses seem so AI, but of course they're not: Eyes are fixed just off-camera, their laughter a beat too slow, their movements slightly wrong. 

Watching this, it was hard to believe that AI was about to snuff out human creativity. If anything, it has handed people a new style to inhabit and mock, another texture to play with. Maybe it's all fine. Maybe the urge to imitate, remix, and joke is still stubbornly human, and AI cannot possibly take it away.  

We asked Al Jean, the longest-serving showrunner, about all the conspiracy theories.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year's list of the biggest technology failures.

It's a popular example of the “Mandela effect,” or a collective false memory. And while some people may laugh and move on, others spend years searching for an explanation.

A mix of technology and politics has given an unprecedented boost to once-fringe ideas—but they are pretty much the same fantasies that have been spreading for hundreds of years.

It's been nearly a decade since the last MCU movie to wear the “Avengers” banner (and not hide it), and now the Earth's Mightiest Heroes are returning for Avengers: Doomsday.

Helmed by returning directors Joe and Anthony Russo, the fourth Avengers film sees two different Avengers teams—one with the recently christened New Avengers, the other brought together by Anthony Mackie's Captain America—caught up in a war for the multiverse that also loops in older versions of the Fox X-Men, our latest iteration of the Fantastic Four, and even the Wakandans and Namor. Oh, and Doctor Doom, played by former Iron Man Robert Downey, Jr.

But instead of all that, this tease centers on Chris Evans' Steve Rogers. The worst-kept secret of the film is the return of the original Captain America, who has a child with presumably Peggy Carter (Haley Atwell, who we can now also assume will make some appearances here), since they sealed their time-displaced romance with a kiss at the very end of Endgame. What that means for the film's plot is a big mystery, but with the subtitle, things likely won't stay rosy for the Rogers family.

The official release of the teaser online comes after a week of rampant leaks around Avengers: Doomsday footage, spurred by the trailer's briefly exclusive attachment to screenings of Avatar: Fire & Ash. After a fevered weekend of speculation that teased multiple trailers for the film would be coming, the above trailer leaked online in varying degrees of quality ahead of Fire & Ash‘s opening, leading to the scattered rollout of Evan's return hitting the internet. At least now you can see it in HD?

“Steve Rogers will return” when Avengers: Doomsday hits theaters on December 18, 2026, followed by Avengers: Secret Wars on December 17, 2027. And before Doomsday comes out, Marvel sure hopes you liked Endgame enough to see it on the big screen again in September 2026.

The Pentagon is now armed to the teeth with “frontier AI systems, based on the Grok family of models,” according to a press release issued Monday. Are you trembling now, ISIS? Does the word “Grok” send a chill down your spines, Tren De Aragua? This expansion of what the release calls the U.S. “AI Arsenal” is apparently being slotted into the Pentagon's more expansive AI platform called “GenAI.mil,” launched earlier this month with Google's Gemini for Government built into it, according to an earlier press release. U.S. “Secretary of War” Pete Hegseth apparently provided the following quote for that release, “AI tools present boundless opportunities to increase efficiency, and we are thrilled to witness AI's future positive impact across the War Department.” Hegseth's quote sounds uncannily like it was written by a 22-year-old graduate from the public relations program at Stanford. While the Israeli armed forces appear to have used AI against Gaza in chillingly lethal ways, GenAI.mil sounds much more Dilbert-ish. If you were worried the Pentagon's Aeron chair jockeys were going to be stuck using Gemini for Government, I have great news: they'll also have—when the software is implemented in “early 2026″—exciting new AI products from an Elon Musk-owned company, which will enable “the secure handling of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in daily workflows,” along with “access to real‑time global insights from the X platform, providing War Department personnel with a decisive information advantage.” An April executive order from Trump sought to revolutionize efficiency in the Pentagon by ordering reviews with goals like, “Eliminate or revise any unnecessary supplemental regulations or any other internal guidance”—the usual Republican idea that you can improve everything by cutting red tape. Anyway, now the military's “bespoke AI platform” will include a second set of models to apply to everyone's AI-intensive tasks, so things are getting very efficient over there. But while the Trump Administration has been unusually friendly to the whims of AI's cheerleaders, there's bipartisan precedent for this kind of thing. For instance, Google's former CEO Eric Schmidt's involvement in a Biden era effort to “significantly increase” AI-related spending on defense and security programs in the federal government was called out by Senator Elizabeth Warren as a potential conflict of interest. And xAI and Google are far from the only tech companies seeking to intertwine their interests with those of the defense industry.But it's currently hard to picture Grok being a crucial link in the “kill chain” or something. This feels more like the Defense Department issuing a press release about a new supplier of toner, with a bit of Dot-Com Bubble flavor thrown in. It's like the Pentagon is announcing that every desk at the Pentagon, currently equipped only with CompuServe, will now get its very own AOL CD-ROM too. Very cool. Thanks for telling us, Secretary Hegseth.

I know you. Yes, you. You were looking at the $630 Kindle Scribe Colorsoft or reMarkable Paper Pro with hungry eyes, but the price of both tablets was upsetting your stomach. So you've started looking elsewhere for a color e-reader/e-notetaker. In your blind search, you've come upon the Boox Note Air 5C, and you're still left grimacing at the $530 asking price. What I can tell you is there's a good reason you want a device like this. It just won't be the everything tablet you were hoping it would be.

I came to the Boox Note Air 5C after finding myself entranced with the $400 Boox Palma 2 Pro. That e-reader is a smaller, phone-sized device compared to the standard 10.3-inch tablet dimensions of the Note Air 5C. Both devices are using the same screen technology, the same octa-core CPU, Android 15 as their operating system, and both use a stylus. And somehow, despite the fact that the Note 5C has a larger screen and similar limitations, I would far prefer to use the smaller device over the larger one, and not just because it's more portable.

Boox Note Air 5C

While it's a versatile e-notetaker, it can't be your color e-reader of choice. 

Pros

Cons

The Note Air 5C doesn't sport as strong a battery life as other similar devices. That's a big flaw considering the longevity we expect from other e-notetakers. The 6.13-inch Boox Palma 2 Pro also comes with a special programmable button that should be standard on all e-readers in general. Having to use a touchscreen with a slower refresh speed to change E Ink settings or refresh the page is far more annoying than bringing it up with a single button press.

If all I needed was an electronic note-taking device that wouldn't hurt my eyes long term, then the Note Air 5C would be sublime. The pen feels great, and the default notes app feels responsive. The added color makes highlighting PDFs, ebooks, or your own notes more expressive. I used it to record my notes before an anticipated tabletop RGB campaign slated for next year. For actually reading my favorite RPG books from this year, it's a mixed bag. And that means the Note Air 5C may become a $530 one-trick pony for some users.

There's an indefinable beauty to E Ink screens. The screen technology isn't anything like your typical LCD touch panel. Instead, it uses an electrical field to move incredibly small microcapsules around to create an image. The Boox Note Air 5C uses Kaleido 3 E Ink, which overlays a color filter on top of the image to generate the look of colored paper. Devices like the reMarkable Paper Pro Move use the slower, more vibrant E Ink Gallery 3. Kaleido 3 can replicate 4,096 colors. Sure, that seems like a lot on paper. In reality, the image won't look anything like real colored paper. That's important to remember if you plan to use color e-paper as your replacement for your comic collection.

What's more, Kaleido 3 is notoriously dim. The only functional way to use the Note Air 5C is by boosting the brightness up to 100%. You also have the option to change the color warmth if you tend to read or jot down thoughts late at night. For many readers, sticking with a black and white e-reader, such as Boox's own Go 6, will offer a cheaper and cleaner experience. There, you can rely on a faster refresh speed to avoid any signs of ghosting, where the E Ink capsules don't quite move in time and create a subtle bleed into following pages.

The screen on the Note Air 5C has a subtle matte texture that offers gentle feedback when you swipe with a finger or drag the included Boox Pen 3 Stylus across it. That pen is one of the biggest highlights of the e-reader. It includes tilt sensitivity and pressure detection. Using it on the default notes app is smooth and comfortable. The back of the pen comes off to reveal two extra replacement nubs as well. It easily beats the stylus included with the Boox Palma 2 Pro, and you don't need to spend anything extra to get it.

As for other amenities, there's not much else. There's a single USB-C slot for power and a microSD card slot to augment the Note Air 5C's 64GB of storage. I already mentioned how much I would appreciate some additional physical controls. What I would also want is a better pen attachment point. The device simply doesn't want to hold onto the stylus—aka the entire reason you buy this device over any regular e-reader or an 11-inch iPad Air with the Apple Pencil Pro.

Everything you lose in convenience is for the sake of the screen. I am much more enthused by color E Ink than the black and white variety. Even a small spot of color makes a huge difference in getting me to sit down and read. Colors make it far easier to highlight PDFs or take notes. It's a shame such technology demands such high premiums, especially when you're limited to such a select few tones.

There are two versions of the Boox Note Air 5C. One, the $530 standard bundle, comes with the tablet, extra stylus tips, and a magnetic case. The keyboard cover bundle costs $640 (it's currently going for less on Boox's own site) and includes a similarly textured case with a keyboard stuffed inside. So, had I discovered my next distraction-free device for typing the next great American novel? Sure, if you have such small hands that typing on a constrained keyboard is preferable to wider devices like a Freewrite keyboard.

Both the folio and keyboard cover bear a pleasant burnt umber color and a soft book cover-like texture. However, I didn't see much of the appeal of the keyboard cover. It folds up so you can only use the Note Air 5C in landscape mode. The keys are constrained by the 10.3-inch size of the tablet, which makes for a cramped typing experience. There's no trackpad either, so even if the device supports Android 15, it won't support any of the recently added touchpad features. The lack of a function row means you still need to touch the Note Air 5C's screen to change brightness or volume settings.

Actually putting text onto the screen will not be as instantaneous as you're used to with any other laptop or tablet with a keyboard. The Note Air 5C supports three refresh modes: Regal, Speed, and “Smooth.” The latter is the most recent mode and is supposed to make the browsing and typing experience near instantaneous. It's slightly faster than the Speed refresh mode, but also results in much more ghosting, which will then require you to refresh your page.

The magnetic case is an odd duckling. It adheres to the Note Air 5C with a simple magnetic attachment point and includes foldable wings that will let you stand it up vertically or horizontally. It also includes a soft, magnetic clamp that folds around the book to keep everything in place. At first, I thought this was exactly the kind of thing I would immediately lose (in the process of writing that sentence, I looked around and realized I left it in the other room). Then I realized what I could actually use it for: making sure I don't lose the pen as well.

The stylus does a very poor job adhering to the e-reader, whether due to the added pocket clip or poor magnets. Wrapping the fold around both the pen and cover did the trick, and it didn't even fall off when I shoved the whole apparatus into my backpack. I still fear that, one day, the pen will come loose.

Over the past few months (mostly thanks to the Boox Palma 2 Pro), I've become addicted to the volleyball manga Haikyu!!. The comic pages that roll through on the Note Air 5C include small shades of color that likely are due to the scanning technology on apps like Crunchyroll Manga. These small imperfections surprisingly add to the faux-paper effect you get on E Ink.

Seeing the splash of color when you open up the book cover can be a calming experience—far less old-timey than on a black and white e-reader. How accurate those colors are will depend on each work's palette. For instance, the cover art to a title like Paru Itagaki's Beastars on the Kindle app bears a close semblance to the real-life manga. The watercolor-like inks are already in line with Kaleido 3's washed-out colors, so that makes sense. When I load my PDF of the indie TTRPG Mythic Bastionlands, those dark tones also look very close to what you get in the physical book.

Strangely, in some titles, I found that the “Vivid” refresh settings made ebooks lose much more of the darker contrast than on the “Fast” setting. However, there was no hope for representing every work that tickles my fancy. The comic series The Power Fantasy by Kieron Gillen and Caspar Wijngaard was a sad facsimile of what it should look like. It lacked the caustic tones of the artwork hanging up in my apartment. The TTRPG Slugblaster by Mikey Hamm, a work so full of deep cosmic purples, appeared far too pale, like a shade of mauve. This made white text too difficult to distinguish compared to how it is on the real-life page.

You'll need to switch to Regal refresh mode to get the most definition of white text on a black background. Because of the color options, highlighting text is considerably better than anything you could use on an e-reader with a black and white screen. Boox's software includes a FreeMark tool that will let you mark up the pages in some apps. It works on Kindle, but it won't in other apps, including, strangely, Boox's own NeoReader PDF viewer. You can mark up text, but it lacks tools to change pen or marker type.

This e-notetaker weighs in at only 440g, or less than a pound. It's thin at 5.8mm thick. Yup, that's what we expect from today's Kindle-likes. And with this form factor, I'm not forced to consider battery life too much. But with the Note Air 5C, I have to keep a close eye on my battery gauge. Even when jotting ideas down or flipping pages in a book, the device's battery depletes precipitously. I can use the Note Air 5C intermittently for an entire day and still have enough left over to get it to a charger. However, I'm used to devices like Boox's own Palma 2 Pro that will last for multiple days with regular use.

If you planned on using this e-notetaker as an artist, I suggest you stick with a clearer OLED tablet. The stylus is accurate enough for penmanship, but E Ink is too unreliable. Colors aren't what you think they are. Trying to fill in spaces is too inconsistent. I tried the popular Android drawing app Krita on the Note Air 5C, and it was too laggy to even consider.

So you're left with a few choices. The Android-based Boox devices have all the benefits of being on such an open platform compared to devices like the Kindle Colorsoft Scribe and the similarly expensive reMarkable Paper Pro. For that, you'll need to deal with occasional jank. The Note Air 5C never failed to boot, but navigating menus can be slow and occasionally laggy. I desperately want just one more physical control on this device to make refreshing the screen and accessing settings seamless.

Boox still promotes the $500 Note Air 4C on its website. They're the same tablet, though the older version is using Android 13 and includes a less-capable folio and pen (plus no keyboard). So if you were looking for the cheapest color e-notetaker, this device is in the running, though there are other options. There's another iteration of the Note Air 5C that's much, much better. Perhaps that will come soon, or else we may finally get a version of color E Ink that truly ticks all the boxes.

Losing weight has officially become more convenient. The popular GLP-1 obesity treatment Wegovy is now available as a once-daily pill.

On Monday evening, the Food and Drug Administration approved Novo Nordisk's high-dose oral formulation of semaglutide for obesity. In clinical trials, people taking the pill lost substantially more weight than those taking a placebo. The drug is expected to be available to the public early next year.

Semaglutide and similar drugs mimic the GLP-1 hormone, which helps regulate our appetite and metabolism, among other things. It's the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk's obesity medication Wegovy as well as its diabetes drug Ozempic.

Both Wegovy and Ozempic are taken weekly via a subcutaneous injection, though the former can be prescribed at a higher maximum dose. In 2019, the FDA approved Rybelsus, a semaglutide-based pill, but only for treating diabetes. This newest approval is the first given to a GLP-1 oral drug explicitly for treating obesity. The newly approved pill—which will maintain the Wegovy branding—is also approved for a higher maximum dosage of semaglutide (25 milligrams) than Rybelsus (14 milligrams).

The Science That Will Shape 2026

In the pivotal OASIS-4 trial, people taking the Wegovy pill lost an average of 13.6% of their baseline weight over 64 weeks, compared to an average of 2.2% weight loss seen in the placebo group. These numbers are in line with the clinical trial results seen with injectable Wegovy. About a third of participants in the treatment group lost 20% or more of their weight. The adverse effects linked to the pill also appear to be comparable to the original Wegovy. Most were gastrointestinal, such as nausea, and were generally mild to moderate in severity.

“With today's approval of the Wegovy pill, patients will have a convenient, once-daily pill that can help them lose as much weight as the original Wegovy injection,” said Mike Doustdar, president and CEO of Novo Nordisk, in a statement from the company.

The Wegovy pill's approval should start an intriguing arms race over the next generation of obesity treatments.

Early next year, for instance, the FDA will decide whether to approve Eli Lilly's experimental GLP-1 pill, orforglipron. Though the weight loss results seen with orforglipron are below that of the Wegovy pill, some research has suggested the latter could become a reliable maintenance treatment for people who have already lost weight with a more effective GLP-1 drug.

Eli Lilly's Weight Loss Superdrug Worked So Well During Trials, Some Quit Over Losing Too Much

In 2026, the FDA will also decide on approval for Novo Nordisk's combination treatment CagriSema, which mixes semaglutide with cagrilintide, a mimic of the hunger-related hormone amylin, for a more potent weight loss effect. And by late 2026 or 2027, the FDA will evaluate Eli Lilly's triple-agonist retatrutide, a drug that has provided the largest weight loss results in trials seen with any medication to date. There are still many other candidates in the pipeline, some of which might offer their own advantages, such as fewer side effects.

As interesting as all this innovation is, it won't necessarily come cheap. These GLP-1 drugs have historically cost a pretty penny (Wegovy was originally priced at over $1,000 a month without insurance). The drug makers have begun to lower prices, and in Canada, a generic version of semaglutide will be available early next year. But whether costs will shrink enough to make these drugs readily affordable to anyone who benefits from them remains to be seen.

We now have the first look at the Ayaneo Pocket Vert, a vertical “Game Boy-style” handheld capable of emulating retro consoles from the Dreamcast, GameCube, and PS2 era. What a time to be alive.

But first, the hardware—it looks pretty solid. Eagle-eyed gadget nerds will already know that the Pocket Vert is not Ayaneo's first handheld shaped like a Game Boy. The handheld maker released the Pocket DMG last year. While capable, the Pocket DMG was quite pricey, starting at $450. Ayaneo hasn't announced official global pricing for the Pocket Vert yet, but based on its 1,699 Chinese yuan starting price (about $241), it's speculated that the handheld could cost around $250. This would make the Pocket Vert just slightly more expensive than the $220 Analogue Pocket.

Speaking of the Analogue Pocket, the Pocket Vert shares many similarities. It's got what appears to be the same 3.5-inch LTPS LCD touchscreen with an identical 1,600 x 1,400 resolution at 615 pixels per inch (ppi). The Pocket Vert even has the same 60Hz refresh rate and 450 nits of brightness.

Compared to the Pocket DMG and the Analogue Pocket, the Pocket Vert has some major differences. It's still an Android 14-based handheld, so you're gonna be running software emulators to play retro games. Unlike the Analogue Pocket, the Pocket Vert doesn't have a cartridge slot for Game Boy games. The Pocket Vert is also made of more premium materials—metal instead of the plastic on the Pocket DMG and Analogue Pocket.

From YouTuber ETA Prime's thorough first impressions video above, you can see that the Pocket Vert is basically a hybrid between the Pocket DMG and Analogue Pocket. All of the buttons seem to be tactile and satisfying. The specs—Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chip with 8GB or 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage, a microSD card slot, and a 6,000mAh battery—seem more than capable enough for emulation. And even the “Magic Touch” touchpad below the D-pad and face buttons, which lets you control games that require a joystick or dual joysticks, seems functional enough for 3D games. As a cherry on top, the Pocket Vert has a fingerprint sensor embedded in its power button.

On the front of games emulation, the Pocket Vert appears to be able to handle beefy retro consoles like the Sega Dreamcast, Nintendo GameCube, and Sony PlayStation 2 pretty well. Using the default AYASpace launcher, ETA Prime says they were able to get a consistent 60 fps in GameCube games such as The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Metroid Prime, and Resident Evil 4 at 3x the original resolution. Same thing for PS2 games such as Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Okami, and Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando. Dreamcast games are less demanding, but they also run with very playable frame rates.

As a Game Boy guy, the Pocket Vert appeals to me in a way that horizontal-shaped retro handhelds do not. No word on when exactly Ayaneo will release the Pocket Vert—sometime in early 2026—but it's one device I'm very much looking forward to. That is assuming the current RAM and flash storage shortage doesn't completely wreck launch plans.

ASRock's X870 Taichi Creator is a good, sub-$320 AM5 motherboard. Its strong all-around performance and creator-focused features - like 10 GbE, ample slot spacing/dual PCIe 5.0 slots, and numerous USB ports - make it a top mid-range option, but it is pricey for X870.

10GbE and 5GbE ports

12 USB ports (two 40 Gbps) on rear IO

Dual PCIe 5.0 slots and M.2 sockets

High price for ATX X870 board

Why you can trust Tom's Hardware




Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.


Since the X870 chipset release in mid-2024, we've covered several ASRock boards for Intel and AMD, including the Taichi. That name was used solely for the company's flagship model until recently, when it released the AM5-based Taichi OCF (designed for overclocking), and now the X870 Taichi Creator. The latest iteration of the Taichi, as its name implies, is designed for creators (think visual media, broadcasters, audio creators, streamers) and, as ASRock says, the board delivers precise performance, stable power, and advanced connectivity to empower workflows with reliability and style.

At $319.99, it's decidedly a mid-range board and getting well into X870E territory. For the money, the Taichi Creator gives you dual LAN ports (10 and 5 GbE) and Wi-Fi 7, two full-length PCIe 5.0 slots (three total), 12 USB ports on the rear IO (two USB4/40 Gbps), capable power delivery, and a high-quality audio solution. On top of that, its all-black PCB and heatsinks feature a gold accent line, while clear plexi covers on the chipset and VRM heatsinks give it a unique color scheme and premium (though somewhat plain) appearance that's sure to look good in any black chassis.

The board's performance was good across most of our testing suite, even though we, yet again, were forced to use our alternate DDR5-6000 set as our primary kit, which isn't compatible with the latest batch of ASRock AM5 boards (and their new BIOSes) we've reviewed. This usually results in some memory-intensive tests running slightly slower than they would on the other kit with tighter tertiary timings (we set primary/secondary to match). Still, it did well in our benchmarks, including gaming. But oddly, this kit worked with all the company's boards at launch, then suddenly stopped being compatible.Below, we'll examine the details and determine whether it deserves a spot on our list of the Best Motherboards. But before we share test results and discuss details, here are the specifications from ASRock's website.

ASRock includes its typical mid-range accessories to help get you started. They include four SATA cables, an ARGB splitter cable, a thermistor cable (for additional temperature source/reading), and the Wi-Fi antenna. There's nothing special. It's not even worth a picture.

Design-wise, the all-black 8-layer PCB features black heatsinks around the board for a stealthy look. There's a gold accent strip running vertically on the left side, while the heatsinks use a ribbed pattern for additional surface area and, of course, looks. Plexi coverings with Creator branding sit atop the chipset and the left portion of the VRM heatsink, creating a unique look. If you're looking for RGB lighting, you'll have to attach to one of the board's multiple headers, as none are integrated.The Taichi Creator's appearance is appealing overall, though a bit understated. This aesthetic aligns well with its target audience, where functionality is generally prioritized over elaborate design or ""bling.""

 




Focusing on the top half of the board, we get a better look at the large VRM heatsinks (not connected) and the plexi design piece (don't worry, it didn't seem to affect cooling), along with the Creator's “precision by design” branding. Above that are the two 8-pin (4+4) EPS power connectors (one required) for the CPU.

Moving past the socket, we next run into the four DRAM slots, with a single locking mechanism located at the top. ASRock lists support up to DDR5-8000, which isn't high, but is well past AMD's sweetspot (around DDR5-6000-6400), so no worries there. We again had issues with our common Kingston kit, so we'd suggest sticking to the memory QVL list for assured compatibility.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Above the RAM slots are the first three (of seven) 4-pin fan headers. In this case, it's the CPU_FAN1/2 and AIO_PUMP headers. Each header supports PWM and DC-controlled devices. Power output varies among the headers, with the CPU_FAN1 capable of 1A/12W, while the rest are 3A/36W. There's plenty of power to go around. The BIOS or the FANTastic Tuning found in the A-Tune application controls any pumps or fans. On the right edge, working our way down, the first item is the 2-character Dr. Debug display, convenient power and reset buttons, two 3-pin ARGB headers (another and an RGB header are on the bottom edge), the 24-pin ATX power connector for the board, and finally, a front panel USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 (20 Gbps) Type-C header.

 




Power delivery on the Taichi Creator consists of 21 phases, 18 of which are dedicated to Vcore. Power is supplied via the 8-pin EPS connector(s) to a Monolithic Power Systems MPS2512 controller. From there, it moves to the 80A MPS2425 SPS MOSFETs. The 1,440A available is enough, even for the flagship Ryzen 9 7950X or 9950X.We've also included some pictures of the other controlling ICs on the board. This includes ASMedia ASM1074(x2 - USB 3.0), ASM1164 (PCIe to SATA controller), the Monolithic Power Systems VRMs, and the Realtek audio and power controller.

 




On the bottom half of the board, starting on the left, we see the audio solution, flagship Realtek ALC4082, a couple of dedicated audio caps, and the audio separation line. It doesn't come with additional amplifiers or DACs, but it is the best codec available.

In the middle of the board are three full-length PCIe slots for graphics and expansion. The top two slots connect to the CPU, with the top-most running at PCIe 5.0 x16 and the bottom slot at x8. With both slots populated, they'll run at x8/x8. The good news is, there's plenty of room between the slots for a thick graphics card and other high-bandwidth add-in cards. The bottom slot connects through the chipset and runs at PCIe 3.0 x4 speeds.

In between the slots and around the PCIe slots are four M.2 sockets. The top M.2 socket, under the larger easy-release heatsink, is one of two CPU-connected PCIe 5.0 x4 (128 Gbps) sockets; the other is hidden under the plate heatsink. Also under the plate heatsink are two more M.2 sockets, though these are PCIe 4.0 x4 (64 Gbps). All M.2 sockets support devices up to 80mm.

As is common with X870 and B850, there is some lane-sharing between the sockets and the USB4 ports. If M2_2 is occupied, both rear USB4 Type-C ports and M2_2 downgrade to x2 mode. You can use x4 via a BIOS setting, but that disables those USB4 ports altogether. If M2_4 is occupied, PCIE3 (bottom slot) and M2_4 downgrade to x2 mode. Last on the bottom half, along the right edge, there isn't much outside the four SATA ports and one 19-pin USB 3.2 Gen 1 connector.

Along the bottom edge are a slew of headers for additional connectivity. From left to right, you have the following:

Before getting to the rear IO, we snapped a few pictures of the onboard ICs that control some of the board's features including ASMedia 1074 (two, USB 3.0), ASM1164 (PCIe to SATA controller), the Monolithic Power Systems VRMs (MPS2425) and controller (MPS2512), and some Realtek ICs for USB-C power and audio.

The rear IO on the Creator is busy, offering tons of USB connectivity. Starting on the left are two buttons: one to clear the CMOS and the other to perform a BIOS flashback. Next are the Wi-Fi 7 connectors and an HDMI (v2.1) output for integrated video. Next are 12 USB ports. You get 10 total Type-A ports: two 10 Gbps, six 5 Gbps, and two USB 2.0 ports. The two Type-C ports are 40 Gbps USB4. Above that are the two fast LAN ports at 5 and 10 GbE, respectively. Last but not least is the simple audio stack consisting of two 3.5mm jacks (mic, line out) and the SPDIF.

The Lego Game Boy she told you not to worry about.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The Lego Game Boy launched earlier this year to rave reviews, but it's just a showpiece that doesn't actually play games. Someone eventually built a working modded version of it, but even then, the screen was too small for LCLDIY, a modder hailing from China. He decided to make a giant Lego Game Boy using an electroluminescent display instead, to avoid the ""annoying pixelation"" that would otherwise come with simply scaling up an older screen.

The electroluminescence offers, perhaps, tasteful pixelation; think of the tech like an exaggerated version of a CRT with much of the same characteristics, but without the main downside. The project is also entirely open-source, so you can follow along at home with the right parts.

The star of the show — the EL display — is not cheap, as outlined on the Hackaday.io page. Moreover, it's hard to make it work with modern systems because it was never designed to accept that kind of signal. It doesn't even support relatively recent outputs like VGA, so everything had to be tweaked from the ground up, starting with how the display communicates with a ""GPU.""

Before that, though, let's understand why the modder even chose an electroluminescent display. See, in many ways, it's the predecessor to OLED, which today is the closest thing we have to CRT. Both displays have pixels that emit their own light, feature near-instant response times, and an infinite contrast ratio due to the lack of a backlight.

OLED, however, scans progressively, whereas CRT was interlaced and had a soft glow due to phosphor persistence. OLED can simulate that look through shaders, and it's often necessary for older games to look era-accurate on an otherwise unforgiving modern display tech. That beautiful glow effect, though, can be achieved with electroluminescent screens, too.

 




Like CRT, EL displays produce a soft, blended pixel look on even large panels, but they do so through phosphor persistence rather than true interlacing. Unlike CRTs, EL displays don't require bulky cathode ray tubes; they are essentially a matrix of phosphors. But those layers are instead controlled through selective voltage, lighting up pixels and naturally masking low-res pixelation.

This is where the OLED connection comes full circle — they're also controlled by electronic pulses; it's just that the pixels are organically self-lit rather than relying on phosphors. Display TED Talk aside, this is why an electroluminescent panel made sense, as it preserved that romanticized glowing look without requiring heavy cathode tubes or jumping straight to OLED and mimicking the entire aesthetic.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

To get the EL display working, LCLDIY had to write his own BIOS because the graphics adapter was custom-built as well. He used the old CHIPS 65548/5 IC as the core, which could send the necessary Horizontal Sync (HSync) and Vertical Sync (VSync) signals to the display, interpreted from a conventional framebuffer of a modern GPU.

This graphics adapter uses a PCI interface, but can work with PCIe cards as well through another converter. LCLDIY used an Intel 854 motherboard with its integrated graphics serving as that aforementioned ""modern"" GPU. This setup requires very basic power, and the translation magic comes from the custom graphics adapter anyways.

Following that, the project was pretty easygoing. All that was required was a bunch of 3D printing to create the parts of the large Lego Game Boy, which was then put together using what seemed like actual Lego bricks from the inside. The parts were self-designed by the modder and took about a week to fully print, after which they were painted, and all the little details, like transparent stickers, were added on top.

LCLDIY added custom buttons and even a wired NES controller tucked away on the side that would be handy for playing games from other platforms. He shows off a bunch of titles like Super Mario Bros., Contra, and Sonic, along with Comix, which looked the best in our opinion.

Every game exhibited that gorgeous glow effect, to the point it looked like a retro-futuristic display that you'd see in an anime from the 90s. The haloing is very prominent and, therefore, carries an unapologetic look that's sure to satisfy any nostalgia. It is just a monochrome screen after all, since true-color electroluminescent panels never became mainstream.

Also, don't let the rose-tinted glasses overlook the fact that image retention is an issue with this display for the same reason it has that glow effect (another way it's similar to OLED!). Still, this is one incredible modding job, and the fact that it was entirely open-sourced by the creator makes it all the more impressive.

""We have RAM at home""


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


With the memory crisis reaching its peak and expected to only worsen, even the slightest of mix-ups are exacerbated and feel almost absurd. That's what happened to an unlucky user on the r/pcmasterrace subreddit, who sent in their 96 GB kit of Corsair Vengeance DDR5 memory for an RMA, but received seemingly fake RAM in return that didn't work.

For some context, 96 GB of DDR5 desktop memory will run you at least $1,000 today — that's how much it is listed for on Corsair's website — so, obviously, you don't want it to get misplaced in some warranty claim. What happened in u/Loudenoughforme's case, though, was instead of receiving the proper replacement, Corsair sent them dummy sticks known as a ""Light Enhancement Kit.""

As the name suggests, these are empty DIMMs designed to look like real RAM, but they contain no memory inside, as they're only meant to enhance aesthetics. They have RGB strips on top that light up when slotted in, making their sole purpose to populate all the RAM slots on your motherboard for that complete look, without spending the extra money.

 




There's real logic behind doing this as running 4 (or more) sticks of RAM at the same time can reduce performance; in most cases, two sticks are ideal and preferred for high-speed DDR5, so decorative kits can really come in handy. Anyhow, Corsair's Light Enhancement Kit only costs $35 and is really easy to spot, thanks to the oddly-spaced pin layout that stands out against the dense contact points for actual memory.

Therefore, the commenters were quick to point this out and someone from the Corsair team even managed to directly get in touch with the user, asking for their ticket number. So, it seems like the case is closed and OP should receive their highly-coveted, working RAM soon. As for who this mix-up can be attributed to on the back end, well, that's anyone guess at this point.

This is an ingenious way of saving your eyesight and giving a second life to an older device.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Developer Alireza Alavi reported strained eyes after 14 hours of reviewing software licenses, so he addressed the issue by using an ePaper tablet as a secondary display. While you can purchase a purpose-built ePaper monitor, it will cost an additional $199. So, Alavi instead used an old Onyx Boox Note Air 2 tablet he had lying around at home. According to the dev, he used the tablet to mirror his laptop display, allowing him to glance at it if he needed to see a color version of the app he's working on. He primarily uses it for reading and some writing, especially since the latency on the old Onyx device isn't as good as on more modern devices.

Alavi actually made two attempts to make the solution work. For his first attempt, he used Deskreen—an in-browser screen-sharing app that lets you wirelessly stream your display over Wi-Fi. However, the streaming quality and input lag was unacceptable for reading, further compounding the slow speed of the tablet due to its age and specifications. Instead, he tried to work around the issue by using VNC.

VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is a remote desktop protocol that transmits pixel data to a remote display (unlike Windows Remote Desktop, which creates a new session on the remote machine). This is a bit more complicated than Deskreen, but Alavi said that it took him about 20 minutes to get it working on his Linux PC. From there, he just needed to download the AVNC client for the Android-powered ePaper tablet. With that done, he now has a working ePaper monitor for reading lengthy documents on.

Another advantage of VNC over Deskreen is that it lets him use the tablet as an input device. While he likely wouldn't be able to use it as a sort of drawing tablet, especially because of the latency that older ePaper screens have, it's still good enough for moving the cursor or even signing a document. While he could've purchased a standalone ePaper monitor for his needs, this small project is an ingenious way of giving a second life to older devices.

The World Institute of Kimchi reported on the results of a recent study published in npj Science of Food, which found that the fermented food may also help improve the immune system, in addition to its gut health benefits.

Kimchi is a traditional Korean fermented vegetable dish that has gained global interest due to its health-promoting properties. Research has shown that fermented vegetables, such as kimchi, can help improve gut microbiota composition, relieve symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and aid weight loss, among other benefits. 

The study in question was a 12-week clinical trial that examined 13 adults with overweight. The participants were divided into three groups. Each group consumed either:

Michelle Routhenstein, MS, RD, CDCES, CDN, and Preventive Cardiology Dietitian at Entirely Nourished, who was not involved in the study, told Medical News Today: 

“This study showed that after eating kimchi daily for 12 weeks, immune cells became better at spotting potential threats and alerting other immune cells to work more efficiently. [T]he study was small, so we can't say everyone would get the same benefit, but it is encouraging and supports including fermented foods like kimchi in your diet to keep your immune system healthy.”

The study found that kimchi helped strengthen the function of the antigen-presenting cells (APCs). APCs recognize external invaders, such as bacteria and viruses, and transmit signals. The researchers note that this shows that kimchi doesn't just stimulate the immune system, it also acts as a “precision regulator.” 

Kimchi can help enhance the immune system's defense capabilities when necessary and suppress unnecessary and excessive responses.

When referring to the study, Routhenstein noted that since most of the immune cells live in the gut, it makes sense that a fermented food like kimchi could help. 

A review in 2016 that examined kimchi and other fermented Korean foods notes that, according to research, the regular consumption of kimchi can help to increase the growth and development of immune cells. 

Other research from 2023 also notes that similar fermented foods, such as sauerkraut, may be beneficial to your health and immune system. 

“Kimchi and sauerkraut contain both probiotics, which are live beneficial bacteria, and prebiotics, which feed those bacteria. These types of fermented foods nourish the gut microbiome, which helps train and strengthen immune defenses,” added Routhenstein.

The immune system plays a vital role. It protects the body from harmful substances, cell changes, and germs that could make you ill. 

Without the immune system, you would have no way to fight off harmful things that enter your body from the outside or changes that occur from the inside. The main jobs of the immune system include: 

Routhenstein noted that there are various reasons why maintaining your immune system is important. Along with the reasons above, she added that a strong immune system can also help prevent chronic inflammation and autoimmune issues. 

This can help keep “your body healthy and resilient, which is key for overall health and disease prevention,” she stated. 

Kristin Kirkpatrick, MS, RDN, President of KAK, Consulting, LLC, a dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic Dept of Department of Wellness & Preventive Medicine, and a Senior Fellow at the Meadows Behavioral Healthcare agreed, “We need to look at the immune system as something that will impact every aspect of health, not just help us fight against cold and flu.”

According to the National Institute of Health (NIH), consuming adequate amounts of certain vitamins and minerals is important for proper immune function. These include: 

Kimchi can be a good source of vitamin C, vitamin K, and B vitamins.

“The overall diet matters because what we eat can increase or decrease inflammation, which also affects immune health. Feeding your gut bacteria the right foods is just as important as including probiotics,” noted Routhenstein. 

She also added that other ways you can help boost your immune system include: 

Kirkpatrick noted that she prefers not to use the word “boosted” for the immune system. 

“A boosted immune system is not always ideal, but I do use the word ‘support,' which implies that the immune system has what it needs to function properly, aid in defenses against the body, and work towards the prevention of chronic diseases,” she told MNT. 

Kirkpatrick stated that what not to have is as important as what to have. “Limiting ultra-processed foods and added sugar can also help with supporting the immune function of the body.” 

“To keep it simple, I tell my patients to aim for 12 colors a day which ensures that a variety of phytonutrients, antioxidants, [and] high nutrient density is adhered to,” she added.

The European Commission has released new guidelines to help EU countries strengthen prevention, screening, and treatment of cardiovascular disease. It includes a call for national heart-health plans by 2027.

The framework, known as the Safe Hearts Plan, sets out nonbinding recommendations organized around three areas: prevention, early detection, and treatment and care, including rehabilitation. The Commission says the guidance is intended to help member states develop or update national cardiovascular strategies.

Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of illness and death in the EU, accounting for 1 in 3 deaths, according to a 2025 report from the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development. The burden is expected to grow substantially, with prevalence projected to increase by 90% between 2025 and 2050 and deaths by 73% over the same period.

“The Safe Hearts Plan is a milestone that lends cardiovascular health visibility and indicates urgency,” Renate Schnabel, MD, MSc, professor of cardiology at the University Heart Center Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany, told Medscape News Europe. “General guidance by the EU could reduce uncertainties, encourage uptake, and provide structures for implementation,” she added.

Prevention is a central focus of the plan, which the Commission describes as the most cost-effective way to address cardiovascular disease and its risk factors.

“The Safe Hearts Plan focuses on prevention as the most cost-effective way of addressing cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors,” Eva Hrncirova, MA, a European Commission spokesperson, told Medscape News Europe.

Dietary policy features prominently. Among the plan's flagship initiatives is a proposed food-processing assessment system that would take portion size, frequency of intake, and a product's role in the overall diet into account, with the aim of encouraging shifts toward healthier eating patterns.

The guidelines also call for stronger tobacco control, promotion of regular physical activity, and expanded efforts to protect children from advertising for unhealthy foods and beverages.

“Structural prevention measures — such as taxation and regulation of tobacco, nicotine products, and unhealthy foods — are likely to have a larger and more equitable impact on cardiovascular health than individual-level targets alone,” Gunnar Gislason, MD, PhD, professor of cardiology at Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark, told Medscape News Europe.

The plan also highlights vaccination as part of cardiovascular prevention, encouraging countries to strengthen national immunization information systems and registries and to train healthcare professionals on links between certain vaccine-preventable diseases and cardiovascular conditions.

On early detection, the Commission says it will support member states in developing and implementing national health checks aimed at identifying cardiovascular risk factors sooner.

Schnabel said that while prevention measures can take years to translate into measurable population-level benefits, earlier detection can have a more immediate impact.

“For hypertension, lipids, and diabetes, a significant reduction in morbidity can be expected if these risk factors are identified and treated,” she said.

Others cautioned that screening programs must be carefully designed. Gislason said evidence supporting broad, population-wide cardiovascular screening remains limited.

“The evidence for broad, population-wide cardiovascular screening remains limited, particularly regarding hard outcomes, and such programs often fail to reach those at highest risk,” he said.

“If not carefully designed, large-scale health checks may divert scarce healthcare resources away from more effective care, including secondary prevention and management of high-risk patients, and could inadvertently widen socioeconomic inequalities. Targeting, follow-up capacity, and equity considerations will therefore be critical in implementation,” he added.

The guidelines also address treatment and long-term management, including proposals to improve coordination of care across the EU.

Among the measures outlined is the creation of an EU network of cardiovascular health centers intended to support diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, and long-term care.

In parallel, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control plans to revise EU legislation governing medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices, with the aim of accelerating regulatory pathways.

“Faster, less bureaucratic approval of novel methods and devices in a safe digital environment could significantly enhance detection and monitoring of risk factors and cardiovascular diseases,” Schnabel said.

The plan also references broader legislative initiatives, including the proposed Biotech Act, which aims to accelerate time to market for biotech products, and revisions to EU pharmaceutical legislation intended to modernize regulatory frameworks, incentivize research and innovation, and streamline authorization processes while supporting access to essential cardiovascular-related medicines.

“Many of the most impactful cardiovascular treatments are well established and cost-effective, yet access and adherence still vary considerably across countries and population groups. Here, the EU has a clear opportunity to add value through coordinated approaches to procurement, pricing, and market access, helping to reduce inequalities and improve outcomes across member states,” Gislason said.

The Commission has also committed €20 million to a flagship initiative aimed at accelerating artificial intelligence (AI)- and data-driven tools for early diagnosis, personalized prevention, and integrated care for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity.

“Whether or not AI will revolutionize cardiovascular healthcare in the near future remains to be seen,” Schnabel said, adding that digitalization could nevertheless support efforts ranging from mobile screening programs to rehabilitation and secondary prevention.

“Overall, careful implementation will be essential to ensure that resources are used where they generate the greatest benefit, and that the plan contributes to reducing, rather than widening, cardiovascular inequalities across Europe,” Gislason said.

Gislason reported no relevant financial relationships.

Schnabel reported receiving funding from the European Research Council, the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, the EU's Horizon Europe research and innovation program, MSCA Doctoral Networks, and German Center for Cardiovascular Research. She has also received lecture fees and advisory board fees from BMS/Pfizer and Bayer outside this work.

In twin pregnancies, cervical length (CL) assessment during the first trimester might be useful in predicting the risk for spontaneous preterm birth before 34 weeks of gestation; CL measurements below 35 and 30 mm warranted closer follow-up. However, a history of preterm birth remained the strongest independent predictor.

""The assessment of CL in the first trimester helps to distinguish the group of twins which need a close follow up,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Magdalena Litwińska, 1st Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland. It was published online on December 12, 2025, in BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth.

The study was retrospective and had incomplete data on maternal characteristics. Interobserver variability was not assessed despite measurements being performed by operators at five different centres. CL measurements were performed within a 2-week timeframe and not adjusted for gestational age.

This study did not receive any external funding. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

 December 23, 2025  

The FDA has approved once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg (Wegovy Pill, Novo Nordisk) as the first GLP-1 agonist pill for weight management. 

The new indication is “to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term and to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events,” Novo Nordisk announced in a December 22, 2025, statement.

The Wegovy pill is a higher dose of the oral semaglutide Rybelsus (7 mg and 14 mg), FDA-approved in 2019 for treating type 2 diabetes (T2D) and in October 2025 for cardiovascular risk reduction in those with T2D at high risk. 

The new approval was based on results from Novo Nordisk's OASIS trial program and the SELECT trial. 

OASIS 4 was a randomized phase 3b trial of 307 participants with overweight/obesity, first reported in November 2024 and published in The New England Journal of Medicine in September 2025. There was a 13.6% weight drop with oral semaglutide at 64 weeks vs just 2.2% with placebo regardless of adherence, and 16.6% vs 2.7% for those who adhered the entire time. Both differences were significant, at P < .0001.

“The well-known safety and tolerability profile of semaglutide was reaffirmed with the Wegovy pill in the OASIS-4 trial, which was comparable to previous trials with semaglutide for weight management,” Novo Nordisk said in the statement. 

The company expects to launch the Wegovy pill for obesity in the US in January 2026. 

Asked to comment, Simeon Taylor, MD, PhD, professor of medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, told Medscape Medical News, “The oral formulation of semaglutide provided impressive weight loss requiring a dose of 25 mg/d, or 175 mg/wk. This dose represents more than 70 times the dose on a weekly basis as compared to subcutaneously administered semaglutide. It is likely that some patients may prefer an oral formulation. However, the large dose may have implications for the challenges to manufacture the amount of drug required to treat all the patients who would benefit from a weight-loss drug.”

Still awaiting an FDA decision is a different type of oral GLP-1 drug: Eli Lilly's orforglipron, for both weight management and T2D. It is a once-daily small molecule (nonpeptide) that, unlike semaglutide, can be taken any time of day without restrictions on food and water intake or need for refrigeration. Full phase 3 data for orforglipron in people with both obesity and T2D were reported in November 2025 and for obesity without diabetes in September 2025. 

Lilly has submitted orforglipron for regulatory review for treating overweight/obesity in 2025 and plans to submit for T2D in 2026, the company said in a December 18, 2025, statement. 

The nonpeptide “nutrient-stimulated hormone” molecules in development for obesity such as orforglipron are thought to be easier to manufacture and ship, and to be potentially less costly than semaglutide and other peptide GLP-1s. However, they are also metabolized differently. “A head-to-head trial may be required to compare effectiveness,” Taylor said.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has approved a new long-lasting prophylactic treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) that is administered once every 6 months. 

Lenacapavir (Yeytuo, Gilead Sciences Ltd) offers an alternative to daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other shorter-acting options. 

The drug was named as the biggest scientific breakthrough of 2024 by Science. The World Health Organization has described it as “a transformative step forward” that could help reshape the global HIV response.

Lenacapavir is a selective HIV-1 capsid inhibitor. It binds with high affinity to specific sites on capsid proteins in the virus's outer layer.

The drug disrupts the virus at multiple stages. It prevents viral DNA from entering the cell nucleus, interferes with viral particle assembly and release, and leads to defective capsid formation.

Together, these effects reduce the risk of HIV-1 replication and spread following exposure.

Treatment is initiated with 2 days of oral tablets alongside an injection. Thereafter, lenacapavir is given as a subcutaneous injection once every 6 months.

Biannual dosing may improve adherence and privacy. The drug may be particularly beneficial for people who struggle with daily medication, find oral PrEP regimens stigmatising, or face barriers to accessing healthcare services.

MHRA approval was based on two phase 3 trials, PURPOSE 1 and PURPOSE 2.

Across both studies, at least 99.9% of participants who received lenacapavir injections every 26 weeks remained HIV negative. This outcome was significantly better than both the background incidence and rates observed in the oral PrEP active control group.

No new safety concerns were identified in the trials.

The MHRA approved lenacapavir for the prevention of sexually transmitted HIV-1 infection in adults and adolescents.

The regulator recommended that the drug be used alongside safer sex practices, including condom use.

Julian Beach, MHRA interim executive director of healthcare quality and access, said its approval “marks the introduction of a 6-monthly long-acting preventative option for sexually transmitted HIV-1 infection.

“By blocking the virus from multiplying if exposure occurs, lenacapavir offers an additional choice alongside existing safer sex practices.”

The most commonly reported side effects when lenacapavir is used for HIV PrEP are injection-site reactions, headache, and nausea. Injection-site reactions may persist longer than those seen with other injectable therapies.

The MHRA said lenacapavir was subject to additional monitoring to enable rapid identification of new safety information. Patients and healthcare professionals are encouraged to report suspected adverse reactions through the Yellow Card scheme.

Further details will be published in the summary of product characteristics and patient information leaflets on the MHRA products website within seven days of approval.

The FDA Biomarker Qualification Program approved changes in hip bone mineral density (BMD) after treatment to serve as a surrogate endpoint in place of bone fractures in anti-osteoporosis drug clinical trials involving postmenopausal women.

The qualification approval was based on the results of the Study to Advance BMD as a Regulatory Endpoint (SABRE). The SABRE research team set out to find measures that determine an anti-osteoporosis drug's power to lower the prevalence of fractures. SABRE included data from 52 trials with over 160,000 participants. The findings demonstrated a strong relationship between a treatment-related rise in hip BMD and a decline in fracture risk.

“Drugs for reducing fractures are available, but treatment rates have markedly declined due to concerns about very rare side effects, inconvenient dosing, and limited effectiveness against some types of fractures,” Dennis Black, PhD, of the University of California San Francisco, said in a press release. “This FDA decision will help address the treatment gap for osteoporosis by accelerating development of new therapies and providing more options to patients and clinicians,” Black concluded.

Previous studies have used fractures as a primary endpoint when evaluating anti- osteoporosis drugs. Prior trials often involved 7705 to 16,071 participants and took years to complete. Granting BMD surrogate endpoint status as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) could be a step toward more time- and cost-efficient trials.

There were several pieces of evidence that were used to back this qualification.

Notably, data from SABRE highlighted a statistically significant relationship between treatment-associated declines in five fracture types (vertebral, nonvertebral, hip, all clinical, and all fractures) and the average percentage change in total BMD over 2 years.

Higher BMD was linked with greater fracture declines for each type of fracture. The coefficient of determinations (R-square) along with the corresponding 95% CIs were 0.71 (95% CI, 0.32-0.83) for all clinical fractures, 0.41 (95% CI, 0.02-0.65) for hip fracture, 0.53 (95% CI, 0.11-0.72) for nonvertebral fractures, and 0.73 (95% CI, 0.33-0.84) for vertebral fractures.

There were 16 randomized controlled trials that all pointed to an association between fracture risk reductions and BMD changes. These trials evaluated anabolic drugs and antiresorptive agents with varying mechanisms of actions.

The qualification specifies that changes in hip BMD are to be evaluated using DEXA, which is a noninvasive and cost-effective imaging test. Changes in calcium and other mineral levels in the bones are monitored from baseline to 2 years. Decreased amounts of minerals often signify bones that are more likely to fracture.

“This milestone achievement will help reduce barriers to developing new treatments that ultimately will improve quality of life for many patients and their families. It represents a fundamental shift in the way clinical studies will be performed in the future,” said Tania Kamphaus, MSc, PhD, associate vice president, Science Partnerships, and director of Patient Engagement at the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, said in the press release. “It also highlights the critical importance of public-private partnerships to accelerate medical breakthroughs.”

 December 23, 2025  

A new study found that over a 4-year period, slightly more than a quarter of Americans experienced any financial strain related to health costs, a proportion far higher than previously reported.

The JAMA Internal Medicine study is the longest longitudinal investigation of how health spending affects Americans' financial security.

Led by researchers from Harvard Medical School, the study examined a 4-year tranche of data from the federal Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys (MEPS) that became available for the first time in the wake of the COVID pandemic, lead author Adam Gaffney, MD, MPH, told Medscape Medical News.

MEPS data were previously only available for 2-year periods. The shorter timeframe does not give an accurate picture, as people may be healthy one year and sick the next, said Gaffney, assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, Boston, and a pulmonary and critical care medicine physician at Cambridge Health Alliance, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Tracking people for a longer period allowed the researchers to portray spending more accurately, and it allowed them to document a cumulative effect — a mounting of costs over time, Gaffney said.

“In real life, people don't have steady, predictable health costs — they experience sharp spikes in costs after an illness, a hospitalization, or a new diagnosis,” said Rishi Wadhera, MD, MPP, MPhil, cardiologist and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the study. “This paper captures that reality in a way we don't usually see.”

The 4-year estimate is “very useful for policy makers,” said Jessica S. Banthin, PhD, senior fellow in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute, Washington, DC. 

The 25% figure reported by the authors “shows how widespread this experience is,” Banthin told Medscape Medical News.

Previous cross-sectional studies — indicating that 11% of Americans experienced financial strain due to health costs in a given year — “captured merely the tip of the iceberg,” wrote John W. Scott, MD, MPH, of the University of Washington, Seattle, in an editorial accompanying the Gaffney study.

The authors measured “financial strain” in three ways. Cost burden was defined as out-of-pocket expenditures for an individual greater than 10% of family income, or greater than 5% for people with low incomes. Catastrophic cost burden was defined as greater than 40% of family income. The authors also included “foregone care,” a subjective measure based on MEPS participants stating that they had not gotten care because of cost. 

About 12% of the 12,645 respondents had any financial strain in the first year; that number rose to 26.7% by the end of the fourth year.

Overall, 4% of respondents said they spent more than 40% of their income on health in the first year — a figure that rose to 11% at the end of the 4 years. About 6% of adults said they had foregone care because of affordability in the first year, a figure that had doubled by the fourth year.

The nonelderly uninsured and individuals older than 64 years had higher rates of cost burden, as did adults with lower education levels. Financial strain increased for those who had a chronic condition, rising substantially with each additional condition. Those with one disease had a 35% increased risk for a cost burden, while those with three or more conditions had a 163% increased risk.

Death also was associated with cost burden and catastrophic cost burden. Overall, 45% of those who died in the fourth year of the study had spent more than 10% of family income on healthcare, while a third had spent more than 40% of income on care.

This finding is “particularly concerning,” said Wadhera.

Scott, in the editorial, wrote that it “adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting that financial hardship is not merely an unfortunate byproduct of illness but also a clinical risk factor that directly threatens patients' health.”

Wadhera said the study “does not prove that high costs directly cause worse health, but we know from other research that financial stress leads people to delay care, skip medications, and experience real harm,” he said. “At a minimum, it shows that our system often adds financial suffering on top of medical suffering near the end of life.”

Gaffney agreed. “The system is failing to protect us at our most vulnerable times,” Gaffney told Medscape Medical News.

The researchers did not include insurance premium costs (because MEPS only assesses them for private plans) or costs for institutionalized Americans in their estimates. 

Both would increase burden estimates, said Gaffney. “We view our estimates as conservative,” he said.

The study is certainly an underestimate without the premium costs, said Banthin.

Most Americans “understand that healthcare costs in this country are very high and that our insurance usually leaves us with substantial copays, deductibles, or additional costs,” she said. It makes “our use of healthcare very costly and very financially burdensome,” she said.

Scott noted in his editorial that the federal safety net was becoming more frayed, with big cuts slated for Medicaid in the coming years and the expiration of enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act premiums that have been in effect since 2021.

“Gaffney and colleagues demonstrate that even brief coverage lapses substantially elevate cumulative financial hardship risk over time,” he wrote.

Members of Congress recessed in December for the year without agreeing on a solution to address what could be millions of people paying higher premiums or foregoing insurance coverage. Democrats were able to secure a vote in January in the House on a potential 3-year extension of the enhanced subsidies, but it is not likely that the Senate — with its Republican majority — will approve that bill, Politico reported.

In September, KFF Health News estimated that most of the 24 million Americans who receive insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace had been receiving enhanced subsidies. While some might find a way to continue to afford coverage, many are likely to drop out, the health policy research organization said.

Banthin and colleagues estimate that at least 4 million people would lose insurance if enhanced subsidies are not restored. Even if Congress votes to restore those subsidies, it's not clear that people would be allowed to sign up for coverage because it would be outside the open enrollment period, Banthin told Medscape Medical News.

Without the enhanced subsidies, “We're expecting to see a significant rise in the share of Americans without health coverage,” which will lead to more foregone care, said Gaffney.

Scott issued a call to action, writing that physicians “cannot remain passive observers to the financial adversity that increasingly accompanies illness and medical care in the US.”

Wadhera agreed. “Cost conversations need to be as routine as asking about side effects,” he said. Doctors should work with pharmacists, social workers, and financial navigators “to help patients act on those conversations.”

Gaffney reported having no relevant conflicts but disclosed that he was a former president of Physicians for a National Health Program, which supports a single-payer health system. Wadhera and Banthin reported having no conflicts.

Many Latine adults with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) reported unmet wound care and pain management needs, perceived discrimination, and difficulties with interpreter-mediated communication during dermatology care.

“In this qualitative study, many Latine participants with HS reported experiencing unaddressed wound care and pain management needs, perceived discrimination, and challenges with interpreter-mediated communication during care with a dermatologist,” the authors concluded. “Interventions to prioritize wound care and pain management in multidisciplinary care plans and optimize patient-centered HS care are needed,” they added.

This study was led by Yanel Hernandez, BS, University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, San Francisco, and was published online on December 23 in JAMA Dermatology.

Findings may not be generalizable beyond California or to individuals with HS who do not seek medical care. Researchers could not confirm whether dermatologists described by participants were board-certified.

This study received support from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases of the National Institutes of Health and the Dermatology Foundation. Two authors reported receiving personal fees and research funding from AbbVie, Medscape, Sonoma Biotherapeutics, Union Chimique Belge, Novartis, Pfizer, and several other companies. They also declared holding stock in Radera, serving as vice president/director of the HS Foundation, and acting as an associate editor for JAMA Dermatology.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has historically been regarded as a chronic, irreversible disease. This conventional view has been challenged by growing evidence that lifestyle changes and surgical or medical interventions can achieve normoglycemia and, in some cases, even remission.

In 2021, four major societies issued a joint consensus statement defining remission in T2D as an A1c < 6.5% for 3 months after the cessation of glucose-lowering pharmacotherapy.

“We chose 6.5% because that is the threshold by which we define diabetes,” Amy Rothberg, MD, a coauthor of the consensus report, told Medscape Medical News.

“The concept and definition of remission were borrowed from other diseases, primarily cancer, and is defined as achieving not necessarily the complete absence of the disease but below the detectable limit of the disease,” said Rothberg, clinical professor of medicine, research professor of nutrition sciences, and director of the Weight Management Program at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

“Remission” isn't the same as “reversal,” noted Scott Isaacs, MD, president of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology and adjunct associate professor of medicine at Emory University, Atlanta.

“‘Remission' refers to a reduction or disappearance of the signs and symptoms of a disease, but it doesn't mean the disease is ‘cured,'” he told Medscape Medical News.

Rothberg added, “By the time people are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, they already have a great magnitude of impairment and have lost beta-cell mass. Even if we can fully stop the progression of the disease — and the jury is still out on that — these patients aren't going to recover those cells.”

Clear language is important, Isaacs said. “Referring to diabetes as ‘reversed' can falsely reassure patients that they no longer need to monitor their health or sustain lifestyle changes.”

Weight loss is a major predictor of achieving remission as obesity contributes to insulin resistance and beta-cell decompensation. Patients with T2D and obesity are advised to lose at least 5% of their body weight, with ≥ 15% loss producing additional benefits.

BS has yielded dramatic improvements in glucose levels in patients with longstanding diabetes, driven largely by weight loss. The American Diabetes Association's guidelines for obesity management for T2D recommend BS for patients with BMI ≥ 40 (or 27.5-32.4 in Asians) unable to maintain weight loss with nonsurgical interventions.

Numerous studies support the superiority of BS over conventional treatment in achieving diabetes remission. In the Swedish Obesity Subjects study, remission rates were eightfold higher at 2 years and threefold higher at 10 years compared with conventional treatment. Follow-up data from this study showed that after 2 years weight fell by 23.4% in the surgery group vs 0.1% in the control group, and after 10 years, weight was 16.1% below baseline in the surgery group but increased by 1.6% in the control group.

The benefits of BS extend beyond weight loss. T2D is an inflammatory disease and BS has been associated with anti-inflammatory effects. Benefits often appear soon after surgery, even before significant weight loss, suggesting that the effects cannot be attributed to weight loss alone.

Medications can also facilitate remission. Both SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) induce significant weight loss, although GLP-1 RAs generally produce greater weight loss.

“A lot of the effects of modern pharmacotherapies are weight-dependent,” Rothberg commented. “As people lower their body fat, and fat is removed from the pancreas and liver, they feel better, improve their health, and hopefully reverse some of the pathophysiology.”

In one randomized study, pairing an SGLT2 inhibitor with a calorie-restricted diet led to remission in 44% of patients compared with 28% of those who received placebo.

GLP-1 RAs show similar potential. A recent study of over 14,000 adults (mean BMI, 32) evaluated four different definitions of remission, all requiring achieving an A1c of < 6.5% for ≥ 3 months:

Remission occurred in 5.8%, 6.2%, 12.2%, and 18.3% of participants, respectively.

“This large real-world study demonstrated that remission of type 2 diabetes with GLP-1 RAs is achievable,” Isaacs summarized.

GLP-1 RAs also appear to exert anti-inflammatory effects in patients with T2D, according to a meta-analysis of over 4700 patients. In fact, GLP-1 RAs represent a “significant breakthrough” in anti-inflammatory therapy, offering novel treatment options that can contribute not only to diabetes remission but also to improvements in other conditions as well.

“The traditional thinking of type 2 diabetes is a one-way street — once you develop it, it continues to progress — hasn't taken into account diet or lifestyle interventions,” said Vanita Rahman, MD, clinic director of the Barnard Medical Center and clinical instructor in medicine at the George Washington University School of Medicine, Washington, DC.

Rahman advocates a low-fat whole-foods plant-based (WFPB) diet, citing a growing body of evidence suggesting its benefits in weight loss and glycemic control.

In research conducted by her group, 58 patients with T2D completed a 12-week online program incorporating a low-fat WFPB diet without calorie restriction, in which participants maintained their pre-intervention medication and exercise practices.

Mean weight dropped by 3.7 kg, mean A1c fell by 0.6%, and 22% reduced diabetes medication doses.

“This study was conducted in a primary care setting, showing this type of intervention is feasible and efficacious in that setting,” Rahman told Medscape Medical News.

The effectiveness extends beyond weight loss, Rahman added. “Research has shown that diets high in fat contribute to insulin resistance, while lower-fat diets improve insulin sensitivity.” And WFPB diets have been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects in T2D.

Rothberg agreed that lifestyle interventions work, pointing to the DiRECT trial, in which nearly half of intervention participants achieved remission at 1 year using a very low-calorie diet and structured refeeding. However, only about one quarter maintained remission without medication after 5 years.

Rothberg's own trial of the REWIND program — a virtual, community-based weight management project — showed substantial and sustained weight loss (16% at 6 months and 14% at 18 months), and diabetes remission in 52% and 43% of participants with T2D at 12 and 18 months, respectively.

“People think lifestyle changes are an adjunct to pharmacotherapy, but it's the other way around,” she said. “Pharmacotherapy, when used, should be the adjunct to lifestyle changes.”

Although many patients require and benefit from medications for weight loss and/or diabetes, “that doesn't apply to everyone,” Rothberg said. She believes clinicians should invite patients to attempt lifestyle changes.

“Many professionals assume people would rather take a drug than change their behaviors. But I'm not sure all patients would feel that way, if given an effective lifestyle and behavioral change intervention.”

She advised clinicians to openly discuss the prognosis of diabetes with patients and their caregivers, as they would for any other serious disease, and tailor dietary guidance based on each individual's needs, environment, and support system.

Such an approach, she said, can give patients the best shot at achieving and sustaining remission.

Rothberg was the site principal investigator for research funded by Boehringer Ingelheim and had a speaking engagement for Eli Lilly. Rahman reported being an employee of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a nonprofit organization providing educational, research, and medical services related to nutrition. Rahman has authored several books on nutrition and reported receiving royalties from these sources. Isaacs reported being the president of AACE.

Almost a quarter of Canadian children with major physical trauma did not access a pediatric trauma center for their care between 2016 and 2021, according to a recent study.

Of 3007 children younger than 16 years with major trauma, 77.6% were directly transported or transferred to a pediatric trauma center. The rest were admitted to a level I or II adult trauma center or an acute care non-trauma hospital, according to the population-based, retrospective cohort study.

The results “suggest the opportunity for improvement” in Canadian trauma systems to ensure “optimal injury care for all children,” senior author Lynne Moore, PhD, professor of social and preventive medicine at the Université Laval in Quebec City, told Medscape News Canada.

The study was published on December 15 in CMAJ.

“Children with minor injuries can safely be treated in nonpediatric centers, but there is evidence of better outcomes when children with major injuries are treated in pediatric trauma centers,” said Moore. The current study did not examine clinical outcomes, however.

A 2023 meta-analysis showed that children treated in a pediatric trauma center were 41% less likely to die than those treated in a nonpediatric center, she added. They also had a 52% lower risk for CT use and a 64% lower risk for operative management of solid organ injuries, “which are interventions that clinical guidelines recommend be avoided in children, suggesting that adherence to guidelines is better in pediatric centers,” said Moore.

Because most severely injured children first present to nonpediatric hospitals, the most effective strategies to improve pediatric trauma care involve “strengthening decision support in prehospital environments and nonpediatric hospitals, not in costly new infrastructure,” the study authors wrote.

To better understand where access gaps occur, the researchers estimated crude and adjusted access to a pediatric trauma center among children younger than 16 years (the age cutoff used for transport or transfer to a pediatric trauma center in most Canadian trauma systems) and admitted to an acute care hospital with severe trauma (ie, Injury Severity Score [ISS] > 12) between April 1, 2016, and March 31, 2021.

Data were collected from nine provinces, but Quebec was excluded because of provincial data sharing restrictions. The territories also were excluded because patient volume was too small. Admissions for burns, frostbite, drowning, poisoning, complications of medical care, and late effects of injury were also excluded because these conditions are not typically indications for transport to a pediatric trauma center.

The investigators performed subgroup analyses and adjustment for variables such as age (0-5 years, 6-12 years, and 13-15 years), sex, body region of injuries (ie, head, spine, thorax, abdomen, upper extremities, and lower extremities), injury mechanism (ie, motor vehicle collision, fall, and other), and ISS.

The average age of patients was 9.2 years. About 64% of the patients were male, and 18.2% of the patients had critical injuries (ISS ≥ 25). Most severe injuries were to the head (60.7%) and thorax (32.6%). About 47% of children were injured in motor vehicle collisions.

Crude access to pediatric trauma centres was highest in Manitoba (94.5%) and Alberta (87.9%) and lowest in the Atlantic provinces (64.7%), Saskatchewan (62.0%), and British Columbia (56.3%).

Using Ontario as the reference (crude access, 83%) because it has the largest population, the researchers found lower adjusted access to a pediatric trauma center in British Columbia (relative risk [RR], 0.68), the Atlantic provinces (RR, 0.80), and Saskatchewan (RR, 0.77) but higher adjusted access in Alberta (RR, 1.06) and Manitoba (RR, 1.14).

Subgroup analysis showed that access was higher for younger children (crude access, 80.9%, 81.7%, and 69.9% for those aged 0-5, 6-12, and 13-15 years, respectively; RR, 1.19 and 1.17) and for those with critical injuries (crude access, 88.8%; RR, 1.16) vs less severe injuries (crude access, 73.0% for ISS 13-15 and 75.7% for ISS 16-24). There was little variation in access based on injury mechanism or body region.

The authors noted that geography may play a role in access to pediatric trauma centers. Geography did not fully explain the observed interprovincial differences, however. For example, in Saskatchewan and the Atlantic provinces, only 27%-48% of children are within a 1-hour drive of a pediatric trauma center, and in Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick, children must be transferred to neighboring provinces to access a pediatric trauma center.

“Other factors — such as prehospital triage, interhospital transfer protocols, and lack of pediatric readiness in nonpediatric hospitals — likely play a role,” they wrote.

“Injury is the first cause of death and disability in Canadian children, so improving injury care for children has enormous potential to improve the lives of Canadian kids and their families,” said Moore.

Prehospital triage tools that consider children's unique needs and toolkits to improve pediatric readiness at nonpediatric hospitals “are already available, so they could be implemented in the short term,” she added. But more research is needed to develop and validate interhospital transfer protocols.

“More generally, we really need better national data on trauma so we can identify opportunities for improvement and evaluate whether those improvements lead to better patient care,” said Moore.

She pointed to Quebec as an example of how system-level coordination can improve access. Quebec has a regionalized trauma system with 60 trauma centers, including three pediatric centers, thus ensuring good geographic coverage. The province also has implemented a standardized prehospital triage tool that considers children's needs, and regional trauma systems have interhospital transfer agreements along with no-refusal policies.

Such system-level coordination, however, may be more difficult to assess and replicate nationally. Since funding of the Canadian National Trauma Registry was withdrawn in 2012, it has become more challenging to promote national improvements in injury care.

Commenting on the study for Medscape News Canada, Kazuhide Matsushima, MD, associate professor of clinical surgery at the Keck Medicine of USC, Los Angeles, said that the findings were not surprising, “given that there are less than 15 level I/II pediatric trauma centers in Canada, which is more or less in line with data in the United States.” Matsushima did not participate in the study.

“In addition to differences in the geographic coverage of pediatric trauma centers, future research should focus on elucidating all the potential underlying mechanisms on the interprovincial variations in access to pediatric trauma centers,” he said. “Certainly, province- or nationwide granular data will be required for those studies, and instead of conventional quantitative research, qualitative research such as focus group interviews with prehospital providers might help improve understanding of the current practice variations.”

While some studies suggest that pediatric trauma patients, particularly younger children, may have better outcomes when treated at standalone pediatric trauma centers vs adult or mixed trauma centers, geographic and systemic constraints make it crucial to identify clinical phenotypes that may benefit the most from care at pediatric trauma centers to optimize prehospital triage and guide interfacility transfer decisions.

“For example, previous studies observed significant outcome benefits related to the care at pediatric trauma centers in children with traumatic brain injury, and some data suggest that penetrating injury patients might do better at pediatric centers, although that is different from my own clinical experience,” said Matsushima.

The study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Fonds de recherche du Québec — Santé. Moore and Matsushima reported having no relevant financial relationships.

 December 23, 2025  

Benzodiazepine use during pregnancy is associated with a 20% higher risk for preterm birth and a 6% increased risk for small for gestational age, with more pronounced effects observed during the second trimester. The analysis of 454,477 pregnancies revealed that benzodiazepine use was linked to a 58% higher risk for abortion than nonuse.

“Our findings may help inform clinicians' prescribing thresholds for benzodiazepines during pregnancy by balancing the attenuated risks (compared with previous studies) against the potential therapeutic benefits for the underlying condition,” the authors of the study wrote. “Whether risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes differ by type of benzodiazepine, duration, dose, and continuity of treatment remain important unanswered questions. Nonetheless, the population-based risk estimates provided in this study will help to balance the importance of receiving benzodiazepine treatment against the potential increased risks for adverse pregnancy outcomes,” Anna Hung, PharmD, PhD, MS, of the Department of Population Health Sciences, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, wrote in an accompanying editorial.

This study was led by Brian Meng-Hsun Li, MClinPharm, School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University in Tainan, Taiwan. It was published online on December 22 in JAMA Internal Medicine.

According to the authors, while propensity score methods with inverse probability weighting were applied to emulate randomization and achieve balanced characteristics between treatment groups, residual confounding could not be completely ruled out. The study may have been subjected to minimal protopathic bias as some patients might have used benzodiazepines shortly before undergoing elective abortion. Additionally, the Birth Certificate Application database only included pregnancies exceeding 20 weeks, potentially leading to underestimation of abortion risk despite capturing abortion records from the National Health Insurance Research Database.

This study received support from grants provided by the National Science and Technology Council of Taiwan. Edward Chia-Cheng Lai, PhD, disclosed receiving grants from the National Science and Technology Council of Taiwan outside the submitted work. Hung reported receiving grants from the National Institutes of Health, the US Department of Veterans Affairs, Abbott, and AstraZeneca; personal fees from Genentech; and honoraria from the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy outside the submitted work.

A study by the Mildred Scheel Early Career Center group led by Dr. Mohamed Elgendy at the TUD Faculty of Medicine provides fundamental insights into cancer biology. Published in the renowned journal Nature Communications, the study shows for the first time that the protein MCL1 not only inhibits programmed cell death, but also plays a central role in tumor metabolism.

The researchers have succeeded in tracing two classic hallmarks of cancer – the evasion of apoptosis (a form of programmed cell death) and the dysregulation of energy metabolism – back to a common molecular mechanism.

The study focuses on the protein MCL1, which is strongly overexpressed in many tumor types and has previously been considered primarily an anti-apoptotic factor of the Bcl-2 protein family. The Dresden researchers now show that MCL1 directly influences the central metabolic regulator mTOR and thus controls the bioenergetics of cancer cells. This is the first time that MCL1 has been described as an active regulator of central signaling and metabolic pathways.

Our findings show that MCL1 is much more than just a survival factor for tumor cells. The protein actively intervenes in key metabolic and growth signaling pathways, thereby linking two fundamental cancer mechanisms.""

Dr. Mohamed Elgendy, TUD Faculty of Medicine

Mechanistically, the team identified a direct functional link between MCL1 and the mTORC1 complex in various cancer models. This newly discovered signaling pathway fundamentally expands the current understanding of the role of MCL1 and opens up new therapeutic perspectives.

In addition to genetic analyses, the study also investigated the effect of MCL1 inhibitors, which are currently undergoing clinical development as promising new cancer therapeutics. The study showed that these agents also inhibit mTOR signaling. This finding is of high clinical relevance, as mTOR inhibitors are already routinely used in cancer therapy.

Another particularly significant finding is the resolution of a previously unsolved problem: several clinical trials with MCL1 inhibitors had to be discontinued due to severe cardiotoxic side effects. The Dresden researchers identified an underlying molecular mechanism for the first time and, based on this, developed a dietary approach that can significantly reduce cardiac toxicity. This protective effect was confirmed in an innovative humanized mouse model.

""This work represents a significant advance in our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer,"" says Prof. Esther Troost, Dean of the Carl Gustav Carus Faculty of Medicine at TU Dresden. ""This high-ranking publication with enormous clinical potential once again demonstrates that the targeted support of outstanding young scientists, as carried out at the Mildred Scheel Center for Young Scientists, is a prerequisite for innovations and the cancer therapy of tomorrow.""

Prof. Uwe Platzbecker, Chief Medical Officer of the University Hospital Dresden, adds: ""This outstanding research work exemplifies how excellent basic research can create direct benefits for our cancer patients. Particularly significant from a clinical perspective is the solution to the cardiotoxicity problem of MCL1 inhibitors. The identification of the underlying mechanism and the development of a dietary protective approach can now pave the way for safer therapies.""

The study is the result of interdisciplinary collaboration between various research groups and institutions. Dr. Mohamed Elgendy's working group in Dresden acted as the lead partner and was supported by experts from national and international partner institutes in Czechia, Austria, and Italy.

The importance of the work was also recognized by the editors of the journal Nature Communications: The publication was selected as one of the outstanding research papers on cancer on the ""Editors' Highlights"" website, which presents the 50 best currently published studies in this field.

A new systematic evidence review finds that cannabis products that carry relatively high levels of the psychoactive compound tetrahydrocannabinol, commonly known as THC, may provide short-term improvements in pain and function. 

However, the review found THC-based products led to an increased risk of common adverse symptoms like dizziness, sedation and nausea. 

At the same time, the review found that recent randomized controlled trials involving products mainly or only containing cannabidiol, or CBD, which does not have psychoactive properties, demonstrated almost no improvement in managing pain. 

This may be surprising to people. Conventional wisdom was that CBD was promising because it doesn't have euphoric effects like THC and it was thought to have medicinal properties. But, at least in our analysis, it didn't have an effect on pain."" 

Roger Chou, M.D., lead author, senior adviser for the Pacific Northwest Evidence-based Practice Center at Oregon Health & Science University

The cannabis plant contains both THC and CBD. Both are believed to act on the body's endocannabinoid system, which modulates pain. Many U.S. states, including Oregon, have legalized cannabis for both recreational and medicinal use, and many people have turned to cannabis to treat conditions including pain, anxiety and sleep. 

The review, an update to a living review first published in 2022, was conducted by researchers at OHSU and published today in the Annals of Internal Medicine. 

Researchers incorporated several additional short-term placebo-controlled randomized trials since the previous review. Both the original review and the new update found some evidence of pain relief for two prescribed products, dronabinol and nabilone, which are made of 100% THC or its analogue. Dronabinol and nabilone are FDA approved for treatment of nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy, and one of them, dronabinol, is approved for HIV wasting syndrome. 

The new review found that oral THC-only products slightly reduce pain severity. 

Chou noted that the improvement in pain was relatively small - on the order of a half point to a point compared with a placebo on a 10-point pain scale. 

""It's complicated because cannabis products are complicated,"" he said. ""It's not like taking a standardized dose of ibuprofen, for example. Cannabis is derived from a plant and has multiple chemicals in addition to THC and CBD that may have additional properties depending on where it's grown, how it's cultivated and ultimately prepared for sale."" 

The medical profession is equally divided on the benefits of medicinal use of cannabis: The American College of Physicians recently declined to recommend inhaled cannabis for non-cancer pain whereas a previous expert panel issued a soft recommendation for people with chronic cancer or non-cancer pain when standard treatments did not work. 

Chou said the review's finding that CBD products failed to reduce pain will surprise many people. 

""CBD-based products are widely available in dispensaries. Many people use these products and they think it helps,"" he said. ""Our goal is to provide some scientific basis to help people make their decisions."" 

The researchers categorized cannabinoids by the ratio of THC to CBD (whether it was high, comparable or low); whether the product was synthetic (produced in a lab) or plant-based (as well as the degree of purification); and the administration method. 

The data showed that oral THC-only products slightly reduced pain severity, but that across trials they were also linked to moderate-to-large increases in dizziness, sedation and nausea. 

They concluded that more research is needed on long-term outcomes and other types of cannabis products; whether there are differences between THC-only products in effectiveness; and to better understand how results based on the products evaluated in the review apply to products that are available in dispensaries.

A possible new treatment for impaired brain blood flow and related dementias is on the horizon. Research by scientists at the University of Vermont Robert Larner, M.D. College of Medicine provides novel insights into the mechanisms that regulate brain blood flow and highlight a potential therapeutic strategy to correct vascular dysfunction. Their preclinical findings, published December 22 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggest that adding a missing phospholipid back into a person's circulatory system could restore normal brain blood flow and reduce symptoms of dementia.

This discovery is a huge step forward in our efforts to prevent dementia and neurovascular diseases. We are uncovering the complex mechanisms of these devastating conditions, and now we can begin to think about how to translate this biology into therapies.""

Osama Harraz, Ph.D., principal investigator, assistant professor of pharmacology at Larner College of Medicine

Alzheimer's disease and related dementias affect 50 million people around the world and numbers are rising, placing immense burdens on families and health care systems. Research deciphers the role of proteins, inflammation, neural activity, and brain cell dysfunction.

Research in the Harraz lab focused on the control of cerebral blood flow and vascular signaling and the role of Piezo1, a protein that lives on the membranes of cells lining the blood vessels, in controlling brain blood flow. Named for the Greek word for ""pressure,"" Piezo1 is a sensor of frictional forces as the blood moves through the brain vasculature. Previous studies showed that Piezo1 activity is altered in carriers of Piezo1 gene variations.

Findings from this new study, ""PIP2 Corrects an Endothelial Piezo1 Channelopathy"" provide novel insights into how Piezo1 affects cerebral blood flow and shows that diseases such as Alzheimer's disease are associated with increased vascular Piezo1 activity. Harraz's team investigated a phospholipid in brain cell membranes called PIP₂. This phospholipid is vital for cell signaling and ion channel regulation-a complex process where cells control the opening and closing of protein pores. The researchers found that PIP2 is a natural inhibitor of Piezo1; when PIP₂ levels drop, Piezo1 becomes overactive, which disturbs the brain's blood flow. They tested adding PIP₂ back into the system, which suppressed Piezo1 and restored normal blood flow. The study suggests that boosting PIP₂ could become a new treatment strategy to restore normal blood flow and enhance brain function. 

Further investigation will focus on defining how PIP₂ interacts with Piezo1, including whether it directly binds specific protein regions or alters the surrounding membrane environment to restrain pore opening. Future studies will also examine how disease-associated reductions in PIP₂ disrupt this regulatory brake, leading to sustained Piezo1 overactivity and impaired cerebral blood flow. Clarifying these mechanisms will be essential for refining PIP₂-based or Piezo1-targeted therapeutic strategies to restore healthy neurovascular function in dementia and related vascular disorders.

Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy has revolutionized hematologic cancer treatment, but its efficacy in solid tumors remains limited by poor infiltration into the complex tumor microenvironment (TME). A new review published in Volume 138, Issue 19 of the Chinese Medical Journal on October 05, 2025, outlines breakthrough strategies to address this critical bottleneck.

Solid tumors present multiple barriers: abnormal vasculature, dense extracellular matrix, disordered chemokine signals, and immunosuppressive stromal cells. These obstacles reduce CAR-T cell access to tumor cells, with circulating CAR-T levels in solid tumor patients 5–10 times lower than in hematologic cancer cases.

To tackle this, researchers are targeting vascular normalization. Anti-VEGF drugs like bevacizumab, when combined with CAR-T cells, remodel abnormal tumor blood vessels, improving T cell penetration. In preclinical models, inhibiting pathways like PAK4 or endothelial cell metabolism further enhances vascular function and CAR-T efficacy.

Modulating the chemokine system is another key strategy. Genetically engineering CAR-T cells to co-express chemokines (e.g., CCL19, CXCL10) or their receptors (e.g., CXCR6) creates targeted gradients, guiding T cells to tumors. A phase I trial of glypican-3-CAR-T cells co-expressing CCL19 and IL-7 showed promise in hepatocellular carcinoma.

Breaking physical barriers is also critical. Targeting fibroblast activation protein (FAP) on cancer-associated fibroblasts or using enzymes like hyaluronidase to degrade the extracellular matrix improves CAR-T infiltration. Preclinical studies with synNotch CAR-T cells secreting matrix-degrading enzymes have demonstrated enhanced antitumor activity.

Combination therapies amplify results: chemotherapy (e.g., nab-paclitaxel) disrupts stroma, radiotherapy triggers inflammatory signals, and oncolytic viruses remodel the TME. Local delivery methods-intratumoral injection, biomaterial scaffolds, or oxygen-releasing systems-boost CAR-T bioavailability while reducing off-target toxicity.

Despite progress, challenges persist: translating preclinical models to humans, optimizing CAR-T cell phenotypes for solid tumors, and scaling biomaterial-based delivery systems. The review emphasizes integrating immunology, genetic engineering, and materials science to advance personalized treatments.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Marijuana use associated with worse school performance and emotional distress for teens","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251223/Marijuana-use-associated-with-worse-school-performance-and-emotional-distress-for-teens.aspx","Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:48:00 GMT","

Using marijuana just once or twice a month was associated with worse school performance and emotional distress for teens, according to a large national study of adolescents led by Ryan Sultán, an assistant professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. The more frequently teens used cannabis, the more likely they were to report emotional distress and other social and academic problems. 

""While previous studies have focused on the effects of frequent cannabis use among teens, our study found that any amount of cannabis use at all may put kids at risk of falling behind in school, and the kids using most often may have the greatest risk,"" says Sultán, who studies adolescent substance use. ""A few 'harmless' joints can snowball into real academic consequences. Teens using it regularly often struggle to focus, miss school, and may lose interest in their future plans."" 

The new study arrives amid a national backdrop of shifting trends in teen drug use. While use of many substances is at record lows among US youths, cannabis remains an exception. About 1 in 5 high school students currently use cannabis, and approximately 6% of 12th graders use it daily – a rate that has increased in the past decade. 

""The real-world impact can be dramatic,"" Sultán says. ""It's not uncommon for a young teen to smoke marijuana only a few times before showing signs of withdrawal and worsening mood."" 

Scientists are especially concerned because today's cannabis products contain two to three times more THC (the ingredient that causes a high) than in the past, making them more potent. And previous studies have shown that using cannabis during adolescence, when the brainis still developing critical neural connections, may have lasting effects on cognitive functions that are critical to academic performance.

A teenager's brain is still developing the circuits for learning, self-control, and emotional regulation. Using cannabis, even casually, during these critical growth periods interferes with those processes and can derail normal development."" 

Tim Becker, a child & adolescent psychiatrist at Weill Cornell Medicine and study co-author

The new study analyzed data from a nationally representative survey of over 160,000 U.S. 8th, 10th, and 12th grade students conducted from 2018 to 2022. Over one-quarter of the respondents reported cannabis use; less than 20% reported monthly or less frequent use; and much smaller percentages said they used cannabis weekly or almost every day. 

In the study, adolescents who used cannabis once or twice a month reported higher rates of depression-like symptoms, anxiety, and impulsive behavior than those who abstained. Near-daily users were almost four times as likely to have poor grades and were frequentlydisengaged from school activities. These associations were even stronger for younger cannabis users. 

Experts recommend having frank, nonjudgmental conversations with teens about cannabis early and often. 

""Make sure they understand that ""natural"" doesn't mean ""safe,"" Sultán says. ""Parents also need to keep an eye out for warning signs like declining grades, mood changes, or loss of interest in hobbies – and consider that cannabis could be a factor.""

Recent advancements in cancer vaccine development have demonstrated their potential for precise tumor targeting through antigen-specific immune activation. Nevertheless, critical challenges persist in clinical translation, including inefficient antigen cross-presentation, suboptimal carrier-mediated immunogenicity, and systemic immune-related adverse events. These drawbacks highlight the pressing requirement for creative approaches to engineer next-generation vaccine platforms that synergistically enhance antigen delivery efficiency, immune activation precision, and biosafety.

Herein, this study constructed a pH-responsive nanovaccine (Lyc-OVA) based on polysaccharide-functionalized CDs derived from Lycium barbarum (Lyc-CDs). The unique surface chemistry of Lyc-CDs, enriched with hydroxyl/amino groups and retained LBP, endowed Lyc-OVA with high antigen-loading capacity (48.4%) and tumor microenvironment-triggered release (80% OVA release at pH 5.4). In vitro, Lyc-OVA enhanced DCs maturation (CD80+CD86+ proportion matching LPS controls) and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion (TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-6). In vivo, Lyc-OVA significantly inhibited primary/distal tumor growth (80.36%/82.16% inhibition rates) by activation of CD4+CD8+ T cells，reduction of immunosuppressive Treg/MDSC populations and reprogramming of the tumor immune microenvironment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Precision immunotherapy for TRBC2-positive T-cell malignancies","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251222/Precision-immunotherapy-for-TRBC2-positive-T-cell-malignancies.aspx","Tue, 23 Dec 2025 01:34:00 GMT","

Researchers at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center's Ludwig Center developed a new treatment that selectively targets TRBC2-positive T-cell cancers, expanding a precision approach they established in 2024 for TRBC1-positive tumors. 

The therapy, an antibody-drug conjugate, targets a protein expressed on the surface of T-cell cancers to deliver a cancer cell-killing drug. 

The work, published Dec. 22 in Nature Cancer, provides a long-sought therapeutic option for half of T-cell lymphomas and leukemias that express the TRBC2 variant of the T-cell receptor.

T-cell lymphomas and leukemias affect roughly 100,000 people worldwide each year. These T-cell malignancies, rare and scientifically complex, have received far less pharmaceutical investment than B cell leukemias and lymphomas and have fewer treatment options. As a result, adults with relapsed T-cell cancers have five-year survival rates of 7% to 38%.

""There is a challenging situation,"" says senior author Suman Paul, M.B.B.S., Ph.D., assistant professor of oncology, ""because unlike B-cell therapies - where eliminating both cancerous and healthy B cells is tolerable - therapies targeting T cells must preserve enough normal T cells for patients to survive infections."" 

""The tricky part is that if the drug kills both the T-cell lymphoma and the normal T cells, then it's very hard for that person to survive,"" Paul explains. ""We have to be mindful that it has to get rid of the cancer, but it cannot completely get rid of the normal T cells."" 

One way to achieve this balance is to target TRBC1 or TRBC2, two mutually exclusive genetic variants of the T-cell receptor. Normal T cells are a mix of TRBC1-positive (~40%) and TRBC2-positive (~60%) populations, but each T-cell cancer expresses only one of the two variants. Selectively targeting the cancer-associated TRBC variant preserves approximately 40%–60% of normal T cells. In 2024, the team published findings on the first TRBC1-targeting therapeutic antibody However, until now, no TRBC2-specific therapeutic antibody existed, leaving half of the patients without an equivalent approach.

In the new study, the researchers used a phage-displayed antibody library, a powerful tool used to discover new antibodies, to create JX1.1, a new antibody that recognizes only the TRBC2 protein target and not the similar TRBC1 protein.

""Our antibody was developed using SLISY, a next-generation sequencing-based platform for rapid identification of antibody candidates from a phage library,"" says Ken Kinzler, Ph.D., Barry Family Professor in Oncology, and director of the Ludwig Center.

Researchers then linked the new JX1.1 antibody to the cancer-cell killing drug pyrrolobenzodiazepine to generate an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). In laboratory studies using cancer cell lines and animal models, they found the new ADC to be highly specific to TRBC2 cancers, clearly distinguishing between TRBC2-positive and TRBC1-positive normal T cells. The ADC killed TRBC2-positive cancer cells, leading to robust tumor regression in animal models with minimal toxicity. All JX1.1-treated mice sustained elimination of detectable cancer throughout the entire follow-up period of 150 days.

""The development of TRBC1 and TRBC2 antibodies together now provides a conceptual 'matched set' of precision tools for the great majority of patients with T-cell cancers,"" says Paul.

In a landmark effort to understand how the physical structure of our DNA influences human biology, Northwestern investigators and the 4D Nucleome Project have unveiled the most detailed maps to date of the genome's three‑dimensional organization across time and space, according to a new study published in Nature. 

The findings, generated using human embryonic stem cells and fibroblasts, offer a sweeping view of how genes interact, fold and reposition themselves as cells function and divide, said co-corresponding author Feng Yue, the Duane and Susan Burnham Professor of Molecular Medicine in the department of biochemistry and molecular genetics.

""Understanding how the genome folds and reorganizes in three dimensions is essential to understanding how cells function,"" said Yue, who also is director of the Center for Advanced Molecular Analysis and founding director of the Center for Cancer Genomics at the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University. ""These maps give us an unprecedented view of how genome structure helps regulate gene activity in space and time."" 

Rather than existing as a straight ladder of code, the human genome folds into looping structures and compartments within the nucleus. These physical interactions can determine which genes turn on or off, influencing everything from development to cell identity and disease.

To study this complexity, Yue and his international collaborators employed a wide array of genomic technologies on fibroblasts and human embryonic stem cells to produce a unified dataset. 

This effort identified:

These maps reveal how the genome's architecture varies from cell to cell and how these variations relate to essential processes, including transcription and DNA replication.

Because no single technology can fully capture the genome's 4D structure, the study also assessed the capabilities and limitations of the methods involved. Through extensive benchmarking, the investigators identified which assays are best suited to detect loops, domain boundaries or nuanced differences in nuclear positioning - providing a roadmap for scientists pursuing similar questions in the future.

Additionally, by developing computational tools capable of predicting how the genome will fold purely from its sequence, the study authors have set the stage for future scientists to estimate how genetic variants - including those linked to disease - might alter 3D genome architecture, all without needing to run complex experiments.

This advance could accelerate the discovery of pathogenic mutations and reveal previously hidden mechanisms behind inherited disorders, Yue said.

Since the majority of variants associated with human diseases are located in the non-coding regions of the genome, it is critical to understand how these variants influence essential gene expression and contribute to disease. The 3D genome organization provides a powerful framework for predicting which genes are likely to be affected by these pathogenic variants."" 

Feng Yue, co-corresponding author 

The work underscores a growing recognition that the genome's function cannot be understood only by reading its sequence and that its shape matters, too. By revealing the connections between DNA folding, chromatin loops, gene activity and cell behavior, the study moves the field closer to a holistic view of how genetic instructions operate inside living cells.

Moving forward, Yue said he hopes these tools will eventually help decode how genome misfolding contributes to cancers, developmental disorders and other conditions, opening the door to structural genomics-based diagnostics and therapies.

""Having observed 3D genome alterations across cancers, including leukemia and brain tumors, our next aim is to explore how these structures can be precisely targeted and modulated using drugs such as epigenetic inhibitors,"" Yue said.

In this interview, News Medical speaks with Dr Bryony Henderson, Medical Director for the UK and US at MedExpress, about the evolving role of GLP‑1 agonists in obesity care and the future of metabolic health treatments.

I am the Medical Director for the UK and US at MedExpress, where I lead our clinical governance and quality teams. My journey to this role has been defined by a passion for safe, innovative, and scalable care.

Before joining MedExpress, I built experience in clinical operations and digital health through leadership roles at Kry/Livi and Numan. I've always been committed to being a clinical voice for change, whether that's through publishing research on health inequalities or leading award-winning public health campaigns and speaking to national media. 

Today, my focus is on ensuring that as we innovate in the digital space, we remain committed to upholding the highest standards of patient safety.

Physiologically, GLP-1 receptor agonists mimic a naturally occurring hormone that our bodies produce in the gut after eating. These medications act as a ""biological bridge"" in three key ways: first, they stimulate the pancreas to release the right amount of insulin; second, they slow down gastric emptying, meaning you feel full for longer; and third, perhaps most importantly, they interact with the brain's reward centres to reduce ""food noise"" and cravings.

Understanding that this is a hormonal intervention, rather than just an appetite suppressant, helps patients view it as a tool to reset their metabolic signals.

These injections are usually prescribed to adults living with obesity, who have a body mass index (BMI) over 30, or over 27 if they have other weight-related health issues such as high blood pressure or prediabetes.

However, looking to 2026, the ""benefit profile"" is expanding, so clinical supervision remains essential. Patients benefit most when medication is paired with broader lifestyle restructuring. 

Absolutely, and this is one of the most exciting areas of development for 2026. As clinical evidence accumulates, we are seeing GLP-1s move far beyond the scale. We expect to see these medications prescribed for a broader range of indications, including osteoarthritis, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. By 2026, we may also see their application in treating sleep apnoea and even certain neurodegenerative conditions. We are moving from ""weight loss drugs"" to ""metabolic health stabilisers.""

Sustainability is highly dependent on the ""wraparound"" care provided. GLP-1s are incredibly effective at inducing weight loss, while on the treatment, we know that obesity is a chronic condition. Without a robust transition plan, hunger signals can return if treatment is ceased.

This is why, at MedExpress, we focus on increased personalization; by 2026, I expect to see more sophisticated dosing schedules and tracking tools that help patients maintain their ""non-scale"" health improvements long-term, whether they remain on a maintenance dose or transition off it.

Managing the ""quick fix"" narrative is a core part of clinical governance. We must be clear: these are medical interventions, not ""vanity drugs"". Psychological support is not an optional extra; it is often essential. We need to address the behavioral relationship with food simultaneously. 

In my view, the most successful treatment models in 2026 will be those that combine medication with behavioral change to ensure the patient's lifestyle evolves alongside their biology.

This is a critical issue. Access through systems like the NHS remains limited compared to clinical need. The NHS is exploring new rollout models, but uptake still only represents a fraction of the eligible population. This creates a ""two-tier"" system in which private prescribing offers earlier access.

However, 2026 will be a turning point: as semaglutide loses patent protection in major global markets, such as China, Canada, and Brazil, and with liraglutide already off-patent in the US, the growth of generics is expected to drive down costs and improve global equity.

The current guidelines offer a strong safety framework, but there is room for further development. As we move toward 2026, I would like to see guidelines that allow for more ""dosing flexibility"" and personalized treatment paths. We need to ensure that widening access, a public health necessity, does not come at the expense of clinical oversight.

My focus is on ensuring that, regardless of the delivery model, the patient is always under the care of a clinician who monitors metrics such as blood pressure and heart rate variability.

Yes, we are witnessing a profound shift. They are helping dismantle the “willpower myth.” By demonstrating how hormonal pathways influence weight, these treatments are reframing obesity as a chronic metabolic disease rather than a lifestyle choice. This shift in perception is vital for reducing the stigma that has prevented many patients from seeking help in the past.

Over the next decade, GLP-1s will be the ""anchor"" of a much more holistic, data-driven approach. We will see an expansion of options, including new combination therapies and oral formulations like orforglipron, which will offer patients more choice in how they take their medication. We'll see expanded options including combination therapies and oral formulations like orforglipron, integrating medication with wearable tech, real‑time metabolic monitoring, and tailored nutritional coaching. We are moving away from a ""one-size-fits-all"" and towards personalized lifelong metabolic health management.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Menopause hormone therapy not linked to dementia risk in women","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251222/Menopause-hormone-therapy-not-linked-to-dementia-risk-in-women.aspx","Tue, 23 Dec 2025 03:04:00 GMT","

A major review of prior research has found no evidence that menopause hormone therapy either increases or decreases dementia risk in post-menopausal women, in a new study led by University College London (UCL) researchers.

The findings, commissioned by the World Health Organization (WHO) and published in The Lancet Healthy Longevity, add much-needed clarity to a hotly-debated topic, and reinforce current clinical guidance that menopause hormone therapy, also called hormone replacement therapy or HRT, should be guided by perceived benefits and risks and not for dementia prevention.

The new systematic review and meta-analysis is the most comprehensive and rigorous synthesis of evidence on menopause hormone therapy and dementia risk completed to date, including data from over one million participants.

The study publication follows a November announcement by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that it would remove the 'black box' warnings on menopause hormone therapy products. These warnings had previously included disproven claims about potential long-term health risks, including a claim of potential increased dementia risk. The FDA announcement further suggested that menopause hormone therapy might reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease, however, the findings of this latest review indicate that this claim is also not supported by the available evidence.

Across the globe, dementia disproportionately affects women, even after accounting for women's longer lifespans, so there's a pressing need to understand what might be driving that risk, and to identify ways to reduce women's risk of dementia.

Menopause hormone therapy is widely used to manage menopausal symptoms, yet its impact on memory, cognition and dementia risk remains one of the most debated issues in women's health. Conflicting research and concerns about potential harms have fuelled public and clinical debate, leaving women and clinicians unsure whether menopause hormone therapy might raise or reduce their risk of dementia.""

Melissa Melville, lead author, PhD student, UCL Psychology & Language Sciences

The international research team, based in the UK, Ireland, Switzerland, Australia and China, pulled together the best evidence on any potential links between menopause hormone therapy and dementia risk (including Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia), which included one randomised controlled trial and nine observational studies, with a total of 1,016,055 participants.

They found no significant association between menopause hormone therapy and the risk of dementia or mild cognitive impairment. Additional analyses of subgroups within the study participant pools, based on timing, duration and type of menopause hormone therapy, still did not reveal any significant effects. They found no evidence that menopause hormone therapy affected dementia risk after early menopause.

The researchers caution that their findings are limited by the scarcity of relevant randomised controlled trials, and that a lot of the evidence is of relatively low certainty. They say there remains a need for high-quality, long-term research, particularly in women from ethnic minority backgrounds or with early menopause, premature ovarian insufficiency, or mild cognitive impairment.

Senior author Professor Aimee Spector (UCL Psychology & Language Sciences) said: ""Currently, the World Health Organization provides no guidance on menopause hormone therapy and cognitive outcomes, leaving a critical gap for clinicians and policymakers. To cut through the noise, we reviewed the most rigorous research there is on the subject and found that menopause hormone therapy does not appear to impact dementia risk either positively or negatively.""

""This review will help to inform the upcoming WHO guidelines on reducing the risk of cognitive decline and dementia, which are expected to be released in 2026.

""More high-quality, long-term research is still needed to fully understand the long-term impacts of menopausal hormone therapy.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","A senescence-based therapeutic approach for temporal lobe epilepsy","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251222/A-senescence-based-therapeutic-approach-for-temporal-lobe-epilepsy.aspx","Tue, 23 Dec 2025 01:55:00 GMT","

Temporal lobe epilepsy, which results in recurring seizures and cognitive dysfunction, is associated with premature aging of brain cells. A new study from researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center found that this form of epilepsy can be treated in mice by either genetically or pharmaceutically eradicating the aging cells, thereby improving memory and reducing seizures as well as protecting some animals from developing epilepsy. 

The National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded study appears December 22 in the journal Annals of Neurology.

A third of individuals living with epilepsy don't achieve freedom from seizures with current medications. Our hope is that senotherapy, which involves using medications to remove senescent, or aging cells, could potentially minimize the need for surgery and/or improve outcomes after surgery."" 

Patrick A. Forcelli, Ph.D., senior author, professor and chair of Georgetown School of Medicine's Department of Pharmacology & Physiology and the Jerome H. Fleisch & Marlene L. Cohen Endowed Professor of Pharmacology

Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) can be caused by several factors, including brain injuries from trauma or stroke, infections like meningitis, brain tumors, blood vessel malformations and genetic syndromes. TLE is the most common type of drug-resistant epilepsy, affecting about 40% of patients with the condition. 

In one part of their study, the investigators looked at donated brain tissue in the lab that had been surgically removed from the temporal lobes of people. They found a five-fold elevation of senescent glia cells in human TLE cases compared to autopsy tissue from people without the disease. Glia cells support and protect neurons but do not produce electrical neuronal impulses.

Based on their human brain tissue investigation, the researchers suspected there could be an abundance of senescent cells in a mouse model that mimics TLE. Indeed, within two weeks of the initial injury that triggered TLE in the mice, the investigators found increases in cellular markers of senescence at both gene and protein levels. Treatment to remove the aging cells in mice resulted in a 50% reduction in these senescent cells, normalized their ability to navigate mazes, reduced seizures and protected a third of animals from epilepsy altogether.

The drug treatment tested in the mice was a combination of dasatinib, a targeted therapy used to treat leukemia, and quercetin, a plant flavonoid found in fruits, vegetables, tea, and wine that can act as a powerful antioxidant and have anti-inflammatory properties. The combination of the two drugs has been widely used to kill senescent cells in a range of diseases modeled in animal studies. The researchers also chose these drugs because they are already in early phase clinical trials for other diseases. Forcelli also notes that because dasatinib is FDA approved as a treatment for a form of leukemia, investigators already know its safety profile, meaning a potentially faster route to clinical trials in people.

The study's first co-authors Tahiyana Khan, Ph.D. and David J. McFall, both trainees in Forcelli's lab, say that senescence of glial cells has recently been implicated in aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, another area they are exploring.

""We have ongoing studies using other repurposed drugs that can impact senescence as well as studies in other rodent models of epilepsy. We would like to understand the critical windows for intervention in epilepsy, and the hope is that these studies will lead to clinically useful treatments,"" says Forcelli.

In addition to Forcelli, Khan and McFall, authors at Georgetown include Abbas I. Hussain, Logan A. Frayser, Timothy P. Casilli, Meaghan C. Steck, Irene Sanchez-Brualla, Ph.D., Noah M. Kuehn, Michelle Cho, Jacqueline A. Barnes, M.D., Brent T. Harris, M.D., Ph.D., and Stefano Vicini, Ph.D.

A research group led by Professor Hiroaki SUZUKI and Takeshi HAYAKAWA from the Faculty of Science and Engineering at Chuo University, graduate student Zhitai HUANG, graduate students Kanji KANEKO (at the time) and Ryotaro YONEYAMA (at the time), together with Specially Appointed Assistant Professor Tomoya MARUYAMA from the Research Center for Autonomous Systems Materialogy (ASMat), Institute of Integrated Research (IIR), Institute of Science Tokyo, and Professor Masahiro TAKINOUE from the Laboratory for Chemistry and Life Science, Institute of Integrated Research, Institute of Science Tokyo, has developed a novel and highly accessible technology for producing uniform Biomolecular Condensates using a simple, low-cost vibration platform.

This method builds upon the unique vibration control technology originally pioneered by Professor HAYAKAWA. It eliminates the need for expensive equipment or complex microfluidic circuits. By utilizing simple mechanical vibration, it achieves precise control over condensate formation within a single aqueous phase similar to the cellular environment, establishing a highly versatile technology.

The research group's novel study employs the Vibration-Induced Local Vortex (VILV) platform. This technology bypasses complex microfluidic pumping systems by employing stable micro-vortex arrays within a simple open device featuring a micropillar array. This is achieved using a standard piezoelectric vibrator. These vortices function as molecular traps, inducing uniform condensation by capturing and concentrating DNA molecules at their central regions. This approach enables condensation control within a single aqueous phase, preserving the activity of sensitive biomolecular components. The team successfully constructed highly uniform DNA condensates and demonstrated precise regulation of their stability through a low-frequency ""maintenance mode.""

Furthermore, the team successfully demonstrated the formation of complex patchy DNA condensate structures, highlighting the platform's capability to construct spatially organized biomaterials. Beyond this specific application, the versatility of the VILV platform is expected to contribute significantly to the fields of bottom-up synthetic biology and the fundamental study of cellular phase separation. We anticipate that this simple and accessible technology will be widely utilized as a standard tool for developing functional artificial cells and novel smart materials.

This research achievement was published in the online edition of the international academic journal Materials Horizons by the Royal Society of Chemistry on November 25, 2025 (UK time).

University of Arizona researchers in the Gutruf Lab have developed a comfortable, easy-to-use wearable device that incorporates artificial intelligence to detect subtle warning signs of frailty, signifying a leap forward in elderly care.

The current model of care is lagging behind. Right now, we often wait for a fall or hospitalization before we assess a patient for frailty. We wanted to shift the paradigm from reactive to preventative.""

Philipp Gutruf, associate department head of biomedical engineering and senior author on the study

The project study, published in Nature Communications on Dec. 20, introduces a soft mesh sleeve worn around the lower thigh that monitors and analyzes leg acceleration, symmetry and step variability.

Frailty, which indicates greater susceptibility to falls, disabilities and hospitalization, affects 15% of U.S. residents 65 and older, according to a 2015 study in the Journals of Gerontology. 

""This device allows clinicians to intervene early, potentially preventing costly and dangerous outcomes,"" said Gutruf.

The associate professor has spent the last seven years at the U of A developing technology that monitors biomarkers. His lab published a study in May on an adhesive-free wearable that measures water vapor and skin gases to track signs of stress.

Adapting and expanding on that technology, the approximately two-inch-wide, 3D-printed sleeve lined with tiny sensors is ""designed to be invisible,"" said Gutruf.

The sleeve simultaneously records and analyzes motion of the wearer and produces an AI analysis. With the device sending just the results, not the actual hundreds of hours of recorded data, transmission is reduced by 99% and the need for high-speed internet is eliminated. Results are transferred via Bluetooth to a smart device. And long-range wireless charging capabilities free the user from plugging in the device or swapping out a battery.

""Continuous, high-fidelity monitoring creates massive datasets that would normally drain a battery in hours and require a heavy internet connection to upload. We solved this with Edge AI,"" said Kevin Kasper, lead study author and biomedical engineering doctoral candidate.

The AI-enabled technology is ""an ideal solution for remote patient monitoring in rural or under-resourced communities,"" he added.

""We are effectively putting a lab on the patient, no matter where they live.""

After traumatic brain injury (TBI), some patients may recover completely, while others retain severe disabilities. Accurately evaluating prognosis is challenging in patients on life-sustaining thery. Though resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) can assess neurological activity shortly after brain injury, it is unknown whether communication across brain regions at this early juncture predicts long-term recovery. Investigators from Mass General Brigham and collaborators in the U.S. and Europe analyzed data from three prospective cohorts comprising 97 patients who underwent rs-fMRI after injury, finding that early communication between three pairs of brain regions is associated with favorable six-month functional outcomes. Findings are published in PNAS.

Using brain scans, we identified signature patterns of recovery after moderate or severe TBI. These findings open new avenues for prognostic assessment in TBI, and emerging evidence suggests these patterns may be modifiable, raising the possibility of future therapeutic application.""

Sam Snider, MD, lead author of the Division of Neurocritical Care and the Department of Neurology, Mass General Brigham

Researchers investigated a special kind of brain activity known as ""anticorrelated"" brain activity, which is a hallmark of normal brain function. This means that when one brain region become active, a separate region deactivates.

The researchers analyzed brain scans (resting-state fMRI) from half of the participants with TBI, identifying two patterns in which different brain regions worked in opposite ways and a third in which regions worked together. People with any of the three patterns were more likely to have better outcomes, even after adjusting for factors like sedation and consciousness level. The researchers incorporated their findings into a model to predict outcomes after TBI. They tested the new method in the other half of the participants. This model did a better job of predicting recovery than older prediction models.

One pattern that strongly predicted positive outcomes involved parts of the salience network, a coordination ""hub"" for many brain networks, and the default mode network (DMN), which is active during rest. Together, these regions mediate conscious access to incoming information. Another pattern included regions involved in cognitive control and basic visual processing. Connectivity between the DMN and language network also helped predict outcomes.

Importantly, findings were consistent across patients with injuries of varying severity, treated in multiple hospitals with different MRI scanners in different countries. Future studies may explore the extent that these neurological connections are essential to recovery and their ability to guide prognostic decision-making after TBI.

A transfer into the domestic league is rumored for one of the USWNT's biggest stars

The recent trend in USWNT player transfers has been that of stars moving away from the domestic league to play in Europe. Clubs across the pond have drawn players with the ability to pay higher salaries and higher competition in the Champions League. However, a big name is now drawing interest from NWSL teams as Catarina Macario's contract with Chelsea is set to expire.

According to ESPN, Macario is set to be a free agent at the end of the 2025-2026 season and can sign a pre-contract with clubs beginning on January 1, 2026. However, it seems that in order to come stateside the league would need to adopt rules that would allow teams to pay a single “High Impact Player” (HIP) a salary that would push past the salary cap by $1 million.

Macario has been a key player for the national team when healthy but she has dealt with significant injuries in the years since joining the USWNT. In the recent friendlies against Italy, the forward scored three goals in two matches. So far this year for Chelsea, she has played just over 600 minutes with two goals and two assists across all competitions.

She could be the next USWNT striker.

The National Women's Soccer League wrapped up the 2025 season, the 13th year for the top-division competition in the United States pyramid. As expected, the majority of the United States Women's National Team is developed domestically, with standout performances and consistent contributions leading to call-ups. Breakout rookie Riley Tiernan could be in Emma Hayes' future plans, with her goal-scoring prowess on display during the initial months of the schedule. The 22-year-old Angel City FC striker can finish clinically in a variety of ways and should continue to improve as a professional.

Raised in Voorhees, New Jersey, Tiernan was a four-year starter at Eastern Regional High School and contributed 85 goals and 85 assists in her career, winning the 2018 Group IV state title. At the club level, she competed with Players Development Academy and claimed the 2018 NPL National Championship. Her lengthy list of personal accolades includes but is not limited to three-time All-South Jersey, four-time All-State, two-time Regional All-American, 2020 United Soccer Coaches All-American, and All-American Game participant.

“She wants to be the best player on the field all the time, but she also knows for that to happen she needs the team to be successful too,” said Eastern head coach Jamie McGroarty in 2020. “And that's the main goal, she always wants to win. A lot of kids with her ability are only concerned with stats, she just wants to win. She's kinda like Wayne Gretzky, where you never see her get hit. She's so deceptive with the ball and has that innate ability to get around people with little fakes.”

After verbally committing in the eighth grade, Tiernan matriculated to Rutgers University and started in all 25 matches as a freshman, contributing eight goals and 13 assists during the run to the College Cup semifinals while being named All-Big Ten First Team, Big Ten Freshman of the Year, and All-North Region First Team. Her sophomore season included four goals and six assists in 20 appearances, followed by three goals and four assists in 20 fixtures as a junior. Her time on the banks of the Raritan River concluded with four goals and 11 assists in 18 contests, ending her Scarlet Knights career as the program's all-time assist leader.

Last winter, Tiernan trained with Angel City FC as a non-roster trialist and impressed during the preseason with her “performance, attitude, and relentless work ethic,” getting signed to a two-year contract with a club option for an additional season. Grabbing an immediate spot, she started and played 90 minutes in the opener and proceeded to go on a torrid run of form, racking up eight goals and one assist in 26 appearances. The league twice named her the Rookie of the Month and selected her to the Team of the Month for May. Unfortunately, the forward saw her production slump toward the end of the schedule (coinciding with a poor run of form as her team missed out on a playoff spot) but was still nominated for Rookie of the Year.

“I was definitely not expecting to have a season like this,” Tiernan shared on the BFFR podcast. “I've always been a very confident player, and I consider myself a confident person throughout any challenges I may face, and I think that's really important… For me to be starting and playing games, it was not something that I was expecting at all. I think it was nerve-wracking and a new entire environment for me to be in. I did not see any of this coming at all.”

At the international level, Tiernan trained with the United States Under-20 Women's National Team in December of 2021. She was named to the roster for the Under-23 squad's pair of friendlies against Germany last summer; her debut came in the opening 2-1 victory, a 27-minute appearance. The program included her for the subsequent camp from June 23rd through July 2nd in Commerce City, Colorado, that briefly ran alongside the senior group, followed by sessions in October and November. Hayes noted her improvement “in the right direction” and praised a “great year,” with further experience bridging the “massive” gap to the senior group.

Standing at five feet, eight inches tall, Tiernan is a rangy and “absolutely fearless” forward with a “high-motor, hard-working mentality that accompanies her technical skills.” She is a tireless, “relentless” counter-presser who is “always moving” with a high “soccer IQ” and a “strong, overwhelming presence,” capable of serving as a target player, “holding the ball off, making runs in behind, and [operating] in small spaces.” There is an improvised freedom to her game, using her athleticism, dribbling, and unpredictable choices to beguile opposing defenders and goalkeepers, paired with an unselfish nature and willingness to do the dirty job of angled runs and physical battles that open space for teammates.

“Tiernan is a giver of gifts; a capable distributor from the forward positions,” reads a report on Observation Station. “She has both the vision and technique to play incisive, dangerous passes. She also has a very strong tendency to float out wide and take people on, which has helped her create dangerous opportunities for teammates... [She has the] ability to ride challenges and twist up defenders on the wings. Considering how active she is as a crosser, her low assist count is disappointing on its face, but her crossing does create box chaos which can lead to goals… Her fake shot/chop move just appears to be unstoppable at this level, and it helps her quickly create separation on the ball to create passing and crossing windows... She is good at quickly beating defenders to get into a position to receive a ball, and then backing into them, bracing well for contact to prevent them from interrupting her first touch.”

Tiernan had a strong start to her professional career, but her production dropped as Angel City struggled to maintain momentum during the 2025 season. She has the talent to compete and, with improved consistency, should earn an invitation to a future USWNT camp. There are limited chances to enter the depth chart with the World Cup and Olympics coming fast, but at the age of 22, the forward has several future cycles during which to make her mark.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","NWSL OKs 'Rodman rule' even as union objects","https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/47399385/nwsl-implements-new-rodman-rule-star-players","Tue, 23 Dec 2025 16:27:00 GMT","

The NWSL on Tuesday implemented a ""High Impact Player"" rule (HIP), which would allow teams in 2026 to spend up to $1 million outside of the salary cap on star players, like Washington Spirit's Trinity Rodman, who meet certain criteria.

The news came minutes before the NWSL Players Association voiced their opposition, issuing a statement saying they would now take action to ""to enforce the rights of the Players we represent.""

In Tuesday's statement, the union said: ""The NWSL Players Association opposes the League's decision to move forward without bargaining over the High Impact Player Rule.

""Under federal labor law, changes to compensation under the salary cap are a mandatory subject of bargaining -- not a matter of unilateral discretion. Fair pay is realized through fair, collectively bargained compensation systems, not arbitrary classifications.

""A league that truly believes in the value of its Players would not be afraid to bargain over it.

""The NWSLPA has put forward a clear, lawful alternative: raising the Team Salary Cap to compete in a global labor market.

""Additionally, we have proposed that through collective bargaining, we work together to create a system for projecting revenue sharing numbers in future years so that Teams and Players can negotiate multi-year deals with certainty. The Union remains ready and willing to engage in good-faith bargaining.""

Earlier this week, NWSLPA executive director Meghann Burke told ESPN that the creation of any such rule requires collective bargaining and that the union opposed it.

""Our position is actually that this exceeds the scope of the league's authority,"" Burke told Abby Wambach and Julie Foudy on their Welcome to the Party podcast. ""Our position is that they must bargain with us over this kind of proposal, not that they merely consult with us.""

Burke told ESPN: ""The league is trying to control and interfere by trying to dictate which players get paid what with this pot of funds. Our position is that teams -- GMs, soccer ops, business folks at the team level -- are uniquely positioned to make judgment calls about how to structure their rosters, how to negotiate deals.

The league said on Wednesday that under the new rule, each club may exceed the league's established salary cap by up to $1m for high impact players beginning in 2026.

The NWSLPA had proposed that the NWSL raise the salary cap by $1m beginning in 2026, which is the same amount of money that the league has now cleared for each team to spend through the HIP rule.

The league said on Wednesday that the threshold will increase year-over-year at the same base rate as the salary cap. The additional allotment may be applied to a single player or distributed among multiple players, providing clubs with meaningful flexibility to recruit and retain high impact talent while preserving competitive balance. For any contract using this provision, the cap charge of the high-impact player must be a minimum of 12% of the base salary cap.

The league called the new measure a ""historic increase in league investment"" in a news release, noting that it will increase league-wide player spending by up to $16m and a total potential investment of up to $115m over the term of the current CBA.

""Ensuring our teams can compete for the best players in the world is critical to the continued growth of our league,"" NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman said in a news release. ""The High Impact Player Rule allows teams to invest strategically in top talent, strengthens our ability to retain star players, and demonstrates our commitment to building world-class rosters for fans across the league.""

The league said that teams would be able to sign players under the rule ""immediately, provided the contract terms do not require the team to utilize the rule until the effective date.""

The rule was implemented in the wake of the contract impasse involving Rodman, as well as the departures of United States women's national team stars Alyssa Thompson and Naomi Girma earlier this year. Both Thompson and Girma left for transfers of over $1m to join English side Chelsea.

In Rodman's case, her contract expires at the end of December, meaning she could sign elsewhere without the Spirit receiving any compensation.

The NWSLPA recently rejected a proposed contract between the Spirit and Rodman, alleging that the deal violated the ""spirit"" of the rules and accusing Rodman of preemptive ""salary cap circumvention.""

The NWSL Players Association then filed a grievance on behalf of Rodman against the league on Dec. 3. In the grievance, the PA said that the contract was legal and that the league's veto of the deal violated at least five points of the collective bargaining agreement. It is unclear the extent to which the NWSL Players Association is on board with the NWSL's latest announcement.

In Wednesday's news release, the NWSL said that per the terms of the current Collective Bargaining Agreement, the league had ""exercised its discretion"" to implement the new rule following ""consultation"" with the NWSLPA.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

This is Legacy, GOAL's feature and podcast series following the road to the 2026 World Cup. Every week, we dive into the stories and the legacies that shaped football's greatest nations. This time it's a look at Italy's long and painful fall from grace. From Berlin 2006 to the heartbreaks that followed, this is the story of a four-time world champion lost in footballing exile.

It has been more than 11 years since Diego Godín's header in Brazil which knocked the Italian national team, coached by Cesare Prandelli, out of the World Cup at the group stages. In that moment, few - perhaps no one - could have imagined that over a decade later it would remain the last image of four-time champions Italy on football's grandest stage.

In those 11 years, the Azzurri touched what many believed would be the lowest point in their history, failing in 2017 — for the first time in 59 years — to qualify for the World Cup finals after losing a two-legged playoff against Sweden. Remarkably, they managed to sink even lower five years later, when the modest North Macedonia blocked their path to Qatar.

The possibility of missing the 2026 World Cup has once again evoked dark ghosts, with the prospect of a third consecutive absence still very much in play. The paradox is that, between these two darkest moments in Italian football, the team led by Roberto Mancini in 2021 managed to win a European title that had been missing since 1968, snatching it in an epic final decided by penalties against hosts England.

What should have been a new beginning - the start of a reborn, modern Azzurri - was soon downgraded to the most classic of exceptions: The rule-confirming anomaly. Because even after the sudden end of Mancini's cycle, which came like a bolt from the blue in August 2023, not even one of Italy's best coaches of the past 20 years, Luciano Spalletti, could lift the national team from its decline.

First came a premature elimination from Euro 2024, knocked out in the round of 16 by Switzerland, leaving a dreadful image of the team's play. Then, an exit in the quarter-finals of the Nations League, setting the stage for a disastrous start to the next World Cup qualifying campaign - a heavy 3-0 loss in Norway and a narrow win over Moldova - that led to Spalletti's dismissal and left his successor, Rino Gattuso, with an almost impossible task of qualifying without the need for the play-offs.

Can all of this be explained simply by listing a sequence of bad results? Is that really enough to understand how a nation that has always been a point of reference in world football risks once again missing out on the World Cup stage, postponing its return until 2030 while extending its absence to sixteen years?

No. The reasons for this long crisis, perhaps the deepest Italy has ever faced, even worse than the dark years of 1954, 1962 and 1966, or the non-qualification of 1958, are multiple and profound. They are rooted in structural weaknesses, in the inability to adapt to the changes that have transformed football both tactically and physically.

But even more gravely, Italy has abandoned its own capacity to identify and nurture talent, embracing management models that have clearly failed to deliver results.

The extraordinary victory of 2006 in Germany marked the culmination of a generation of extraordinary players - Gigi Buffon, Alessandro Nesta, Fabio Cannavaro, Andrea Pirlo, Francesco Totti, Alessandro Del Piero, to name the most iconic - who had come close to triumph in previous years.

At the same time, that penalty shootout win in Berlin over France also marked the twilight of a great era. After it, not only did the national team's results decline, but Italian clubs also stopped achieving major international success. Italy, which the following year celebrated glory in both the Champions League and Club World Cup via AC Milan, has not won either trophy since 2010, the year of Inter's glory.

That same period also brought the first major warning sign: The disastrous 2010 World Cup in South Africa, where the reigning champions, under Marcello Lippi, crashed out early. Since then, Serie A clubs have reached four Champions League finals (two for Juventus, two for Inter), two Europa League finals (one lost by Roma under José Mourinho in 2023 on penalties to Sevilla, and one won spectacularly by Atalanta in 2024), and three consecutive Conference League finals, with Roma's victory in the first edition in 2022 followed by Fiorentina's defeats in 2023 and 2024.

Beyond those, there have been very few prestigious results, and there is a sense that the gap to Europe's elite has not just widened since the golden era of the 1990s and early 2000s, but that the balance of power has actually been reversed.

A comparison with the Premier League is now almost impossible. England's top-flight has created an unbridgeable gulf, being the first to grasp the Copernican revolution brought by the influx of billions from television networks and global investors. Clubs were forced to reinvent themselves, no longer as sporting associations, but as real entertainment businesses, capable of attracting capital from every corner of the world. They invested first in modern stadiums, designed to generate new revenue streams (merchandising, restaurants, shops, events), and then in acquiring the best players and managers available.

In Italy, however, the flood of money from television rights - first in lira, then in euros - instead fuelled a vicious cycle, as clubs focused on short-term spending to maintain appearances, rather than building a sustainable future. They ignored the ageing infrastructure, failing to modernise stadiums that were becoming increasingly outdated and unattractive, even for foreign fans who now represent a growing market. And they stopped investing in youth development, the very foundation of Italy's footballing future - and by extension, the national team's.

The sudden arrival of vast sums of money in the early 1990s coincided with another historic shift: The Bosman ruling of 1996. It triggered an uncontrolled pursuit of foreign stars - or presumed ones - in the hope of increasing competitiveness. But it deeply changed the fabric of Italian football. Entire academy teams, once known for producing homegrown talent, became filled with young players from every corner of the world, often chosen for economic convenience rather than merit. Youth coaches, under pressure to win and climb the career ladder, abandoned the mission of developing good players (and people) through sport.

This is one of the main reasons for the crisis of the past two decades, and especially of the last 11 years, the time between Italy's last two World Cup appearances. How is it possible that a country which, in every post-war era, has produced players of the highest calibre now struggles to assemble a truly competitive national team - and, compared to many other nations, has so few internationally sought-after talents?

Only in recent years have Italian leagues showcased players like Marco Verratti, Gianluigi Donnarumma, Riccardo Calafiori, Guglielmo Vicario, Sandro Tonali, Destiny Udogie, and more recently Federico Chiesa, Giacomo Raspadori, Matteo Ruggeri and Giovanni Leoni, who have sought success abroad. Previously, high domestic wages and a certain reluctance among Italian players to challenge themselves overseas kept most at home, apart from a few exceptions, such as Gianluca Vialli, Paolo Di Canio, Gianfranco Zola in England, or Christian Vieri in Spain.

It is no coincidence that Italy's last major triumph, at Euro 2020, was built around a handful of players who had grown and matured abroad, such as Donnarumma, Jorginho and Verratti, whose experiences outside Serie A allowed them to raise their game.

Today, as Italy aims to return to the World Cup after years of absence, it again places its hopes in players of higher international standing: Donnarumma, now at Manchester City after his European successes with Paris Saint-Germain; Calafiori of Arsenal; Tonali, the midfield anchor at Newcastle; and Moise Kean, who after difficult stints with PSG and Everton, has found a home at Fiorentina.

All good or even very good players, but apart from Donnarumma, few could truly be called champions. Those once abundant in Serie A, and therefore in the Azzurri, are now an endangered species.

Of the current crop, It is difficult to find - apart from Donnarumma - a single player capable of establishing himself as a starter in one of Europe's top clubs. This lack of quality reflects a system that is unable to keep up with the times; a football culture that has failed to place pure talent at the centre of its thinking or to show courage in trusting its young players.

Many, despite promising careers in club academies and youth national teams, end up in Serie B or Serie C just to find minutes, or move abroad for experience. That was the path of Francesco Pio Esposito, now Inter's new striker, who impressed on loan at Spezia last season, earning himself a place in the senior squad before scoring his first goal for Italy against Estonia. A 2005-born forward already drawing heavy comparisons to past Azzurri greats like Vieri and Luca Toni but who remains an exception, not a trend, in a football culture that still sees youth as a weakness.

Another is Giovanni Leoni, Italy's new defensive hope. Before suffering a serious injury on his debut for Liverpool in the Carabao Cup, he had impressed with Parma and sparked a bidding war between Inter and Milan. Born in 2006, his £30 million transfer to Liverpool would be considered normal in the Premier League, but almost reckless for a Serie A club.

Alongside them stands Francesco Camarda, the youngest debutant in Serie A history having had his development accelerated by Milan during one of the Rossoneri's toughest periods. Guided by Zlatan Ibrahimović, Camarda is now out on loan at Lecce, seeking experience in a more modest environment. After shining with Italy's Under-17 European champions in 2024, his goal is to return to Milan and become an option for the national team, perhaps by Euro 2028 or the 2030 World Cup, rather than next summer's tournament in Canada, Mexico and the United States.

Esposito, Leoni and Camarda; three faces of Italy's footballing future, but also talents who carry a broader challenge: Reigniting passion among a new generation of fans.

That is because another worrying trend has emerged in the decline of the number of young Italians who are choosing football as their sport. The rise of new national heroes in other disciplines has shifted attention, with Jannik Sinner and Matteo Berrettini leading lights in the world of tennis, Sofia Goggia and Federica Brignone in skiing, and the resurgence of Italy's volleyball teams.

In this context, full of contradictions and difficulties, national team coach Gattuso has had to live under immense pressure. Another failure would represent the final blow to a political and managerial system that, in recent years, has produced disappointing results, very few structural reforms, and now risks part of its reputation on passing a long-promised law on stadiums — a reform crucial for modernising Italy's infrastructure ahead of Euro 2032, which they will co-host with Turkey. The long and exhausting saga surrounding the new San Siro in Milan, and the stadium projects in Bologna, Florence, Rome and Naples, have become almost as vital as avoiding a third consecutive failure to qualify for the World Cup.

The moment of truth for Italian football is now.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

World Cup Fan Fests will feature 'Freedom' trailer-trucks Jason Smith / Getty Images

A White House task force facilitated a proposal for World Cup host cities in the United States to house vast ‘Freedom' trailer-trucks with United States flags at official Fan Festivals in celebration of the country's 250th anniversary.

The Trump administration established the ‘FIFA World Cup 2026 Task Force' in March. It is chaired by U.S. President Donald Trump and vice-chaired by his vice-president, J.D. Vance. Trump appointed Andrew Giuliani, the son of former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, to run its day-to-day operations as executive director. The task force's primary role is to lead and coordinate federal efforts in support of the tournament, notably across safety and security concerns.

The task force holds regular weekly calls with the 11 American host city committees, which are effectively subsidiaries of FIFA's U.S. operations. At one recent meeting, the task force invited a pitch from organizers of America's 250th birthday celebrations, which falls on July 4, 2026, at the start of the World Cup's round of 16. The ‘Freedom' trucks were proposed to the host cities as a way to align the World Cup with America's Semiquincentennial, marking 250 years since the Declaration of Independence was signed.

Major FIFA Fan Fests have already been announced by several host cities across the United States, such as Liberty State Park in Jersey City, and a 25,000-person capacity Fan Fest at the National WW1 Museum and Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri. Others, such as the San Francisco Bay Area, are considering a reduced slate of Fan Fests amid the major financial burden FIFA has transferred onto cities.

Since his January inauguration, Trump has taken several steps to ramp up celebrations for ‘America 250.' This included the establishment of the White House Task Force 250, which is also chaired by President Trump and includes representation from cabinet members. This month, Trump launched Freedom 250. He further announced that between June 25 and July 10, the U.S. will hold a Great American State Fair on the National Mall, “celebrating America's exceptional history and culture.”

He also announced a national prayer event, “to rededicate (America) as one nation under God”, as well as a UFC event at the White House and the inaugural Patriot Games — a four-day athletic event involving one male and one female high school athlete from each U.S. state and territory. The Freedom 250 organization is described on its website as “the national, non-partisan organization leading the celebration of America's 250th birthday” — it says it is the official public-private partnership to amplify presidential moments of the anniversary year.

Previously, another organization, named America250, was created by Congress in 2016, charged with organizing the national commemoration, and this has bipartisan representation from Congress, as well as honorary presidency positions for former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, and First Ladies Michelle Obama and Laura Bush. However, the New York Times has reported that the organization has taken on a “different direction” since Trump returned to the White House. The Atlantic reported that America250 had launched a partnership with Moms For Liberty, a conservative group, while also securing sponsorships with companies such as Palantir, UFC, Coinbase and Oracle, whose executives have financially supported Trump.

On the call with host city executives, it was explained that the large trailer trucks will be touring the United States in 2026, adorned with U.S. flags and the word Freedom. According to four people with knowledge of the call, all of whom wished to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, these were described as mobile museum freedom trucks and airstream trailers, which would tell the story of America's history and independence. Two people said they expected the trucks to be 18-wheelers, but the size was not confirmed by the task force.

In September, the Institute of Museum and Library Services announced it had awarded America250, the organization established in 2016, six mobile “Freedom Trucks” to share the story of the nation's founding, which it said directly supported Trump's presidential executive order, “Celebrating America's 250th Birthday.” The director of the Institute of Museum and Library Services also has a seat on Trump's White House Task Force for America 250.

The news release added: “At a time when 64 percent of Americans cannot pass the citizenship test, these key exhibits aim to make our nation's history more accessible and reinforce patriotism among Americans of all ages.”

The World Cup task force declined to comment, but senior sources with knowledge of the presentation confirmed the offer was true, while saying it is an offering rather than an obligation for host cities. Other offers included the provision of U.S. swag and tourism guides. The task force did not confirm which specific 250-themed entity set out the offer at the World Cup meeting, but indicated there is internal government involvement, as well as public/private partnerships working across America 250 initiatives.

In a recent interview with The Athletic, Giuliani described the World Cup as “an incredible opportunity to show off” America's first 250 years.

He added: “President Trump, more than anything, represents the fact that, as Americans, we don't have to apologize anymore for whatever imperfections may exist in our country's history. We can look at the overall work of the last 250 years and what America has done for Western civilization, and truly celebrate that American greatness.”

White House spokesman Davis Ingle said the Trump Administration is “committed to working with and providing resources and opportunities with all of our partners, including the FIFA World Cup 2026, to deliver one of the most iconic sporting experiences in history for Americans and the world to enjoy.”

FIFA declined to comment, referring questions to Giuliani's task force, while the America250 group that was launched nine years ago did not respond to outreach from The Athletic.

FIFA has already demonstrated willingness to promote Trump's agenda, most famously when awarding the U.S. president its inaugural Peace Prize this month. FIFA president Gianni Infantino attended Trump's pre-inauguration rally and his inauguration, as well as joining the U.S. president on visits to Qatar and Saudi Arabia in May.

Some World Cup host city executives, however, told The Athletic they were unsure whether ‘Freedom' trucks would be relevant or appropriate at Fan Fests during a global soccer tournament, indicating they may not take up the offer.

They also have an awareness that the word “freedom” has come to be interpreted in differing ways across the United States, according to one's political leanings. The non-profit group Turning Point USA, co-founded by Charlie Kirk, has the mission, according to its website, of building the most organized, active, and powerful conservative grassroots activist network on high school and college campuses across the country. Turning Point sells merchandise, including T-shirts, hoodies, baseball caps and flags, with the word ‘Freedom.' But the group's view of what constitutes ‘freedom' has sometimes contrasted with the interpretation of liberals, or left-leaning groupings.

Michele Goodwin, a professor at Georgetown University Law Centre, explains the nuance: “History and origin stories are critically important. We must learn exactly who are the people that make up the space that is the United States. The challenge we've had in the United States is, ‘Who gets to tell the story?' Whoever gets to tell the story dominates a narrative and there are very different narratives.

“There can be a narrative that excludes indigenous people or paints indigenous people as savage. That was the framework for centuries in the United States, that indigenous people were scalpers, that they were people who wanted to do harm to white Europeans and then had to be moved off to reservations. That's one version of a story.

“Another version of a story is that the lands were occupied for thousands of years, and the indigenous people were marched off their lands. There's the retelling of American enslavement, where there were boys, girls, babies, men and women being regularly sold by people.

The second largest auction block in the United States was where Wall Street is today. Is that part of the freedom story? Which stories will be told? Is it all of the stories, or is it some stories included and other stories being left out? Who is curating the story makes a difference.”

Now that the World Cup draw and schedule have been confirmed, qualified nations are figuring out where exactly they should base themselves for a tournament that spans three countries and several time zones.

The good news is that FIFA has, to a certain extent, clustered group stage matches within regions of North America, but that does not discount a vast amount of travel for many teams. England, for example, will begin against Croatia in Dallas before heading to Boston and New Jersey to face Ghana and Panama. England's logistics team had been very keen on basing the squad in Kansas City during the tournament due to its central location and the qualities of Sporting Kansas City's facilities.

But nations must follow FIFA's process to secure their favored base. FIFA has published a brochure, available to peruse on its website, in which national teams' executives can study training base options, as well as nearby hotels across North America. They can filter their hotel search to find golf hotels, beach hotels, countryside hotels, business hotels, resorts or suburban options, as well as filtering for the hotels that include pools, spas, tennis courts, gyms and walking trails.

They can also narrow their searches to find the travel time from training bases to hotels, and from airports to hotels. The nations' decision-makers can also look at venues outside the brochure. Brazil, for example, have looked closely at the New York Red Bulls' training facility.

However, even if a national federation has a preference, it is not guaranteed to receive its first choice. Various criteria will be applied. If a nation has two games, compared to one game, located close to the training site, then this team will be given preference.

If multiple teams have requested the same base as their first choice, then preference will be given based on a team's world ranking, with the higher-ranked nation earning the place. That is according to Giuliani, the World Cup Task Force director, speaking recently to The Athletic, and confirmed by other sources who wished to remain anonymous as they were not authorized to speak on the matter. FIFA declined to comment.

Should England miss out on their preferred Kansas City base, they have previously looked at Charlotte FC's training base in North Carolina, while they are also assessing options in New York and New Jersey, where the FIFA brochure lists options including the Pingry School, Rutgers University, Stockton University and Columbia Park Training Facility.

Preparations are continuing across host cities for the anticipated footfall, global attention and associated security threats posed by the World Cup and this month, Los Angeles Police Department chief Jim McDonnell sounded a note of concern six months out from the tournament.

Los Angeles will host eight matches at the World Cup, including two group-stage games at SoFi Stadium for the USMNT, and two games involving Iran, all of which are likely to require enhanced security provisions. Los Angeles has seen protests against the U.S. government following raids by immigration and customs enforcement officials, while President Trump also sent in the National Guard.

City Council members, including Katy Yaroslavsky, have warned their responsibility is to keep Los Angeles “solvent” as well as safe. In response to a recent request from Mayor Karen Bass to increase funding by $4.4m to employ a further 410 officers by July, she told LAist:“I want to grow the police department, but I have yet to see a proposal that identifies an ongoing funding source to pay for more officers.” The City Council then approved $1.8million to fund training from January for up to 40 new LAPD officers.

Asked if the City Council is doing enough to prepare his police force, the police chief told the Snapchat political show Good Luck America: “Absolutely not. When we're fully deployed at 10,000 officers, we have half the officer-to-population ratio as New York and less than half of what Chicago deploys per capita. We're a very lean organization to begin with. We're down 1,400 officers. I was given budget approval to hire 240 new officers this year. We have done that. But even at that, this year, I'm going to lose 500-600 officers due to attrition, retirement or other reasons.

“Even if we were to get what we're asking for, we're still probably negative 150-200 two and a half years out from the Olympics. That is not the place any city would want to find themselves. But moving forward, my hope is that the City Council takes a fresh look at this issue and realize that the eyes of the world are going to be on Los Angeles several months from now with the World Cup, but the largest Olympics in history will be here. It is a tremendous opportunity for Los Angeles to be able to showcase what we have. But if you if you don't do it appropriately, then it could be a different outcome.”

Gov. Dan McKee, Bryant University President Ross Gittell, Bryant University Vice President of Athletics and Recreation Bill Smith, and General Treasurer James Diossa performed an exchange of Bryant and Ocean State 2026 soccer jerseys at the press conference on Oct. 31.

SMITHFIELD – After hosting Rhode Island's newest sports team, the Rhode Island Football Club, for its inaugural season, Bryant University will be a base camp for the FIFA World Cup 26 in June.

The announcement was made in late October, with fans waiting to see the bracket of teams that will be playing at Gillette Stadium. So far, England, France, Brazil, Morocco, Scotland, Haiti, Ghana, and Norway will be among the teams potentially using Bryant's stadium for a team base camp next year.

Currently, Boston is set to host seven matches through June and July.

“Bryant's recognition by FIFA World Cup ‘26 affirms the foresight of our investment in best-in-class facilities across our campus,” said Bryant President Ross Gittell.

Gittell emphasized the recent opening of Bryant's 43,000-square-foot field house this fall, with state-of-the-art spaces for training, recovery, and wellness.

“Our goal has always been to create resources that strengthen academics and the student experience, leading to top 1 percent outcomes for graduates. FIFA's recognition of our modern campus facilities underscores both their quality and their broader global appeal,” he said.

There are more than 60 potential sites mapped out for the FIFA World Cup tournament next year. All sites must meet FIFA World Cup standards, including level grass pitches with a certain blade height for specific grasses, adequate lighting, ample security and extensive training facilities.

Bryant University is partnering with The Graduate by Hilton Providence and is the only New England site included for consideration.

If selected by a national team, a select group of student-athletes will be invited to train on a community day at Bryant University.

Town Council President John Tassoni said the town is looking forward to hosting athletes from other nations.

“We will continue to be respectful, discreet, and professional as we interface with the team in the hopes that our site will be selected. With the honor comes the opportunity for some of our youth soccer players to train with these athletes,” he said.

a Global Moment

The countdown to the 2026 FIFA World Cup is about to feel very real. The group draw always sparks debate and daydreams, but the moment when the tournament truly snaps into focus is the release of the official match schedule. That is when the World Cup stops being an idea and becomes a plan. 

This edition is already historic by design. Forty-eight national teams. One hundred and four matches. Three host countries sharing the stage. Bigger is the headline everyone knows. More demanding is the part that makes this tournament fascinating.

FIFA unveiled the official match schedule during a global broadcast available on FIFA.com, FIFA+, and FIFA's official television and digital platforms, supported by authorized broadcasters around the world. This is not a quiet upload or a press release buried online. It is a shared moment, designed for fans everywhere to experience at the same time.

That matters because soccer is emotional synchronization. Fans in different time zones will be watching together, refreshing feeds, sharing reactions, and immediately asking practical questions disguised as excitement. Can I get there? Can I take time off? Can I afford this? The schedule reveal is where hope meets logistics.

This broadcast is essentially the unofficial opening ceremony of the World Cup year.

A World Cup schedule may look like a spreadsheet, but it functions more like a heartbeat. For fans, this is the moment when imagination turns into commitment. Calendars get marked. Travel routes become real possibilities. Accommodations move from maybe later to book now. Viewing parties are planned. Entire summers are quietly reorganized around kick-off times.

For host cities across Mexico, the United States, and Canada, the schedule is the starting point for everything else. Transportation systems, security planning, volunteer coordination, hospitality staffing, and citywide events all orbit these dates. A World Cup match is not just ninety minutes on the pitch. It is a full-scale urban operation.

For national teams, the schedule becomes an early strategic document. Rest days matter. Travel distances matter. Climate differences matter. A short turnaround combined with a long flight can affect recovery, rotation, and preparation. The schedule shapes competitive balance long before tactics enter the conversation.

Once the schedule is public, fans immediately start reading between the lines. Which matches will be played at night? Which games will kick off early? Which group stage fixtures suddenly feel like must-watch television because of timing or location? 

The schedule allows fans to anticipate where intensity might peak and where surprises could quietly emerge. This is also where future classics begin to reveal themselves. A group stage match on paper might look routine until context turns it into something electric. The schedule gives us the emotional map of the tournament, highlighting not just where games will be played, but how they might feel.

Hosting the World Cup across three countries makes this edition unprecedented in scale and complexity. Different borders, climates, cultures, and fan traditions all have to fit into one coherent competition.

That is why the schedule reveal is not a formality. It is a carefully produced showcase designed to explain how matches are distributed to ensure fairness, manageable travel, and a smooth experience for players and fans alike. Balance is the invisible star of this World Cup.

The goal is not just to host more matches. It is to make the expanded format work without exhausting teams or overwhelming cities.

Lionel Messi's sister, Maria Sol, has reportedly been injured in a road traffic accident. The 32-year-old is said to be “out of danger”, as she begins her recovery, but has been left nursing broken bones and burns. Maria Sol had been due to marry a member of Inter Miami's coaching staff in the new year, but those January nuptials have been postponed indefinitely.

The Sun reports on news that has broken in Messi's native Argentina. TV journalist and presenter Angel de Brito claims to have been in contact with Messi's mother, who has delivered an update on her daughter.

It is said that Maria Sol, who was travelling through Miami, lost control of her vehicle and hit a wall. She was left with spinal fractures and burns, with immediate medical attention being required.

De Brito told American TV programme LAM, with messages being read from his mobile phone: “Messi's sister is okay, she's out of danger but I was checking things with the family because she was due to get married in Rosario in Argentina on January 3 and she's going to have to suspend it.

“She suffered burns and burns are very difficult to treat as well as displacement of vertebrae. She's already started her rehabilitation in Rosario.

“I asked her mum Celia Cuccittini because I'd received some information and she told me it's true but that Maria Sol is okay. She has two fractured vertebrae, a fractured heel and wrist. The wedding is going to be put back. Celia told me she fainted and hit a wall.”

Reports regarding Maria Sol's crash remain mixed, with it initially being suggested that she had come off the road while driving a pick-up truck. Following updates from her family, it is now being claimed that burns were suffered after falling from a motorbike. Neither story has been confirmed or denied as yet.

Maria Sol is set to tie the knot with Julian “Tuli” Arellano, a member of the backroom team at Inter Miami. He forms part of the Herons' U19 coaching set-up. They were due to walk down the aisle in Rosario on January 3.

Messi married childhood sweetheart Antonela Roccuzzo in their home city on June 30, 2017. The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner and his wife, alongside their three sons, had been due to attend Maria Sol's ceremony.

She met partner Julian when both were young - much like Messi and Antonela - as they grew up in the same neighbourhood. Maria Sol is a clothing designer and entrepreneur who has been able to steer clear of the limelight throughout her brother's iconic playing career. She lived in Spain before heading home to Argentina to work on professional projects.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","'He's the best ever!'","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/best-ever-pedri-playing-lionel-messi-again-barcelona-secret-visit-camp-nou/blt1084050b830de0db","Tue, 23 Dec 2025 15:55:50 GMT","

Barcelona midfielder Pedri is more than receptive to the idea of playing alongside Lionel Messi again in the future. The two were team-mates at Barca for the 2020-21 season before Messi's contract expired and couldn't be renewed due to financial restrictions, leaving on a free transfer for Paris Saint-Germain instead. Ever since his emotional departure, the Argentine has been linked with a return to Catalunya.

Nobody knew when Barcelona's 2020-21 campaign started that it would be the last that Messi would ever play for the club. Against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic with all matches played behind closed doors, Barca won the Copa del Rey but finished a disappointing third in La Liga, with Atletico Madrid claiming the title on the last day of the season. A PSG side led by Kylian Mbappe eliminated La Blaugrana from the Champions League at the last-16 stage. Even through this relevant disappointment, Messi still managed to register 38 goals and 14 assists in 47 games in all competitions.

That also proved to be Pedri's debut season for Barcelona following his €5 million (£4.3m/$5.9m) move from Las Palmas in the Canary Islands. Despite never playing in the Spanish top flight before, he proved to be an instant hit, featuring 52 times across all competitions.

Last month, Messi made an unannounced trip to see the newly-renovated Camp Nou. In an interview with Esquire, Pedri admitted even he was unaware that the Argentine was making the visit and admitted he would love to see the World Cup winner back in the red and blue of Barcelona.

When asked how he found out about Messi dropping by to Camp Nou, Pedri replied: ""Through social media, because it started popping up everywhere. It was hard not to see it. I wish we could have met up for a bit.

""Of course [he would like Messi back at Barcelona], without a doubt. He's the best ever, and he helped me a lot the year we were together.""

Despite Pedri's clear admiration for Messi, he did not list him when asked to name who he thinks the best players in the world at present are, instead opting for two Barcelona team-mates, two La Liga rivals and two stars from the Premier League.

""Mbappe, Lamine [Yamal], [Mohamed] Salah, [Erling] Haaland, Raphinha, and Julian Alvarez are the best in the world,"" was the Spaniard's response.

""I want to face all of them, except Lamine, who plays with us. Especially Haaland and Salah, because I haven't faced them yet.""

Pedri's Barcelona could yet play against Salah's Liverpool or Haaland's Manchester City during the knockout phases of this season's Champions League. He name-dropped the latter as a team who are strong contenders to be crowned kings of Europe.

""PSG, the current champions,"" Pedri added when discussing contenders to win the Champions League. ""Arsenal is also a very strong team. And I'd always include City and Real Madrid among the contenders. One team I see as strong, and that has pleasantly surprised me, is Sporting Lisbon.""

Barcelona head into the Spanish winter break sitting four points clear of Real Madrid atop La Liga's table and through to the last 16 of the Copa del Rey, while they will face Athletic Club in the semi-finals of the Supercopa de Espana in January. They are, however, down to 15th in the Champions League league phase standings.

Meanwhile, Messi has just won the MLS Cup in the USA with Inter Miami alongside fellow Barcelona alumni Luis Suarez, Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets. Now aged 38, he also made history by becoming the first player to ever win the MLS MVP award in back-to-back years. Though he has remained tight-lipped on a return, Barcelona presidential candidate Marc Ciria has vowed to do ""whatever it takes"" to bring the club legend home again.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Luis Enrique set to receive first-of-its-kind contract offer from PSG after capturing ninth trophy of remarkable reign at Parc des Princes","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/luis-enrique-set-to-receive-first-of-its-kind-contract-offer-from-psg/bltb352d596392a0805","Tue, 23 Dec 2025 13:59:32 GMT","

Paris Saint-Germain are reportedly weighing up an unprecedented contract proposal for Luis Enrique. Appointed in 2023 to replace Christophe Galtier, the Spaniard inherited a club long defined by domestic dominance but haunted by European frustration. Less than two years on, PSG are no longer chasing history; they are living it.

Under Luis Enrique's guidance, PSG lifted their first-ever Champions League trophy last season, finally removing the psychological barrier that had loomed over the club for more than a decade. It was a breakthrough that reshaped perceptions of Parisian football across Europe and cemented Luis Enrique's status as the architect of a new era. Across 143 matches in all competitions, Enrique has recorded 98 wins, 26 draws and just 19 defeats, a win percentage of 68.53 per cent. That level of consistency has translated into silverware, including an Intercontinental Cup triumph against Flamengo, coached by former Chelsea defender Filipe Luís, to cap a near-flawless 2025. The only blemish came last July, when Enzo Maresca's Chelsea denied PSG a clean sweep at the Club World Cup. Even that setback has done little to dull the sense that this is a team operating at the peak of its powers.

With Luis Enrique's current deal due to expire in 2027, PSG are already moving to secure his future. According to reports from Diario AS, the club are seriously exploring the idea of offering a so-called ""lifetime contract"", a concept that has never previously been seen at the elite level of European football. Senior figures within the club are understood to be thrilled with Luis Enrique's work and increasingly convinced that he should be the long-term steward of PSG's sporting vision. More than a coach, he is viewed as a cornerstone of the club's future identity, someone capable of sustaining success rather than merely delivering it in bursts.

That confidence was reinforced last weekend as PSG eased into the next round of the French Cup with a 4-0 win over fifth-tier side Vendee Fontenay Foot. Goals from Desire Doue and Ousmane Dembélé, alongside a brace from Gonçalo Ramos, ensured there were no surprises. Afterwards, Luis Enrique struck a tone that mixed satisfaction with professionalism.

He said: ""It is good to play in the Cup, in a stadium with this atmosphere. It was a celebration, and we played seriously. It is difficult when you play against a team of a very different level. There was a big difference, but I think we prepared the match well and the players played very well.""

Analysing the club's success in 2025, Luis Enrique added: ""It is historic for the club. Normally, reviews wait for the end of the season, since we are in the 2025-2026 season. This cannot be the time for a review, but if we think only about the calendar year of 2025, it is clear that it is historic for the club, for the Parisians. We are happy. But we are also happy for the Christmas holidays. It is good for us to have this recovery time. But after the holidays, we will be happy to return and think about what remains of the season.""

Crucially, Luis Enrique has found at PSG an environment perfectly suited to his footballing philosophy. Empowered by the club's hierarchy, he has instilled an uncompromising belief in hard work and collective responsibility, values that have not always been universally embraced in star-studded dressing rooms. The departure of Kylian Mbappe to Real Madrid proved a turning point. Freed from the gravitational pull of a single superstar, Luis Enrique discovered a balance that had eluded PSG in the 2024–25 season. The results since then have been emphatic.

His authority has been absolute. Luis Enrique has shown a willingness to bench any player, regardless of reputation, reinforcing the principle that no individual stands above the team. Some have thrived under that challenge. Dembélé, once questioned for his consistency, has flourished to such an extent that he has captured both the Ballon d'Or and The Best FIFA Men's Player award under Luis Enrique's guidance. Others have learned the lesson the hard way. Talents such as Bradley Barcola and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia now understand that selective effort leads only to the bench.

Despite the trophies, two major tests lie ahead. The first is securing Luis Enrique's long-term future and formalising the partnership PSG are keen to make permanent. The second is ensuring that key players, starting with Vitinha, continue to buy into the relentless pursuit of success. PSG know the task will not be straightforward. Sustained success attracts attention, and a club that has finally found the formula must now work to protect it by tying down their superstars to longer deals, so that they remain protected from potential suitors in the future.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Fulham defender Joachim Andersen suffered a gruesome injury during the Cottagers' Premier League clash with Nottingham Forest. The Denmark international tangled with Reds forward Igor Jesus during a top-flight contest at Craven Cottage. He was left sporting a nasty blow to his left hand, with one of his fingers having to be snapped back into place. WARNING: This article includes graphic images of an injury that some people may find disturbing.

Andersen lined up at the heart of Fulham's defence against Forest, with usual centre-half partner Calvin Bassey away on Africa Cup of Nations duty with Nigeria. He was able to keep a clean sheet in a 1-0 win.

The 29-year-old played through pain in order to complete 90 minutes. There were less than 24 on the clock when he was left wincing and in need of medical attention. He tangled with Brazilian striker Jesus and took a blow to his hand.

Television cameras showed how the ring finger on Andersen's left hand had been bent out of place. Jesus was apologetic, as he stood over the Fulham star while he was treated, with a fixture in west London being halted for several minutes.

Andersen was able to continue after seeing his broken digit realigned, with strapping being applied. He was only off the field for a matter of seconds, with no time being wasted in putting his body on the line.

Sky Sports commentator spoke of how Andersen was unable to look at his hand after realising what he had done. Ex-Chelsea and England goalkeeper Rob Green was on co-commentary duty and - having suffered plenty of hand injuries himself down the years - was able to feel the Fulham star's pain.

Andersen was taking in his 81st appearance for the Cottagers when helping them to a much-needed win. Mexico international striker Raul Jimenez netted the only goal of the game from the penalty spot.

He has matched Manchester City legend Yaya Toure as the only man in the Premier League era to successfully convert 11 spot-kicks - with there still no blots on his copybook from 12 yards.

Cottagers boss Marco Silva told reporters afterwards of seeing his side pull 10 points clear of the relegation zone: “The result, 100%, is a massive three points and a massive win. It wasn't our best performance, but I don't remember one chance for Forest all game. They had the possession but didn't create and we managed the game well. It was a professional performance from our team.”

He added on nerveless Jimenez being a guarantee of goals from the penalty spot: “He's reliable. The calmness, the quality, the braveness to wait until the last moment for the goalkeeper to move.”

Silva said that Wales international midfielder Harry Wilson “looks like he's going to be okay” after picking up a knock when putting in a tackle and being forced from the field with six minutes left on the clock.

With injuries being picked up and three players away at AFCON with Nigeria, Silva has admitted that he will be looking to dip into the January transfer market for new recruits. He has said: “We have been speaking not just now, the last month and a half, probably. After the last summer, things that we were supposed to do, we didn't.

“The African Cup we knew was going to happen, but of course the injury of Rodrigo as well created a completely different scenario for us. We know what we need. Let's see.”

Silva is only under contract until the end of the season, leading to questions of his own future. He added: “I think this (signing players) is not about the manager, because it's not what Marco Silva as a manager needs to improve or to strengthen the squad. It's what Fulham Football Club needs. If I'm not here speaking and if someone from the club is speaking, they are going to say the same.”

Fulham, with Andersen ready to strap his fingers up and go again, have three London derbies - against West Ham, Crystal Palace and Chelsea - to take in across their next four fixtures.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Cristiano Ronaldo would have bigger impact in MLS than 'very quiet' Lionel Messi, claims ex-Inter Miami & USMNT star","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/cristiano-ronaldo-bigger-impact-mls-very-quiet-lionel-messi-ex-inter-miami-usmnt-star/blt36acd080dd5ef70c","Tue, 23 Dec 2025 13:46:23 GMT","

Lionel Messi has been a sporting sensation in the United States, with the history books being rewritten by the Argentine at Inter Miami, but MLS has been told that Cristiano Ronaldo would have made an even greater impact than his “very quiet” eternal rival. Portuguese GOAT CR7 favoured a Saudi Arabian adventure over pursuit of the American dream.

A couple of all-time greats found themselves on the move in 2023. Ronaldo was a free agent at that point following his stunning release by Premier League giants Manchester United ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. He accepted a lucrative offer from Al-Nassr in the Middle East.

A matter of months later, Messi reached the end of his deal at Paris Saint-Germain. Rather than remain in Europe, or follow Ronaldo to the Saudi Pro League, the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner linked up with another former United No.7 in South Florida - Inter Miami co-owner, David Beckham.

Messi has savoured Leagues Cup and Supporters' Shield successes in the States, while MLS Cup glory was enjoyed in 2025. He has won the Golden Boot and back-to-back MVP awards, while agreeing a contract extension through 2028.

A-list guests continue to flock to Inter Miami fixtures, with ticket prices soaring when the Messi show is in town, but former Herons and USMNT star Brek Shea has told Jackpot City Casino of North American soccer missing a trick: “I think Cristiano Ronaldo would have had a bigger impact in MLS than Lionel Messi.

“No disrespect to Messi, but Messi seems like a homebody. He's very quiet. He doesn't speak the language quite well yet. So I just think Ronaldo seems more outgoing, does more things in the public eye.

“So I think just on that, speaking the language, doing interviews, I think would have just automatically had a bigger impact. I'm strictly speaking off field stuff. I don't know if he would have put up the same numbers, but a bigger impact? Yes, he would have.”

It has been suggested that Ronaldo and Messi could reunite in America, having previously competed on opposing sides of the fierce El Clasico divide with Real Madrid and Barcelona, respectively.

Ex-Manchester United coach Rene Meulensteen, who worked with CR7 at Old Trafford, has said: “Can you imagine having Messi and Ronaldo playing in the same team in Miami? It's a fantastic city. I think he would love to go there.

“On the contrary, it would be amazing to reignite the Messi and Ronaldo rivalry. Why not Los Angeles? I think Cristiano would probably move to LA because he'd be so close to Hollywood. That's probably his next destination.”

Ronaldo will be crossing the Atlantic next summer when gracing the 2026 World Cup, but will not be making an imminent move at club level as he is tied to terms at Al-Nassr through to 2027 and has already passed his 40th birthday.

Messi has more tales to tell in the States, after agreeing fresh terms, with Shea admitting it was imperative that MLS did not allow their star attraction to move on. He added: “I think from Miami's point of view, they could not let Lionel Messi go. Everywhere I've traveled, to Spain, to France, to South America, I see pink jerseys everywhere.

“It's actually insane how many Inter Miami jerseys there are everywhere you go, which is amazing for the league, and amazing for Inter Miami. Obviously, Messi probably knows that and has seen that before.

“But yeah, I didn't think he was going to be playing at this World Cup. It's truly astonishing to see Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi are still playing at this level for this long.

“I think Inter Miami personally needs him for their new stadium opening next year. I think they need that to kick it off for the first two seasons. So, good for them, good for the league. And Messi, keep doing your thing.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Captain, leader... legend? John Terry's most controversial Chelsea moments","https://www.goal.com/en-sa/lists/captain-leader-legend-john-terry-most-controversial-chelsea-moments/blta05800231e060d29","Tue, 23 Dec 2025 08:00:00 GMT","

For all his quality as a defender and his overflowing trophy cabinet, John Terry's near-19-year Chelsea career was punctuated by moments of significant controversy - from his early days at Stamford Bridge right through to his peak. His legacy is a complex one as a result, with many recognising him as one of the finest defenders England has ever produced while simultaneously asking serious questions of his character.

Within the walls of Stamford Bridge, at least, Terry will always be an icon, having led the club to five Premier League titles, five FA Cups and an elusive Champions League crown during a glittering era as their charismatic, hardman skipper, earning himself the tagline 'Captain, leader, legend' among the Chelsea faithful.

Among neutrals and rival fans, however, the former centre-back is a widely abhorred after a string of high-profile misdemeanours and brushes with the law, with two incidents in particular between the late noughties and early 2010s standing out in people's minds.

But what has led to Terry's reputation sinking so low? Below, GOAL reflects on the nine most controversial moments of the Chelsea hero's storied career...

Terry found himself in hot water in November 2006 after comments he made about referee Graham Poll following his sending off against Tottenham. Terry claimed the official had given him conflicting reasons for his second yellow card.

He told Chelsea TV: ""On the pitch. Graham Poll said to me that it was for the barge where I just kept running. Then, after the game, he said it was for the fall when me and Ledley King fell. He's obviously had a look at it and decided that's probably the best option and it covers every angle for him.""

Terry was hit with an FA improper conduct charge for 'questioning Poll's integrity', which he later admitted as he was fined £10,000.

Bizarrely, Terry was twice fined for parking his car in a disabled space during his time with Chelsea - once in 2008 and again seven years later in 2015, even though he had reportedly vowed never to do it again after the first incident.

The footballer was caught red-handed the second time as he was photographed with his car parked in the bay outside a kebab shop in Esher, Surrey. The original offence - which happened in the same area - saw him allegedly use the spot for two hours while he had a family meal at a branch of Pizza Express. He was fined just £60.

Chelsea were forced to defend their captain in 2009 when it was alleged that he had taken a secret £10,000 payment from an undercover reporter to host a behind-the-scenes tour of the club's Cobham training ground, without informing then-manager Carlo Ancelotti. He reportedly wanted £8,000 to go to charity and the remainder to a middleman.

The Blues said in a statement: ""Chelsea FC host a large number of visitors at the training ground throughout the year, the majority of which are made up of club sponsors, our charity partners and supporters. The players play a big part in these visits and John Terry naturally has a leading role. Contrary to media reports and the appearance of edited video this morning, the club is confident that at no time did Terry ask for or accept money in relation to visits to the training ground."" Ancelotti also denied the allegation, saying his player had ""done nothing wrong"".

The year 2009 was a tumultuous one for Terry, as he also had to face claims from a revered former team-mate about his role in Jose Mourinho's dramatic Stamford Bridge exit two years prior. Legendary defensive midfielder Claude Makelele, who left Chelsea in 2008, wrote in his autobiography that he was informed that a row between Mourinho and Terry over the centre-back's fitness played a significant role in the Portuguese tactician leaving.

The Frenchman went as far as to say that his co-star made a transfer request which forced Roman Abramovich to act, with both the club and Terry forced to deny Makelele's claims.

""It's bizarre, actually, because he knows the real truth and, if anything, I was one of three players phoning Roman at 1am or 2am the night I heard he'd been sacked, to keep him on,"" Terry later said, adding: ""Me and Jose know the truth. It's bizarre that Maka has put this in his book, but I tried to call him Friday night and his phone was off.""

In a particularly sordid incident that Terry would probably like everyone to forget, the footballer was caught on CCTV drunkenly urinating in a pint glass on the dancefloor of an Essex nightclub. The footballer was 21 at the time and was nursing a broken toe, which he allegedly used as his excuse for not making his way to the toilets to relieve himself.

The footage reportedly showed Terry urinating in the glass while his friends laughed and egged him on, before dropping it on the floor and being escorted out of the club by security staff after a member of staff had brought the grim act to their attention. Ironically, the clip would be leaked on the internet three years later.

Early in his senior Chelsea career, a 20-year-old Terry and fellow club legend Frank Lampard were among a clutch of players at the centre of an ugly, booze-fuelled incident in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York.

When their UEFA Cup fixture was postponed as a mark of respect 24 hours after the attacks, Terry, Lampard, Jody Morris and Eidur Gudjohnsen used the unexpected time off to go on a drinking binge, which resulted in them being seen ""stripping, swearing and vomiting"" at a hotel packed with grieving U.S. citizens who were stranded by flight cancellations near London's Heathrow airport, according to the BBC. They were later seen diving headfirst down the lanes at a nearby bowling alley.

Terry and Co. were fined two weeks' wages by Chelsea, with then-managing director Colin Hutchinson labelling their behaviour ""totally out of order"". However, he denied that the players 'intended to insult or abuse anyone' amid claims they had mocked the Americans present.

In January 2002 - the same year as the urine incident - Terry and Chelsea team-mate Morris were arrested and charged over an assault on a nightclub bouncer, who was allegedly struck on the head with a glass bottle. Terry did punch the security guard in the face, but he claimed he was acting in self-defence.

Having faced jail time, Terry and Morris were eventually cleared of assault and affray, but the incident scuppered the then-uncapped defender's chances of going to the 2002 World Cup with England, with the FA adjudging that he should be unavailable for selection until the legal case was completed. He was found not guilty in August, not long after the tournament concluded, and reportedly left the dock in tears.

Terry has been accused of cheating multiple times during his relationship with wife Toni, whom he married in 2007, but the most infamous allegation emerged in 2010, when it was sensationally claimed that the Chelsea captain had had a four-month affair with the girlfriend of former team-mate Wayne Bridge, Vanessa Perroncel, in late 2009.

When a super-injunction on media reporting was lifted in January 2010, the rumours were splashed across the tabloids, though Perroncel received printed apologies for breaches of her privacy. It was also reported that Terry paid the French model hundreds of thousands of pounds to stay silent. For her part, Perroncel has always maintained that the affair never happened.

Nevertheless, Terry was stripped of the England captaincy the following month (he was reinstated a year later), and when he played against Bridge for the first time since the allegations emerged, following the latter's January move to Manchester City, the left-back infamously refused to shake his hand before kick-off.

The most controversial incident of Terry's glittering but tumultuous time at Chelsea would ultimately bring an end to his international career. Following the west London derby against Queens Park Rangers in October 2011, a video circulated on social media that appeared to show the Blues skipper calling Anton Ferdinand - brother of Terry's England team-mate Rio - a ""f*cking black c*nt"", with a member of public reporting it to the police.

Terry insisted he was responding to an on-pitch allegation from Ferdinand that he had used racist language. However, a police investigation was launched, alongside an FA probe, and Terry was eventually charged with using racist language in December. He was stripped of the England captaincy for a second time as a result, although he was acquitted in a criminal trial in the summer of 2012.

The player was subsequently hit with an FA charge for using abusive words and behaviour which ""included a reference to the ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race of Ferdinand"". Terry denied the charge, and on the eve of his FA hearing he announced his international retirement, saying his position had become ""untenable"".

Terry was found guilty in September 2012, resulting in a four-month ban and a £220,000 fine, as well as being disciplined internally by Chelsea. He didn't appeal the verdict and issued an apology the following month, saying: ""Although I'm disappointed with the FA judgment, I accept that the language I used, regardless of the context, is not acceptable on the football field or indeed in any walk of life. With the benefit of hindsight, my language was clearly not an appropriate reaction to the situation for someone in my position.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The F1 grid does Secret Santa for 2025

F1 Animated! The funny side of the 2025 season

Pierre Gasly reflects on three years at Alpine, and sets out their ambitious goals for the future, in a lengthy conversation with F1.com.

Pierre Gasly headed into 2025 looking to build on an encouraging end to the previous F1 season, having scored points in four of the final five rounds and made another appearance on the podium. It proved to be a particularly challenging year for his Alpine team, though, who struggled for performance early on and promptly shifted development resources to their 2026 challenger, leaving them at the foot of the Teams' Championship.

As the campaign drew to a close, the Frenchman sat down with F1.com to assess his time at Alpine so far, why he is more confident than ever about the chances of ‘Team Enstone' recovering and competing at the sharp end again, and how he feels ready to take the next step in his own career after nine eventful years in the sport...

Gasly has a group of local journalists huddled around him at Alpine's hospitality unit in Mexico City – all listening intently as he talks about the highs and lows of his F1 career, what drives him on and off the track, and his passions outside the sport – when F1.com arrives to get ready for a separate interview.

A few minutes later, the 29-year-old wraps up those duties, greets us and leads the way to a meeting room at the back of the building, where over the next half an hour or so – already in the mood to chat – he opens up on the past, present and future.

It is difficult for us both to believe, but Gasly will soon reach a decade as an F1 driver, having arrived on the grid with Toro Rosso during the latter stages of the 2017 season, before establishing himself at the junior team and then earning promotion to the senior Red Bull squad – only for that move to be over in just 12 races.

After resetting and rebuilding at Toro Rosso (later known as AlphaTauri), with whom he scored a memorable victory around their home Monza circuit in 2020, Gasly left the Red Bull family at the end of 2022 to begin a new chapter at Alpine, owned by automotive giants Renault.

When Gasly walked through the factory doors for the first time, Alpine had just finished fourth in the championship and had their sights set on the big-hitting teams ahead, meaning regular podium finishes – and potentially even more – were the expectation.

However, three up-and-down seasons – filled with managerial reshuffles and off-track noise – have seen them fall significantly short of those goals, with 2025 bringing a new low when Alpine dropped from sixth to 10th (and last) in the standings.

So, with a moment to reflect as another busy year winds down, how does Gasly review his journey with Alpine until now?

“It's crazy,” Gasly begins, pausing for thought. “It doesn't quite feel like three years, maybe because I had to go through so many changes, whether it was the management point of view, the team structure, team mates… It almost feels like every time it's been a fresh start – not the continuity of working with the same people.

“There have been some clear highlights, like the podium in Brazil last year, the P3 in Las Vegas Qualifying last year, the podiums at Zandvoort and in the Sprint at Spa in 2023, but I think it's fair to say that, overall, we're quite far [away] from our expectations.

“When I started at Alpine in 2023, the team had just come out of a very strong 2022 campaign, so I expected a lot more, which unfortunately didn't happen.

“But, if you ask me now, it's the most confident I've been for the coming seasons, compared to the end of 2023 or the end of 2024. It hasn't all been smooth and easy, but at the same time, I feel like we've been through the rough part of the journey, and much brighter days are coming.”

Part of Gasly's optimism comes from Alpine's decision to effectively scrap further developments on their 2025 car early in the season and focus on 2026, when sweeping regulation changes – covering both power units and aerodynamics – come into play.

A head start on the competition, if you will, even though there are “no guarantees” of success.

“At the start of the year, when the team shared their approach and the fact that they would be keen to focus on 2026, I was the first one to say, ‘Just forget about this year. Even stop earlier and just start working on 2026',” Gasly makes clear.

“The reality is we are 10th in the championship. Let's say we would have put a bit more budget and development [into the 2025 season], then we could have challenged for sixth or seventh in the championship – but we don't do it for sixth or seventh in the championship, we do it to be right at the top.

“This couple of months of development for next season could be the difference between being at the top or being in the midfield again for another few years. I was more than happy, even as painful as it's been this year, to accept a tough season as a team, to make sure that we give ourselves the best chance.

“Generally, I'm not a patient guy, but you've got to understand and figure out how to get the maximum out of a situation. We have no guarantees, but as a team I know our approach makes sense for what we're trying to achieve, and to put us back on the map in F1.”

Meanwhile, Gasly believes Alpine have finally found the managerial balance – under Executive Advisor Flavio Briatore and recently-signed Managing Director Steve Nielsen – to steer a workforce that boasts “great characters” and has “all the ingredients” required to succeed.

A host of names have come and gone from top Alpine positions in recent seasons, including the likes of Otmar Szafnauer, Bruno Famin and Oliver Oakes, but Gasly still sees plenty of positives beyond the headlines and noise generated by these changes.

“I say this with full transparency and honesty: we must have some of the best technical staff on the grid, looking at people's experience, skill sets… I don't think we've ever been in a situation with so many great engineers, mechanics and staff back in Enstone,” says Gasly, namechecking the factory that won titles under previous Renault and Benetton guises.

“That's why I'm filled with optimism, because when I look at the situation we are in, the people we have inside the team, and the brainpower we have inside this team, we have to perform. Surely it must all come together and it must work.

“On Flavio, I think I connect with him because he has a winner's mentality. He doesn't care about anything other than winning. All he's focusing on, all the time, is getting more out of us as a team – every single individual in the team. He doesn't settle for anything less than perfection, and that's my mentality as well.

“We're in a competitive sport and we need to aim for perfection at all levels – that's the only way we're going to get to where we want to be. Flavio's won in F1, he's won many other things in life besides F1, and I think that's thanks to his mindset and approach. I can see he's really putting his heart into the team and the effort to make it happen.

“I also really like Steve. He's a very different character to Flavio, but I think they complement each other a lot. He's a great addition to the team in terms of leadership and experience, and being very factual and very objective: ‘If we're good at something, we're good, but if we're weak somewhere, let's not hide from it'.

“I feel that we've got great characters across the team, and we've got all the ingredients to be successful. Now we've just got to make it happen.”

The third key point for Gasly when it comes to Alpine's future chances is their switch to Mercedes power units – the manufacturer who stole a march on the competition at the start of the turbo-hybrid power unit era and have been heavily tipped to come up with another potent design this time around.

Indeed, Mercedes won eight successive Teams' Championships between 2014 and 2021, and powered McLaren to the last two titles, as well as claiming six Drivers' crowns with Lewis Hamilton – and playing a part in Lando Norris' 2025 triumph – across the same period.

While Gasly is keen to recognise Renault's efforts over the years, with their F1 engine department recently shutting down, he is naturally eager to experience Mercedes' latest creation, which will also power the works team, reigning champions McLaren and Williams in 2026.

“First of all, I think it's important for me to thank all the people who worked [at Renault's factory] in Viry-Chatillon, and who worked on the engine side,” Gasly emphasises. “There was a lot of noise, and it doesn't really feel fully deserved for all the hardworking people who tried to deliver as much as they could.

“Now we open a new chapter with Mercedes, and obviously, looking at their CV, how many times they've been World Champions, I'm sure it's going to be a great adventure. I'm not going to lie, I'm very excited about it. From what I'm hearing, the engine is in a great place, so I'm looking forward to that first test and feeling what it's like to have Merc horsepower on my back.

“I have very high expectations for us as a team next year. We made tactical sacrifices on 2025 to reward all of us by starting on the right foot from 2026 onwards. That's what I expect from us, and that's what I believe we can achieve, from the people we have and the work we are doing.

“Next year, I want to be fighting at the front of the grid. As it stands, I don't see any reason why we shouldn't be able to be right up there.”

Should Alpine's new car and new engine deliver such a step, which is a lot easier said than done, it would also represent a full circle moment for Gasly, who has impressively rebuilt his career and reputation after a tricky first shot at the ‘big time' some six years ago.

As touched on earlier, little more than a season into his F1 career with Toro Rosso, Red Bull chiefs promoted Gasly to the senior team in place of Daniel Ricciardo, who had made the bold and unexpected decision to join rivals Renault.

It was a baptism of fire for the youngster, who already found himself up against it after a pair of crashes during pre-season testing, and became the first of several drivers to struggle in the second Red Bull seat alongside Max Verstappen – the experience lasting 12 Grands Prix.

Gasly is philosophical as the topic comes up in our conversation, sharing more insight into how it unfolded on his side, the main takeaways, and how it has made him even hungrier for another chance to try and show what he can do in a competitive car.

“For me, it was a very particular situation,” he says, again taking some time to think about his next words. “It can't be seen as six months, 12 races, and ‘How did I do?' in a very simple way, because there was nothing straightforward when I was there.

“I could talk about it for hours. Is there a need for it? No. The chapter's closed. Sometimes things work out and sometimes they just don't. It's obviously sad that it didn't work out. At the same time, it wasn't in my control. I know on my side I tried every single time to do my best with what I was given.

“Unfortunately, it wasn't made for two cars. You can argue that it works perfectly for Max, they're doing an incredible job for him, but… I remember at the time I was with them, Charles [Leclerc] was in his first season with Ferrari, and we were discussing it a lot. It was a very different approach for two drivers with similar experience getting to a top team.

“Anyway, I don't really want to dwell on it. I'm very grateful for Red Bull and what they've done for me. Things could have been different, but at the end of the day, I also won a race with AlphaTauri afterwards; I'm one of two to have achieved that, alongside Seb Vettel, so I'm very happy to be part of that club. It wasn't meant to be with Red Bull, but that's okay.”

Noting that “a lot of people thought I was done” when he got sent back to Toro Rosso, Gasly adds: “For me, it's just about putting a lot of effort in. Sometimes people underestimate how much work you've got to do. I've never stopped grinding. I know what I want to achieve, and I know my potential.

“I do feel that all these years have built a lot of fire inside me, and a desire to have my time. I see guys like Charles, Lando, George [Russell] – who I've been fighting in my career – getting their time to shine and their opportunities, and I need the car to be right up there with them.

“We all get a different career, we all get different times, but I must say I'm eager to get to next year, and hopefully finally get my hands on a car that allows me to be fighting at the front with these guys. From the moment I have it, I know I'm not going to let it slip. I'm ready – I'm definitely more than ready for my time.”

So, with all of the above in mind, just how sweet would it taste to succeed at Alpine?

“I think it would taste absolutely amazing,” Gasly smiles. “As I said, I believe in hard work, and that ultimately, if you do the right thing, the succession of right actions will eventually lead to the right outcomes.

“For this team, as well, it would mean the world to get back to the top. I really like the approach of all our guys sticking together as a team, putting their best efforts in weekend after weekend, even when we have a car that is not competitive. No one's giving up.

“I feel it's making us so united – to feel that sort of pain together, to accept it, and to not be divided. I think it's building such a strength that when these better times come, we could have an incredible synergy, and really enjoy that ride together.

“Obviously being French and representing a French brand is also something that I'm very proud of, and I want to put this brand and this team back to where they belong. Hopefully we can make that happen sooner rather than later…”

The F1 grid does Secret Santa for 2025

F1 Animated! The funny side of the 2025 season

With victory in the 2025 season finale, Lando Norris became the eighth driver to win a World Championship with McLaren.

Those who have been crowned World Champion while racing for McLaren all share a certain tenacity, and their journeys to the top have rarely been smooth. Whether it's fierce rivalries or troubling reliability issues, they've had their fair share of hurdles to overcome en route to the history books.

The Woking outfit have produced a champion in nearly every decade, with Lando Norris becoming the latest to join the illustrious list that includes, among others, legendary drivers like Lewis Hamilton, Ayrton Senna and Niki Lauda. We take a look at how each of these deserved winners fought for their titles with the historic team…

When Fittipaldi made a surprise move to McLaren in 1974, it felt like a strange choice – he had already won a title with Lotus, a team that had shown time and again they were one of the greatest throughout the 1960s and 70s. McLaren, on the other hand, had a fairly lacklustre start to their F1 adventure and were far from the success that Colin Chapman's team had become.

But the Brazilian driver identified that, while unproven, Bruce McLaren's legacy had ambition and enthusiasm, and their 1973 challenger had looked rapid despite its flaws. It didn't take long for Fittipaldi to harness their updated 1974 car, winning his first race in Round 2 at his home event, and after three more Grands Prix he took the lead in the standings.

His performance, while strong, was far from dominant as the points advantage swung constantly – his team mate Denny Hulme and the Ferrari pair of Lauda and Clay Regazzoni all took a turn at the top.

While he only won three races out of 15, additional podiums kept Fittipaldi in the fight alongside Regazzoni, with the pair arriving at the finale at Watkins Glen level on points to lay the foundations for the now iconic McLaren vs Ferrari rivalry. Adding an extra obstacle, both struggled with the track's bumpy surface and qualified in eighth and ninth, with the Italian starting just ahead.

Fittipaldi knew that his rival was more than willing to take risks, leaving him keen to pass as quickly as possible and avoid Regazzoni shutting the door on him at a later stage. The Ferrari driver actually got the better launch at lights out, but Fittipaldi stuck close behind him and tried to overtake down the inside. As expected, he was left no space and dropped two wheels onto the grass, barely avoiding a spin before he immediately veered back onto the circuit to surprise Regazzoni and surge past. He charged away and built an unassailable gap, eventually crossing the line in fourth and securing the title with 55 points, three clear of his nearest rival.

Fast forward another two seasons and it was no longer McLaren who needed to impress, but the archetypal lovable rogue James Hunt, who had to find a new team after Lord Hesketh announced he no longer had the money to fund the effort to crown the next British World Champion.

Hunt was known to push to the limit both on and off track – he had gained the moniker of ‘Hunt the Shunt' after some dreadful crashes early in his career – and his playboy lifestyle had been well documented. Yet he immediately made his mark at McLaren by securing pole position at the season opener in Brazil.

Raw speed helped him start on the front row numerous times, often alongside his main competitor, Ferrari's Lauda. That wasn't nearly enough to be considered a title contender from the start, with his explosive emotions and reliability problems frequently knocking him out of races while the Austrian dominated early on.

There were more lows to come for Hunt as DNFs and disqualifications thwarted his title challenge, leading to Tyrrell's Jody Scheckter becoming Lauda's closest rival in the standings before the Briton's fortunes finally turned at Paul Ricard. The combination of pole and victory with engine failures for both Ferraris was everything he needed to drag himself back into contention.

1976 proved to be one of the most defining seasons in F1 history as Lauda suffered his infamous fiery crash at the Nurburgring, where his fuel tank ruptured and the car was engulfed in flames. Miraculously, he only missed two rounds to begin healing his extensive burns and returned to find that Hunt had chipped away at his lead, so much so that he only had a three-point advantage heading into the final round, the first ever Japanese Grand Prix.

McLaren booked a private test day to get to grips with the new circuit – call it clever or unfair, but it helped Hunt to take the lead of the race amid pouring rain and fog while Lauda withdrew on the second lap due to the treacherous conditions. A puncture jeopardised the Briton's chances, but he recovered to P3 and became World Champion by a single point.

After a three-year sabbatical, and with two titles already won at Ferrari, Lauda joined McLaren in 1982 to partner Alain Prost. The pairing was genius but volatile as both had already established themselves as incredible racers and wanted nothing more than to beat one another, especially as Lauda was coming off the back of scoring just 12 points the previous season.

Thanks to their new Porsche TAG engines, McLaren thrived, winning 12 out of 16 races in what turned out to be the closest Championship fight in F1 history. Prost and Lauda were remarkably evenly matched when it came to victories, and the same applied to their poor reliability too, so much so that a pattern developed over the year – whenever Lauda took nine points for a win, Prost failed to finish the race. But when Prost won, Lauda still added points to his tally and gradually cut down the Frenchman's lead.

As it turned out, even those low scoring weekends were critical, including the rain-soaked Monaco Grand Prix which was cancelled and half points were awarded. Prost took 4.5 for winning, but was nevertheless overshadowed by a young Senna's awe-inspiring performance in the wet weather.

More wins and DNFs meant that the McLaren pair entered the final round with Lauda on 66 points and Prost on 62.5. Despite his lead, it looked as though it would all unravel for the Austrian driver as he ended the season with zero pole positions, qualifying 11th with Prost far ahead in second. After 33 laps, he had worked his way up to third while his team mate led from Nigel Mansell, who suffered a brake issue and spun out to promote Lauda to P2. Without any further drama, that was enough for Lauda to beat Prost to the title by a miniscule margin of half a point.

For three seasons running, Prost had been denied the Championship by Lauda, Nelson Piquet and Keke Rosberg, leaving him as one of the favourites for the 1985 title. He had spent the years of near-misses honing his race craft, which proved to be his saving grace in a season where McLaren were not the fastest in Qualifying trim – he only took two pole positions, but a superb run saw him stand on the podium in nine of 11 rounds following a flawless drive in Monaco.

Ferrari's Michele Alboreto was enjoying similarly strong performances, but statement victories in Austria and Italy saw Prost build a 12-point lead over his nearest rival, who would go on to retire from the final four rounds. A P4 finish at Brands Hatch was enough for the Frenchman to cruise to the title, solidifying his status as one of the sport's greatest drivers.

McLaren's advantage over other teams faded the following year as Williams surged forward, aided by their formidable line-up of Mansell and Piquet. As 2025 also showed, having two brilliant drivers can be a blessing and a curse as they repeatedly took points off one another, allowing Prost to take advantage and secure his second title in 1986.

While others were undoubtedly faster, he was so consistent with his podium finishes that he began the finale in Australia just six points adrift of Mansell, with Piquet a single point further back. He had an outside chance, but needed to win the race no matter what, which is exactly what he did. Goodyear maintained that one set of tyres would last the whole race, a prediction that proved to be Mansell's undoing as his left-rear gave way, forcing him to weave onto the escape road while Prost stormed to another victory.

By that point, ‘The Professor' had honed his cerebral approach to driving – winning races came naturally to him, but staying out of conflict with both competitors and his own team did not. He would split races into stages, conserving performance before launching a late challenge, whereas his team mate Senna would go flat out constantly, simultaneously endearing fans and infuriating Prost.

No other team could match McLaren's consistency in 1989, so with little competition in terms of constructors, the feud turned inwards and the unprecedented rivalry between Prost and Senna reached its controversial climax. Their collision at the Japanese Grand Prix is still talked about now, but it was the result of months of bitter clashes.

Despite admitting that they had found differences in each driver's engines, Team Principal Ron Dennis switched his allegiance from Prost to Senna after a heated Italian Grand Prix where the Frenchman announced he would be leaving for Ferrari in 1990. An incident with the trophy and very passionate tifosi enraged Dennis further, leaving Prost to fight his own battle in the remaining rounds.

Arriving at Suzuka, he was 16 points clear of Senna and would seal the title if the Brazilian retired from either of the final two races. In classic Senna style, he refused to yield when trying to overtake Prost, sending both of them skidding down the escape road. Marshals helped him restart the car and he went on to win the race while the Frenchman retired, but Senna was soon disqualified for cutting the chicane and therefore not completing a full lap, granting Prost his third and final Championship.

With the exception of a particularly good year for Williams and Piquet in 1987, McLaren drivers dominated the Championship in the mid- to late-1980s as Prost and Senna shared the titles between them, which sounds a lot more cordial than the reality.

Keen to reclaim the top spot in 1988, the pair won 15 of the 16 rounds between them as some teams opted to anticipate the following season's regulation changes that included a mandatory switch to naturally aspirated engines. McLaren instead used a Honda turbocharged engine, which gave them a significant advantage over the other teams and even led to Prost and Senna lapping the entire field on one occasion.

Come the end of the season, the Frenchman had technically outscored Senna by 11 points, but the system meant that only a driver's 11 best results counted towards the Championship. With eight wins and three P2 finishes, Senna narrowly beat Prost with 90 points to 87, paving the way for their feud to escalate even further, especially once Prost left for Ferrari.

In a direct swap for 1990, Gerhard Berger joined McLaren while Prost mounted the Scuderia's first title challenge in years. The battle between the two teams was vicious, but Prost had the upper hand after wins in Mexico, France and Britain before his rival bounced back with three more victories in the following five rounds, giving him a nine-point lead in the Standings as they returned to Japan.

For the second consecutive year, the duo dramatically crashed out of the race after Senna raged that despite taking pole position, it was Prost who started on the preferred side of the grid. The Brazilian also retired from the final round in Australia, but still managed to win the title by seven points due to the rule that allowed drivers to discount their worst scores from the Championship.

Their rivalry wasn't quite as spirited in 1991, which was the last season to feature the celebrated quartet of Senna, Prost, Piquet and Mansell – they won 93 of the 112 Grands Prix since 1985 – but furious conflict with Ferrari and a lack of reliability prevented Prost from winning any in his final season with the team.

With the Frenchman out of contention, Senna faced the challenge of Mansell, who won five races upon his return to Williams while the Brazilian was victorious in seven. For the first time, all points counted towards the Championship, giving Senna a clear advantage as he was a regular fixture on the podium while the Briton suffered five impactful retirements. With the help of team mate Berger, the title was once again decided in Japan, where McLaren secured a 1-2 finish and Senna ultimately beat Mansell by 24 points.

Williams went on to flourish for the next few seasons until everything fell into place once again for McLaren, when the new Technical Director Adrian Newey provided Mika Hakkinen with a Championship-worthy car. Having claimed his maiden victory in 1997, the so-called Flying Finn was eager to go even further in his eighth F1 season and was aided greatly by his team mate David Coulthard.

Learning from the clashes between Prost and Senna, McLaren implemented pre-agreed orders that fuelled their dominance – in the season opener, for example, Coulthard let Hakkinen through after the Finn mistakenly headed to the pits, honouring their deal that whoever led at the first corner would be prioritised.

Questions about the legality of McLaren's braking system arose, but they continued to succeed until a raft of errors and mechanical failures allowed the then two-time World Champion Michael Schumacher to draw level on points with Hakkinen with two rounds remaining. However, any jeopardy quickly vanished as the McLaren driver beat Schumacher with ease in both races to end the season on a neat 100 points.

Their battle reared its head again the following year, with Ferrari winning the Teams' Championship by just four points over the Woking outfit. Like other Champions before him, it was a case of all or nothing for Hakkinen, who either retired or finished on the podium in 15 of the 16 rounds. After a confident start to 1999, Schumacher broke his leg in an incident at Silverstone and was subsequently ruled out of title contention as Eddie Irvine unexpectedly became the senior driver at Ferrari.

Hakkinen wasn't exactly running away with it as, by Round 12, he led Irvine by just one point, which backfired when Schumacher returned for the penultimate round in Malaysia. Playing the team game, he handed Irvine the lead of the race and backed up the Finn, allowing the Ferrari driver to jump to first in the Standings with a four-point advantage. All that work briefly turned out to be for nothing as the Scuderia were disqualified due to their cars being deemed illegal, but their subsequent appeal was successful and the Championship again went down to the wire.

McLaren's newfound harmonious team dynamic is what secured victory for Hakkinen in Japan, with Coulthard backing Irvine up while the Finn sped away, resisting constant pressure from Schumacher to win with 76 points to Irvine's 74.

McLaren have had several stand-out liveries, but a fan favourite is still the chrome design that serves as a reminder of Hamilton's dramatic journey to becoming the youngest champion in F1 history at the time. After he lost out to Kimi Raikkonen the preceding year, the 23-year-old got a new team mate in Heikki Kovalainen to bring an end to the intra-team quarrel with Fernando Alonso.

The Briton refined his aggressive driving style from his rookie season and quickly demonstrated that he was a more complete and mature competitor, thriving in a newly united team environment. While his lead in the standings slipped from his grasp as he failed to score at the Canadian and French Grands Prix, he delivered one of his greatest performances at Silverstone and soared to victory with a wet weather masterclass, handing him the top spot which he fiercely defended until the finale.

All he needed to do was finish fifth or higher in Brazil to be crowned the first British World Champion since Damon Hill in 1996, and he got off to a strong start by qualifying fourth. Amid heavy rainfall, Hamilton stayed in the top five for 69 laps before running wide, allowing Sebastian Vettel to charge past and leave him in a frustrating sixth place heading onto the final lap.

What rival Felipe Massa, who was confidently leading his home race and looked well on his way to winning the title, didn't anticipate was Toyota's Timo Glock staying on slick tyres despite the rain. Struggling to stay on the circuit, he slowed down, giving Hamilton the perfect opportunity to overtake and reclaim a place in the top five to win the Championship by a single point.

Last but by no means least, Norris is the latest to be honoured with the title as a McLaren driver, and like those who came before him, it was an incredibly tight battle to get there. With seven wins to his name, he overcame his team mate Oscar Piastri's commanding points lead and resisted a late charge from Max Verstappen to become the outfit's first victor in 17 seasons.

McLaren repeated their long-standing habit of deciding the Championship in the final round, where Norris had to finish on the podium in order to outscore his Red Bull rival. Although Piastri passed him on the opening lap, the Briton maintained third place all the way to the chequered flag, earning just enough points to take his maiden crown as Verstappen fell two points short.

It remains to be seen whether Norris will replicate the feat in the near future, with McLaren first facing the challenge of capitalising on the upcoming regulation changes. Safe to say, they're not done producing drivers of World Champion calibre quite yet.

The F1 grid does Secret Santa for 2025

F1 Animated! The funny side of the 2025 season

Max Verstappen has revealed that various factors would come into play if he were to ever consider making a move away from Red Bull in the future.

Max Verstappen has given an insight into the talks that were held earlier in the year over a potential Mercedes switch, with the Dutchman also reflecting on the factors that would matter to him if he were to consider a move away from Red Bull in the future.

Despite holding a contract to race for the Milton Keynes-based outfit through to the end of 2028, speculation linking Verstappen to a possible Mercedes move started to mount during the middle of the 2025 season.

This was brought to a close ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix in August when Verstappen confirmed that he would be driving for Red Bull in 2026, adding: “I think it's time to basically stop all the rumours, and for me it's always been quite clear that I was staying anyway.”

Several months on, the four-time World Champion was quizzed during an interview with BBC Sport on how seriously he considered a possible move, leading him to explain how various elements would play a part in any decision about his future.

""For me, it's not only about F1,"" said Verstappen, who has been a part of Red Bull's line-up since his promotion from Toro Rosso in 2016. ""There's a lot of things that have to come together for me to make a change. Future roles, stuff like that.

“So if I ever would make a change, of course, it's a big one for me because this definitely feels like a second family, and that's not easy to replicate, let's say, like that.

""The change, if I would ever make one, it's not only because I need a faster F1 car or I need a difference in the environment. There's a lot of things that are around my F1 career and things that I'm doing outside of F1 that all have to come together.""

Pushed further on whether this means that it was not something he was seriously considering at the time, Verstappen responded: “I'm not going to lie. For sure, there were talks. But at the same time, it was all very friendly and open. Nothing more than that.""

Verstappen – who won on his GT3 debut at the Nurburgring Nordschleife in September – also spoke of his desire to continue improving as a driver, adding that he does this by “always trying to look for details, trying to just learn about the car, learn about yourself, do a lot of things also outside of F1.”

""I'm driving, of course, a lot of different cars, external which I don't think it hurts you, racing in F1,” the 28-year-old continued. “So, yeah, just trying to make yourself a bit more of a complete driver, a bit more all-round.""

CBS had pulled the segment, but the original version of the newsmagazine apparently aired in Canada.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	The 60 Minutes segment that was spiked by CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss for not being ready is now readily available online, after the network that airs the show in Canada ran the original version of the program and subsequently released it online.


	A source in Canada confirmed that as of earlier Monday evening, the full original 60 Minutes episode, including the “Inside CECOT” segment that was pulled at the last minute, was available via Global TV's streaming platform.




60 Minutes had been slated to run the segment, which featured Sharyn Alfonsi as the correspondent and Oriana Zill de Granados as the producer speaking to Venezuelans who had been deported by the Trump administration to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison.

					Bari Weiss On Decision to Preempt '60 Minutes' Story: ""It Was Not Ready""		
			









	Weiss, however, asked that it be pulled before it aired.




			Related Video		







	“I held a 60 Minutes story because it was not ready,” she told staff Monday morning. “While the story presented powerful testimony of torture at CECOT, it did not advance the ball—the Times and other outlets have previously done similar work. The public knows that Venezuelans have been subjected to horrific treatment at this prison. To run a story on this subject two months later, we need to do more. And this is 60 Minutes. We need to be able to get the principals on the record and on camera. Our viewers come first. Not the listing schedule or anything else. That's my north star and I hope it's yours, too.”

	











	By the time Weiss asked that the episode be adjusted, the network had already released that week's lineup for the newsmagazine, and it came too late and ran in Canada (or whoever is responsible for transmitting the episode to the Canadian TV partner did not make the requested change).


	The result is that the segment is now widely available on platforms like X and YouTube from viewers posting their videos of the segment, though copyright complaints from CBS could temper that enthusiasm.


	Alfonsi, meanwhile, was outraged by the move, emailing her colleagues that “our story was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices. It is factually correct,” Alfonsi wrote. “In my view, pulling it now—after every rigorous internal check has been met is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”


	Weiss told staff that she is serious about getting the story on air once her concerns have been addressed, though Global TV's move will now let viewers see whatever changes CBS makes to the final version.

David Ellison's new regime has earmarked Paramount+ to be the new home of all animated content from Avatar Studios and its expanding 'Airbender' universe. There's more: Taika Waititi is joining the voice cast of the new feature film.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	The upcoming feature The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender will bypass a theatrical debut in theaters in October 2026 and premiere exclusively on Paramount+ as the streamer becomes the exclusive home of all animated content from Avatar Studios, the creative force behind the beloved and acclaimed Nickelodeon series Avatar: The Last Airbender.


	Ditto for the new series Avatar: Seven Havens. Both animated projects are being produced by Avatar Studios, which was formed in 2021 under Nickelodeon as a division designed to create a new, ever-growing universe based on the worlds of Avatar and subsequent series, The Legend of Korra.

	Based on the original series Avatar: The Last Airbender created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, the feature film will be directed by Lauren Montgomery with Steve Ahn and William Mata co-directing. Latifa Ouaou, Maryann Garger, Konietzko and DiMartino serve as producers. Award-winning composer Jeremy Zuckerman returns to score both the film and series.


	“The Avatar Universe has captivated audiences for two decades, and Paramount+ is proud to be the exclusive streaming home for its beloved animated incarnation,” said Jane Wiseman, Head of Originals for Paramount+. “The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender and Avatar: Seven Havens represent the next evolution of storytelling from Avatar Studios — bringing together remarkable talent both in front of and behind the camera to deliver the epic adventures and emotional depth fans have come to expect.

	











	These additions, alongside The Legend of Korra and the original series, solidify Paramount+ as the destination for the animated Avatar Universe.


The Last Airbender ran from 2005 to 2008 and was set in a world of warring nation states where people, known as “benders,” can manipulate the four elements of earth, fire, wind and water. The series has received the Peabody Award, a Primetime Emmy, Annie Awards and Genesis Awards.

Billboard Korea compiled the ranking in partnership with Billboard based on each artist's achievements from October 2024 to September 2025.

	Billboard Korea



	The Billboard K-Pop Artist 100 is back!


	The 2025 ranking was compiled by Billboard Korea in partnership with Billboard based on each artist's achievements from October 2024 to September 2025 on the U.S.-based Billboard Hot 100 songs chart and Billboard 200 albums chart, along with the internationally reflective Billboard Global 200 songs chart, global Billboard Boxscore touring data and streaming and songs sales activity within Korea. Luminate is the streaming and sales source for all of the respective rankings (excluding Billboard Boxscore).


	The No. 1 spot goes to SEVENTEEN and its 13 members, with consistent performance in the U.S., global and Korean markets. SEVENTEEN's decade-long career reached new heights this year, cementing its status as one of the most powerful K-pop groups. The act had an exceptionally active year — not only in touring, but also in album releases. Spill the Feels (November 2024) debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200, while SEVENTEEN's most recent album, HAPPY BURSTDAY, debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 in June. Additionally, three of the group's subunits — BSS, HOSHI X WOOZI and CxM (S.COUPS X MINGYU) — released albums that contributed to the brand's global dominance.


	One of the most groundbreaking moments of the year came from BLACKPINK's Rosé, whose collaboration with Bruno Mars on “APT.” debuted at No. 8 on the Hot 100 in October 2024, making her the highest-charting solo female artist in K-pop history; the song went on to peak at No. 3 in February. She already earned chart honors as a member of BLACKPINK, the highest-charting K-pop girl group to date on the Hot 100. 


	Meanwhile, Stray Kids continued their record-breaking streak, achieving two No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200 with HOP in December 2024 and KARMA in August 2025. The albums helped make them the first act from any country to debut at No. 1 with its first seven chart entries on the Billboard 200 since the chart began publishing on a regular weekly basis in 1956. 


ATEEZ also reached a new milestone with Golden Hour: Part 2, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in November 2024, marking the group's second album to achieve this distinction. In 2025, ATEEZ appeared on the Billboard 200 and Hot 100 with their album Golden Hour: Part 3 and the song “Lemon Drop,” respectively.


	Additionally, TWICE's fourth studio album THIS IS FOR remained on the Billboard 200 for 14 consecutive weeks since its release in July. “Strategy” and “TAKEDOWN (JEONGYEON, JIHYO, CHAEYOUNG)” from KPop Demon Hunters also received notable attention, peaking at No. 51 and No. 50 on the Hot 100, respectively. 


	A closer look at the charts reveals several notable trends that defined the performance of the K- pop genre in the past year. First, groups that debuted after 2023 made a strong showing. BOYNEXTDOOR placed five consecutive releases on the Billboard 200, while ILLIT — who entered the Hot 100 with their debut track “Magnetic” — saw their album bomb hit the Billboard 200 this July. KATSEYE is particularly dominant, with their EP Beautiful Chaos gaining steady momentum, and both “ Gnarly” and “Gabriela” entering the Hot 100, where “Gabriela” peaked at No. 33. KATSEYE kicked of their first U.S. tour in November.


	Second, K-pop artists' solo activities stood out. Following Rosé, who released her first studio album Rosie in December 2024, all BLACKPINK members went on to to release albums or mini-albums as well. The group also returned with “Jump” in July, debuting at No. 28 on the Hot 100. BLACKPINK, which kicked off their DEADLINE World Tour in July, has also announced a comeback scheduled for January. NCT members Mark and Haecha launched their first solo albums, while i-dle's Minnie, Yuqi and Miyeon also continued individual promotions. Meanwhile, BTS members JIN and j-hope, who completed service earlier, pursued solo releases and embarked on their first world tours as solo artists. All BTS members promised to come back in March, and will likely shake up the rankings once again.


	A stark contrast between the U.S. and Korean music charts emerged in 2024. While bands like DAY6 experienced a phenomenal year in Korea — dominating domestic streaming platforms with both old and new hits (“Happy,” “Welcome to the Show,” “Time of Our Life,” “You Were Beautiful,” and “Congratulations”) and selling out major venues, their success has yet to generate major attention in the U.S. market. The continued rise of Korean bands raises the question of whether the K-band genre will gain similar traction internationally in the coming years.


	Finally, we cannot overlook the phenomenal success of KPop Demon Hunters. What kind of presence will the voices of HUNTR/X and Saja Boys, born of the smash 2025 Netflix film, establish moving forward Keep your eyes on K-pop through the final moments of 2025.


For the 2025 Billboard K-Pop Artist 100, group members are sometimes listed together, except for where notable solo or unit activity separates the artists. Member order generally follows the official listings provided by their agencies, though those on hiatus for military service are placed toward the bottom.


	Celebrating their 10th anniversary in 2025, DAY6 is a four-piece band under JYP Entertainment — the same label behind TWICE, ITZY and  Stray Kids. The members are SUNGJIN (vocals/guitar), Young K (bass/vocals), WONPIL (vocals/keyboard) and DOWOON (drums). Even during their military service period, songs like “You Were Beautiful” and “Time of Our Life” saw a resurgence on Korean streaming charts. In 2024, YouTube Music ranked DAY6 as the highest-charting male idol group of the year, and in 2025 they became the first Korean band ever to perform a solo stadium tour in celebration of their 10th anniversary. With their third world tour Forever Young held across 2024 and 2025, DAY6 visited 18 cities around the world.


	The leader and main rapper of BTS, RM began his solo career in 2015 with his first mixtape Rap Monster and officially changed his stage name to RM in 2017. His 2018 mixtape mono. topped the iTunes Album Chart worldwide, showcasing his strength as both a producer and lyricist. In 2022, his first studio album Indigo peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard 200, setting a new record for the highest-ranking Korean solo artist at the time. His second album Right Place, Wrong Person reached No. 5 on the same chart. In 2026, he is set to hold a special exhibition at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art expanding his influence to art.


	G-DRAGON is back! In October 2024, he resumed his solo career after seven years with the single “PO￦ER.” In February, he dropped his third full-length album Übermensch and immediately kicked off his tour. His comeback dominated both global and Korean charts, proving that fans around the world had been eagerly awaiting his music. G-DRAGON is also set to perform with his fellow BIGBANG members at Coachella 2026.


	Consisting of six members — Keeho, Theo, Jiung, Intak, Soul and Jongseob — P1Harmony entered the Billboard 200 with four consecutive releases. In October, their first English-language album EX debuted at No. 9 on the Billboard 200, underscoring their accelerating global rise. P1Harmony is also recognized for their dynamic stage presence. The group's new tour, P1ustage H: MOST WANTED, which kicked off in August, aims to reach 25 cities worldwide, including eight stops across North America.


	Formed through the global audition program The Debut: Dream Academy, KATSEYE is a multinational girl group under HYBE and Geffen Records that officially debuted on June 28, 2024. The six-member lineup — Daniela, Lara, Manon, Megan, Sophia and the only Korean member Yoonchae — made their debut in the United States. Their single “Gnarly” reached No. 90 on the Hot 100 and their follow-up track “Gabriela” climbed to No. 30 on the Nov. 15, 2025, chart, marking their highest placement yet. KATSEYE kicked off their first concert tour Beautiful Chaos in late November.


	BOYNEXTDOOR (Seongho, Riwoo, Myeong Jaehyeon, Taesan, Ihan and Unhak) — who debuted in 2023 — is quickly emerging as one of K-pop's fastest-rising acts. The group's 4th EP: No Genre, released last May, debuted at No. 62 on the Billboard 200, marking their fourth entry on the chart — an impressive streak for a rookie group less than two years into its career. BOYNEXTDOOR also achieved its first-ever No. 1 on the Billboard Japan Hot 100 with “Count to Love” from  BOYLIFE. Adding to their growing global presence, the sextet made a successful appearance at Lollapalooza. The team, which has been ranking high not only on the U.S. and global charts but also on Korean charts, made their comeback in October with new EP The Action.


	Yeh Shuhua is the youngest of the group. Originally a theater major at an arts high school, she shifted her dream from acting to K-pop after being captivated by its performance energy. Known for her bold, witty personality, she has shown remarkable improvement in vocals and stage presence since the group reorganized as five members.


	Inspired by Super Junior to pursue K-pop, Yuqi passed Cube Entertainment's audition and moved to Korea during high school. She regularly contributes to songwriting and composition, having co-written and composed “Giant” from her first solo single A Page. She released her first solo EP in 2024, followed by the single “Motivation” in 2025, further establishing herself as a multifaceted artist.


	Soyeon is the act's leader, main rapper and creative core. Before debut, she gained recognition through Produce 101 and Unpretty Rapstar 3. Since debuting in 2018, Soyeon has written, composed and produced most of i-dle's title tracks, shaping the team's distinct musical and visual identity. She continues to expand her influence as a producer.


	With her dreamy, otherworldly tone, Minnie broadens the group's identity. A prolific songwriter and composer, Minnie released her first solo mini-album HER in January, cementing her position as a producer/artist. Fluent in Thai, Korean and English, she continues to explore acting and fashion alongside her music career.


	Main vocalist Miyeon is known for her clear tone and steady vocal control. Beyond her flawless stage presence, her candid and down-to-earth charm endears her to fans. She released her first solo album in 2022 and co-produced the 2025 single “Sky Walking,” expanding her range as a singer/songwriter. Her solo project My Lover arrived last month.


	V is known for his soulful tone and striking visuals that captivate fans worldwide. His 2023 solo album Layover debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, marking the highest-charting position for a K-pop solo album to date. The title track “Slow Dancing” entered the Hot 100 at No. 51, while “Love Me Again” and “Rainy Days” also appeared on Billboard's global charts. After opening his Instagram account, he set multiple Guinness World Records by becoming the fastest person to surpass 1 million followers and then attained 65 million followers, solidifying his status as a globally influential artist whose every move draws attention.


	Born in Thailand, Lisa became YG Entertainment's first non-Korean artist and debuted in 2016 as BLACKPINK's rapper, dancer and vocalist. Her 2021 solo debut album LALISA entered the Hot 100, earning her global acclaim, while the B-side track “Money” became the first song by a K-pop solo artist to surpass 1 billion streams on Spotify.

	Born in New York to a Korean father and a French-American mother, Vernon moved to Korea at the age of 5. He was street-cast in middle school, which led him to become a trainee. Known for his distinct personal music style, Vernon, alongside Woozi, joined the Recording Academy this year. As a solo artist, he leans toward pop-punk and rock genres. Tracks like “Blackeye” and “Shining Star” highlight his cool vibes. Recently, he even took the stage holding his father's guitar during a concert performance.


	Seungkwan is SEVENTEEN's main vocalist. A well-known fan of Wonder Girls, he is both a performer and a K-pop enthusiast with a deep understanding of the scene, and he helped raise the group's public acknowledgement early in their career through appearances on variety shows. While he shows a bright and cheerful side as a member of BSS, his vocals reveal a more emotional and sensitive dimension. Known for his high notes and clear tone, Seungkwan often covers songs by female vocalists such as Taeyeon and IU. Recently, he showcased his deepened artistry by performing his solo track “Raindrops” on the piano during the latest concert.


	Talented in dance from childhood, The8 attended an art high school in Beijing before being cast. His stage name The8 symbolizes the number eight, which is considered lucky in China. Onstage, he stands out with a distinctive presence. Fans can catch his delicate artistic side in solo tracks like “Orbit” and “Star Crossing Night (feat. GALI).”


	DK, SEVENTEEN's main vocalist and leader of the BSS unit, was inspired to pursue singing in high school after watching the Korean rock band YB. Interestingly, he made his debut as a musical actor in 2019 with Artus-Excalibur. Known for his solid vocal skills, DK frequently participates in soundtracks and is also one of the members who performs the most cover songs, showcasing his versatile voice.


	Street-cast while walking home from middle school, Mingyu trained for almost four years. Starting with collaborations with brands like Louis Vuitton and Cartier, he quickly made his mark in the fashion scene among SEVENTEEN members. He currently serves as an ambassador for CK and Dior. As part of the hip-hop team, Mingyu previously released the single “Bittersweet (feat. Lee-Hi)” with Wonwoo in 2021. This year, he teamed up with S.Coups to form the unit CxM, taking his artistry to the next level. Their first EP, HYPE VIBES, reached No. 71 on the  Billboard 200.


	SEVENTEEN's main producer and leader of the vocal team, it's no exaggeration to say that most of the group's hit songs were created by Woozi. As of April 2025, he had 228 works registered with the Korea Music Copyright Association and joined the Recording Academy in July. Beyond his role as a producer, Woozi is also known for his impressive vocal tone and high notes. He completed his HxW activities in August before enlisting in the military in September.


	Hoshi is the leader of SEVENTEEN's performance team, deeply involved in the group's choreography. He also contributes to SEVENTEEN's image as a self-producing idol group alongside producer Woozi. He showcases choreography that perfectly fits his dance style in solo tracks like “Spider” and “Damage (HOSHI Solo) (feat. Timbaland).” While known for his impressive performance skills, Hoshi also possesses vocal abilities, which can be heard on solo tracks such as “Stay” and “I Want You Back.” Beyond his work with the BSS unit, Hoshi released new album BEAM and held a fan concert tour with Woozi under the unit HxW this year. Leading up to his enlistment in September, Hoshi shows his passion for music until the very end.


	Jun, along with The8, is one of SEVENTEEN's Chinese members. As a member of the performance team, he only began dancing after becoming a trainee, but with his natural physique, martial arts training and relentless practice, he quickly established himself with powerful dance lines. Originally a child actor, Jun continues his acting career. This August, the Chinese film The Shadow's Edge, starring Jun, drew 6.3 million viewers in just two days in China, marking a major box-office success. To check his conceptual and intense artistry, don't forget to watch his solo performance tracks like “Limbo” and “Psycho.”


	Joshua, born in Los Angeles, is known for his sweet vocal tone and strong singing ability, and he has actively participated in collaborative projects with international musicians. Alongside fellow vocal team member DK, he contributed to Pink Sweat$' “17 (feat. Joshua and DK of SEVENTEEN)” and the remix of New Kids on the Block's “Dirty Dancing (feat. Joshua, DK & Dino of SEVENTEEN).” In August, Joshua teamed up with singer/songwriter Dylan Matthew to release “Love Is Gone (Acoustic) (with JOSHUA of SEVENTEEN & Dylan Matthew).”


	Celebrating their 10th anniversary in 2025, SEVENTEEN's recent activities have been remarkable. The group released three albums, and their RIGHT HERE tour held 24 shows, selling 865,000 tickets and setting a record as one of Billboard's Top K-Pop Tours of 2024. As of September, four of the 13 members have enlisted in the military. The remaining nine members embarked on their NEW_ tour in September.


	S.COUPS, as the group's overall leader, plays a pivotal role in guiding SEVENTEEN.  2025 was a year that highlighted S.COUPS' presence onstage. Through the unit CxM launched with member Mingyu in September., S.COUPS showcased a wide range of musical versatility.


	In an interview with Billboard Korea, he expressed, “I believe that these new challenges as a unit will also contribute to the growth of SEVENTEEN as a team,” reflecting his enduring ambition. S.COUPS also made his Met Gala debut in 2025, marking him as the SEVENTEEN member who stood out most prominently this year.

The baby joins 8-year-old twins Nicholas and Lucy & 5-year-old daughter Mary.

Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	Enrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova now have a family of six.


	The longtime partners welcomed their fourth child last week, sharing on Instagram that their youngest was born Dec. 17. “My Sunshine 12.17.2025,” the joint post is captured, sharing a photo of the baby alongside a stuffed sloth. No details have been shared about the baby's name or sex.


	The baby joins 8-year-old twins Nicholas and Lucy, born in December 2017, and 5-year-old daughter Mary (nicknamed Masha), born in January 2020. Adorably, Iglesias also captioned his Instagram birth announcement for Mary in a similar fashion, writing at the time: “My Sunshine 01.30.2020.”

	











	The Spanish pop superstar and the Russian tennis player began dating in 2001, meaning next year will mark their 25th anniversary.


	Kournikova's last Instagram post before the baby announcement was a picture with her three older kids on Halloween, with the girls wearing matching pumpkin costumes and Mom in a yellow duck costume.


	In March 2024, Iglesias released his most recent album, Final (Vol. 2), featuring collaborations with Miranda Lambert, Belinda, El Alfa and Maria Becerra. The project debuted in the top 10 on Billboard‘s Latin Pop Albums, landing at No. 6.


	Iglesias holds the record for the most No. 1 songs on Billboard‘s Hot Latin Songs chart (27 songs) and the Latin Pop Airplay chart (24 songs). He's also landed 25 hits on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100, including two chart-toppers: the three-week No. 1 “Be With You” in 2000 and the two-week No. 1 “Bailamos” in 1999.

	Sean Ono Lennon says it's possible that future generations could lose touch with the music and legacy of The Beatles, a thought he admits once felt unimaginable.

	Speaking on CBS Sunday Morning, the 50-year-old musician and producer reflected on his role as a steward of his late father John Lennon's legacy — a responsibility he says has increasingly come into focus as culture, technology and listening habits continue to shift.

	“To forget about it? I do, actually,” Sean said when asked if he believed younger generations could one day move on from the Beatles' catalogue. “And I never did before.”


	Sean explained that while he has “technically” stepped into the role of caretaker for his father's work, following decades of stewardship by his mother Yoko Ono, he views the legacy as something shared with the wider world.


	“Obviously the world is also the custodian of his legacy,” he said. “I'm just doing my best to help make sure that the younger generation doesn't forget about The Beatles and John and Yoko. That's how I look at it.”


	The Beatles — completed by Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and the late George Harrison — remain one of the most influential acts in music history, with a catalogue that reshaped popular music from Please Please Me (1963) through Let It Be (1970). Still, Sean acknowledged that cultural relevance isn't guaranteed.

	











	“My parents gave me so much that I think it's the least I can do to try and support their legacy in my lifetime,” he said. “I feel like I just owe it to them. It's a personal thing.”


	Sean has continued to engage with his parents' work in contemporary ways. In 2023, he and filmmakers Dave Mullins and Brad Booker released the animated short War Is Over!, inspired by John and Yoko's 1971 song “Happy Xmas (War Is Over).” The film won win an Academy Award for short film (animated) in 2024.


	Reflecting on the message at the core of his parents' work, Sean described their legacy as rooted in more than idealism alone. 


	“It's peace and love,” he said, “but it's also an attitude toward activism that's done with humor and love.”

Sr. Charts & Data Analyst (Latin & Billboard Español)


Romeo Santos collects a 23rd No. 1 on Billboard's Latin Airplay chart with “Lokita Por Mí,” alongside Prince Royce, extending his own record for the most No. 1s among acts that primarily record tropical music.

	Royce, meanwhile, holds the second spot among tropical acts with 20 No. 1s. He also ties with Karol G for the 10th-most No. 1s across all genres. Additionally, the song climbs from No. 3 to No. 1 on the Tropical Airplay chart.

	











	Here are the 11 acts with the largest collection of No. 1s on the overall Latin Airplay chart since its inception in 1994:


Count, Artist39, J Balvin36, Ozuna32, Enrique Iglesias30, Bad Bunny29, Daddy Yankee25, Maluma24, Shakira24, Wisin23, Romeo Santos20, Karol G20, Prince Royce


RainNao's First: Puerto Rican singer-songwriter RaiNao, celebrates her first No. 1 on a Billboard chart as her collab with Bad Bunny, “Perfumito Nuevo,” claims the top spot on the Latin Rhythm Airplay chart. The track rises 4-1 after two weeks in the top 10.


	“Perfumito Nuevo” secures the No. 1 spot with the Greatest Gainer honors, after registering 6.3 million audience impressions, up 30%, earned during the tracking period. Plus, the song flies 21-6 on the overall Latin Airplay chart for its first week in the top 10. For Benito, the new win adds a 37th top 10 to his ledger, RaiNao scores her first.

					By Max Goldbart 

International TV Co-Editor


Russell Brand has been charged with two more counts of rape and sexual assault. 


	The Metropolitan Police said in a statement that the Forgetting Sarah Marshall star's charges relate to two further women on top of the previous charges, which were two of rape, one of indecent assault and two of sexual assault.


	He will appear in court on January 20 next year in relation to the charges. Six months later, his trial starts for the other charges, for which he has pleaded not guilty. He has previously denied all charges against him and said he is “incredibly grateful” to be able to defend the charges in court.

	“The women who have made reports, including those connected to the two new charges, continue to receive support from specially trained officers,” said the UK's Metropolitan Police today. “The Met's investigation remains ongoing, and detectives urge anyone affected by this case, or anyone with information, to come forward and speak with police.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Detectives started investigating Brand around two years ago following a Channel 4 and Sunday Times investigation. 


	They then charged the former comedian and TV presenter with one count of rape, one count of indecent assault, one count of oral rape and two counts of sexual assault. 


	Given that Brand had been living in the U.S. full time and is something of a friend of MAGA, an extradition battle had been expected, but he appeared in court in London for pre-trial hearings.


	The initial revelations on Channel 4 and in the Sunday Times led to much anger and introspection. Since then, the BBC, Channel 4 and Big Brother producer Banijay have all led internal probes, having worked with Brand on shows up until late last decade. All these probes have led to apologies and further revelations. The most recent report from the BBC found that staff at the UK broadcaster's L.A. bureau had “joked about” an incident in which the star was alleged to have exposed himself to a woman in a bathroom. Channel 4's report unearthed “two new worrying allegations” against Brand, who had worked on that network's Celebrity Bake Off as recently as 2018.

	











	Brand was also accused in a lawsuit of sexually assaulting a film extra on the New York City set of the 2011 romantic comedy Arthur.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


	The 60 Minutes segment that was pulled by CBS News editor in chief Bari Weiss appeared across social media on Monday afternoon, when a Canadian outlet reportedly posted it online.


	The segment features interviews with Venezuelan deportees who were sent by the Trump administration to the harsh CECOT prison in El Salvador. According to The Globe and Mail, Global TV — the outlet that airs 60 Minutes in Canada — had featured the segment on its app before it was taken down, apparently appearing by mistake.


	Among those featured in the segment is Luis Munoz Pinto, who described being beaten and sexually assaulted. He said that he was detained by customs officers as he was awaiting asylum proceedings but had no criminal record.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The segment does not include a sit-down with any Trump administration official, but it does feature a clip of Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt defending the practice, saying: “These are heinous murderers. Rapists. Murderers. Kidnappers. Sexual assaulters. Predators who have no right to be in this country and they must be held accountable.”


RELATED: ‘60 Minutes' Correspondent Slams CBS News Decision To Pull Segment On Trump Deportations, Says Move Was Political, Not Editorial


	The report cited statistics gathered by Human Rights Watch that nearly half of those the U.S. sent to the prison had no criminal history. In the segment, correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi said 60 Minutes reviewed the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement data and it “confirms the findings of Human Rights Watch.” Alfonsi said that the Department of Homeland Security “declined our request for an interview” and referred questions about the prison to the government of El Salvador, which did not respond.

	











	Just hours before 60 Minutes was to air, CBS News announced that the segment was being pulled but would appear at a future date.


	Alfonsi later sent an email to staffers objecting to the decision to pull it, saying that it was not an editorial move but a “political” one and amounted to corporate interference.


	In a call with staffers on Monday morning, Weiss said that while the story “presented powerful testimony of torture at CECOT,” it did not advance the topic, noting that The New York Times and other outlets have done similar work. “The public knows that Venezuelans have been subjected to horrific treatment at this prison. To run a story on this subject two months later, we need to do more. And this is 60 Minutes. We need to be able to get the principals on the record and on camera,” she said. According to The Times, Weiss suggested that they interview Stephen Miller, the architect of the Trump administration's deportation policy, and provided contact information to the 60 Minutes staff.


	A White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. CBS News also has not commented on the appearance of the segment online.


	Now that the segment is out there, any changes made to the broadcast will be matched up to the new one. With FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez and others criticizing the decision to pull the segment, if a new version does air it will likely get heavy before-and-after scrutiny.

					By Jill Goldsmith 

Co-Business Editor


	Warner Bros Discovery on Monday confirmed receipt of Paramount's amended, unsolicited tender offer and “consistent with its fiduciary duties and in consultation with its independent financial and legal advisors, will carefully review and consider” it.


Paramount Skydance has offered to acquire all of WBD's outstanding shares for $30 each in cash. Its sixth and previous bid had been unanimously rebuffed by WBD's board, which, instead, inked a deal to sell its studio and streaming assets to Netflix after a speedy auction. Paramount took its case directly to shareholders with a hostile tender offer December 8. The amended offer it presented this morning was not higher monetarily but addressed a series of concerns raised by WBD, led by CEO David Zaslav.

	











	“The WBD Board carefully reviewed the December 8 Tender Offer and determined that it provided inadequate value and imposed numerous significant risks and costs on WBD and its stockholders, and did not meet the criteria of a “Superior Proposal” under the Netflix Merger Agreement. The Board is not modifying its recommendation with respect to the Netflix Merger Agreement. Warner Bros. Discovery will review the Amended Tender Offer and advise its stockholders of the Board's recommendation after the completion of that review,” WBD said.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“Warner Bros. Discovery stockholders are advised not to take any action at this time with respect to the amended Paramount Skydance tender offer.”


	WBD shareholders have until January 21 to tender their shares to Paramount under the amended proposal, which now includes a $40.4 billion personal equity financing guarantee by Larry Ellison (the Oracle co-founder and father of Paramount CEO David Ellison); an enhanced $5.8 billion breakup fee; and increased financial flexibility during an interim period.

	











	Par's previous offer included a financing backstop commitment by the Ellison Family Revocable Trust but not personally by Ellison, a situation that WBD explained in an SEC filing last week that it considered too risky.


	In an interview on CNBC today, RedBird Capital founder and managing partner Gerry Cardinale, a partner with the Ellisons in Paramount Skydance, called the trust issue a “red herring that is out there and preventing our offer from getting vetted and taken seriously, so we took it off the table. It is now off the table.”

Netflix = Movie theatre industry killers period, they have shown but disdain to theatrical releases which greatly serves  as the locomotive that pulls movie titles ! Go Paramount!!!

It will be a real shame is netflix owns those IPs. What has netflix done well since season 1 of stranger things? N O T H I N G. But they've produced stinker after stinker. They'll bury DC comics. I for one am rooting for paramount. I think the day that netflix acquires WB will be a dark day. Worse than Disney acquiring Lucas films.

One of Paramount's talking points is that it will serve as a good home for Warner's CNN, a news outlet with a storied brand but a troubled business outlook. Every time Weiss blunders, it raises a cloud over Paramount's ability to steady media properties. Amid a difficult operating climate —

This is utter hogwash, this is how you silence a story that impacts the civil rights of many people who are poor and unable to defend themselves.

Paramount & Skydance media care less about the truth and more about their narrative by selling a fiction to the American people about the harsh impact of a lawless president who behaves like a circus monkey.

The reality is that our FCC is suppose to work to protect our airwaves from becoming a soundboard for one agent or party that attempts to control what is broadcast as truth or fiction.

This same FCC took no action to hold Fox News accountable for violating this basic trust when they admitted in court they would pay $ 850 million for selling a fictional story about election fraud…

There is a limit in place to protect our airwaves from the potential harm of a single narrative that has a limit of 39% of airwave dominance by a single media group, yet it's crystal clear this is how our democracy is now under attack.

Yes by nefarious actors who care less about the truth and a more successful storyline of ending our free democratic country as we have known it for the last 250 years.  

What they have done in undermining 60 minutes independence demonstrates clearly that sky dance and the Ellison family have no intent on providing a Free Press anymore than Jeff Bezos was willing to give the Washington Post a clear unobstructed mandate to stay out of their business and provide the public with the truth no matter how painful it was for him and his buddies.

shareholders will come back for love of david… which one?

There was a time — 6 years ago? — when WB seriously considered going after Paramount if only to get Star Trek, Mission and the other tv library assets.

nflx just wants to own batman, dc, barbie, etc. so soon all they need is some ai and their plan to be redbox direct is complete.

					By Pete Hammond 

Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic


	“I am always on pins and needles before a film opens. It is less about the reviews for me than whether people show up or not,” James Cameron told me when I interviewed him about the release of Avatar: Fire and Ash. 


	Surprising? I thought so, coming from a man whose films have grossed more $8 billion and hold three of the four spots in the top-grossing films of all time with Avatar at No. 1, Avatar: The Way of Water third and Titanic fourth, after being No. 1 for a generation. So wondering if people are going to show up is indeed a bit surprising, but until he sees how the new film plays out over the holidays and into the new year is something he demands before committing to doing a fourth in the series — even if the stories and scripts are completed for the initially planned five-part franchise.

	











	Well, the film opened Friday and earned $89 million over the weekend and has about $347 million worldwide. Not bad, but Cameron knows the cost of these films is enormous, and he is cautious about giving the next one a green light even though they have shot some footage with the kids from Fire and Ash but only because as he says the next film will take a big leap in time. He looks at these most recent two Avatars (shot simultaneously) as kind of his Dune 1 and 2. The next two — “should we get to make them” he says — would be another completely different set of two films.

	Cameron joins me for this week's episode of my Deadline video series Behind the Lens to talk about a wide variety of things, beginning with Titanic, which with is tied for most Oscar nominations ever (14) and most Oscar wins with 11. He says his inspiration was David Lean's Doctor Zhivago, a love story set against a big canvas. He talks about the strategy of releasing it at Christmas 1997, where it could play into the new year. Boy did it ever, landing an unheard-of 16 weeks at No. 1 and a near-$2 billion gross.


	About not knowing whether there will be more Avatars, he says: “I always say ‘if,' but will it be profitable enough, and only we will know that.” We talk about the origin of the idea for Avatar, which initially came about with him as CEO of the new company Digital Domain with the idea to push to the ultimate limit the art of CGI. So he wrote it but tells me that, in 1995, “it was so ultimate that nobody knew how to do it!” It took another 14 years or so, but they did it.

	We also talk about the process of working with the actors in the films, how that is the most important and most misunderstood aspect. He thinks performance capture is second only to actual theater acting as the purist form of the actor's craft, and he explains why. We also talk about why the urgent message of Avatar: Fire and Ash is remarkably important, more now that ever considering the state of America and the world, ironically saying it is incredible that Avatar can get you rooting against your own species.


	We also talk upcoming projects including one close to his heart and another warning for the world, with Ghosts of Hiroshima following the paths of two young men who not only survived one nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima near the end of WWII but then another when they returned home to Nagasaki. He believes the story that cries out for empathy and connection has parallels to Avatar in some ways and tells me when he plans to make this film, claiming the challenge for him is he still doesn't know quite how to do it.

	I also get news on his long-gestating desire to reboot the 1966 sci-fi classic Fantastic Voyage. He will produce it and says he is working with a director on a new script and thinks it could move forward in a big way this coming year.

Hailey Bieber revealed her toned abs in a sexy selfie that also showed off her enviable view of the beach.

The Rhode Beauty founder sported a yellow t-shirt she hiked up to show her midriff, which she paired with  a pair of tiny polka-dot ruffle shorts, in a picture she shared on her Instagram Stories Monday. 

She accessorized with a black-and-white Playboy Hello Kitty baseball hat.

Bieber's beachside selfie showed her sunny surroundings despite it being late December, giving the perfect view of the ocean.

She later shared a pic of her husband, Justin Bieber, on her Instagram Stories, wearing a blue t-shirt reading “Brain is for lovers.” 

The picture appears to be from their recent trip to Japan, which Hailey shared on Instagram earlier this month.

“👔🗼🇯🇵 best city,” she wrote of their trip, which included their 1-year-old son, Jack Blues.

The model, 29, recently switched up her hair to a supermodel bob reminiscent of '90s icon Christy Turlington.

The soft, flipped-out cut recalls Turlington's longer bobs from the late '90s and early aughts — not to be confused with the viral “Christy cut” that trended on TikTok earlier this year, which referenced the supermodel's shorter, shaggy pixie-bob hybrid from 1991.

Meanwhile, Hailey and Justin, 31, have been spending plenty of quality time together.

The two were snapped out and about in Los Angeles late last month, days after she celebrated her 29th birthday on Nov. 22.

The sighting came after some fans believed the “Peaches” singer snubbed her on her birthday. Fans noticed that Justin didn't share a birthday post on social media for his wife, and that he was also absent from her pre-birthday dinner party hosted by Rhode Skin.

Many pointed out that he was present at both Kris Jenner and Kendall Jenner's recent birthday bashes.

But the couple once again proved they were solid despite constant speculation about their marriage. 

Justin shared romantic snaps of him and Hailey cuddling on Nov. 27, and she later shared a picture showing her husband did in fact attend her birthday celebration.

Travis Kelce wrote a heartfelt letter to the “love of [his] life,” Taylor Swift, before her final Eras Tour shows.

The emotional moment Swift read the letter aloud backstage, ahead of her Vancouver performance on Dec. 6, 2024, was shown during Episode 6 of her “End of an Era” docuseries.

“So many unbelievable memories on this tour, but my favorite one is seeing you in concert for the first time,” the letter began.

The pop star read the next line with a giggle: “Being mesmerized and swept off my feet by a woman who doesn't even know me.”

“I selfishly say thank you for creating this legendary tour, and to [tour manager] Robert [Allen] for making you stop through Kansas City, Mo. That night in KC was the beginning of me meeting the love of my life,” Kelce's letter concluded.

The NFL star was referring to the moment he attended the Eras Tour at Arrowhead Stadium on July 8, 2023, and famously tried — and failed — to give the singer a friendship bracelet with his number on it.

He later went on his “New Heights” podcast to tell his listeners he was upset because she “didn't want to meet” him.

Despite them missing a connection at that show, the pair began quietly “hanging out” two months later and have been a power couple ever since.

The docuseries highlights how the three-time Super Bowl winner was a huge source of emotional support for Swift throughout her grueling tour.

This was particularly shown when he was the first call she made after her return to the stage in London days after a failed terrorist attack at Austria's Ernst Happel Stadium, where she was supposed to perform.

“Baby, it's like the crowd knew that I needed a pick-me-up. They were — when I walked out on stage, they were wilder than I've ever seen,” she gushed, as he let her know that he could hear the joy in her voice.

“I'm so happy to be back to doing this in a functional way. Like, I was so happy that I thought I was going to forget how to play guitar and sing,” she added.

The couple has publicly supported each other in their respective careers, a dynamic that the Grammy winner gushed about during Episode 4 of the docuseries.

In the episode, Swift explained how the tight end is the “right fit” for her because their “passions coexist and actually fuel each other.”

“Ultimately we love cheering each other on,” the songstress added. “That's rad.”

She even brought the athlete out as a surprise guest during the London stop of her Eras Tour, because according to her, “Travis is like a real yes guy in terms of life itself. He's just up for anything.”

“The End of an Era” is available to stream on Disney+.

Rob and Michele's kids Jake and Romy will honor their parents with a memorial service following their gruesome murders.

“Jake and Romy Reiner remain grateful for the outpouring of love and support they have received,” a statement from the siblings' spokesperson provided to People on Monday read.  

“They will share information about a memorial service honoring their parents at a later date.” 

Reps for the Reiner family were not immediately available to Page Six for comment. 

Rob, 78, and Michele, 70, were stabbed at their Los Angeles home on Sunday, Dec. 14. Sources told The Post it was Romy who made the horrific discovery of the slain director and allegedly told officers that her brother Nick should be a person of interest.

Later that evening, Nick was was arrested for the murder of his parents. 

A rep for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office told Page Six that the 32-year-old was taken to Parker Center Jail in Downtown Los Angeles and later transferred to Twin Towers Correctional Facility where he is being held without bail and reportedly on suicide watch. 

Nick was charged with two counts of first-degree murder with a special circumstance of multiple murders on Tuesday, Dec. 16. 

He made his first court appearance on Wednesday, Dec. 17. He was shackled at both hands and feet and wore an anti-suicide smock.

Following the short hearing, Nick's lawyer — famed criminal defense attorney Alan Jackson — announced to reporters outside the courthouse that an arraignment has been scheduled for Jan. 7. 

Jake, 34, and Romy, 28, also released a joint statement following the hearing.

“Words cannot even begin to describe the unimaginable pain we are experiencing every moment of the day. The horrific and devastating loss of our parents, Rob and Michele Reiner, is something that no one should ever experience. They weren't just our parents; they were our best friends,” they said via a rep.

“We are grateful for the outpouring of condolences, kindness and support we have received not only from family and friends but people from all walks of life.”

The pair added, “We now ask for respect and privacy, for speculation to be tempered with compassion and humanity and for our parents to be remembered for the incredible lives they lived and the love they gave.”

The two made no mention of their brother.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Originality doomed the Safdie brothers' 48 Hrs remake","https://www.avclub.com/safdie-brothers-48-hours-remake-cancelled","Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:26:50 GMT","

Even before the Safdie brothers gave audiences a panic attack with Uncut Gems, Josh and Benny Safdie, along with longtime co-writer Ronald Bronstein, planned to remake 48 Hrs, based on the Nick Nolte-Eddie Murphy two-hander directed by Walter Hill. Initially announced in 2017, the Safdies' version was originally a vehicle for comedian Jerrod Carmichael. By the time Uncut Gems hit theaters, the project had evolved. In 2019, they told The A.V. Club that it was no longer a remake.

“Walter Hill came to a Gems screening,” Josh Safdie told us at the time. “I'd heard that he had seen Good Time and was a fan of that. He really liked Uncut Gems, too. The Driver is one of my favorite movies. 48 Hrs is great, but The Driver is his masterpiece. And I said, ‘Let's just get this out of the way immediately. We're not remaking your movie.' And he said, ‘Okay. It's weird, I watch these two movies and think that these guys are not short on original ideas. Like, why would they need to do a remake?' [Laughs.] So what happened was, we wrote a few drafts for the studio, and it just wasn't a remake. We tried, but I just don't know how to do it. Maybe the general structure was kind of 48 Hrs. And there was a cop and an inmate. But it's going to be re-shifted into something original.”

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Paramount felt the same way. The script was no longer a remake, and apparently, the studio had no interest in an original script from them. On a recent episode of Deadline's Crew Call podcast, Safdie explained what happened, and it's really as simple as it wasn't the 48 Hrs remake Paramount asked for. “We wrote a remake of 48 Hrs for Paramount, and they read it, and they were like, ‘This isn't a remake, what is this? This is an original film.' We're like, ‘Sorry, we tried.'” That's what they get for writing an original film. Still, apology accepted. We'd still like to see whatever they were working on.

The cat is out of the bag yet again. After trailers playing in theaters last week seemed to confirm that Chris Evans' Steve Rogers will return in 2026's Avengers: Doomsday, Marvel finally released the footage to those of us who haven't bought a ticket for Avatar: Fire And Ash yet. The clip also confirms that the film will hit theaters on December 18, 2026. 

Otherwise, the clip doesn't reveal too much. Steve pulls up to a country home aboard his bike, Triumph. Inside, he holds and gazes lovingly at an infant. Is this his infant? Perhaps, or perhaps Steve has picked up a couple of babysitting gigs now that he's no longer Captain America. We will find out more in a year! 

Evans' return for Doomsday—which kicked off its hype cycle at San Diego Comic Con in 2024 by confirming another major Avengers actor would return—has been speculated for a while. Deadline reported last December that Evans would return not as Captain America but as Steve Rogers. “Yeah, no—happily retired!” Evans told Esquire the following month, lamenting that “This always happens. I mean, it happens every couple years—ever since Endgame. I've just stopped responding to it.” In June, Evans, who at the time was promoting Materialists with Fantastic Four star Pedro Pascal, told ScreenRant, “It's sad to not be back with the band, but I'm sure they're doing something incredible.” How sad could it have been, really?

Sam Rosenberg's monthly column CineMusic highlights newly released film scores and soundtracks and the composers/curators behind them. In this first installment, Sam speaks with Daniel Blumberg about his rousing score for Mona Fastvold's historical/musical drama The Testament of Ann Lee.

It's been a few weeks since I saw Mona Fastvold's The Testament of Ann Lee for the second time and I still haven't gotten its score and soundtrack out of my head. Arriving in theaters this week, the film is an expressionistic biopic about the titular leader of the Shakers, a 19th century religious movement whose form of worship consisted of rhythmic, ecstatic dancing. Daniel Blumberg, who got started in bands like Cajun Dance Party and Yuck before winning the Academy Award for Best Original Score earlier this year for The Brutalist, composed the music for Ann Lee while also adapting a few Shaker spirituals and writing and performing an original song, “Clothed by the Sun,” with star Amanda Seyfried. Additionally, he makes a brief cameo in the film as a deacon to a fear-mongering preacher-turned-Shaker convert played by Tim Blake Nelson.

Similar to his thrilling work on The Brutalist, Blumberg's score for The Testament of Ann Lee is visceral and rousing, filled with ominous piano plinks, riveting string arrangements, and even some electric guitar shreds. Its rich, stirring instrumentation also embodies the ambition and disillusionment of its protagonist, who, like Laszlo Tøth, sought to exorcise their trauma through a creative endeavor amid an intense cultural turning point. But unlike The Brutalist, Ann Lee is an all-out musical drama, with its characters often breaking out into rapturous song and choreography in the hopes of getting closer to a higher spiritual power that could liberate them from their pain.

Over Zoom, Blumberg discussed more about his recording and research process, working extensively on set, and using handbells to support one the film's most climactic scenes. This interview has been edited for clarity.

Paste Magazine: Just to start off, congratulations on the film. I've seen it twice now and I really enjoyed it, especially the music. I'm curious to know what the research process was that went into adapting the music from the Shaker movement. Were there specific songs that you found that you felt fit the story, or did Mona and Brady [Corbet] note them in the script and ask you to adapt them?

Daniel Blumberg: There were placeholders in the script for when they wanted songs to happen, but we approached it quite openly. Mona said it's possible for it to be all original songs—whatever feels right—so we just met up in New York as soon as The Brutalist was done to start putting this together, meeting up every day and going through thousands of hymns and spirituals. Our starting point was just looking at those. They're really informal melodies that you can access quite easily. We just started looking at words. Some of the songs just have syllables as the lyrics, so “va vi vam.” I was just immersing myself in the history of the Shaker music and then we started experimenting.

There were some bits that sounded relevant to  moments in the narrative. The reason why Mona asked me to score her last film [The World to Come], which was my first film score, was because she had listened to all my song records. I'm a songwriter and I make song records, so she was very encouraging for me to approach it like that. I was just finding the balance between doing something that felt really within [the Shaker] tradition, but also knowing that you're not making a documentary. You're making a fable about Ann Lee, so it was just drawing on the traditions. They didn't have instruments and we decided to use more instruments as we went on. A lot of it's based around this idea that there was this documentation of them being quite free at the beginning with their songs and singing. I relayed that to these improvising singers that I go and see in London, particularly Bill Minton and Maggie Nichols.

You've worked with both Mona and Brady before. Are your collaborations with each of them different or is there overlap in how they work with you, especially since they already work so close together as creative and romantic partners?

They're very different people, so they're definitely different to work with. Obviously, it's within the family, but I have slightly different ways of working with both of them. It both comes from the same place, which is trust and the fact that we both think that we can make something good together and that we'll push each other. It's quite a simple thing, but it's quite actually a big starting point for a collaboration because essentially, I'm helping Mona or Brady make their piece of work. I love films more than I love film scores. I never really listened to film scores. I got into film through directors, so I love working with directors where I wanna see this script become a film and it feels like an honor to be part of the process.

Before working on the score, were you familiar with Ann Lee and her teachings? If not, did you try to insulate yourself from knowing more about her so you wouldn't feel too influenced? Or did you find it more beneficial to absorb who she was in order to have a stronger grasp on how to compose the score?

I just immersed myself as much as possible in the Shakers. For example, I boiled over all of the books about their music and also lots of their drawings. They did beautiful drawings. I really love those. I do drawings as well. I really like some of their books that I found on their furniture. You never really know what the way in will be for the film, but I didn't prescribe a “I don't wanna know too much about them” or anything like that because there was just a lot of work to do. I was doing it with Mona as well, so we went to the Hancock settlement and I was talking to the music people there. Seeing their construction firsthand, you get a feeling just from being around there that you are literally in the same place where Ann Lee was. You get different ingredients to harness your instincts.

The fact is when I'm recording in the studio with musicians, what's the part of me that knows that it's a good take or that it's sounding correct for that scene or for the world? Being on set really helps. I was on set for the whole of this film. I was having meetings with all the heads of department in pre-production and they're talking about a visual language or a different side of things, but all of those are giving me clues as to what world we're making together for this film.

Then, obviously, eventually, you start seeing the pictures, the celluloid, and the performances and all of these ingredients start to just influence the decisions you make musically. I worked early on The Brutalist, but with this, I was part of every bit of it in terms of the edit and then sound mix. By the end of it, you know together what you feel is the right move.

At the start, we were trying to decide what songs to put in. I wrote John's running song because [Mona] wanted to change the pace in that moment in the film. Some words were inspired by the description of them finding a settlement. There just comes a point where you think that that will work, but yeah, I didn't put a cap on how much information I knew or not.



It's so funny you brought up the running song because that's one of my favorites from the movie. It's so goofy and fun, which is such a stark contrast to the rest of the soundtrack and score.

At that point in the script, we wanted a lighter, quite funny moment. I wrote this piece on the keyboard that was quite a late edition. I don't really read and write music on manuscript. I dunno what I pressed on the piano, but they were very strange chords. They wanted a choir to sing it—the “doo beep boo da doop!” My cousin's in this amateur choir that meets every Tuesday afternoon and she showed me a video of them singing and I thought, oh, maybe they'd be good for this film. So I worked with the conductor of this amateur choir and this guy wrote out all of my strange keyboard parts into manuscript that they all sung. It sounded bonkers. We recorded with a lot of different mic setups so that we could put the sounds all around the woods when we got into the sound mix. There's people singing around the whole cinema. The spatialization of that song was really fun to do with the sound mixer Steve Single. That was really intricate, that mix. That was definitely the funnest song.

In addition to that song, another song I love is “Hunger & Thirst,” mainly because Amanda Seyfried sings the title over and over in a way that's almost hypnotic. Was this a Shaker spiritual that you kept mostly intact? How much of that and the other spirituals did you reinterpret?

That was quite a breakthrough for us. I remember I sent it to Mona. We would normally work during the day and then I would spend the evening and night doing demos. The melodies are so simple. There's literally a Shaker hymn called “Hunger & Thirst.” There's versions of that song everywhere on the Internet, like loads of people singing that. I kept the lyrics, but I put a mid eight in it and put more minor chords underneath it. Mona was really excited about that. When I woke up in the afternoon, I had all these texts on my phone. She'd listened to it when she woke up and she was saying, “This is exactly what we need to do.”

She liked that it was totally a Shaker song, but also sounded like one of my songs from one of my records. Then, I wrote it with Amanda in mind and had to change the key for her. She sings in a different key. It was cool because that was one that was really elevated in terms of using more reverb than other places in the film. This is where she transcends the Earth and she soars up. She connects to heaven. We just went wild. Steve Nobles played church bells on that. Really beautiful sounds with these church bells we got hold of. He was scraping the edges of these really resonant church bells and had a choir pad, just chords from that amateur choir. It also sounded like a musical to me. It was like a pop song.

One of the things that was interesting as well was “Beautiful Treasures,” which is [Amanda's] first big solo song. That's in the reel before, so it's not that far away from “Hunger & Thirst” and the difference between our approaches to those two songs was a big conversation. For example, there are a lot of live vocals in “Beautiful Treasures” because we wanted it to really be in the room, so I used a lot of vocals from her dance and breaths on set. The violins were really dry. The sound of her moving her hand across the floor—it was really in the room. We had to be really careful with the mood of that song because it's so sad with the stillbirths. It's heavy material. Those two big songs coming quite close together—we had very different approaches to each of them in terms of production and singing on set.

Also, “Hunger & Thirst” was a oner, so she performed that in one go, which was amazing. And when I say she performed it, the cinematographer Will Rexer shot that in one take on 35mm. We recorded [Amanda's] vocals on Sunday, and then on Tuesday, we were shooting it. That was one of the moments where I was really impressed. I really enjoyed working with Amanda. We very instantly clicked. With “Hunger & Thirst,” she was mouthing to playback while she was dancing and I had to sit and watch her lips when she was performing, just to make sure they wouldn't have any issues in the edit because you can't really mess with the song too much. Her vocals are just banged on. She'd learn her performance at night after shooting for the whole day. “Beautiful Treasures” had a lot of live vocals and I was trying to retain that live energy. I was choosing which bits would be live and which bits would be playback, just depending on what the actual intention of the song was in the film.

There's another song that stands out, which is the one with the electric guitar that plays during the solar eclipse scene. Even though it's a more contemporary touch, it feels fitting in reflecting the epicness of the moment. I'm curious what went into incorporating that part into the score.

The idea of the electric guitar was in the script. When [Mona and Brady] write their scripts, they always write the musical cues. Sometimes, they might say “orchestral swell” and I don't really use orchestras, so it's like a note saying that it's gonna be a big thing happening, or something. I remember the first time I read the script and it said “electric guitar screech.” But in the end, the electric guitar only came in at that point. I tried electric guitar on various points throughout the process and it felt really exciting when it comes in, when [Lewis Pullman's character] is basically encouraging people to join their movement. I found that song, “Bow Down O Zion,” and I made this epic outro where he starts the song off encouraging these people and then they all join in at the end and they're like, we are with you, and the electric guitar comes in. I just made the lyrics saying about the mother's devotion to set us all free.

The singer from Low, Alan Sparhawk, is doing backing vocals, which is nice. I stayed with Alan and Mimi [Parker]. We've done a lot of touring together and recording at their house. I thought of them a lot during this process, ‘cause they're religious and always singing in their household and on tour. It's a very genuine part of their lives. It was really beautiful that Alan came and sang on that. I thought it was nice that he sang on that song specifically ‘cause of the fuzzed out guitars, which are quite associated with Low and my music. I actually used Mark Hollis' amplifier for that eclipse, which is quite an interesting, weird thing that happened. I have his Champ and Mark Hollis is a musician I really love. I have his Fender Champ and the first time I used the amp was on the eclipse.

I noticed you had a little cameo in the movie as Tim Blake Nelson's deacon. I'm curious to know what it was like being on set and performing with the other actors.

I was on set the whole time because I had to make sure microphones were in the right place and playback was happening in the right way. I had an engineer with me, Danny, and we had our Pro Tools session. Just technically, there was a lot of stuff to make sure would work so that when they received all the footage, it would be in sync and Sofía [Subercaseaux] would be able to edit without having to problem solve and all that stuff. I was recording all the actors during that process, so they would come and record their vocals at my Airbnb when they had time off shooting. Everyone was very close. Amanda would come and record at my Airbnb. After shooting for ten hours, 12 hours, she'd come and we'd have some wine and record.

One thing that I really liked was there were some singers we knew would be part of the score. Maggie Nichols, who's this seminal improvising singer, does an amazing performance right at the start of the film, just before you see their first prayer together, the big dance sequence. Then, Josephine Foster, who's an incredible folk artist. I did the credit song for The World to Come with Josephine. We always wanted her to be in the film. For me, it was a really nice link between what you're seeing on the screen and these beautiful voices in the score. Obviously, it's the same case with the actors, but there's also a lot of vocal sounds and Maggie did a whole improvisation to the whole film that we were mixing in throughout the sound mix and revoicing some of the Hungarian extras with these singers. There's no one who sings like Josephine. It was really great to have her in the film. I got to put her voice in the funeral sequence as well, so it was really nice to have a link between the sounds and the score.

In the same way that when you see Ann ringing the bell at the end in the Shaker village, there's a really nice link between all the handbells that are in the next scene with all the fire. There's 50 or 60 handbells being rung and that kind of dissonant sound is when it's all burning down. Just loads of handbells. I had about 50 handbells in my flat in London that I rented out. They were so beautiful and I used them for the whole film. Because the actors were singing in different keys that worked with their vocal range, I had to rent all of the handbells in five different octaves. When they were just laid out on my floor, I thought, what would it sound like to hear all of them rung at the same time?

So my friend Kenichi came over and we just spent about two hours just ringing all of the bells one by one. It sounds crazy. You have the idea and it doesn't sound like a good idea, but that really worked. It sounds louder than it is because there's all these dissonant notes. When there's two notes on the chromatic scale, it creates this atonal dissonance, so it all sounds quite abrasive. It has a really strong sound that it's almost like putting my fingers in my ears, just on the cusp of that. It's a very extreme moment. The fact that that can exist, that extremity, and then the extremity of Amanda Seyfried singing “Beautiful Treasures” and “Hunger & Thirst,” those two things existing in one picture, was something that we were literally trying to achieve for those extremes to make sense. That was something from the start, we were trying to find ways of pushing that.

What was your favorite or the most meaningful song to compose?

I love all the songs we ended up using. I love “Down to the Deep” and the way that that chorus hits. They all have their own space in the film. It was quite a diverse set of songs. I guess the newest one for me was the song at the end. I was quite skeptical of putting a song at the end, but I'm quite happy with how that turned out. That's quite nice, ‘cause we've been singing and we've been doing some gigs as well together, me and Amanda, and that's a nice one to play.

Rob and Michele Reiner's children have shared an emotional update on plans to honor their parents following the tragic and devastating deaths of the beloved filmmaker and his wife.

In a heartfelt statement, Jake and Romy Reiner, said a memorial service will be held at a later date.

In the statement, Jake and Romy Reiner, expressed deep gratitude for the support they have received since their parents' passing.

“Jake and Romy Reiner remain grateful for the outpouring of love and support they have received,” their spokesperson told PEOPLE on Monday, December 22.

It continued, “They will share information about a memorial service honoring their parents at a later date.”

Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner were found dead on Dec. 14 in their home in Brentwood, California.

Their son, Nick Reiner, was arrested the same day and is charged with two counts of first-degree murder.

The news shocked Hollywood and communities worldwide, leading to an outpouring of tributes from colleagues, friends and fans.

Family of the Reiners were recently seen gathering in images obtained by TMZ.

Jake and Romy Reiner originally broke their silence on Wednesday, December 17, with a heartfelt message.

“Words cannot even begin to describe the unimaginable pain we are experiencing every moment of the day. The horrific and devastating loss of our parents, Rob and Michele Reiner, is something that no one should ever experience. They weren't just our parents; they were our best friends,” the two wrote.

They added, “We are grateful for the outpouring of condolences, kindness, and support we have received not only from family and friends but people from all walks of life.”

The two asked for privacy during this difficult time.

Rob's work as an actor and director left a lasting mark on film and television, while Michele's presence as a creative spirit and supportive partner was treasured by loved ones who knew her.

The children's message reflected both heartfelt sorrow and a determination to honor their parents with dignity when the time is right.

Friends and colleagues have already begun sharing memories of the couple — recounting Rob's sharp wit and heartfelt guidance, his skill as a storyteller, and Michele's artistic eye and warm presence.

Many tributes have described the pair as generous mentors, loyal friends and people whose warmth extended far beyond their professional successes.

Reiner's career spanned decades and genres.

He first gained fame as Michael “Meathead” Stivic on “All in the Family” before transitioning to a celebrated directing career with films such as “This Is Spinal Tap,” “Stand by Me,” “When Harry Met Sally…” and “A Few Good Men,” beloved for their humanity, humor and emotional resonance.

Michele Singer Reiner, a photographer and creative collaborator, was admired for her eye and her steadfast support of family and friends.

I have been so in shock since reading about this horrible tragedy. Having had grown up watching and loving this unbelievable talent…I am now at a loss for words. Prayers go out to family and friends. RIP Rob n Michelle from so many who love you and will miss you. God Bless.

Yess very horrible to hear hope the family can heal from this tragedy it's hard send pryers with love.

Wasn't Rob married to Penny Marshall from Laverne & Shirley at one time?

Yes.  He adopted her daughter,  Tracy.

I am so sorry for your loss. This is a tragedy in your family circle! Bad enough losing both your parents at the same time. Your brother who killed them is a sick person he will probably be put away in a nut house for life!
Sounds like he used street drugs for many years but I heard if this is true he had been clean for last 5 yrs!
I pray God will guide you grown kids, family and friends through this difficult time! Lots of Love to all of you!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Beloved YouTuber Passes Away at 51 & Tributes Pour In","https://entertainmentnow.com/disney-news/youtuber-adam-the-woo-passes-away/","Tue, 23 Dec 2025 03:55:59 GMT","

YouTube creator Adam The Woo, beloved for his travel and theme-park vlogs, has died at the age of 51, authorities and family members confirm.

The news was confirmed by TMZ on Monday, December 22. 

The outlet learned that deputies from the Osceola County Sheriff's Office in Florida responded to concerns about Adam's well-being earlier in the day before discovering him unresponsive in his home.

An autopsy has been ordered as officials work to determine the cause of death.

According to the outlet, deputies were initially dispatched to Adam's residence in Celebration, Florida, around midday after someone requested a wellness check, but were unable to make contact.

Later in the afternoon, another call reporting an unattended death prompted a return to the scene, where first responders found him inside.

A friend — who had seen him the day before and grew concerned — discovered him through a third-floor window and alerted authorities.

Adam's father, who lives locally, was also notified.

Prior to TMZ's confirmation, Reddit became flooded with a reported screenshot that his father made on Facebook stating that his son had passed.

“Out beloved Adam, our Son was found dead in his home this afternoon. Keep us in your prayers please,” the screenshot stated.

Born David Adam Williams, “Adam The Woo” became one of YouTube's most recognizable vloggers through his engaging explorations of amusement parks, roadside attractions, historical sites and pop-culture locales.

He garnered a devoted following for his genuine curiosity, upbeat style and willingness to take viewers on journeys that ranged from Disney parks to quirky, forgotten corners of America. In addition, he would frequently visit movie locations of iconic films.

Adam's main channel, “Adam The Woo,” and his second channel, “The Daily Woo,” together attracted hundreds of thousands of subscribers and millions of views.

Fans often praised his ability to make every day feel like an adventure — whether he was strolling through a theme park, browsing an antique store, or uncovering a hidden gem off the beaten path.

His final YouTube video was uploaded on Sunday, December 22, where he strolled through Celebration, Florida, and had a humorous interaction with The Grinch.

He had just returned from a month-long international trip where he documented his travels abroad with some of the locations being Italy, Switzerland, and Malta.

He was planning on spending 2026 traveling thorughout backroads and small towns in the America.

The news of his passing spread quickly online, with fellow creators and fans expressing shock, sadness and appreciation for the joy he brought to their screens.

Many shared heartfelt reactions on social media, noting how Adam's friendly demeanor and unique point of view inspired them to explore more of the world and to document their own experiences.

One of his friends, singer Beth Vandal, shared her sadness and confirmed the sad news on her Instagram Stories.

“Just got the worst news of my life. One of my besteset friends passed away,” she wrote. “I tried calling andd texting I don't believe it. We talked every week, it's going to voicemail, adn no texts going through.”

“Close Encounters of the Third Kind.” “All that Jazz.” “Anaconda.” The golden triangle. The holy trinity. The undisputed pinnacles of late 20th century Hollywood cinema. Each of these masterpieces invited the world to dream with its eyes open. Each of them has become synonymous with one of the three sacred elements that makes the movies so magical. (Imagination. Artistry. Snake.) And each of their posters are proudly framed in a row on the walls of the Sony lot where some — or in the case of Bob Fosse's swan song, none — of their scenes were shot. 

 










Or so Tom Gormican's sweet-natured but wastefully slipshod new take on “Anaconda” would have you believe. Maybe. Like almost everything in this soggy first draft of a comedy meta-sequel, the poster gag is so ambivalent that it's hard to know if it's meant to be a joke or not.

I guess it's funny that Luis Llosa's cable TV classic — a silly “Jaws” riff about a giant CGI serpent who slurps down the members of a documentary crew as they drift along the Amazon — would be canonized alongside two of the most iconic American movies ever made, but Gormican's film completely fails to contextualize the 1997 original on its own terms. Is it disreputable trash? Is it a winsome time capsule that's made all the more endearing by its shitty effects and star-bound cast? Is it a faintly recognizable piece of IP that a desperate producer might thoughtlessly decide to revisit for seconds, like a water boa regurgitating its undigested food?

 










So far as this new “Anaconda” is concerned, the answer to all of those questions is both “yes” and “no” all at once. 

When talent-challenged background actor Ronald “Griff” Griffen Jr. (Paul Rudd) walks by the aforementioned one-sheets after being fired from a bit part in a TV medical drama, the “Anaconda” poster presumably catches his eye for a couple of different reasons, the most important two of which are braided together and relevant to the story at hand. The first is that it's the kind of movie Griff and his friends loved to watch — and tried to make — when they were kids growing up in Buffalo. The second is that it's also the kind of a movie whose rights might be semi-realistically affordable for a regular guy suffering a mid-life crisis. Guess who buys them. 

Griff doesn't have any special affinity for “Anaconda” (his nostalgia is mostly limited to Jon Voight's immortal performance as a knife-licking Paraguayan snake hunter so slimy that it feels like his prey already spat him back out), but that's precisely what makes it the perfect subject for a satire about how modern Hollywood would rather trawl the collective unconscious for half-remembered ideas than come up with any of its own. Alas, this “Anaconda” is a lot better at illustrating the problem than it is at poking fun at it, even if Gormican — whose more coherent “The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent” also flubbed its self-reflexive concept — mostly resists the temptation to pretend that anyone does or should give a shit about the original.

 










Indeed, the sharpest aspect of his screenplay, co-written by Kevin Etten, is that it diagnoses its workaday characters with their own versions of the studio executive mindset. Similar to some of the people who greenlit this misshapen turd, the slowly extinguished potential of which still lingers in the air like a faint smell, Griff's friends back East have all betrayed their childhood dreams in favor of accepting “B, or maybe even B+” lives because they've been conditioned to believe they didn't have any other choice. 

Horror obsessive Doug McCallister (a relatively grounded Jack Black) aspired to be the next John Carpenter, only to settle for being the goriest wedding videographer in all of upstate New York. Burnout Kenny Trent (a wasted Steve Zahn, forced to squeeze an entire role out of a throwaway joke about being “Buffalo sober”) must have also had ambitions of some kind at one point, but I'm struggling to remember what they were. The same goes for Claire Simons, who's played by Thandiwe Newton in a “since when does she do stuff like this?” performance that's premised on the idea that one of the world's most beautiful women might have spent her teenage years hanging out with the cast of “Saving Silverman.” Once upon a time she starred in Doug's junior high creature feature “Squatch,” and now — bored and Buffalo rich from a recent divorce — Claire is happy to plunk down some of the $43,000 that he needs to shoot his masterpiece in the Amazon.

 










That Doug's reimagining is called “The Anaconda” is one of the only winking in-jokes Gormican's movie allows itself to make, which is bizarre for a comedy that's ostensibly premised on the idea of restoring some heart to the Hollywood IP machine. Emphasis on “ostensibly.” Truth be told, “Anaconda” is determined to be about as little as possible, a bug that it tries to will into a feature with a running gag where Doug and Griff repeatedly strain for big ideas they can glom onto their script (which amounts to Black whispering the word “themes” while he squints into the distance). In lieu of a clear target or any meaningful point of view, Gormican fatally trains his attention on the madcap whimsy of making an independent movie with your friends — on the restorative joy of creating something for the love of the game and spending time with your favorite people. The problem there is that “Anaconda” is so shoddily made — and not in the lo-fi, sweded, endearingly amateurish way that Doug's micro-budget sequel might be — that it completely undermines the same fun that it's meant to celebrate. 

There are worse things than watching Black, Rudd, and Zahn play three gormless morons on a mid-life misadventure, but almost every scene and setpiece is constructed with a haphazardness that blunders away their charm. The dysfunction is on full display from the total “huh?” of a prologue, and it only gets worse when our heroes' DIY creature feature is suddenly upended by the appearance of a real anaconda (and by “a real anaconda” I, of course, mean “a CGI behemoth so fake-looking it makes the snake from the original seem photorealistic by comparison”). 

 










The serpent's introduction is so lackadaisical that it's hard to tell if it's supposed to be scary or funny (Gormican aims for both and settles for neither), and the movie is so uncertain about its own sense of humor that it never really commits to whether or not Doug sees the monster as a blessing in disguise. Which is similar to how the movie never really commits to Claire's unspoken crush on Griff, or to the subplot about illegal gold-mining, or to basically anything else. It's no wonder that the best thing about “Anaconda” is Selton Mello's supporting performance as the snake wrangler our boys meet up with in Manaus, as the functionality of his role allows the overqualified Brazilian actor to stay on task in a way that proves impossible for his more prominent co-stars; it's also inherently funny to see the dad from last year's hyper-serious “I'm Still Here” make such an extreme pivot to this kind of silliness. 

“Anaconda” constricts its premise a little tighter as it moves along (if only because the absurdity ratchets up in a way that forces the film to adopt a clearer sense of itself), and there are some undeniably amusing bits of stupidity along the way. The post-modern stuff tends to fall flat, but, say, the sequence where Jack Black runs for his life with a regurgitated hog strapped to his back is hard to deny. And honestly, all I've ever asked of a movie — any movie — is that it make at least two jokes at Jon Voight's expense, and on that score I have no choice but to acknowledge that Gormican's meta-sequel delivers, if only just. Still, this self-reflexive Hollywood sendup is so slapdash and unsure of itself that it ultimately feels less like a bad in-joke than a case of a snake eating its own tail. 

 










Sony Pictures Releasing will release “Anaconda” in theaters on Christmas Day.

Writer/director Craig Brewer‘s “Song Sung Blue” is an exuberant ode to chasing dreams. It's as deliriously romantic as it is clear-eyed about the brutal tragedies and struggles its real-life heroes, Mike (Hugh Jackman) and Claire Sardina (Kate Hudson), experience. In Brewer's hands, the true story of a husband and wife who form a Neil Diamond cover band and find salvation in music plays like a modern-day Frank Capra movie, joyous and painful in equal measures, but ultimately celebratory of its characters and generous toward the audience in its pleasures.

 










Brewer felt a personal connection to the Sardinas' story from the first time he encountered it in a 2008 documentary, also titled “Song Sung Blue.” “The truth about independent films is that a lot of movies get made that are never distributed,” Brewer told IndieWire, noting that he made one of those movies before his breakout at Sundance with “Hustle & Flow” in 2005.

“I made my first film, ‘The Poor and the Hungry,' for $20,000, and I still think it's one of my best,” Brewer said, “but there weren't any distributors who wanted to pick up a black and white DV movie with no stars that takes place on the streets of Memphis.” 

 










The experience of taking “The Poor and the Hungry” around film festivals made Brewer empathetic to the many other artists doing something similar — musicians like Mike and Claire, who played in bars for peanuts, or filmmakers making the rounds of regional festivals without the muscle of big financiers or distributors behind them.

“You go to festivals everywhere that are not the biggies,” Brewer said. “They're not Sundance. They're not Cannes. You're just going to anyplace that will accept your movie, and sometimes you go to these film festivals, and there are four people in the audience, and two of them are programmers who are just there because they don't want you to feel bad. That's happened to me so many times, so I always have a real soft spot for those kinds of films.”

Brewer's desire to support other independent filmmakers led him to a screening of the documentary “Song Sung Blue” at the 2009 Indie Memphis Film Festival. “Being in that screening room with five people and totally being knocked on my ass, I just felt that this was a great story,” Brewer said. In keeping with the film's outsider origins, director Greg Kohs didn't have a distributor for “Song Sung Blue” — the only way to get a DVD was to send Kohs money so he could personally burn one from his computer.

 










Brewer bought one of those DVDs and began showing it to everyone he could. “For years I would show it to people and just say, if I ever get a chance, this would be a movie I'd want to make,” Brewer said. “The idea of telling that story gnawed at me for a long time.” 

After Brewer finished “Dolemite is My Name,” he felt the time was right. “I began to think, OK, you're 49 years old, the age your dad was when he dropped dead of a heart attack. Yes, you're being offered jobs that would pay you a lot of money, but maybe you should do something that means a lot to you.”

Brewer suspected that the movie might be a difficult sell given some of the dark moments in the Sardinas' lives, and he quickly realized he was right. “Everybody in town said no,” Brewer said. “They saw the documentary and said, ‘Everyone is going to be depressed by this.'” But Brewer saw “Song Sung Blue” as an inspirational underdog tale in the tradition of “Rocky,” and kept pushing forward until he got the green light he needed from Focus — the whole time relating to his movie's protagonist.

“I was looking at Mike Sardina and thinking, this guy has blind ambition toward something that seems completely unattainable,” Brewer said. “The problems never stop. And yet I'm rooting for him.” Brewer's affection for the Sardina's informed his approach to the visual style with his department heads, as he embraced the clutter of everyday life in the production design but shot everything with warm, welcoming lighting that invites the audience into the film's world.

 










“When I grew up, I'd go to my grandmother Dixie's house, and there was this hoarder mentality,” Brewer said. “If you get a new TV, you don't throw out the old TV — now that becomes a TV stand, and you put the new TV on top of the old TV. [Cinematographer] Amy [Vincent] and I have a love for that kind of lifestyle, and we felt something similar when we were working on ‘Hustle & Flow.' It's a simple shotgun house in Memphis where they're stapling drink holders to the wall, and they're covered in sweat, but I want everybody to want to live there because of the excitement that's happening.”

In the case of “Song Sung Blue,” that excitement comes from the sheer idealism with which the Sardinas approach their music. “I want the audience to come with respect and awe, and to see the magic within that life,” Brewer said. “Amy and Clay Griffith, my production designer, really believe in our hearts that there's something beautiful about those homes and the way the Sardinas lived, and if you can take the cynicism out of yourself you see it, and it's powerful.”

Part of the Capraesque quality in Brewer's film comes from its uniquely American story and how it taps into an earnest idealism that yields considerable emotional effects thanks to Brewer's genuine investment in the values he's exploring; its celebration of creating and performing for no other reason than the love of it feels deeply personal and honestly earned. “I think we've lost our way as a society a little bit,” Brewer said. “In terms of art, we put so much of our worth in the idea of fame and fortune as a barometer of success.”

 










In shooting the Sardinas belting out Neil Diamond songs in dive bars and strip-mall restaurants, Brewer wanted to capture the purity he felt early in his career, when he was a young filmmaker on the outside of the industry. “You will never beat my first premiere,” he said. “It was at a bar called The Last Place on Earth, and we had a band play beforehand, and then everybody watched my movie on a sheet we put up. That was me performing for my community in Memphis, and I felt love and comfort and encouragement.”

The greatness of “Song Sung Blue” lies in the way that Brewer recalibrates our expectations and definition of success in keeping with the feeling he experienced at his first premiere. “For some reason, we look at bands like that and say, ‘Oh, you didn't really make it, did you?'” Brewer said. “I felt like this was a story where I could say what I believe, which is that there are a lot of amazing people and amazing stories in this world, and there's still greatness in the American dream. We're understandably in a place where we've been critical of our country, and there's a divide, but I think we've lost a little bit of the memory of what we're really about.”

For Brewer, the key was honoring Mike and Claire Sardina with a movie that celebrated their lives with the grandeur he recognized in them when he first saw Greg Kohs' documentary. “You need to give them the respect David Lean gives the characters in ‘Lawrence of Arabia,'” Brewer said. “Those are bigger than life characters, but so is Mike Sardina, and I don't think there's anything wrong with treating him like he's Omar fucking Sharif.”

 










“Song Sung Blue” opens in theaters from Focus Features on Christmas Day.

Daniel Lopatin doesn't score the Safdie brothers' movies so much as open portals in them. In Good Time and Uncut Gems, his worship of all things kosmische created a peculiar contrast with the images on screen, drenching the brothers' grainy tales of '10s debauchery in the aura of an earlier time. Hospital hallways gleam with the same twilit aura of Thief; New York's diamond district ripples with as much danger as the landscapes of Sorcerer. Lopatin isn't recreating Blade Runner with his soundtracks as much as Risky Business, pulling us into the subconscious of the Safdies' manic characters and submerging us in their doomed self-sabotage. When Howard Ratner hits, we don't just resolve to a major chord—we enter the realm of the angels, with glowy flutes and Mellotrons dancing in the air like a thousand roses blooming at once.

It's all very heightened, absurd even. But with his score for Josh Safdie's whirlwind new Timothée Chalamet vehicle Marty Supreme, Lopatin has taken this woozy, internalizing effect and sent it outward. Safdie's latest follows a hungry young Jewish table tennis player in the early '50s on his mission to bring glory to himself, his game, and all of America while he's at it. As Chalamet hurtles toward his supposed destiny, a parade of '80s hits lights the way, pointing toward some imagined time as futuristic for him as it is nostalgic for us. Tears for Fears' “Change” launches the film like it's shooting Marty out of a cannon. Songs by Peter Gabriel and New Order swirl as if we were caught in an endless training montage. I won't spoil how Alphaville's “Forever Young” gets used, but it underscores a particularly seminal moment for our hero.

The music in Marty Supreme is a central character, one as freewheeling, in-your-face, and impossible to resist as Marty himself. Though the '80s and its attendant commercialism and sci-fi cheese have always been of particular fascination to Lopatin, his previous Froese-flavored scores only reflected the surface shades of his craft. Where his work as Oneohtrix Point Never has blurred boundaries, his scores have often leaned more toward pastiche. But for Marty Supreme, Lopatin meets the larger-than-life film on its level, building the palette he's honed over the years into a totalizing prism of sound.

Lopatin delves into his longtime concerns over media and memory by constructing a lush, time-drunk soundscape that echoes the chintzy Fairlights, DX7s, and Synclaviers of the film's pop songs. The arpeggio is once again the grounding current, and he draws on everything he's learned to do with it since his Rifts days. New-agey R Plus Seven flutes chirp through the iridescent romance of “The Call” and “The Apple,” before “Endo's Game” brings Marty's high plummeting down with the dark, throbbing bass of Garden of Delete. “Holocaust Honey” reinterprets Constance Demby's “Novus Pt. 2: The Flying Bach” as a circus of spiralling organs, strings, and choirs, blowing up a dreamily haunting flashback to Koyaanisqatsi proportions. If Lopatin has increasingly pushed his solo music into a more over-the-top, dramatized mode over the years (with the refreshing exception of this year's mellow Tranquilizer), all that theatricality finally finds a good outlet here, lifting the material to grandiose and otherworldly places.

As the story of Marty Supreme traverses nations, Lopatin's score follows suit. With Japan standing in the way of Marty's quest to assert American dominance in table tennis, Lopatin weaves in motifs reminiscent of the country's own colorful history of electronic music. The pompous bouncing-ball stomp of “Marty's Dream” and “Pure Joy” recall Yasuaki Shimizu's classic Music for Commercials, while the fluttering, Midori Takada-like marimbas of “Motherstone” come topped with sax and fretless bass straight off an old Prism record. Those mallet instruments continually reappear throughout the soundtrack, providing a ricochet that carries the film through its many white-knuckling escalations (in a Q&A for the film, Lopatin spoke of drawing specific inspiration upon realizing the instrument also consists of a ball and a stick—just like table tennis).

Though the music is obviously at its most powerful when experienced in the film, all of this frantic energy makes for a surprisingly rich record on its own merits. Dispensing with the snippets of dialogue and long stretches of quiet underscore typical of these kinds of releases, Lopatin cruises on a relentless pulse that evokes the movie's sustained state of tongue-in-cheek nerviness. Swaying between hypnotic, almost parodic instrumentals like the swooning organs of “Vampire's Castle” and head-in-the-clouds fusion zoners like “Rockwell Ink” and “The Necklace,” the pace and sequencing are as satisfying as any great recent electronic album you could point to. When “The Real Game” peaks with marimbas popping off like balloons, it's as climactic a moment on the soundtrack as it is in the film.

Lopatin has long sought to mutate popular culture into alien forms. Here, he's done it with the sports drama, tearing apart its tropes and rebuilding them as a psychedelic voyage into one man's search for greatness. The film is cosmic Rocky, a thriller-comedy-blockbuster whose scope reaches all the way from the atom bomb to the holocaust and back to the pyramids, locating that beautiful and terrible human need to strive for the impossible, no matter the toll. Lopatin's music is key to Marty Supreme's emotions, and particularly its ending—his gorgeous “Force of Life” complicates the film's commentary on ambition, evoking how limitless and meaningless our dreams can be. It's all a big swing, and it's all a big hit.

Finn Wolfhard and George Harrison are bringing you peace on Earth this holiday season — or at least, they're sharing a very sincere wish for it, via the first-ever music video for the late artist's classic single “Give Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth),” off 1973's Living in the Material World. Rolling Stone has the exclusive look behind the scenes of the stop-motion visual, which dropped last week.


	The whimsical video follows Harrison on a trip (in more ways than one) through Friar Park, where he lived and worked after the end of the Beatles. It's an ode to both Harrison's love of gardening and his musical career, as he was known for lovingly tending to his Friar Park plots, often referring to himself as “just a gardener.” You can watch the folks at Nobody Told Me Studios and Tye Down Pictures and a team of 20 stop-motion artists bringing Wolfhard's vision to life in the exclusive clip. “I storyboarded it,” says Wolfhard in the video. “[But] I'm not the one every day moving everything.” The video was executive-produced by George's son, Dhani Harrison, and David Zonshine.

	“Finn is one of the sweetest and most talented people I know of his generation, and he is the perfect person to direct a video for my dad,” Dhani said in a release. “My dad would have loved this, and I hope his wonderful, creative, heartfelt ideas help this song reach another generation.” This year, Wolfhard starred in the final season of Stranger Things, as well as The Legend of Ochi, a cuddly creature feature that also boasted some particularly incredible practical effects.

	The Harrison estate released a reissue of Living in the Material World in 2024, one year past the 50th anniversary of the album that Rolling Stone called a “slept-on masterpiece worth rediscovering.” The record sees Harrison feeling disillusioned by his religious heroes and mourning the loss of his mother. The new edition was remixed by engineer Paul Hicks, who also did the 2019 All Things Must Pass box set, with a bonus disc of alternate takes.

Billy Porter gave an update on Monday following his diagnoses of sepsis in September and thanked fans for their support during this tough period.


	“I'm here, first and foremost, to say happy holidays, Merry Christmas, Happy Kwanzaa, Happy Hanukkah, and everything in between,” said the Tony winner in an Instagram video.


	“Some of you may or may not know that I was in the hospital, very ill this fall with urosepsis. It was not easy. It's been a very, very challenging four months, and I want everybody to know that I am on the road to a full recovery. I'm not there yet, but I'm on the road to that, and I wanted to thank everybody for your prayers and your love and sending me all the vibes,” he continued, becoming emotional. “I felt every single one of them.”


	The most common cause of urosepsis is an untreated or undertreated UTI, according to the Cleveland Clinc, and if left untreated, the infection spreads through the urethra, bladder and kidneys.

	In September, Porter stepped away from the role of the Emcee in the Broadway production of Cabaret at the Kit Kat Club following his diagnosis. “Due to a serious case of sepsis, Billy Porter must also withdraw from the production,” the play said in a statement at the time. “His doctors are confident that he will make a full recovery but have advised him to maintain a restful schedule.” The production terminated its run on Sept. 19 instead of its planned Oct. 19 finale.

	











	In his social media post Monday, Porter also added clips from his new film, Amazon Prime's Christmas Karma and the caption, “She's ALIVE!!! Proof of life, PTL!!! Thank you all all thought, prayers and healing energy! Merry Christmas one and all!”

Kevin Costner has been sued for failing to pay for costume rentals used to make his film Horizon: An American Saga – Chapter 2.


	Western Costume, a Hollywood costume rental company, filed a lawsuit on Monday in Los Angeles County Superior Court against Costner and his production banner Territory Pictures for breach of contract (via People). The lawsuit seeks restitution for unpaid costume fees and alleged damage to some of the items.


	In the suit, Western Costume points to an invoice from 2024 for more than $134,000 in costume rentals. According to the lawsuit, the film's production “did not pay the agreed upon rate for the costumes and failed to return the costumes undamaged.”


	The lawsuit seeks more than $350,000 in damages, including the $134,256.82 in unpaid costume rentals and $150,000 in economic damages. Western Costume is also asking for $200,000 in attorney's fees and $40,000 in accrued interest on the bills. The company is seeking an additional $100,000 in punitive damages. 

	











Horizon: An American Saga — Chapter 2 is a sequel to 2024's Horizon: An American Saga, which starred Costner alongside Sienna Miller and Giovanni Ribisi. The release of the second film was postponed after the first disappointed at the box office, pulling in a reported $11 million. Chapter 2 screened at the Venice International Film Festival in September, but has yet to get an official release date. 


	Financial and legal troubles have plagued Costner during the production of the Horizon series. In May, a stunt performer on Chapter 2, Devyn LaBella, sued Costner over an alleged unscripted rape scene. LaBella is sued the production companies and Costner for sexual discrimination, harassment, and creating a hostile work environment. She also alleged that she faced retaliation after reporting the incident, as she claimed she was not called back for further work on the film series, nor by the stunt coordinator who had hired her before.

	In October, a judge ruled that LaBella could proceed with eight of the 10 claims in lawsuit against Costner. Costner had previously asked the court to dismiss the entire lawsuit. He claimed the movie is an expressive work, protected by the First Amendment, and that the stuntwoman, Devyn LaBella, had failed to adequately allege that the scene in question was added without proper notice or appropriate safeguard measures. After hearing arguments for nearly an hour, the judge mostly sided with LaBella, finding that she deserves more time to conduct discovery and continue pursuing her claims. 


	Despite the legal hurdles, Costner has continued to seek funding to finish the film series. Last year, he met with top Saudi officials and pitched them on financing the third and fourth installments, although no deal was made, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The third film remains in limbo.

				Buford Puser in 1966, a year before the death of his wife, Pauline.

B
uford Pusser should have been on top of the world. By Aug. 20, 1974, he was the most famous sheriff in America, all because of the unexpected smash-hit film Walking Tall, which introduced Pusser — played in a starmaking turn by Joe Don Baker — and his crime-busting exploits in McNairy County, Tennessee, to the masses the prior year. Those exploits, as depicted in the film, included cleaning up the county of illicit bootlegging, battling ruthless gangsters known as the State Line Mob, and defending his family, especially after the ambush murder, six years before, of his beloved wife, Pauline.


	As Buford told it in public ever since Aug. 12, 1967, and especially on the road to promote Walking Tall, he had received an early-morning phone call about a disturbance, and Pauline came with him. He drove along a winding, poorly paved road toward the Mississippi state line, and shots rang out — fatally striking Pauline in the head, and grievously wounding Buford in the face. In the film, after recovering from his wounds, he took his car and drove it into one of the saloons, taking an eye for an eye to avenge his wife's death. In real life, Pauline's murder remained unsolved.

	











	Audiences around the country flocked to meet the 36-year-old Pusser, clearing six feet six and 250 pounds, all soft-spoken Southern manners, his face ravaged by the scars of multiple reconstructive surgeries, and his body still within range of the fighting form of his wrestling days. And that morning in 1974, seven years and eight days after Pauline's killing, news outlets packed a Memphis press conference to hear Pusser announce that he would play himself in the sequel to Walking Tall.











			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Pusser, who served as a sheriff from 1964 to 1970, loomed large both metaphorically and literally. Young men looked up to him and young women wanted to be with him. The myth of Pusser, already pervasive because of the sheer number of car accidents, knife attacks, and shootouts he said he'd survived, grew bigger thanks to the movie (and later sequels), and in the books and songs that praised his exploits, like Memphis singer Eddie Bond's “The Ballad of Buford Pusser” and W.R. Morris's biography The Twelfth of August.

	The accelerating celebrity fed into the enormity of his newest career move. “I've got to be good in this movie,” Pusser told the Jackson Sun. “Twenty or 25 million Americans are counting on it.” The same reporter asked a reasonable follow-up: Was it difficult to relive the worst and most tragic moments of his life, “to turn a personal nightmare into a box-office saga?”


	“Why not?” said Pusser. “I have to live with those memories every day anyway.”


	The press conference ended in the late afternoon. Pusser drove the two hours home to Adamsville, to pick up his newly repaired Corvette. After dinner, around 9:00, Pusser stopped by the McNairy County Fair in nearby Selmer, where he could check in on Dwana, his 13-year-old daughter.


	Dwana had spent the day at the fair with her best friend, Tina, but she wanted to see her daddy. As she described in her 2009 memoir, Walking On, every time he got in a car, and especially the Corvette with its extra-low suspension, Dwana worried. Her nerves had gotten so bad that she'd been hospitalized earlier in the year, and the doctors quickly identified the issue: “She's already lost her mother. Now, she's worried sick that she's going to lose you.”


	At 11 p.m., Tina's mother was supposed to pick up the girls, but didn't show up until 11:40. Dwana kissed her father — who'd been drinking vodka over ice from a Styrofoam cup all evening — goodbye and told him she loved him. The green Monte Carlo set out for Adamsville along U.S. Route 64. Pusser's Corvette sped past. “Buford had better slow down or he'll get killed before he gets home,” Tina's mother said. “Oh, no, please don't say that,” implored Dwana.

	The Monte Carlo went around a troublesome curve and approached an embankment in the distance, visible through a light post and nearby store. Dwana could see that something had happened down the hill. She began to shout. “Oh, my gosh, it's my daddy! I just know it's my daddy!”

	











	When they stopped at the scene of the wreck, Dwana jumped out of the car. Pusser lay face down behind the Corvette, whose front end was in flames. She screamed at her father not to die. Dwana heard him mumble something — she hoped it was her name — and then he was gone, dead of a broken neck, his blood alcohol level twice the legal limit. As Dwana later wrote, “Daddy loved a fast car.”


	Buford Pusser's death cemented him as an American legend, fully embedded into the country's tough-guy DNA. Over the next five decades, through more rehashings of the story — including the 2004 Walking Tall remake with the Rock — that legend metastasized. He became the archetype for sheriffs everywhere, seeping into the American fabric. Every May, a local museum devoted to Pusser bestows an annual award — a ceremonial Pusser-autographed bat — to sheriffs who best emulated his crime-busting ways (past winners include Joe Arpaio, David Clarke, and Mark Lamb.) Walking Tall's director, Phil Karlson, had outlined the rationale all the way back in a 1974 interview with The New York Times: “I wanted to make a picture for once in which the good guy was the hero — I was tired of pictures which glorified crooks, petty chiselers, and con men.”


	But as the summer of 2025 turned to fall, the legend of Pusser had taken a licking. The strongman-vigilante archetype was decidedly out of vogue.The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) had reopened its investigation into the long-unsolved murder of Pauline thanks to a stream of tips about a lost murder weapon and witnesses never interviewed at the time. In tandem with the McNairy County district attorney's office, the TBI announced that Pusser was the prime suspect in his wife's murder, and that he likely killed her and staged the crime scene. For those who knew him only through Walking Tall, the news was a shock — but not to McNairy County residents who'd been skeptical of Pusser's narrative, and dared to posit he was anything but a hero.


	THE JARRING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MAN and myth is never more apparent than at the Buford Pusser Museum, which turned the house Pusser lived from 1971 until his death into a permanent shrine. (The one where he'd lived with Pauline burned down.) A giant statue replicating his sheriff's badge greets visitors, as do faded twin tablets listing the Ten Commandments. An eight-minute introductory video featuring his daughter, Dwana, establishes the narrative, further buttressed by family photos, perfectly preserved rooms (the walls and carpeting all orange and tan hues), guns and ammunition behind plexiglass cabinets, movie memorabilia, the wreckage of the car that finally killed him, and a signed photo from President Ronald Reagan to Pusser's mother, Helen, “with best wishes.” The museum makes little room for nuance, let alone the stories of anyone alongside Pusser — particularly Pauline and her children.

	











	Making a myth requires active participation. It also necessitates a good storytelling instinct, which Pusser had in spades. He'd honed those instincts as a boy in Adamsville, so close to his mother that he refused to go to school. (Pusser's relationship to his father, Carl, a farmer, sharecropper, and eventual police chief of Adamsville, was more complicated.) Finally forced to attend school at six, he preferred to dwell in his own mind rather than listen to teachers. “More muscle than brain,” read Pusser's high school yearbook inscription, by virtue of his prowess on the football field and basketball court. He also demonstrated erratic behavior, as with a story he liked to tell about a practical joke he played upon his maternal grandfather, firing a shotgun against the side of the outhouse as the older man used it. According to Dwana, “When his grandpa came running out with his pants hanging down below his knees, Daddy thought it was the funniest thing he had ever seen.”


	He joined the Marines in August 1956, but washed out after a few months, apparently because of asthma. Only 11 days after his discharge, Pusser was seriously injured in a car accident, the first of many. When he recovered, he landed a job as a mortician's assistant in Selmer, but that also ended after a few months, around the time he claimed to have been attacked by members of the so-called State Line Mob, immortalized in Walking Tall as a beatdown so severe it left him with untold scars and face down in a rainy ditch. (This version of events could never be corroborated.) In October 1957, Pusser made his way to Chicago to work at the Union Bag Co. His stature attracted notice, and wrestling became a side hustle, adopting the monikers “the Wild Bull” and “the Mad Russian.” At one of his matches, he met the woman who would become his wife.


	Pauline Mullins remains an elusive figure. Born Feb. 27, 1931, the eldest of six, she was raised in Haysi, Virginia — an even smaller town than Adamsville. A place that when you grew old enough, as her younger brother, Griffon, told the TBI, you “bugged out of there because there was nothing left but the coal mines.” (Griffon Mullins did not respond to requests for an interview.) By 1959, Pauline had survived a troubled first marriage and made the wrenching decision to give up her youngest child, Karen, born physically and mentally incapacitated, to distant relatives to raise. (Karen, later Sharon, died in her twenties.) Pauline and her two eldest kids, Diane and Mike, settled in Chicago.

	











	When Pauline met Pusser, he was just 21 to her 28. He liked her as well as her children, which was more than her first husband ever had. They married on Dec. 5, 1959. A week later, for reasons that remain murky and are depicted quite differently in Walking Tall, Pusser and two pals decided to travel back to Adamsville, an eight-hour trip on a good day, and ended up at the Plantation Club, where they got into a fight with the owner, W.O. Hathcock. Later, Pusser said it was revenge for the attack two years earlier; Hathcock, who swore out an assault and attempted-murder complaint, claimed Pusser and his friends were out to rob him. The trio were acquitted in a jury trial thanks to multiple witnesses, including Pauline, swearing he was out of state at the time.


	In early 1962, a year after this legal victory, Pusser moved his family, now including baby Dwana, to Adamsville. He picked up wrestling gigs for money, but wanted to be in law enforcement, finally given the chance when elected constable that September. He professed a desire to clean up the area; McNairy County was dry, unlike neighboring Mississippi, and busting up illegal moonshine rackets became a semiregular thing.


	But Pusser wanted more. He wanted to be county sheriff and ran for election in the summer of 1964. It would be a long shot, but five days before the election, his opponent, Democratic incumbent James Dickey, died in a car crash. At 26, Pusser became the youngest sheriff in the state's history. He would be reelected handily two years later. Was it popularity — or fear?


	He claimed self-defense when he shot Louise Hathcock, W.O's sister in law and the proprietor of the Shamrock Hotel, on Feb. 1, 1966, while he was investigating an on-site robbery. Maybe that's how it happened, but no one else was in the room. (An autopsy concluded Hathcock had been shot twice in the back.) No one was around, either, when Pusser killed convicted murderer Charles “Russ” Hamilton on Christmas Day 1968, responding to a drunk-and-disorderly complaint. Then there was the stabbing incident, supposedly instigated by a hitchhiker. A couple of gunshot wounds to his face in January 1967 landed Pusser in a hospital.


	All the while, Pauline was looking for a way out of her marriage. Multiple people would later attest to the trouble between Pusser and Pauline, who not only kept house, but also handled the books for the sheriff's department and cooked for the prisoners at the county jail. Pusser had affairs with several women. Pusser's deputy, Jim Moffett, later told the TBI that Pauline had gone to the DA's office asking about how to get a divorce from her husband, since she would have to prove he was at fault. And she had found a motel room in nearby Savannah while she figured out how to get the kids out of the house and leave Pusser for good.

	











	Any troubles, however, evaporated on Aug. 12, 1967, when Pusser got a disturbance call before dawn. Pauline went with him. Maybe it was to save time on later travel, or because she was worried about him, or because he didn't want to let her out of his sight; his story kept changing. Either way, Pusser and Pauline were the victims of an ambush, he said, by several of his enemies. Pauline was killed almost instantly. He attempted to battle them on a desolate road near the state line, and kept going even after his jaw was nearly shot off, he said, by a .30-caliber carbine.


	In death, she became a symbol and ceased being a person. No one discussed Pauline as being anything other than the wife of Buford Pusser, legendary lawman. Meanwhile, Pusser's second turn as sheriff was an opportunity for further publicity. In 1968, Eddie Bond, the Memphis singer who infamously turned Elvis Presley away from his band, garnered local notoriety for “The Ballad of Buford Pusser,” and later, an entire album's worth of Pusser-related songs (the queasiest might be “Christmas in Heaven,” dedicated to Dwana, and about her dearly departed mother).


	A year later, in 1969, having gotten wind of Pusser's notoriety, Roger Mudd of CBS News arrived in McNairy County to interview the sheriff for the broadcast. Mort Briskin, a Hollywood producer, watched it and saw film potential, obtaining Pusser's life rights that summer to make the movie that would become Walking Tall. W.R. Morris, a local PR guy and former newsman, made hay with a 1971 biography — really hagiography — called The Twelfth of August. Pusser, and later his estate, would have legal skirmishes with all three men. He openly disparaged Morris in particular — but continued to sign copies of The Twelfth of August for anyone who asked.


	CAMMY WILSON WAS A YOUNG REPORTER working at the Dayton Daily News in Ohio when her editor saw Walking Tall in the fall of 1973. He was curious about the relationship between the real Buford Pusser and Joe Don Baker's version, so he sent Wilson down to Tennessee.  


	Wilson had covered the war in Vietnam, and was nearly as scared by McNairy County. “I had a rental car, and every time I went to Selmer, I would take a different route,” she says. She'd been told by reputable people that Pusser would sit in his car on U.S. Route 45, watching for her to pass. Wilson refused to interview or meet Pusser in person, only by telephone: “I thought he was very volatile, and I was not in a position where I would have had sufficient protection from anybody.”

	











	The resulting story ran in the Sunday edition of the Dayton Daily News on Oct. 7, 1973. Wilson delivered an incisive, forensic deconstruction of the Pusser legend, revealing him to be almost the exact opposite of the heroic crime fighter of Walking Tall. She reported that Pusser took $600 a month in bribes from Louise Hathcock, whom he later killed — “There were no actual witnesses, as far as is known, to the killing,” Wilson wrote. It landed with a thunderclap.


	She had an affidavit from a tavern owner about Pusser being on the take. And in her retelling of Pauline's murder, written with a sizable amount of skepticism of the official narrative, “the only person who substantiated Pusser's story was his father, Carl Pusser.” As Grady Bingham, Alcorn County, Mississippi's sheriff, told Wilson, “I was in office four years, and I never had to kill anybody.” Another resident, shaking his head, added: “There's just been too much killing with Pusser.”


	Needless to say, Pusser wasn't happy with the article, and claimed that Wilson had an agenda. “Her mother was about to lose her home in Mississippi,” he told Newspaper Enterprise Association wire reporter Ellie Grossman in March 1974. “Cammy was contacted by these people involved in the crime now on the state line, and she stayed some weeks to do the story. Then she came up with the $1,500 payment for the house. Now, you tell me: Is a paper in Dayton, Ohio, going to send someone 500 miles to write a story and pay her salary all that time?”


	Yes, said Wilson's editor. When Pusser died, the Dayton Daily News ran an editorial detailing the reality of his life, featuring “at least seven mysterious deaths and countless beatings.” After publishing a pointed story about Pusser's death and legacy in New Times Magazine, Wilson decamped for Minnesota and a job at the Star Tribune. She revisited the Pusser story in 1977, timed to the release of the third Walking Tall film, and then moved on to other award-winning investigations, first at the paper, and later in Asia in the 1980s.


	Wilson retired a few years ago after a long stint as a journalism professor. Now 80, she is feeling the pull of the Pusser story again. “I think I was so disgusted with the way that people reacted,” Wilson says. The myth had grown larger than ever, but Wilson still vividly remembers what it was like to talk to the people who actually lived in McNairy County. “It was only in other places that people wanted to believe that movie,” she says. “People were cowering. They did not engage him directly. The people who engaged him directly, some of them wound up dead.”

	











	THE DRIVE WEST INTO MCNAIRY COUNTY from Nashville on a late October day is a particularly beautiful one, crossing rolling hills through brightly colored foliage. Something changes at the approach to Adamsville, population roughly 2,200, and not only because U.S. 64 suddenly becomes Buford Pusser Highway. The ‘Ville, with its red, teeth-baring bird mascot, fish-fry and rib joints, and close proximity to the Shiloh National Military Park, has gone all in on the long-dead sheriff. Pusser was their hometown man, who inspired generations of men to make law enforcement their career (never mind his flagrant flouting of the law) and who gave off the aura of potent masculinity so many still strive for today.


	Not everyone in McNairy County holds Pusser in high regard, though. It doesn't break cleanly, but the gist is that in Adamsville, you are pro-Pusser, and in Selmer, you aren't. The divide began years before Pauline's murder, but her death cemented the split, the rumor mill churning within hours of her death. Pusser's story didn't make sense. Why would Pauline have gotten into the car with him at 4:45 a.m.? Why, if she'd been shot and he hadn't yet, had he not radioed for help? And then when bullets supposedly blew through the side and took out Pusser's cheek, why hadn't he tried a distress signal of some kind? Why was there another crime scene two miles away from where the ambush happened, where 16-year-old Dennis Hathcock, son of Pusser beating victim W.O. and nephew of murdered Louise, discovered part of Pauline's scalp and brain matter stacked in a pile, almost as if it had been carefully arranged?


	The rumors grew so deafening that a month after the alleged ambush, the state district attorney, Will Terry Abernathy, flatly denied to the Jackson Sun that Pusser had been arrested for murdering Pauline. The rumor “has absolutely no foundation,” Abernathy said, and “several leads are being checked out.” Those leads circulated around supposed “State Line Mob” members like Carl “Towhead” White, murdered in 1969, who denied any involvement. Or Kirksey Nix, imprisoned still for other crimes — including ordering a successful hit on a judge — who denied, at times volubly, having anything to do with Pauline's murder. (He also had an alibi.)


	If Pusser knew something more, or even had something to do with killing Pauline, who was going to do anything about it? Whatever appetite there may have been likely vanished after Pusser was reelected McNairy County sheriff handily for his third and final term in 1968, and were quelled for good after his death six years later. State investigators had only Pusser's word for what happened. And despite what a Tennessee medical examiner later said, it was unusual that Pauline's body wasn't autopsied; she was a homicide victim, after all.

	











	The lack of an autopsy baffled law enforcement, too, who finally did something about it. On Feb. 8, 2024, Pauline's remains were disinterred from the cemetery in Adamsville. The presence of a backhoe reverberated across McNairy County, and everyone — the pro-Pusser crowd and the naysayers — understood what it meant: the answer to what really happened to her was, perhaps, in sight.


	The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation quietly reopened the case in late 2022, acting on many tips sent its way by Mike Elam, a former law-enforcement officer from Bella Vista, Arkansas. Elam, once a Pusser fan, had grown suspicious of the legend over the course of three decades, and wasn't shy about broadcasting his beliefs on message boards, Facebook groups, and YouTube videos.


	Elam heard from those with information about Pauline and what might have happened to her — people whom the TBI had never spoken to during the initial investigation. People like Dennis Hathcock, whom police officers had shooed away from the crime scene in 1967 and never interviewed. People like Lavon Plunk, the wife of Deputy Sheriff Peatie Plunk and Pauline's best friend. Pauline had confided in Lavon that she was planning on taking the kids and leaving Pusser. Though Lavon had expressed some mild suspicions to Cammy Wilson, it would take another three decades before Lavon told Elam, in a recorded conversation later obtained by the TBI, about the gunshot she thought she had heard coming from the Pusser house on the night Pauline died — and that in her fear of the likely culprit, she drove home.


	Elam forwarded his interview with Lavon to the TBI. He also learned that Peatie and Lavon's son, Ricky, had held on to a gun that may have been used to kill Pauline and wound Pusser, and urged Ricky to tell investigators. Ricky told the TBI that on the day of Pauline's murder, Buford asked Peatie to retrieve his guns from the trunk of his car while he was in the hospital. Peatie then gave the gun to his son. Oakley Dean Baldwin, another former law-enforcement official, in North Carolina, also passed on relevant information, including contacts for Pauline's surviving siblings. The new investigation was short on direct evidence — most of the witnesses, as well as the likely suspect, were dead — and long on circumstance, reconstruction, and narrative.


	The TBI tracked down Pusser's former girlfriends, one of whom was the subject of an alleged argument between him and Pauline in the early-morning hours of Aug. 12, 1967. According to family members who were told this information decades later, Barbara Gail Drewry Bivins and Shirley Smith were in the parking lot of the Old Hickory Club in Guys, a town near the Mississippi state line. They heard shouting from a man and a woman in the near distance, the couple unaware anyone was listening. But the women quickly recognized the Pussers' voices.

	











	Pauline sounded fed up, the women said. She knew about his affairs, but the one with Pearl Wade, a Black woman visiting her parents off and on from Ohio, was the last straw. “I'll ruin you!” she screamed at her husband from the passenger side of the car. That was all they heard before the car sped off.


	Antipathy is not grounds for indictment. The results of Pauline's autopsy, however, created reasonable cause to believe that Buford Pusser was her likeliest murderer. It revealed that Pauline had been shot twice in the back of the head, contradicting Pusser's initial statements to the TBI in August 1967. The autopsy also revealed that Pauline had recently recovered from a broken nose, which, investigators noted, are “frequently associated with incidents of domestic violence.”


	Buried within the six-volume, more-than-2,300-page TBI file was a 1976 statement by another of Pusser's deputies, Jim Moffett. He told investigators then that he knew Pusser had hit Pauline three days before her death.


	WITH THE TBI FILE AVAILABLE to the public, and the district attorney's judgment that if alive today, Buford Pusser would be indicted for the murder of his wife, more than 60 years of myth seems to be challenged. “I'm absolutely delighted that the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation finally got onto it,” Wilson tells me. Patterson Hood, co-founder of the Drive-By Truckers, whose 2004 album, The Dirty South, included three songs puncturing the Pusser myth, is more pointed when I ask him about the new developments: “I said all along that he was a piece of shit!” Hood says. “It was also pretty common knowledge back in those days that he was no better than the people he was fighting — and maybe even worse, because he had a badge and that made him extra powerful.”


Mike Elam and Oakley Dean Baldwin also believe this is a happy outcome. Elam ends every video on the case by saying, “We got justice for Pauline.” Baldwin, in the newest edition of The Murder of Mrs. Buford Pusser (Solved), co-written with his wife, Doris, closes the book with, “No more running and no more hiding. Justice is served!”


	But what does justice mean here? In the rush to celebrate the end of a case, and for overturning the myth of Buford Pusser, there's little appetite to grapple with Pauline's lived life, and what she meant to her family and her friends. In all of the mythmaking surrounding the story of Pusser beating and robbing W.O. Hathcock in December 1959, it's telling that little, if any, thought was given to the effects on Pauline, barely wed a week with two kids to care for while her husband was off criminally gallivanting with his pals.

	











	A similar lack of insight exists about Pauline's life in McNairy County: Did she feel isolated from her family, particularly as her husband became physically abusive, slept with other women, and killed several people in suspicious circumstances?


	The trauma didn't end with Pauline's death, either. Diane, 17 when her mother was murdered, once called Pusser “a man to be afraid of.” He had slapped her at least once, and spoke of other kinds of abuse to her friends, including more than one occasion when Pusser ran his hands all over her body as he cornered her in the kitchen. Shortly before Pauline's death, Diane ran away after an argument with her mother. “The vibes were so bad,” Diane told Cammy Wilson in October 1973. “Mother was upset, she would have these bad headaches. She got real upset and nervous.” Pauline tracked her down and called, imploring Diane to come home. “She told me things were going bad with her and Buford. That was right before she got killed.”


	The mood grew even more rancid for Diane after Pauline's death. She'd heard a fight and a gunshot that night, the TBI later learned, and believed she saw Pusser carrying her mother to his car. She continued to clash with Pusser and grew suspicious about his finances. According to Wilson's article, Diane's concerns grew after cases of booze were delivered to the house: “I remember one time he busted a U-Haul trailer full of untaxed whiskey. I looked under my bed and there was a case of McIntosh Scotch and a case of half-pints,” she is quoted as saying. ”If he was supposed to be putting people in jail for hauling so much whiskey, why was he keeping so much of it?”


	Diane eventually left Adamsville, marrying and having children. She died in 2010 at the age of 60. Mike stayed close with his stepfather and never publicly questioned his narrative before his own death in 2021, age 66. Dwana, Pusser's only known biological child, felt the most profound psychological effects, with both of her parents dead before her 14th birthday. Much of her estate, approximately $260,000 (more than $1.7 million today) was lost when Pusser's mother, Helen, hired a supposed private investigator whom she paid more than $100,000 to look into an alleged murder conspiracy, according to the Toronto Star.


	Dwana got pregnant at 16 with her first daughter, Atoyia, marrying the girl's father in a brief union. Several other husbands came and went; a second daughter, Madison, was born in 1990. Though she worked for more than 15 years at a local radio station, hosting the afternoon drive-time show, Dwana invested most of her energy in her father's legacy, particularly with the official opening of the Buford Pusser Museum in 1988, and a later, the short-lived restaurant Pusser's.

	











	In her memoir Walking On, Dwana stated that she believed her father's death wasn't an accident. If she had any reservations about the official narrative about Pauline's murder, expressing them — and the public refutation of the myth by Buford Pusser's daughter — was out of the question. Dwana eventually developed multiple sclerosis and struggled with depression. In 2018, according to an autopsy report obtained by Mike Elam, she died by suicide at the age of 57. Six years later, Atoyia, just 46 years old, died.


	At the end of October, the city of Adamsville hosted a meeting to discuss the future of the Buford Pusser Museum. The Pusser skeptics largely stayed away, so the overall sentiment in the room was that Pusser was, and always would be, the local hero, and that the museum should remain open, a pledge of allegiance to the myth. Madison Garrison Bush, Dwana's daughter and the older surviving Pusser heir, appeared by Zoom, vowing to take legal action against the TBI. In a statement posted the following day, Bush said: “Do I believe my grandfather killed my grandmother in the ambush? I absolutely do not.”


	Bush moved to Houston a few years ago, where she is raising her family and was recently crowned Mrs. Plus America, but Adamsville, she said in an email a few days after the meeting, is always with her. “There are no easy words for the kind of loss my family has faced,” she tells me. “Losing my mother was like losing my anchor — she was my link to the past, my mentor, and my best friend. Then, losing my sister felt like the ground shifted all over again. Grief like that never really leaves you; it changes you. But it also clarifies what truly matters.”

	For her, the recent TBI revelations about her grandmother's murder may have been painful and “stirred up questions,” but they also confirmed her sense of purpose. “Truth doesn't erase legacy, and this past investigation did not prove a new truth. It deepens it. My goal is to protect our family's humanity — to ensure that behind the legend, people never forget there was love, loss, and a little girl who grew up without her parents, whose story still deserves to be told with respect. It's living with the weight of history, but also trying to live your own story in the present.”


	That story will continue. Last month, the museum announced that the annual Sheriff Buford Pusser Festival would return to Adamsville in May.

UFOs continue to be one of the most fascinating topics in the world.

Something strange is going on in the skies of Wyoming.

When it comes to topics that fascinate and captivate the internet, there are few higher on the list than UFOs.

There's one big reason why that's a fact.

We have countless photos and videos, and very little concrete information to work with. If the government does know what is going on, it certainly isn't being generous with the information.

We now have a new situation developing in the Cowboy State.

The Cowboy State Daily recently reported that officials are dealing with unknown objects flying over Sweetwater County's Red Desert and Jim Bridger Power Plant.

The outlet reported that Sheriff John Grossnickle has seen the ""drone-like flying objects with his own eyes,"" and sightings have been going on for a little over a year.

A representative for the county's sheriff's office told the Cowboy State Daily that the objects are at an altitude too high to be engaged from the ground. That mirrors similar incidents where fighter jets had to be scrambled against unknown objects.

Police believe the objects ""move like drones, but are fundamentally still a mystery,"" according to the same report.

To make the situation even stranger, it doesn't appear the authorities have a single clue as to what is in the sky or why the objects are repeatedly flying in the areas they're consistently being spotted.

Yet again, we have another data point about UFOs/UAPs, and zero actual evidence or proof as to what is going on.

The most fascinating part of this situation is that the drones are flying so high that they're outside of engagement distance.

I'm not a drone expert, but how many civilian drones are capable of hitting altitudes that can exceed gunfire range?

It would appear that whatever is in the skies of Wyoming is very technologically advanced. Now, does that mean it's little green aliens? No. It could be the government testing new technology, and remaining silent about it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=uap","Transient revelations: the science behind UAPs","https://www.meer.com/en/101984-transient-revelations-the-science-behind-uaps","Tue, 23 Dec 2025 07:04:52 GMT","

In a recent All Things Unexplained episode, Vanderbilt's Dr. Stephen Bruehl details peer-reviewed evidence that “transients” in pre-Sputnik sky plates spike around nuclear tests—and recounts an insider claim that Congress was privately briefed on the possibility of non-human intelligences living among us.

Dr. Stephen Bruehl, collaborating with Dr. Beatriz Villarroel of the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics (Nordita), analyzed digitized Palomar Observatory plates from 1949–1957—an era before satellites or orbital clutter. Using approximately 2,700 days of observations, the pair compared the occurrence of transient, star-like points (appearing on one plate, gone on later ones) against dates of above-ground nuclear tests and cataloged UAP reports.

Their analysis revealed three striking patterns:

Days within a ±1-day “nuclear window” showed about a 45% higher likelihood of transients.

The effect peaked the day after a test, with roughly a 68% increase in transient odds.

Transients also tracked with ground UAP reports, forming a three-way pattern: nuclear tests ↔ transients ↔ UAP sightings.

Because these photographic plates predate satellites and modern debris, they provide a uniquely clean dataset. Villarroel's complementary analysis suggests many transients behave like sun-reflective objects in orbit—bright in sunlight, fading in Earth's shadow—consistent with flat, reflective surfaces at altitude. The team's findings now invite replication using other historical plate archives to confirm or challenge the correlation.

During the interview, Bruehl recounted a credible second-hand account that a private Congressional briefing included discussion of non-human intelligences (NHI) living among us.

This remains Bruehl's personal account rather than an independently verified claim, but it resonates with increasing governmental interest in historical UAP data, archival collaborations, and formal investigation of unusual aerial phenomena.

The day-after spike hints at a time-linked relationship between nuclear detonations and transient phenomena, deserving renewed physical and statistical scrutiny.

The triangulated correlation among tests, transients, and UAP reports statistically strengthens decades of anecdotal “UFOs & nukes” stories—this time with quantitative evidence.

The pre-satellite era offers confidence that the patterns aren't merely artifacts of modern orbital traffic.

Replication: apply the same methodology to additional plate archives, such as those of the Vatican Observatory and other 1940s–1950s global collections.

Method refinement: integrate machine learning to reduce confounders; include controls for geomagnetic storms, test locations, and seasonal factors.

Open data collaboration: encourage institutional access to digitized plates and structured UAP databases for transparent cross-verification.

On a ±1-day nuclear window, we saw roughly 45% higher odds of a transient; most of the effect lands the day after—about 68% higher odds.

(Dr. Stephen Bruehl)

Pre-Sputnik skies were clean. That's the strength of this dataset.

(Dr. Stephen Bruehl)

I was told that a private Congressional briefing touched on NHI living among us—and that was exactly what Congress was told. 

(Dr. Stephen Bruehl, as recounted on the show)

Bruehl's new preprint with Little and Powell (Cluster Analysis of Features Associated with Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) tackled a different problem — how to make sense of hundreds of credible UAP reports spanning seventy years. Drawing from Powell et al.'s curated database of 301 high-quality cases, the team ran a two-step cluster analysis on 216 sightings complete enough for computation.

Five variables were fed into the model: shape, estimated size, ability to hover, presence of electromagnetic effects, and presence of sound.

The algorithm returned seven statistically distinct clusters with a silhouette score of 0.6, meaning strong cohesion and separation—proof that these patterns weren't random noise.

Classic disc: silent, hovering discs or spheres, often with domes, viewed close to the ground; “falling-leaf” or wobbling motions are common.

Daylight disc: identical shapes but seen by pilots at altitude; non-hovering, often radar-tracked, sometimes in formation.

Cylindrical giants: cigar or bullet shapes, the largest objects in the dataset; half could hover, some played “cat and mouse” with observers.

Triangular craft: silent black triangles seen mostly at night, with red-and-white lights, hovering yet capable of Mach-1 bursts and instant acceleration.

Ovoid flyers: oval or triangular craft lacking sound, hovering, or EM effects; likely distant or high-altitude observations—perhaps misidentified technology.

Electromagnetic objects: discs or ovoids producing EM interference — car stalls, compass failures — almost all seen within 2,000 feet.

Audible anomalies: varied shapes united only by the presence of sound; often near-ground, close-range, illuminated, but relatively slow.

The computer's verdict echoed decades of anecdotal lore—yet with the statistical rigor of biomedical pattern recognition.

“When a clustering model yields a silhouette of 0.6,” Bruehl said, “that means there are real, separable structures hiding in the noise.”

Shape emerged as the strongest clustering driver, but not the only one.
Two clusters existed solely because they did not hover, likely reflecting different observation contexts (civilian vs military pilots).

Another pair was defined by energy signatures—electromagnetic interference versus audible propulsion.

Even more striking was what the clusters implied about propulsion physics. Roughly a third of the discs and triangles both hovered and accelerated silently beyond Mach 1—flight envelopes no known human craft can achieve without thunderous thrust or heat bloom.

The team compared these behaviors to every known platform—jets, helicopters, drones, lighter-than-air craft—and found none fit. Statistical analysis had backed what witnesses had long claimed: some UAP move as if inertia itself is optional.

The dataset also captured history's rhythm. Triangular and boomerang craft (Cluster 4) rose sharply in post-1980s reports, while daylight discs dominated the early Cold War.

Objects producing EM effects stayed remarkably consistent across decades — close, low-altitude, metallic — suggesting a stable phenomenon rather than cultural drift.

Bruehl interprets this as both caution and promise: “Even with witness error, when independent eras reproduce the same geometry and behavior, you're probably measuring something real.”

At first glance, the nuclear-transients paper and the UFO-cluster paper address different domains—astronomical photography vs human testimony. Yet together they outline a continuum of anomalies:

Energy disturbances in the environment (nuclear tests, EM fields).

Observable transients or structured craft responding in measurable ways.

Statistical patterns are resilient across decades and data types.

In both cases, the signal only emerged after noise reduction—clean plates in one, curated witness data in the other. It's the same methodology Bruehl honed studying chronic pain patients: isolate variables, let the clusters speak.

Bruehl remains cautious. His papers don't claim extraterrestrial origin, only statistical distinctness. But in a field long divided between believers and debunkers, that may be the boldest claim of all—that the unknown can be analyzed.

“Science advances when you quantify curiosity,” he said. “We finally have enough data to treat UAP not as a rumor, but as a signal.”

Methodological proof-of-concept: Cluster analysis can convert qualitative UFO lore into testable archetypes.
Historical Baseline: Both studies use pre-satellite or tightly screened data, minimizing modern contamination.
Interdisciplinary Gateway: Astrophysics, psychology, and data science converge on questions once confined to speculation.

Bruehl's next step, he says, is to scale the model with machine-learning classifiers across millions of reports, integrating atmospheric and radar metadata — a first true phenomenology of the unexplained.","{'href': 'https://www.meer.com', 'title': 'Meer | English edition'}","other"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=paranormal","Pub conducts paranormal probe after strange occurrences","https://salisburyandavon.co.uk/pub-conducts-paranormal-probe-after-strange-occurrences/","Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:40:39 GMT","




WHEN the doors of the historic New Inn in Amesbury closed for the night earlier this month, the pub was far from quiet.

Instead of last orders and lock-up, the centuries-old Grade II listed building played host to a paranormal investigation that stretched into the early hours – and left its new landlords intrigued rather than unnerved.

Landlord Nate Saitch says the idea came about after interest from the paranormal community found its way to the pub's social media.

“The Fear Frequency approached us through our social media,” he explained. “They had heard many stories about strange goings-on at the New Inn, both from published articles and first-hand accounts from customers and former tenants.

“In fact, they weren't the first to ask. They were the second investigation team to contact us; the first team couldn't match dates with us in the diary.”

The investigation took place after closing time on Sunday, December 6, with the team remaining on site until around 4am.

Landlord Nate (far right) is on the edge of his seat.

With the pub empty and lights low, the atmosphere was set for what would turn out to be a memorable night.

Among the standout moments for Nate and his team was an unexpected revelation about one of the investigators.

“One of the most exciting moments was a discovery about the skeptical cameraman, Brandon,” said Nate.

“During the investigation, it emerged that he had psychic abilities as a child, which came as a real surprise.”

There was also a moment that made everyone stop in their tracks: “There was also a loud crash heard on the stairs, even though the upstairs area was completely empty at the time.”

Without revealing everything uncovered during the investigation, Nate admits the night delivered more than they anticipated.

“The investigation produced some very interesting results. We uncovered some unexpected information, and I was also warned not to dig into a blocked-up tunnel in the cellar.”

What's that noise?!

Josh Fear of Fear Frequency, the team behind the investigation, says the New Inn had long been on their radar.

He said: “I chose The New Inn after hearing multiple reports of unexplained activity from both staff and locals, including unusual noises, footsteps, and things being heard or felt when no one else was around.

“The history of the pub was a big part of the appeal. Knowing how long it's been part of the local community and how many people have passed through over the years makes it a fascinating place to investigate, as older buildings often seem to hold onto energy or memories from the past.”

A personal connection added weight to those stories: “I also have a friend who previously lived there and experienced things turning on by themselves, unexplained footsteps, and other activity, which added to my interest.”

During the night, the team experienced “several moments that couldn't be easily explained,” including unexplained sounds, flickering lights and equipment such as the REM Pod reacting with no obvious cause.



One incident echoed what Nate had heard earlier. “One of the most interesting moments was a loud crashing sound that came directly from upstairs while everyone was downstairs at the opposite end of the building,” Josh said.

Despite the late night and eerie moments, the experience left a positive impression. “Yes, definitely,” Nate said when asked if he would host another investigation.

“It was a very positive experience, and everything that happened felt friendly and positive in nature.”

For a pub steeped in history, it seems the New Inn may still have a few stories left to tell, whether from the past, the present, or somewhere in between.

Vanderpump Rules 2.0 is in full swing, and while most of the new cast doesn't have direct ties to the OGs, the same can't be said for SUR manager Demy Selem, who started working at the restaurant when Scheana Shay was still employed as a waitress. At the time, Selem remembers thinking she “would never want” to be a part of the reality show, but as the years passed and her friendships with the next generation of SUR-vers grew stronger, she eventually came around to the idea.

“Honestly, I wasn't super close with any of the old cast and with the new cast—Marcus, Kim, Natalie, Venus—we were all always hanging out anyway,” Selem told DECIDER over a Zoom call. “They kind of talked me into it.”

While the cast may be different, the amount of drama is certainly the same. In Episode 1, Natalie Maguire lands herself in trouble after coming to SUR on her day off—with her family—and berating Paulo, the faceless 54-year-old SUR bartender she was dating, for blocking her number. The twist? Selem, who has an on-again off-again friendship with Maguire, dated Paulo first. With the bartender opting to remain off-camera, some fans have wondered if his name was actually code for Peter Madrigal, SUR's longtime manager who appeared throughout the early seasons of Vanderpump Rules.

“That makes me nauseous. I'm sorry. That makes me sick because Peter's one of my closest friends,” Selem said. “Peter and I have laughed about it because he's that guy friend that I've had that has never tried to hit on me, never tried anything with me. Since I started at SUR, we've always just been friends.”

When DECIDER caught up with Selem, she also spoke about SUR's new HR system that put an end to those risqué photoshoots, what it was like to work with Shay when the OG show was filming, and how business at the restaurant has changed since the pandemic. Check out the full interview below.

DECIDER: You are the longest SUR employee on the cast, so what has it been like to go from watching the OG stars film the show at the restaurant to now doing it yourself?

DEMY SELEM: Working when they were filming with the cameras around, I would just be like, “Oh, my God, I would never want to do this. This is crazy.” And now I'm doing it. It's definitely been the most amazing experience. I thought it was going to be way more intense. But the cameras are there and you don't notice them. Even when I was working there with the old cast and they were filming, I would just walk in the middle of a shot to go grab drinks and run to a table. I was just still working. Cameras don't exist. They're not there. But being in front of the camera, I thought would be way scarier than it actually is. I mean, there are security cameras literally all over SUR. So we're always on camera. They're literally everywhere. Nobody knows. They are secret ones and no one knows about them because people are going crazy shit there.

What was it that made you want to go from never doing the show to giving it a shot?

Honestly, I wasn't super close with any of the old cast and with the new cast—Marcus Kim, Natalie, Venus—we were all always hanging out anyway. They kind of talked me into it. Like, “It's gonna be so fun.” I just knew it would be different if I did it with this group of people, basically. So I'm glad I did.

I have to ask: what was it actually like working with Scheana Shay at SUR? And did she give you any advice going into this new chapter?

When I started at SUR in 2017, 2018, Scheana was the very first person that asked me for my phone number to hang out with outside of work. This was when she was back in Vegas. She was doing that thing in Vegas for two or three months. She had a residency thing in Vegas and so she invited me to come. I was only at SUR for like two weeks then. I went, we hung out in Vegas and she was super nice to me. She was very welcoming. I definitely appreciate her for being so sweet because I was very nervous starting in that job. She definitely made it easier. We still stay in touch. She's been very supportive. I asked her what entertainment lawyer I [should] pick when I got the contract. She helped me with that. 

What do you think about the comparisons to the OG cast?

Nothing can compare to the original cast. We are a very different group of people. There's no Scheana, there's no Stassi, there's no James, Jax. We are all very different, and I would really love for people to stop trying to compare the two because we've never tried to compare to them. We're our own people.

There have been a lot of conspiracies online that Paulo is actually Peter. 

That makes me nauseous. I'm sorry. That makes me sick because Peter's one of my closest friends. First of all, Peter is only 42. OK, so, not my type. Just kidding. No, I've seen that so much. That is crazy to me. Peter and I have laughed about it because he's that guy friend that I've had that has never tried to hit on me, never tried anything with me. Since I started at SUR, we've always just been friends. He and I have slept in the same bed. When I'm drunk, because he lives down the street from SUR, I can go and sleep in his bed. Nothing. You know what I mean? Peter is one of my closest friends. So when people say that, I'm just like, “Oh, my God, you guys are insane. Who comes up with this kind of stuff?”

Advertisement

Speaking of Peter, I have to ask for the diehards, how has he been? Will we see him in the background of any scenes?

You might see him maybe in the background. During the summer, he was doing other work and stuff and traveling. So I honestly don't think he was there as much, but maybe in the background, yeah.

In this week's episode, Lisa revives an old classic: the SUR photoshoot. But this time it's much more PG than it used to be. Are we grateful for that? Or do you think the new cast could've/should've let their freak flags fly a bit more?

Advertisement

When Lisa said we have HR now, that was not a lie. We have HR. Things are very different now than when I started at SUR. The little dresses that we used to wear, the Saint Tropez dresses, we don't do that anymore. I had a nip slip multiple times while working. Things are very different now, so I think this one just needs to be a little bit classier. I do wish that we could have been able to do something a little more scandalous. But we have HR now.

As manager, I'm sure it's really hard to balance being the boss and being the friend. I think we see a lot of that struggle in scenes with you and Natalie. What is it like to navigate that, specifically with Natalie?

First of all, I could never, ever, ever imagine speaking to a manager that way. When I started working at SUR, Peter was my manager, and he's one of my closest friends and I would never, ever, ever think of talking to him that way. So there's that. Also, as a friend, as someone who claims to love me and wants to fix our friendship, [she's] not acting like it.

Advertisement

How are you and Natalie now?

Natalie and I are very up and down. We always said we need couples therapy or something. We are very up and down. We're like Kim and Marcus. I'm not kidding. We are like him and Marcus. We love each other, but sometimes, we just don't want to be together and I can't stand her.

Advertisement

It sounds kind of sisterly.

I'm so glad I don't have a sister, honestly, because that sounds like actual hell. As of right now, we're not speaking. But we were talking yesterday. 

This week, we see you get really worked up to the point where you're shaking – and Lisa even gets involved. How often do you confide in Lisa? Or do you try to keep it away from her?

I don't really like to bring that to Lisa because she already has so much going on. I don't want to go to her and be like, “Hey, your bartender's a crazy person. She's literally giving me anxiety and making me want to rip my hair out. “So I don't want to give that to her. But she happened to be there that day. But I normally do try to keep her [out of it]. I don't want to worry her with such little things. 

Kim says that Natalie is not a girl's girl. Would you agree?

I think it depends on the day. With Natalie, you never know which Natalie you're going to get. That's the problem. She can be a girl's girl, but she can also not be a girl's girl.

In the premiere, we saw Lisa talking about how the pandemic had an effect on business at SUR. As someone who has been there for a while, how would you say things have changed over the years?

What Lisa said during that meeting, I feel like people are understanding that it's not even just a SUR thing. Most restaurants are going through this. Things have not been the same since COVID. We used to have, like, 600 covers on a Friday night, Saturday night. Now, if we have 250, it's a busy night. It's not a SUR thing. It's like that everywhere. Things have not bounced back since the pandemic. We used to be open until 2 a.m. every night. Now we're not. It makes me really sad because I know that place is fun and people love being there. I know it'll get back to that one day. I used to love going to work. I mean, I still do, but I used to really love going to work. Getting home at 4 a.m. after work, I used to be in a good mood. We were making so much money. Now I'm managing. It's not as fun for me at least. It's fun for everyone else, but they weren't there pre-COVID, so they don't know how fun it used to be. 

I've heard that Chris and Jason's OnlyFans is going to be a big topic. Have you seen their page? What are your thoughts?

I learned what a penis pump is so that was something. I did see a little part of a clip before I think I threw the phone because I was traumatized. 

Were you never able to look at them the same again?

Oh, for a while. But I've accepted it's who they are, they're cousins, they're in love.  It is what it is. I've accepted it. I don't judge. 

What else can you tease about the rest of the season?

I'm really excited for people to see me actually smile and have fun because I feel like I'm usually always in manager mode. The cast trip that we took, those three days were honestly the best for all of us. We had so much fun and I'm really, really excited for that.

A satellite photo from July shows intricate snowy stripes painted across the Atacama Desert in Chile. The icy weather temporarily put the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observatory into ""survival mode.""

Where is it? Atacama Desert, Chile

What's in the photo? A rare dusting of snow covers parts of one of the driest places on Earth

Which satellite took the photo? Landsat 9

When was it taken? July 10, 2025

This striking satellite photo captured a rare spectacle earlier this year, when ""one of the driest places on Earth"" experienced a rare snowstorm. This freak event temporarily turned the barren, rocky landscape white — and briefly shut down one of the world's most powerful radio telescopes.

The Atacama Desert is a roughly 40,500-square-mile (105,000 square kilometer) non-polar desert, located within a 1,000-mile-long (1,600 km) strip of land nestled between the Pacific Ocean and the Andes mountains in northern Chile. It is the world's oldest non-polar desert, having remained semi-arid for at least 150 million years. And it is home to the sunniest spot on Earth, the Altiplano Plateau, which experiences sunlight levels equivalent to those on Venus.

The desert is also widely considered to be one of the driest places on Earth, alongside other hyperarid spots, such as Antarctica and the Sahara. Some areas currently experience as little as 0.002 inches (0.5 millimeters) of rain annually, according to Guinness World Records. Previous research has hinted that parts of the Atacama went nearly 400 years without any recorded rain, between 1570 and 1971.

On June 25, a rare snowstorm hit Atacama after a ""cold-core cyclone"" unexpectedly drifted down from the north, covering over half the desert with white powder, according to NASA's Earth Observatory.

The satellite photo above shows a section of the desert in the Chajnantor Plateau, which rises to around 16,000 feet (5,000 meters) above sea level. This area is home to the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observatory — an array of more than 50 radio dishes that scour the ""Dark Universe."" (ALMA itself is not visible in the aerial photo.)

 




This area is well-suited to astronomical research because it is remote, dry and well-elevated, which reduces interference and maximizes the amount of data telescopes like ALMA can collect. But when the snow settled over the observatory, it temporarily forced ALMA into ""survival mode,"" meaning that the dishes were repositioned to stop them from accumulating snow, halting observations.

The icy dust may have also affected the Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) Telescope, located around 530 miles (850 km) southwest of ALMA, but to a lesser extent, according to Live Science's sister site Space.com. The newly constructed Vera C. Rubin Observatory is also located in Atacama, near the SOAR telescope, but was not affected by the storm.

The snow did not last long, and most of it had disappeared by July 16. In some places, the sunlight was so intense that the snow likely sublimated, or turned directly from solid to gas, before it melted, according to the Earth Observatory.

This is not the first time that snow has fallen in the Atacama. Similar events also occurred in 2011, 2013 and 2021.

The region has also experienced several intense bouts of rain in recent years. When this happens, it can trigger deadly mudflows. In March 2015, at least 31 people were killed after heavy rainfall triggered Atacama's largest ever flood, according to a 2016 study.

 




Rain can also cause desert flowers, which normally appear in spring, to unexpectedly bloom during winter months, creating fields of vibrant petals to sprout up around the desert. This most recently happened in 2024, after a surprise rain shower caught the plants off guard.

—World's largest iceberg, A23a, is disintegrating into thousands of pieces alongside penguin refuge

Precipitation is rare in the Atacama for two reasons. Firstly, it sits within the ""rain shadow"" of the Andes, which block clouds moving in from the east. And second, cold ocean currents off the region's western Pacific coastline prevent water from evaporating into the air over the desert. This makes Atacama inhospitable to most lifeforms, aside from hardy desert flowers and extreme microbes that live well below its dry surface.

However, the recent instances of extreme precipitation in the region could be a sign that human-caused climate change is making it more likely for snow and rain to fall there. If this continues, the Atacama may one day no longer be one of the driest places on Earth.

Brain-computer interfaces are moving out of the lab and into real medical use.

In this episode of The Michael Shermer Show, Michael Shermer talks with Matt Angle, founder and CEO of Paradromics, a neurotechnology company developing one of the most advanced high-data-rate brain implants in the world, similar to Neuralink. These devices record activity from individual neurons, making it possible to restore speech in people with paralysis, reconnect the brain to external devices, and potentially treat chronic pain and neurological disorders with far greater precision than existing approaches.

Angle explains why progress in neuroscience has been limited not by biology, but by data—how much information we can actually read from the brain, and how fast. He describes how patients who can no longer speak may soon communicate fluently using only brain signals, why invasive implants can sometimes be safer than long-term drug treatments, and what it takes to bring a brain implant through FDA approval and into the clinic.

The conversation also touches on the larger questions raised by this technology, including autonomy, consciousness, and what happens when the boundary between brain and machine begins to blur.

Matt Angle is the Founder and CEO of Paradromics, a neurotechnology leader developing the world's most advanced and clinically viable brain-computer interface (BCI) platform—bridging human thought and digital capability. Paradromics' BCI platform records brain activity with unmatched precision, capturing data at the level of individual neurons. This advanced technology enables the decoding of vast amounts of brain data, opening the door to next-generation treatments for paralysis, chronic pain, addiction, mental health conditions, and more. With the power of AI, this platform has the potential to radically shift how healthcare providers approach some of the most challenging medical conditions.

Angle earned his PhD in Neuroscience from the University of Heidelberg, followed by postdoctoral research at Stanford University. Paradromics engineered its first clinical product, the Connexus® BCI, received two FDA Breakthrough Device Designations, and performed the first-in-human neural recording in May 2025. The company is now preparing to launch a clinical trial in early 2026, pending regulatory approval.

Accused gang members look out from their cell at the Counter Terrorism Confinement Center on Dec. 15, in Tecoluca, El Salvador.John Moore/Getty Images

A 60 Minutes segment on Venezuelan men who say they were tortured after being sent to a prison in El Salvador by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration surfaced on a Canadian broadcaster's website despite being pulled from the show.

The 13-minute piece, by reporter Sharyn Alfonsi, was available on the website of Global TV on Monday afternoon and early evening. The previous day, CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss ordered the story excluded from the broadcast just hours before airtime, drawing accusations of censorship.

The move follows months of criticism that CBS is going out of its way to curry favour with Mr. Trump and his supporters, including by installing Ms. Weiss, an anti-woke media personality, atop its news division.

The piece appeared to no longer be available on the Global site later on Monday evening. Representatives from Global and its owner, Corus Entertainment, did not respond to requests for comment on Monday.

Ms. Alfonsi's work, which The Globe and Mail accessed before it was removed from the web, airs the accounts of two Venezuelans who say guards at the Centre for the Confinement of Terrorism – best known by its Spanish-language initials, CECOT – subjected them and hundreds of other men to physical abuse after they were taken to the prison from the U.S. as part of Mr. Trump's mass deportation drive.

CBS News' Bari Weiss directs 60 Minutes to pull story critical of U.S. deportation policy

One of the men who spoke to Ms. Alfonsi, Luis Munoz Pinto, said he was beaten by four guards shortly after arriving at CECOT. They knocked his face against the wall and broke his tooth, he recounted. Mr. Munoz Pinto said he was beaten many more times, including by guards who hit his genitals with their hands. He said prisoners were not given clean water and had to instead drink toilet and bathing water.

It was common for prisoners to be locked in a pitch-black isolation cell, he added. “They would take you there and beat you for hours and leave you locked in there for days,” he said in the broadcast.

Mr. Munoz Pinto said he has no criminal history, not even a traffic ticket, but was falsely accused of being a gangster based on his tattoos.

A second man, William Lozada Sanchez, recounted being forced to kneel on the floor for 24 hours at a time. Anyone who couldn't do it, he said, was taken to an isolation cell named “the Island.”

“The Island is a little room where there's no light, no ventilation, nothing. It's a cell for punishment where you can't see your hand in front of your face. After they locked us in, they came to beat us every half-hour,” Mr. Lozada Sanchez said in the piece.

2024: Trump sues CBS over Kamala Harris ‘60 Minutes' interview

The segment casts doubt on the U.S. President's insistence that the deported men were members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Citing research by Human Rights Watch, it reports that, of 252 Venezuelans taken to CECOT, nearly half had no criminal history and only eight had convictions for violent offences.

Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley also help corroborate the details about CECOT shared by detainees in the 60 Minutes report.

Ms. Alfonsi, in a note to CBS colleagues widely reported by U.S. media, said the story had already been cleared by CBS's lawyers and its standards division before Ms. Weiss had it pulled. Ms. Alfonsi said Ms. Weiss wanted the story held because Trump administration officials had refused to be interviewed for it.

The reporter warned that such rationale meant the U.S. government could “veto” any story it wanted by simply not commenting.

“If the administration's refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch' for any reporting they find inconvenient,” Ms. Alfonsi wrote, adding that Ms. Weiss's decision was “a political one.”

Ms. Weiss, in a statement on Sunday, said she held the story because it was “not ready” and that she would “look forward to airing this important piece when it's ready.”

Paramount settles with Trump over ‘60 Minutes' interview for US$16-million

In comments to a Monday morning editorial conference call also provided to U.S. media, Ms. Weiss reportedly offered another rationale, saying that the CECOT story was old news. “The public knows that Venezuelans have been subjected to horrific treatment at this prison,” she said. “We need to do more.”

CBS is already under fire for agreeing to pay US$16-million earlier this year to settle a lawsuit from Mr. Trump over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris, his Democratic presidential rival in the 2024 election.

CBS's owner, Paramount Global, recently merged with Skydance Media, a move that required federal government approval. During the approval process, David Ellison, Paramount Skydance's chief executive, told the regulator that CBS would be friendlier to conservatives. 

Mr. Ellison, whose father, Oracle founder Larry Ellison, is an adviser and donor to Mr. Trump, appointed Ms. Weiss as the head of CBS News after buying her news website, the Free Press.

Ms. Weiss, a former New York Times columnist, set up the Free Press in 2021 to counter what she viewed as left-of-centre biases in the media.

            British police said on Tuesday that comedian and actor Russell Brand had been charged with a new count of rape and another of sexual assault.
    


            The new charges – authorized by the Crown Prosecution Service – related to two women and followed five charges made in April involving four other women: two counts of rape, one of indecent assault and two of sexual assault, going back more than two decades.
    


            Brand, 50, will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on January 20 in relation to the new charges. A trial on the earlier charges is scheduled to begin at Southwark Crown Court on June 16.
    


            Reuters has attempted to reach Brand for comment.
    


Russell Brand pleads not guilty to rape and sexual assault charges



            Brand pleaded not guilty in May to the five original charges. Once a well-known broadcaster in Britain and a former husband of US pop singer Katy Perry, he has denied having non-consensual sex.
    


            After the original charges were announced, he said he had been a fool and a sex addict in his younger days but “what I never was, was a rapist.”
    


            The original investigation began in September 2023 after allegations were reported by Channel 4 TV's “Dispatches” show and The Sunday Times newspaper.

Russian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev has backed US President Donald Trump's latest criticism of the New York Times, saying some Western media outlets were working in sync against the American leader, his Ukraine peace efforts, and Russia.

Dmitriev, Russia's senior negotiator, who just returned from talks in Miami with top US interlocutors, made the remarks in an X post on Tuesday while reposting a social media statement by Trump.

Trump, writing on Truth Social earlier in the day, called the NYT “a serious threat” to US national security and accused it of “lies and purposeful misrepresentations,” branding the outlet “a true enemy of the people.” 

“Their radical left, unhinged behavior, writing fake articles and opinions in a never-ending way, must be dealt with and stopped,” Trump wrote.

And it's not just the NYT. It's a globalist, well-funded, organized, and synchronized US/UK/EU deep-state-aligned fake media machine—targeting traditional values, common sense, economic prosperity — and therefore President Trump, his team, his peace efforts, and Russia. 👇 pic.twitter.com/Y4VbWNodJV

Backing Trump's message, Dmitriev said it was “not just the NYT,” but what he described as a “globalist, well-funded, organized, and synchronized US/UK/EU deep-state-aligned fake media machine,” which he said was targeting “Trump, his team, his peace efforts, and Russia.”

Dmitriev has previously said that what he called coordinated media attacks were being timed to undermine the ongoing US-Russia negotiations and described the latest Miami round as “constructive.”

Last week's talks in Miami occurred as several European powers have pushed to insert themselves into the US-led diplomatic efforts. Moscow has long accused these NATO members of undermining Trump's peace efforts through their hawkish stance and attempts to use frozen Russian assets to bankroll Kiev and prolong the conflict.

In recent months, Trump has publicly attacked several news outlets, launched a White House ‘media bias' tracker, and engaged in high-profile disputes with, and multi-billion-dollar lawsuits against, publications including the NYT and CBS. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called the NYT a “fever swamp,” accusing it of publishing fake stories about Trump's mental health.

Last month, Trump also threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion, accusing it of interfering in the 2024 presidential election by manipulating public perception through a spliced edit of his January 6, 2021 speech.

US President Donald Trump has claimed that his Venezuelan counterpart, Nicolas Maduro, would be “smart” to leave office as Washington intensifies its apparent efforts to remove him from power. 

The US has assembled a naval force that Trump calls “by far the biggest we ever had in South America” off Venezuela's coast and is enforcing a blockade on its oil tanker traffic, citing unilateral sanctions. Since September, the US military has also been conducting strikes on small boats alleged to be carrying drugs, which UN experts have condemned as unlawful extrajudicial executions.

When asked repeatedly during a press conference on Monday if Washington's intention was to force Maduro from power, Trump gave non-committal remarks alluding to that possibility. “He can do whatever he wants,” the president responded. “If he wants to do something, if he plays tough, it will be the last time he ever plays tough.” He also claimed it would be “smart” for Maduro to step down.

Earlier Monday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested Maduro is the target of Washington's actions during a ‘Fox and Friends' interview.

“We're not just interdicting these ships, but we're also sending a message around the world that the illegal activity that Maduro is participating in cannot stand, he needs to be gone, and that we will stand up for our people,” she said.

The US pressure campaign has been condemned by other nations, including Russia. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called his Venezuelan counterpart, Yvan Gil, on Monday to express solidarity and share Moscow's concern over “Washington's increasingly escalatory actions in the Caribbean Sea.”

Russia's Foreign Ministry has denied an Associated Press claim that it had begun evacuating families of diplomats from Venezuela.

BERLIN, December 23. /TASS/. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said that the US nuclear umbrella is an ""absolute guarantee"" for European NATO allies.

""When it comes to nuclear deterrence, the US nuclear umbrella is our absolute guarantee, and that will not change. Certainly, several European NATO allies have their own nuclear capabilities, and we engage in both direct and indirect cooperation in this regard. There's nothing more to say on this matter,"" Rutte said in an interview with the DPA news agency. He was responding to a question about whether European NATO allies need to bolster their nuclear deterrence capabilities.

The NATO chief further expressed confidence that the United States' commitment to the alliance under President Donald Trump will remain firm. ""Their national security strategy outlines that a secure Europe, a strong NATO, and close cooperation between the US and European NATO allies are American priorities,"" Rutte emphasized. At the same time, he noted that the US has its own specific interests within NATO.

""The Arctic represents a vital issue. We observe Chinese and Russian vessels active in that region. And we can only protect the Arctic together, with European and American NATO allies acting in unison,"" Rutte asserted. He added that the North Atlantic is also pivotal for US security. ""To guarantee the security of the North Atlantic, the US needs a strong European side of NATO. We're all in the same boat not just for historical reasons but for practical ones as well,"" he said.

Earlier this year, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that he would initiate discussions with allies about the possibility of placing European countries under the protection of France's nuclear deterrence forces. Germany, Poland, Lithuania, and Denmark have already expressed their readiness to discuss the issue. German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul previously stated that replacing the US nuclear umbrella for Europe is not feasible in the near future, though Germany is engaged in talks with France and the UK on nuclear matters.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, December 23. /TASS/. Russia welcomes foreign diplomats visiting the country with open arms, inviting them to enjoy its rich culture and vibrant people, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Alimov said during an event for heads of diplomatic missions at the State Historical Museum.

""Today, our embrace, our doors are wide open for you in the best place, with the most fascinating exhibition, which we ourselves have not yet seen,"" the deputy minister noted. ""You are welcome in our country. Diplomats must communicate, diplomats should have the opportunity to see the host country, understand it, and, if possible, love it.""

As part of the event, heads of diplomatic missions visited the unique Treasures of Imperial Residences: Tsarskoe Selo exhibition, featuring over 526 items. The exhibition not only contains items from the permanent collection of the museum located in one of Russia's most famous imperial residences but also features unique artifacts stored in its archives. In particular, jewelry from the Naryshkin Treasure is being displayed in Moscow for the first time.

A significant portion of the exhibition consists of personal belongings of Russian rulers, including uniforms, household items, and gifts from Asian countries, demonstrating the active development of Russia's international policy. Of particular interest are items from the famous Amber Room, miraculously rescued from Leningrad during the Great Patriotic War.

Foreign diplomats were also presented with a collection of paintings, which includes works by prominent Italian masters, as well as paintings by Ivan Aivazovsky, in particular the ""View of Constantinople by Night.""

Tips include flushing rat, squirt soap into toilet or if the rat is too large close toilet lid and call pest control experts

Residents in Washington state have been told to be aware of unwanted festive visitors before Santa comes down the chimney – rats coming up from the toilet.

Health officials in Washington warned that recent flooding in the state “may sweep rodents into the sewer systems”. In a Facebook post, the Seattle and King county public health department wrote: “If a rat visits your toilet, take a deep breath and follow these tips,” before outlining the steps to take if a rodent emerges from your commode.

Unsurprisingly, the first tip provided is: “Try to stay calm. That might not be easy under the circumstances.” The Facebook post advises people to flush the rat down the toilet or squeeze washing up liquid into the toilet to grease the reviled furry mammal's path back into the sewer.

If the rat is too large to be vanquished this way, the health officials say, residents should close the toilet lid and call a pest control company. Presumably, using other places of convenience would be advisable if caught short in the meantime.

Rats are surprisingly strong swimmers and can hold their breath for several minutes, meaning that, along with their tenacity and ability to squeeze into small spaces, they can easily enter someone's home via the toilet.

Such a scenario, a nightmare for people with musophobia, is more common in older buildings with dilapidated pipes following heavy rainfall.

Washington state has been dealing with some of its worst ever flooding this month, with several days of torrential rain causing thousands of people to be evacuated as floodwater inundated homes, washed away roads and triggered landslides.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

US President Donald Trump's newly named envoy has said he hopes to help ""make Greenland part of the US."" Denmark, which controls the autonomous island, is ""deeply angered"" according to its foreign minister.

Denmark is incensed at the appointment of Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry as new US special envoy to Greenland as President Donald Trump continues to heap pressure on the Nordic nation and looks to take over the autonomous territory from Copenhagen.

In appointing Landry on Sunday, Trump — who has threatened to take Greenland by force from ally Denmark if necessary — wrote that the southern governor, ""understands how essential Greenland is to our National Security, and will strongly advance our Country's Interests for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Allies, and indeed, the World.""

Landry took to the social media platform X to thank Trump for the appointment, writing, ""It's an honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the US.""

On Monday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said the move left him ""deeply angered"" and said Washington must respect Denmark's sovereignty, with Copenhagen vowing to summon the US ambassador in protest.

""As long as we have a kingdom in Denmark that consists of Denmark, the Faroe Islands, and Greenland,"" said Rasmussen, ""we cannot accept that there are those who undermine our sovereignty.""

Rasmussen told Denmark's TV 2 that he was ""particularly upset by his [Landry's] statements,"" calling them ""completely unacceptable,"" and adding to the Reuters news agency: ""We insist that everyone — including the US — must show respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark.""

The EU said it stands in ""full solidarity"" with Denmark and the people of Greenland as the US increased its efforts to take over the island. 
 
European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa both voiced their solidarity with Copenhagen, one of the EU's members, by calling territorial integrity and sovereignty ""fundamental principles of international law.""
 
""These principles are essential not only for the European Union, but for nations around the world,"" both posted on their X accounts.

Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said news of the appointment, ""might sound like a big deal,"" but added that it ""doesn't change anything for us here at home.""

""We will determine our future ourselves,"" he said.

In a joint statement with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, Nielsen added: “Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders and the US shall not take over Greenland.” 

Though most Greenlanders say they want to be independent of Denmark, they have also voiced very clear opposition to becoming the property of the US.

Trump, who floated the option of buying Greenland and established a new consulate there during his first term, has repeatedly threatened to get it no matter what since returning to office in January 2025.

He has sought to emphasize Greenland's location and mineral riches as key to US national security and has ignored the wishes of Greenlanders and Danish leaders in his pursuit.

The US has also dispatched high-level representatives such as Vice President JD Vance as well as Donald Trump Jr., to Greenland in an apparent effort to push the president's agenda.

This August, Denmark — a NATO ally — summoned US representatives over reports suggesting Washington was attempting to interfere in Greenland.

Greenland, located halfway between the US and the Arctic, is a former Danish colony that has held the right to declare its independence since 2009.

Patrick Hotze's three daughters made it home safe from Camp Mystic after July's catastrophic floods that killed 25 campers and two teenage counselors. He attended some of the funerals and says he understands the outrage over the Texas camp's plan to partially reopen next year.

He also intends to send his girls back.

“My heart is broken for them,” Hotze said of the parents whose girls died, including some he described as close friends. “I think it's different for each kid and each family.”

For the first time since the roaring flood, the 100-year-old all-girls Christian sleepaway retreat plans to sign up campers in January, forging ahead with a reopening that has divided families and stunned some lawmakers. Campers will start arriving in May, bunking on higher ground than the area where fast-rising waters on the Guadalupe River swept away two cabins.

Some families say the decision to let their daughters return is a vital step in their own healing from the disaster that is still under scrutiny. The floodwaters that worsened with terrifying quickness during the July Fourth holiday weekend killed at least 117 people in Kerr County alone. Two victims have still not been found, including an 8-year-old Camp Mystic camper.




Next year, Texas legislators are set to hold investigative hearings into the tragedy but have shown little appetite to assign blame. Local leaders in Kerr County, including two who were asleep when the waters started rising, remain in their jobs after defending their preparations and evacuation efforts. They are now steering a slow recovery while trying to expedite a new flood warning system before campers return.

“We recognize that returning to Camp Mystic carries both hope and heartache,” Camp Mystic's owners wrote in a letter to families this month. “For many of your daughters, this return is not simple, but it is a courageous step in their healing journey.”

It is unclear how many girls will return to Camp Mystic when the camp begins enrollment next month, but a spokesperson said there is “strong interest.” The camp's owner, Dick Eastland, died in the flood and his family has vowed to enhance safety measures before reopening, including two-way radios in every cabin and new flood warning river monitors.

The devastating July floods were hardly the first to strike the area known as “Flash Flood Alley,” where the limestone hills quickly gather water and funnel it into narrow river banks. This year was at least the fifth time in a century that flooding near the Guadalupe River has turned deadly. An attorney for Camp Mystic, Mikal Watts, said he and camp officials have contacted several former campers who witnessed previous floods and who told them they were nowhere near as high or as powerful as the flooding this year.

Those assurances have not quieted some parents of the 27 victims, who say the decision to reopen is insensitive and that the Eastland family has refused to take responsibility for its failures.

Lawsuits filed by some of the families allege camp operators failed to protect the children and even ordered girls and counselors in the cabins closest to the river to stay inside as floodwaters overwhelmed the property. Hundreds of 911 calls released by authorities this month included a woman who lived a mile downriver and said two of the campers had swept by.

“As parents of children who were killed at Camp Mystic last summer, we are deeply hurt but, sadly, not shocked by yet another insensitive announcement from Camp Mystic focused on enrollment,” the parents of six girls who died said in a public statement this month.

Some parents say Camp Mystic has played an instrumental role in their children's personal and spiritual development, and that eased their decision to allow their girls to return.

Liberty Lindley's 9-year-old daughter, Evie, was among those caught in the flooding. She was trapped with her campmates in a cabin dubbed Wiggle Inn, adjacent to the low-lying cabins that were quickly inundated by the flooded river.

Many of the girls Evie knew were swept to their deaths.

Yet despite the horror Evie endured, floating on mattresses with her friends in the pitch dark before being evacuated by helicopter, Lindley said her daughter didn't hesitate when asked if she wanted to return to Camp Mystic.

“I know some people don't understand that or think that's crazy,” she said of her decision to allow her daughter to go back.

She recalled talking with Evie — whose twin sister died of leukemia in 2024 — while washing her hair in the bathtub, right after her terrifying ordeal.

“She thought she was going to be seeing her sister that night in heaven,” Lindley recalled. “And she still looked at me with a smile and said, ‘Mom, I really hope next year at camp we do Mary Poppins again, because I still really want to be Bert.' That is just hours after the fact.”

Still, not all parents are eager to send their daughters back to Camp Mystic.

John Ball, an attorney in McAllen, Texas, whose daughter was at Camp Mystic during the flood, said he has serious reservations, especially after the poor communication from camp officials about his daughter's whereabouts.

Ball said he was out of town and didn't learn that his daughter was safe until more than 12 hours after the flooding, when she was able to borrow a cellphone and call him.

“That was the hardest part, not knowing,” Ball said.

“I think we're going to take this year off and see how it goes and what these changes look like that they're implementing,” he said, “and we'll go from there.”

A University of Oklahoma student who received a zero out of 25 on an assignment regarding gender norms says she was targeted for her Christian beliefs, citing a scathing response from the teacher's assistant who doled out the grade.

Weeks after a University of Oklahoma student's story about being flunked on a paper that touted her Christian faith caused a viral uproar, the teaching assistant behind the grade has been fired.

""Based on an examination of the graduate teaching assistant's prior grading standards and patterns, as well as the graduate teaching assistant's own statements related to this matter, it was determined that the graduate teaching assistant was arbitrary in the grading of this specific paper,"" the state's flagship school said in a Monday evening statement. ""The graduate teaching assistant will no longer have instructional duties at the University.""

Samantha Fulnecky, a junior at the school, received zero out of 25 on an assignment in which she referenced the Bible after graduate teaching assistant William ""Mel"" Curth, who uses she/they pronouns, scored the paper.

The teaching assistant tasked Fulnecky and her classmates with writing a response to a scholarly article titled ""Relations Among Gender Typicality, Peer Relations, and Mental Health During Early Adolescence,"" which discusses results of a study about gender norms among middle schoolers and the social ramifications children may face for not conforming to gender norms.

They were asked to provide a ""thoughtful discussion of some aspect of the article."" The rubric for the assignment did not require students to provide empirical evidence in their responses.

The third-year student responded by saying that gender norms should be celebrated, not denigrated. She cited Genesis, the first book of the Bible, in which God created men and women equally, but with separate purposes.

""Gender roles and tendencies should not be considered 'stereotypes,'"" Fulnecky wrote in her essay. ""Women naturally want to do womanly things because God created us with those womanly desires in our hearts. The same goes for men. God created men in the image of His courage and strength, and He created women in the image of His beauty. He intentionally created women differently than men and we should live our lives with that in mind.""

She later described the societal push toward nonbinary gender identification as ""demonic.""

Curth took exception to Fulnecky's essay, and gave her a zero out of 25.

""Please note that I am not deducting points because you have certain beliefs, but instead I am deducting point [sic] for you posting a reaction paper that does not answer the questions for this assignment, contradicts itself, heavily uses personal ideology over empirical evidence in a scientific class, and is at times offensive,"" Curth's explanation for the grade said.

Curth said the concept of only two sexes is not backed by science.

""You may personally disagree with this, but that doesn't change the fact that every major psychological, medical, pediatric, and psychiatric association in the United States acknowledges that, biologically and psychologically, sex and gender is neither binary nor fixed,"" Curth said.

The graduate teaching assistant also called Fulnecky's essay ""highly offensive.""

FEDERAL APPEALS COURT SIDES WITH WASHINGTON PROFESSOR PUNISHED FOR MOCKING UNIVERSITY LAND ACKNOWLEDGMENT

""I definitely think that I was being punished for what I believe because I very clearly stated in my essay in my response to the article, I very clearly stated my beliefs and stated what — not just my beliefs — but what the Bible and what God says about gender and about those roles,"" Fulnecky told Fox News Digital amid the uproar.

Curth was placed on administrative leave after the student filed a discrimination claim, as the university conducted an investigation.

In its statement announcing Curth's firing, the university said the school's provost, described as the ""highest-ranking academic officer,"" personally reviewed the incident before the decision to fire Curth was made.

""Because this matter involves both student and faculty rights, the University has engaged in repeated and detailed conversations with the Faculty Senate Executive Committee to ensure there is an understanding of the facts, the process, and the actions being taken,"" the statement said.

The school also noted that Fulnecky's grade had been restored. 

""The University of Oklahoma believes strongly in both its faculty's rights to teach with academic freedom and integrity and its students' right to receive an education that is free from a lecturer's impermissible evaluative standards. We are committed to teaching students how to think, not what to think. The University will continue to review best practices to ensure that its instructors have the comprehensive training necessary to objectively assess their students' work without limiting their ability to teach, inspire, and elevate our next generation.""

President Donald Trump has had a largely successful year at the Supreme Court, but on Friday, he was handed his first loss in months, and more difficult decisions from the justices appear on the horizon.

Since the Trump administration took office in January, it has petitioned the Supreme Court's emergency docket more than two dozen times and has been overwhelmingly successful. The administration had a winning streak on the emergency docket dating back to May, but that streak was broken Friday in an immigration judge free speech case, and 2026 could offer more losses at the high court for Trump, as the justices issue opinions on some of his major policies.

The Trump administration asked the high court to halt the proceedings of a case in federal court challenging a policy requiring immigration judges to receive permission when giving speeches pertaining to their duties. The administration claims a federal appeals court erred by allowing the case to proceed for additional fact-finding in federal court, rather than deferring to the Merit Systems Protection Board, which deals with disputes brought by federal employees.

Chief Justice John Roberts granted an administrative stay on Dec. 5, but the full court later lifted the administrative stay and declined to give the administration its requested pause of proceedings. The unsigned order said the administration's request came too early in the process and invited it to refile its petition after the case is more developed.

“At this stage, the Government has not demonstrated that it will suffer irreparable harm without a stay. This denial is without prejudice to a reapplication if the District Court commences discovery proceedings before the disposition of the Government's forthcoming petition for a writ of certiorari,” the Friday order said.

While not a complete loss for the administration, the ruling marked the first time since various immigration related petitions earlier this year that the president has been on the losing side of an emergency docket order. 

Prior to Friday, the most recent loss for the administration on the emergency docket was in May when the high court halted deportations under the Alien Enemies Act in Texas. The May order had followed some similar previous orders on deportations and immigration matters, which the Trump administration had been on the losing side of on the emergency docket.

While the Trump administration racked up its first loss on the emergency docket in months, it has been awaiting a ruling on whether it can deploy troops to Chicago since October. Solicitor General D. John Sauer filed the petition to the court's emergency docket 66 days ago, longer than the typical six to eight weeks the Supreme Court has taken to respond to Trump petitions this year.

The legal battles over the administration's use of the National Guard in major cities, where immigration enforcement has been met with unruly protests, have spanned multiple federal courts, but the Chicago case marks the first time the Supreme Court has been asked to weigh in. The deployments in Chicago, Portland, and Los Angeles include federalizing state National Guard troops to defend federal assets and officials, according to the administration.

Trump's attempt to deploy troops to Chicago was halted by a federal district court, an order which was upheld by a federal appeals court, leading to an emergency petition at the Supreme Court. Sauer urged the justices to lift the court-imposed stay of the deployment, arguing it “improperly impinges on the President's authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property.”

“This case presents what has become a disturbing and recurring pattern: Federal officers are attempting to enforce federal immigration law in an urban area containing significant numbers of illegal aliens,” Sauer wrote in his Oct. 17 petition to the Supreme Court. 

“The federal agents' efforts are met with prolonged, coordinated, violent resistance that threatens their lives and safety and systematically interferes with their ability to enforce federal law,” the petition continued.

After initial briefs were filed by the Justice Department and Illinois officials, the high court requested additional briefs asking whether “regular forces” in the law Trump invoked to deploy the National Guard include the military. The federal statute, 10 U. S. C. §12406, outlines when a president may federalize and deploy the National Guard, including in instances when “the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”

The Trump administration argued the military is not included in the “regular forces” mentioned in the federal law outlining when the president can deploy the National Guard, while Illinois officials argued it does include the military.

The Trump administration has faced a mixed bag of rulings in different National Guard cases across different federal courts, with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit being the only lone court to allow a deployment — in Los Angeles — to continue in the interim.

There is no set timeline for the Supreme Court to issue orders regarding emergency petitions, meaning an order on the petition could come at any time.

While the emergency docket has offered up several wins for Trump early in his second term, the Supreme Court's merits docket appears poised to offer some high-profile losses in 2026.

The administration is currently awaiting decisions on the president's sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs and on whether the president can fire independent agency heads without cause, after oral arguments in both cases were held in late 2025. In the first several months of 2026, the high court will hear arguments over whether Trump's birthright citizenship order is constitutional and an emergency docket case over whether to allow the firing of Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, which Trump claims he properly did for cause.

During arguments in the tariffs case, the justices appeared skeptical of the administration's arguments that the president had the power to issue sweeping tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The justices did appear likely to side with the administration on the president's view of firing independent agency heads, after previously siding with Trump multiple times on the emergency docket on the matter.

SUPREME COURT GRAPPLES WITH HOW MUCH EXECUTIVE POWER INDEPENDENT AGENCIES REALLY EXERT

The birthright citizenship case is expected to be an uphill battle for the Trump administration, after the executive order was struck down by various courts as unconstitutional.

After a busy year at the Supreme Court in 2025, the Trump administration is hoping to continue its overwhelmingly positive record among the justices into 2026, despite the end of the winning streak in the closing months of the year.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump dodged committing to the release of the complete Jeffrey Epstein files, but expressed sympathy on Monday for people identified in photographs with the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender in document tranches released from Epstein's estate.

The Trump administration failed to meet a legislative deadline on Friday to release the government's Epstein file in its entirety. The Department of Justice published hundreds of thousands of redacted documents, photographs, and videos on Friday afternoon, but has not specified when the entire file will be made available to the public.

Photographs of several prominent Americans, including former President Bill Clinton and Trump himself, socializing with Epstein were included in a tranche of documents released on Friday. The president fielded questions on the topic Monday afternoon at Mar-a-Lago, suggesting it was a “terrible look” for Clinton, despite no evidence of wrongdoing.

“I've always gotten along with Bill Clinton. I've been nice to him. He's been nice to me. We've always gotten along. I respect him. I hate to see photos come out of him, but this is what the Democrats, mostly Democrats, and a couple of bad Republicans, are asking for,” the president stated. “I don't like the pictures of Bill Clinton being shown. I don't like the pictures of other people being shown. I think it's a terrible thing. I think Bill Clinton's a big boy. He can handle it.”

“But you probably have pictures being exposed of other people that innocently met Jeffrey Epstein years ago, many years ago, and they're highly respected bankers and lawyers and others,” he continued, suggesting that Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), whom he called a “real lowlife,” would ruin those people's lives through their continued pursuit of the entire Epstein file.

“Massie is a loser, and he works with the Democrats. He's just being used by the Democrats,” the president added. “This whole thing with Epstein is a way of trying to deflect from the tremendous success that the Republican Party has.”

Trump closed his response by claiming that “people are very angry that pictures are being released of other people that really had nothing to do with Epstein, but they're in a picture.”

“In a picture with him because he was at a party and you ruined the reputation of somebody,” he stated. “So a lot of people are very angry that this continues.”

The average availability rate of F-35s throughout fiscal year 2024 was just 50% partly because the Pentagon “did not consistently hold Lockheed Martin accountable for poor performance related to F-35 sustainment,” according to a report from the Defense Department's Office of the Inspector General.

When Chelsea Hirschhorn started her company, she didn't buy into the expectations of how a ""traditional founder"" would approach the business, she says. 

According to Hirschhorn, the founder and CEO of Frida, a fertility, pregnancy and infant product company, ""a lot of founders are celebrated for going fast and breaking things."" 

However, her approach to building Frida was ""a little bit more measured,"" she told CNBC's Julia Boorstin on the latest episode of the ""CNBC Changemakers and Power Players"" podcast.

Her penchant for ""organization and thoughtfulness"" doesn't hold her back, said Hirschhorn, a 2025 CNBC Changemaker. In fact, she considers it her superpower as a leader.

Still, before launching Frida, Hirschhorn had to learn how to get comfortable with taking on new challenges.

""From a career perspective, I'm very ambitious,"" she said, but prior to starting her company, she described herself as ""pretty risk-averse.""

Hirschhorn worked as a bankruptcy attorney before she launched Frida. After a neighbor gifted her a NoseFrida, a Swedish nasal aspirator designed for babies, Hirschhorn saw potential in the product and decided to buy the neighbor's business selling the devices.

In 2014, Hirschhorn launched Frida with the NoseFrida as its flagship product.

It was a difficult decision for Hirschhorn to leave her previous career, she said, and she ""needed a lot of encouragement"" from her husband, who now serves as the president of Frida, to take the leap. 

True to form, Hirschhorn took a careful approach to scaling her business, and she decided from the beginning not to raise venture capital funding to build Frida.  

Rapid growth was ""never our objective,"" she said.

""I approached the business building with a level of practicality and a measured pace, I think, that is not necessarily a reflection of a traditional founder,"" she said.

That approach, along with a level of ""comfort with bucking the trend,"" have been consistent threads in her story as a founder, Hirschhorn said – and it helped her build a ""winning strategy"" for the company.

Hirschhorn described her current leadership style as ""empathic, transparent"" and ""informed by the stage of life that I'm in,"" she told Boorstin.

When Hirschhorn first launched Frida, she was ""singularly focused on building the actual foundation for the business"" and prioritized ""achieving certain milestones"" in Frida's growth trajectory, she said.

She led ""with the expectation that other people sort of follow my lead as far as the rigor and the work ethic and the commitment,"" she said.

Since then, her leadership philosophy has ""evolved meaningfully,"" she told Boorstin. 

Today, she prioritizes empathy and strives to be ""comprehensive in my understanding of different people's motivations.""

Her leadership style has also been informed by her experiences as a working mother, she said.

Hirschhorn is aware of ""the dynamics that mothers face and the trade off and sacrifice of personal and professional ambitions and time management,"" so she offers perks like weekly manicures and haircuts for her team. 

From the outside, those perks may not seem ""that significant or meaningful,"" she said, but they represent her commitment to prioritizing well-being.

Bitcoin's recent price action has started to wear on people. After a strong start to the year and a run that pushed above $100,000 and briefly touched $125,000, the market has drifted into something closer to a low-volatility grind. On the 1000x podcast, ProCap's Jeff Park argued that this shift in “market structure” is not a minor detail. In his view, it is the central reason Bitcoin has struggled to reassert momentum, even as gold and other commodities have pushed to fresh highs.

Bitcoin Needs Volatility

Park's thesis is straightforward: Bitcoin's upside story historically leans on volatility. If volatility compresses and stays compressed, Bitcoin loses one of the features that has consistently attracted marginal risk capital, especially the kind of capital that shows up early, pushes price, and then pulls in the next cohort behind it.

“There's two things we need to hit on,” Park said. “One is the belief in the projection that I have for Bitcoin to reach meaningfully new highs that we need implied volatility and realized volatility to rise concurrently. And then the second is to your question, why is that not happening today?”

He framed Bitcoin less as an isolated “crypto asset” and more as one instrument in a much wider relative-value universe. In that universe, Bitcoin competes for allocation with equities, rates, FX, and commodities, not just other tokens. And the attribute that made Bitcoin distinct for many allocators was its capacity for asymmetric outcomes, which volatility helps express.

“Bitcoin is not in a microcosm of its own, right?” Park said. “You're competing with Mag 7, you're competing with gold, you're competing with FX, you're competing with JGBs, and it's a huge world out there. And the feature that I think Bitcoin has always been exciting for a lot of folks is to capitalize upon asymmetric outcomes in which the volatility is one of the unique features that makes it worthwhile for the risk-taking endeavor.”

Bitcoin Needs ‘Real' Buyers

That sets up the uncomfortable comparison the hosts kept circling: gold making new highs while Bitcoin lags. Park didn't try to wave it away. He called it a moment for Bitcoin holders to be realistic about adoption and about where the truly structural bids are right now.

“The reality is gold is going up because there's real buyers, right?” he said. “There's real buyers stepping in as there has been for the past year and a half. And those structural bids continue to exist because it has found a product market fit within our global monetary framework as a reserve asset.”

Park argued Bitcoin is not there yet. Yes, there are recurring headlines about sovereign interest, and he referenced the Czech Republic's central bank as an example of a country testing Bitcoin exposure. But he emphasized that the dominant flows in 2025 have been ETFs and corporates, not governments and not central banks.

“Make no mistake, it's not governments and it's not central banks,” he said. “Most of the flows today have come from ETFs and corporates. ETFs are coming because there's private wealth investment advisors that want exposure to an asset class… Corporates have a very different intention of what they're trying to accomplish.”

In Park's telling, that distinction matters because it changes the market's tone. ETF buyers are often seeking portfolio construction benefits, decorrelation, optionality, a non-consensus sleeve, rather than the kind of high-conviction, narrative-driven bid that historically made Bitcoin feel like the market's main event. Retail Adoption Must Return 

Park then extended the argument into a broader cultural point about who actually pushes new adoption. He described Bitcoin as a generational project and warned that institutionalization only works if it remains anchored to retail participation rather than replacing it.

“At the core of it is because Bitcoin is a movement of young people's hearts,” Park said. “If young people stop participating, I think the fact that the institutionalization of Wall Street is happening on the back of their investments is also going to come to a halt… If you want Bitcoin to continue to perform, you want to appeal to young participants.”

He also pointed to a separate drag: Bitcoin's risk conversation has become noisier. Park cited renewed “quantum anxiety” and internal disputes around various Bitcoin Improvement Proposals, arguing that even low-probability existential risks need to be compensated and low volatility does not offer that compensation.

“Gold doesn't have that,” he said, contrasting Bitcoin's ongoing protocol and existential debates with gold's comparatively settled narrative. “You have to be compensated for it… and you are certainly not going to be compensated for quantum risk with Bitcoin vol at 25.”

Even so, Park did not present the long-term case as broken. If anything, he argued Bitcoin's advantage becomes more obvious when you focus on practical ownership rather than financialized wrappers. He described physical gold as operationally difficult – opaque pricing, logistical friction, authenticity concerns — and said Bitcoin still offers something closer to a single global clearing price and simpler portability.

“Anyone who's ever tried to buy physical gold knows how annoying that process is,” he said. “The pricing is intransparent. The logistics is unclear and ultimately authenticity too… Bitcoin still has what I call a singularly clearing price for trading.”

Why Isn't Bitcoin Going Up? | Jeff Park https://t.co/CxtFhRKcIZ

At the end, Park said the main question going forward is whether Bitcoin can regain the conditions that historically pulled new participants into the trade and whether the market is willing to pay for the risk it keeps insisting Bitcoin represents.

At press time, Bitcoin traded at $87,779.

By late 2025, Ethereum was processing more than $5 trillion in quarterly transaction volume, a figure comparable in scale to traditional payment processors. Major institutions are now migrating value onto this digital rail, often without ever mentioning the word “cryptocurrency,” turning Ethereum into an increasingly used settlement layer in specific institutional contexts.

This article examines how the world's leading financial institutions are quietly adopting Ethereum's decentralized infrastructure.

Ethereum as financial plumbing, not a crypto asset

To the average observer, Ethereum is a “coin” to be traded. To Wall Street, however, it has become something far more practical: high-tech financial plumbing. In August 2025, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck labeled Ethereum the “Wall Street token,” highlighting that the network's underlying architecture, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), is becoming a global standard for bank-to-bank settlement.

Unlike legacy systems that require manual reconciliation, Ethereum functions as a “single source of truth,” where transactions are verified by a global network of nodes rather than a central clearinghouse.

Instead of relying on routes that can take days to clear trades, institutions are using Ethereum's smart contracts to automate much of the manual work handled by middle-office operations.

This shift enables T+0 settlement, meaning transactions clear instantly. Previously, a trade would settle on a T+2 basis, as banks exchanged messages to verify funds and positions. On Ethereum, the asset transfer and the payment occur at the same moment.

In this context, Ethereum functions as foundational infrastructure that allows the traditional financial system to operate faster, at a lower cost and with fewer errors. Because Ethereum is value-agnostic, it serves as a neutral platform where financial agreements can be codified and executed without human intervention. 

Stablecoins and tokenization as the entry point

Wall Street's adoption of Ethereum's infrastructure is also visible in the rapid growth of “tokenized dollars.” Following the passage of the GENIUS Act in July 2025, a landmark piece of US legislation that established a clear framework for stablecoins, the total market capitalization of these assets climbed to $300 billion. For banks, stablecoins on Ethereum represent digital versions of the US dollar that can move around the clock, avoiding the settlement risk associated with traditional banking hours and weekend closures.

Traditional payment giants such as Visa and Mastercard have integrated stablecoin settlement APIs to support global payments on the network. These firms are not interacting with the speculative side of crypto. Instead, they are using Ethereum-based stablecoins to settle transactions between merchants and banks in near real time.

As banks adapt to client demand for faster cross-border transfers, the Ethereum network provides the secure infrastructure needed to move these regulated digital dollars.

Did you know? The GENIUS Act, signed into law on July 18, 2025, became the first federal framework to formally authorize US banks to issue stablecoins through subsidiaries. This shift repositioned Ethereum from a regulatory gray area into a legally compliant infrastructure layer for the US dollar.

Tokenized funds and real-world assets

The evolution of Ethereum has moved beyond payments into the tokenization of more complex investment vehicles. In December 2025, JPMorgan made headlines by launching its first money market fund on the public Ethereum blockchain. Trading under the ticker MONY, the fund allows qualified investors to access yields from traditional US Treasury securities, using Ethereum as the distribution layer.

By placing a fund like MONY on the Ethereum blockchain, JPMorgan enabled peer-to-peer transferability and daily dividend reinvestment that were previously difficult to achieve. Investors can subscribe or redeem using cash or stablecoins through institutional platforms. In this structure, Ethereum is not the investment itself. It functions as the digital wrapper that increases liquidity and operational efficiency.

This development marks a turning point in which Ethereum's smart contracts handle much of the operational burden of fund administration, significantly reducing overhead costs. By automating yield distribution through code, Ethereum allows these funds to operate with a level of precision and transparency that legacy databases cannot easily replicate.

The strategic silence: Why Wall Street is not naming Ethereum

If you examine the marketing materials of top-tier banks, you will see terms such as “onchain liquidity,” “distributed ledgers” or “programmable payments,” yet the underlying technology is almost always Ethereum. This “invisible” adoption helps explain why Ethereum is frequently chosen by Wall Street institutions.

A key technical driver is the network effect. Much like the internet relies on standardized protocols, the financial system is converging around Ethereum's programming standards. By late 2025, multiple reports suggested that tokenized dollars on the network were quietly reshaping how money moves between major clearinghouses.

As more assets such as treasuries, bonds and real estate are tokenized on Ethereum, the network's utility becomes increasingly evident in institutional use cases. Since its launch in 2024, BlackRock's BUIDL fund has become the world's largest tokenized money market fund, deploying more than $1 billion directly on the Ethereum blockchain to enable near real-time dividend distribution.

Similarly, in late 2025, JPMorgan rebranded its blockchain division as Kinexys, facilitating more than $2 billion in average daily transaction volume through Ethereum-compatible rails.

By relying on Ethereum's “credible neutrality,” these firms avoid the constraints of proprietary private blockchains that lack global interoperability. Instead, they treat Ethereum as a neutral and largely invisible settlement layer. As a result, the network has begun to function as a standardized operating system for global capital, regardless of whether the brand is explicitly acknowledged in boardrooms.

December 23, 2025



Eric Adams, who will be New York's mayor for eight more days, on Friday unveiled the city's new “blockchain plan,” a 61-page document intended to guide agencies as they investigate new uses of the distributed-ledger technology best known for undergirding cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.

The plan is designed to aid agencies as they “investigate potential opportunities and risks, build public literacy on emerging technologies, and establish mechanisms to track progress and coordinate citywide efforts,” according to a letter attached to the plan signed by city Chief Technology Officer Matthew Fraser. Purportedly developed over the last 18 months, the new plan is a continuation of Adams' many years of policies, and stunts, aimed at stimulating the blockchain and cryptocurrency industries.

According to a press release, the plan also expands on an executive order Adams signed last October establishing an Office of Digital Assets and Blockchain Technology. The office is led by Moises Rendon, who for more than a year-and-a-half had served as a digital assets and blockchain policy adviser in the city's Office of Technology and Innovation. (After repeated calls and emails over the last two months, the city's technology office has not cleared Rendon for an interview, nor answered questions about the new blockchain office's operations. When contacted for this article, a spokesperson from the technology office provided an excerpt from Fraser's letter.)

The city's plan notes that blockchain is a “fast-growing technology attracting intense global interest and development,” and points to the technology's marriage with bitcoin and a recent rise in the number of new “digital assets.” The plan frames blockchain as an “emerging technology” that must be studied before the city can “chart a responsible path forward.” (A contact for Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani didn't immediately respond to an email asking whether the blockchain plan will continue under his administration.)

The plan outlines several new initiatives, including a pilot project led by the city's Department of Environmental Protection that explores using blockchain to verify asbestos certification. No further details on the pilot are provided, except that the IT office will also “engage other interested agencies on potential applications such as digital credentials, permits and licenses, or broader data management efforts.”

There are plans for an interagency working group, a new “information hub” to advance public information and consumer safety, and technical guidance for agencies, centered on issues of “equity, privacy and data security, access, public benefit.” Not addressed in the plan is why the nation's largest city is expending resources on a technology widely considered, outside of the crypto industry, to be of little utility.

More than four years ago, this publication published an article noting the rapid decline of blockchain, a technology buoyed by the success of cryptocurrency, but that never found widespread use in state or local government offices. This was despite many pilot projects around the country and repeated attempts by industry to breach the sector.

“Outside of crypto, tell me a use of it,” Ed Toner, Nebraska's former chief information officer, said in 2021. “Tell me a widespread value-add that blockchain has ever delivered, ever. I challenge everybody.”

Many things have changed in the public sector over the last four years, but blockchain's status isn't among them. The technology's primary role, as the technological backbone of the crypto industry, is occasionally punctuated by attempts to use it for other things before it once again fades from view.

Blockchain occasionally crops up in association with digital identity software being considered by state agencies, or is proposed as a way to register historic locations. The California Department of Motor Vehicles last year used blockchain to record 42 million vehicle titles, in hopes of reducing fraud and providing owners more autonomy when selling their vehicles.

In 2023, the Rhode Island Department of Commerce, led by Secretary Elizabeth Tanner, experimented with using blockchain to replace an outdated paper process for applying for business licenses. The department, which is no longer led by Tanner, did not respond to an email asking for an update on the success of that project.

Early iterations of mobile voting software used blockchain, only to be handily dismantled by security researchers. Joe Kiniry, a cryptographer who designed the technology behind the Mobile Voting Project, a new effort led by the political-strategist-turned-venture-capitalist Bradley Tusk, recently dismissed blockchain as “nonsense.”

Blockchain has been tried for many other uses, such as recording land deeds or streamlining disaster-response processes in the federal government, though the value added by blockchain has never been obvious. In 2022, more than 1,500 software engineers and other technologists signed a letter letting Congress know they'd had enough of blockchain technologies, which “facilitate few, if any, real-economy uses.”

“We dispute the claims made in recent years about the novelty and potential of blockchain technology,” the letter read. “Blockchain technology cannot, and will not, have transaction reversal or data privacy mechanisms because they are antithetical to its base design. Financial

technologies that serve the public must always have mechanisms for fraud mitigation and allow a human-in-the-loop to reverse transactions; blockchain permits neither.”

Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University in Washington, D.C., said blockchain is a performative gimmick that won't seem to go away, despite the clear message sent by the technology's many detractors.

“People in the industry frankly had had enough of people saying, well, the blockchain can fix it,” Allen said of the 2022 industry letter. “And they're like, no, blockchains suck.”

Blockchain's conceit is largely the same as the cryptocurrencies that it enables: Centralized power, like that of banks, has led to levels of corruption, unfairness and institutional lethargy that do not serve the interests of the masses — but decentralized and transparent technologies can usher in a new paradigm in which people are empowered to transact on their own terms. But, Allen pointed out, blockchain has accomplished little in the crypto industry but to shift a modicum of power away from banks and into the hands of the people who run the crypto companies, many of whom are bankers and wealthy entrepreneurs.

“There are always concentrations of power,” Allen said. “You're always trusting somebody. So why use this inefficient, clunky database when it doesn't get rid of the intermediaries, it doesn't get rid of the concentrations of power? So then, just use the simple database that's quick and efficient.”","{'href': 'https://statescoop.com', 'title': 'StateScoop'}","cryptocurrency"

Kolkata: The All India Fair Price Shop Dealers' Federation (AIFPSDF) has threatened to launch a nationwide movement amid concerns that the Centre may introduce the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), or e-rupee, enabling beneficiaries to redeem entitlements at fair price shops through a cashless, Aadhaar-authenticated system.

The Government of Gujarat has recently sent a concept note to the Government of India through its Secretary of the Department of Food & Public Distribution on issuance of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) / e-Rupee for public distribution system in Gujarat, which will enable the beneficiaries with a cashless, Aadhaar-authenticated redemption at ration shops.

As proposed, the CBDC will be issued in the form of Digital Food Coupons. There will be a total of 7 such coupons for a beneficiary every month- two for central commodities and five for state  commodities. The five coupons for state commodities meant for supply of Tur Dal, edible oil, salt and sugar at subsidised prices from state exchequer of the Gujarat government.

“The  implementation of this project is a method to implement Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)  will  lead to the abolishment of ration dealers and so we will oppose this DBT and coupon system tooth and nail, “ said Biswambhar Basu, national general secretary of AIFPSDF.

The Federation will wait till the Budget Session of  the Parliament next year and if the scheme is implemented a nationwide movement will be launched. The  Federation will  also file a special leave petition (SLP) at the apex court in this matter, anticipating that the concept note will be implemented by the centre.

Business Insider Edition 

#FeaturedPost


        Crypto adoption has moved beyond curiosity across Africa. Payments, remittances, savings, and online services now rely on blockchain tools in everyday settings. Inflation pressure, currency controls, and a mobile-first population have started pushing practical use cases into the open. Governments and regulators are also taking clearer positions, and this is influencing how companies operate and scale. Some countries now stand out for infrastructure, policy clarity, and user participation. These markets offer a useful snapshot of where crypto activity is gaining durable traction across the continent.
    


        Nigeria remains Africa's most active crypto market by volume and participation. Peer-to-peer trading is deeply integrated, driven by currency volatility and a demand for faster payments across borders. A good deal of Nigerians use stablecoins for commerce, freelance income, and international transfers. Local developers also play a role, building wallets and blockchain analytics tools.
    


        Crypto's reach in Nigeria extends into digital leisure as well. Crypto-enabled entertainment platforms show how tokens are used outside traditional finance, with users prioritising practical benefits such as faster deposits, quicker withdrawals that do not rely on bank processing times, and transaction records that can be verified on-chain. A Bitcoin casino list typically highlights these payment patterns across platforms, reinforcing why Nigerian users often associate crypto with speed, accessibility, and fewer intermediaries. In that sense, leisure use cases sit alongside remittances and everyday payments rather than outside them.
    


        Despite regulatory caution, activity has continued through licensed fintechs and peer networks. The Central Bank's earlier restrictions did not halt adoption. Instead, they pushed users toward decentralized tools and regulated payment providers willing to work within new rules.
    


        South Africa offers one of the clearest legal frameworks for crypto on the continent. Authorities classify crypto assets as financial products, bringing exchanges and service providers under oversight. This clarity has aided in attracting institutional interest and has also encouraged compliance-driven growth.
    


        Major exchanges operate openly, offering rand on-ramps, custody services, and tax reporting tools. Banks have also taken a more cooperative stance than in many neighboring countries. This has reduced friction for both retail users and professional traders.
    


        The country also benefits from a mature financial sector and strong technical talent. Blockchain startups tend to aim for enterprise adoption rather than informal peer-to-peer trade, which sets South Africa apart from other high-volume markets.
    


        Kenya's long history with mobile money has shaped its crypto usage. Users are comfortable with digital wallets and instant transfers. Crypto tools often plug into this mindset rather than replace it.
    


        Stablecoins are very often used for cross-border commerce and freelance payments. Many developers in Nairobi's tech hubs experiment with blockchain for micro-payments, digital identity, and carbon credit tracking. These applications align with existing mobile habits, so the learning curve is lowered.
    


        Regulation is cautious, but it is not hostile. Authorities have begun focusing on consumer warnings rather than on outright bans. This approach has allowed for innovation to continue while policymakers proceed to study the long-term implications.
    


        Ghana's crypto market is a lot smaller than Nigeria's, but it still shows steady participation. Urban professionals and entrepreneurs often use crypto for savings diversification and international transfers. This interest also extends into blockchain education and community meetups.
    


        The Bank of Ghana has explored digital currency pilots, thus signaling openness to new payment systems. While crypto regulation is still evolving, it is the absence of aggressive enforcement that has allowed platforms to operate with a relative level of stability.
    


        Ghana's strength lies in gradual trust-building. Adoption grows through education, fintech partnerships, and regional trade use cases, not rapid speculation.
    


        Egypt presents a different picture. Demand for crypto is strong, fueled by inflation concerns and restrictions on foreign currency access. At the same time, regulation remains strict, and official approval is limited.
    


        This tension has not erased usage. Peer-to-peer trading and offshore platforms are still common. Developers focus on privacy-focused tools and decentralized finance applications that operate without local custodians.
    


        Egypt's large population and technical talent pool suggest long-term potential, even if short-term growth faces constraints. Much depends on whether policymakers soften their stance or introduce clearer licensing pathways.
    


        Morocco's crypto activity has grown quietly. Official policy remains restrictive, yet enforcement has been inconsistent. This has created space for informal adoption, particularly among younger professionals and digital workers.
    


        Blockchain skills are in demand, especially in software outsourcing and Web3 development. Many Moroccan developers work for international crypto firms, contributing expertise even if local markets face limits.
    


        Remittances also play a role. Crypto offers an alternative route for cross-border transfers, especially when traditional channels are slow or expensive.
    


        Tunisia's crypto story centers around technical talent. The country produces skilled engineers who contribute to both open-source blockchain projects and international startups. Local trading volumes are modest, although development activity is still worth noting.
    


        Early experiments with digital currencies and blockchain education programs have created keen awareness. While regulation is currently cautious, the focus on skills and exports is what is giving Tunisia a different kind of relevance within the crypto economy of Africa.
    


        There are several shared factors that explain why certain African nations show stronger crypto prospects. In many cases, the traditional banking systems in place introduce friction that slows payments and limits access. This makes crypto a practical alternative and not a speculative one. Currency volatility also plays a role, because it pushes individuals and businesses to look for ways to store value or transact without constant exposure to fluctuations in the local economy.
    


        Mobile-first habits matter just as much. In countries where digital wallets and app-based payments are already normal, crypto tools are feeling like a natural extension and not a radical shift. Strong developer talent is what further reinforces this momentum. This is particularly the case when local engineers are connected to global crypto firms and open-source projects. Finally, legal signals, whether they are formal frameworks or simply the space to experiment, are helping to determine how confidently platforms and users can and do engage with the technology.

Amplify ETFs, a fund provider with over $16 billion in assets under management, has brought to market two new ETFs that give investors targeted exposure to companies and cryptocurrencies behind stablecoins and tokenized assets.

The Amplify Stablecoin Technology ETF (STBQ) offers exposure to payments companies, crypto infrastructure providers and platforms facilitating stablecoin-based trading.

It tracks the MarketVector Stablecoin Technology Index, which includes equities and crypto assets such as DeFi protocols and stablecoin-adjacent tokens. Amplify's website shows the fund currently has 24 holdings, the largest of which are spot crypto ETFs offering exposure to XRP, SOL, ETH, and LINK.

The Amplify Tokenization Technology ETF (TKNQ) focuses on businesses enabling the digitization of real-world assets and tracks the MarketVector Tokenization Technology Index.

TKNQ currently has 53 holdings, the largest of which are the same ETFs that offer exposure to spot cryptocurrency prices, along with several equities.

Both funds carry a 69 basis point total expense ratio and are now trading on NYSE Arca.

The timing of the offerings coincides with regulatory shifts. The U.S. GENIUS Act, signed in July, created a federal framework for stablecoins and also paved the way for institutions to settle tokenized assets using stablecoins by clarifying compliance and audit requirements.

What if it could solve all of our energy problems?

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Nestled between Hawaii and the western coast of Mexico lies the Pacific Ocean's Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), a 4.5 million-kilometer-square area of abyssal plain bordered by the Clarion and Clipperton Fracture Zones. Although this stretch of sea is a vibrant ecosystem filled with marine life, the CCZ is known best for its immense collection of potato-sized rocks known as polymetallic nodules. 

These rocks, of which there are potentially trillions, are filled with rich deposits of nickel, manganese, copper, zinc, cobalt. Those particular metals are vital for the batteries needed to power a green energy future, leading some mining companies to refer to nodules as a “battery in a rock.”

However, a study reports that these nodules might be much more than simply a collection of valuable materials for electric cars—they also produce oxygen 4,000 meters below the surface where sunlight can't reach. 

This unexpected source of “dark oxygen,” as it's called, redefines the role these nodules play in the CZZ. The rocks could also rewrite the script on not only how life began on this planet, but also its potential to take hold on other worlds within our Solar System, such as Enceladus or Europa. The results of this study were published in the journal Nature Geoscience. 

“For aerobic life to begin on the planet,” Andrew Sweetman, deep-sea ecologist with the Scottish Association for Marine Science and lead author of the study said in a press statement, “there had to be oxygen and our understanding has been that Earth's oxygen supply began with photosynthetic organisms. But we now know that there is oxygen produced in the deep sea, where there is no light. I think we therefore need to revisit questions like: where could aerobic life have begun?”

The journey toward this discovery began more than a decade ago when Sweetman began analyzing how oxygen levels decreased further into the depths of the ocean. So it came as a surprise in 2013 when sensors returned increased levels of oxygen in the CCZ. At the time, Sweetman dismissed the data as the result of faulty sensors, but future studies showed that this abyssal plain somehow produced oxygen. Taking note of the nodule's “battery in a rock” tagline, Sweetman wondered if the minerals found in these nodules were somehow acting as a kind of “geobattery” by separating hydrogen and oxygen via seawater electrolysis. 

A 2023 study showed that various bacteria and archaea can create “dark oxygen,” so Sweetman and his team recreated the conditions of the CCZ in a laboratory and killed off any microorganisms with mercury chloride—surprisingly, oxygen levels continued rising. According to Scientific American, Sweetman found a voltage of roughly 0.95 volts on the surface of these nodules, likely charging up as they grow with different deposits growing irregularly throughout, and this natural charge is enough to split the seawater. 

This discovery adds more fuel to the already-fiery debate over what to do with these nodules. Mining outfits like the Metals Company, the CEO of which coined the phrase “battery in a rock,” sees these nodules as the answer to our energy problems. However, 25 countries want the governing body—the International Seabed Authority (ISA) Council—to implement a moratorium, or at the very least a precautionary pause, so more research can be conducted to see how mining these nodules could affect the ocean. This is especially vital considering that the world's seas are already facing a litany of climate challenges, including acidification, deoxygenation, and pollution. 

In response to this discovery, Scripps Institution of Oceanography's Lisa Levin, who wasn't involved with the study, highlighted why such a moratorium is so important for protecting these deep-sea nodules in a comment to the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition: 

The ISA is still negotiating with key players on deep-sea mining regulations. 

So while the future of the world's oceans is approaching a critical moment of conservation or exploitation, science has proven once again that disrupting these ecosystems could have consequences we can't even imagine.

Wastewater from washing machines is widely seen as a major source of microplastics -- tiny plastic particles suspected of harming both people and animals. To help reduce that pollution, researchers at the University of Bonn have created a new filter based on a natural model: the gill arch system in fish. In early tests, the patent-pending device removed more than 99 percent of plastic fibers from washing machine wastewater. The findings were published in the journal npj Emerging Contaminants.

A washing machine used by a four-person household can generate up to 500 grams of microplastics each year, largely due to fibers wearing off textiles during washing. That makes everyday laundry one of the most important sources of these particles. Today, much of that material ends up in the sewage sludge produced at wastewater treatment plants. Because this sludge is often applied as fertilizer, the fibers can ultimately be spread onto fields.

Why existing washing machine filters fall short

Because of the scale of the problem, many manufacturers have been looking for ways to remove microplastics from wash water before it reaches the environment. ""The filter systems available so far, however, have various disadvantages,"" explains Dr. Leandra Hamann from the Institute for Organismic Biology at the University of Bonn. ""Some of them quickly become clogged, others do not offer adequate filtration.""

Hamann, working with her doctoral supervisor Dr. Alexander Blanke and other colleagues, turned to biology for ideas. The team focused on fish that act as expert natural filters -- the result of hundreds of millions of years of evolution.

Some fish feed by filtering water, including mackerel, sardines, and anchovies. They swim with open mouths and capture plankton using their gill arch system. ""We took a closer look at the construction of this system and used it as the model for developing a filter that can be used in washing machines,"" says Blanke, who is a member of the transdisciplinary research areas ""Life & Health"" and ""Sustainable Futures"" at the University of Bonn.

How fish gills inspired a self-cleaning filter design

Over time, these fish evolved a strategy similar to cross-flow filtration. Their gill arch system forms a funnel that is widest at the mouth and narrows toward the gullet. The funnel's walls are formed by branchial arches, which include comb-like structures. Those structures are covered in tiny teeth, creating a mesh stretched across the arches.

""During food intake, the water flows through the permeable funnel wall, is filtered, and the particle-free water is then released back into the environment via the gills,"" explains Blanke. ""However, the plankton is too big for this; it is held back by the natural sieve structure. Thanks to the funnel shape, it then rolls towards the gullet, where it is collected until the fish swallows, which empties and cleans the system.""

That same idea helps prevent clogs. Instead of slamming directly into a flat barrier, particles move along the surface and are guided onward toward the gullet. The approach is also highly efficient, since it removes almost all plankton from the water. A washing machine microplastic filter needs both strengths: strong capture and resistance to blockage. To build a version for laundry, the researchers recreated the gill arch system and tested different mesh sizes and funnel opening angles.

Test results, manufacturing costs, and microplastic removal

""We have thus found a combination of parameters that enable our filter to separate more than 99 percent of the microplastics out of the water but not become blocked,"" says Hamann. The team reached that result by combining lab experiments with computer simulations. Because the nature-based design avoids complicated moving parts, it should be inexpensive to produce.

Captured microplastics collect at the filter outlet and are suctioned away several times per minute. Hamann, who has since moved to the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, says the collected material could be pressed inside the machine to squeeze out remaining water. The resulting plastic pellet could then be removed every few dozen washes and thrown away with general waste.

Patents, industry hopes, and health concerns

The University of Bonn team and the Fraunhofer Institute for Environmental, Safety, and Energy Technology UMSICHT have already applied for a patent in Germany, and EU-wide patenting is now in progress. The researchers hope manufacturers will refine the design and build it into future washing machines. That could reduce the spread of textile-based microplastics, at least to some extent. The need is pressing: analyses suggest these particles may cause serious health harm. They have already been detected in breast milk and in the placenta -- and even in the brain.

Participating institutions and funding

In addition to the University of Bonn, the Fraunhofer Institute for Environmental, Safety, and Energy Technology UMSICHT contributed to the study. Funding came from the Federal Ministry of Research, Technology and Space (BMFTR) and the European Research Council (ERC). Support for protecting and marketing the invention is being provided by the Transfer Center enaCom at the University of Bonn in close cooperation with PROvendis GmbH, a service provider for the NRW university network for knowledge and technology transfer ""innovation2business.nrw.""

Parcellation of the cerebral cortex into functionally modular brain areas is foundational to cognitive and systems neuroscience. Here, we question the central status of brain areas from the perspectives of neuroanatomy and electrophysiology. We argue that the major ostensible determinants of brain function, such as cytoarchitecture and connectivity, seldom produce convergent parcellations. Brain areas themselves are just one of several equally important organizing principles; others include macroscale gradients, distributed networks, layers, columns and patches. We further argue that the evidence for a close correspondence between areal parcellation and cognitive function is weaker than is generally supposed. Indeed, many important cognitive functions appear to be implemented in a broadly distributed manner, whereas others appear to obey organizations that have little relationship to brain areas, including distributed networks and functional gradients. We conclude by suggesting a set of guiding principles for performing systems and cognitive neuroscience without the intellectual foundation provided by arealization.

Google parent Alphabet's $4.75 billion deal to acquire Intersect, a clean energy developer and data center infrastructure company, represents a major exit for a company that was headquartered for many years in the Pacific Northwest.

More broadly for the industry, the deal adds a new twist to the competition among cloud giants to secure the energy required to power their AI ambitions.

The deal, announced Monday, is expected to give Google a team that can develop, build, and generate power directly alongside data centers — bypassing the long wait that companies typically face to connect new facilities to the electrical grid.

Founded in 2016, Intersect was based in Beaverton, Ore., before officially moving its headquarters earlier this year to San Francisco. 

Intersect has grown into a major player in utility-scale renewable energy, with major assets in solar power and battery storage. The company has raised more than $10 billion to date and already had a partnership with Google, which took a minority stake in a funding round last year.

“AI today is stuck behind one of the slowest, oldest industries in the country: electric power,” wrote Intersect founder and CEO Sheldon Kimber, in a blog post announcing the deal. “The country has racks full of GPUs that can't be energized because there isn't enough electricity for them.”

Microsoft and Amazon are also racing to secure power for AI data centers, but through different approaches. Neither has acquired a power developer outright.

Alphabet's agreement to acquire Intersect is structured as $4.75 billion in cash plus the assumption of debt. It's expected to close in the first half of 2026. 

Intersect, which has more than 360 employees, will continue to operate under its own brand, with Kimber remaining as CEO. The company's operations in Texas and California will be carved out and remain with current investors including TPG Rise Climate and Climate Adaptive Infrastructure.

France's national postal and banking services were knocked offline by a suspected distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on Monday, according to an announcement by La Poste. The postal service called the attack “a major network incident” that was disrupting “all of our information systems.”

La Poste's online mail and banking services, website, and mobile app are among the services that are temporarily unavailable, per a machine translation of the announcement, which said customers could still carry out banking and postal transactions in person.

The banking branch of the company La Banque Postale also published an announcement about the cyberattack, which was “temporarily making our customers' access to their mobile app and online banking space unavailable.”

Despite claims made by a Russian hacktivist group, it's not yet clear who is behind the cyberattack.

The cyberattack comes as the French government contends with a series of cybersecurity incidents of late, including remote control software found planted on a passenger ferry.

Last week, the French Interior Ministry disclosed a data breach in which hackers broke into email accounts and stole confidential documents, including criminal records. Shortly after, local authorities announced the arrest of a suspect, a 22-year-old whose name was not divulged. 

It's not clear if any of the incidents are linked.

The former Yahoo CEO, Marissa Mayer, refuses to sit on the sidelines of the generative AI revolution.

After spending the last six years running Sunshine, a photo-sharing and contact-management startup with little success, the storied tech leader has shuttered the company to launch Dazzle, a new startup focused on building the next generation of AI personal assistants.

While Mayer is not yet sharing specifics about Dazzle's functionality, she has revealed that the new company has raised an $8 million seed round at a $35 million valuation. The round was led by Forerunner's Kirsten Green, with participation from Kleiner Perkins, Greycroft, Offline Ventures, Slow Ventures, and Bling Capital. Although Mayer has admitted to investing her own capital in the startup, she emphasized that the round was led by Green, a venture capitalist with a storied record of identifying iconic consumer brands such as Warby Parker, Chime, and Dollar Shave Club.

Green's investment suggests Dazzle is poised for the coming wave of new AI-infused consumer businesses. The founder of Forerunner Ventures previously told TechCrunch that while enterprise AI took the early lead in this tech cycle, consumer-facing AI is a “late bloomer” that's finally ready for its breakout.

Even for a founder of Mayer's fame, landing Green as a lead investor is a significant stamp of credibility for Dazzle, especially after Sunshine was widely considered to be a flop. “I think she really has a great sense for where people and platforms are going,” Mayer said.  

Mayer told TechCrunch that the Sunshine team began prototyping Dazzle last summer, a project that quickly eclipsed their previous work in ambition and opportunity. “We realized that this was something that we were much more excited about,” she said, noting that Dazzle has potential for “a much bigger impact” than what Sunshine was building.

Originally founded as Lumi Labs in 2018, Sunshine first launched with a subscription app for contact management dubbed “Sunshine Contacts.” Despite its founder's high profile, the product struggled to gain traction. Privacy advocates raised alarms over the app's practice of pulling home addresses from public databases to enrich contact lists, and the company never recovered from the initial skepticism. By 2024, the company broadened its offering by adding event management and “Shine,” an AI-powered photo-sharing tool. The new offering was widely criticized for its outdated design and similarly failed to attract widespread usage.

Sunshine raised a total of $20 million from investors, including Felicis, Norwest Venture Partners, and Unusual Ventures. When the company was dissolved, investors received 10% of Dazzle's equity, Mayer said.

Reflecting on Sunshine's struggle, Mayer was candid about its limitations, admitting the problems the company was tackling were too “mundane” and not large enough. “I don't think we got it to the state of overall polish and accessibility that I really wanted it to be,” she added.

Mayer is now betting that the lessons from Sunshine will help her build a much more resilient and impactful business with Dazzle.

Before her tenure as Yahoo CEO, Mayer was employee number 20 at Google, where she helped design Google search ‘look and feel', and oversaw the development of Google Maps and AdWords.

“I have had the rare privilege of being at two companies that really changed how people do things,” Mayer told TechCrunch. “Yahoo, for many, defined the internet. Google, in terms of Search and Maps, changed everything. I really aspire to build a product that has that kind of impact again.”

Dazzle is expected to come out of stealth mode early next year.

You can have still have weird broken stallouts though.I dunno, this article has some good problem solving but the biggest and mostly untouched issue is that they set the minimum h.264 bandwidth too high.  H.264 can do a lot better than JPEG with a lot less bandwidth.  But if you lock it at 40Mbps of course it's flaky.  Try 1Mbps and iterate from there.And going keyframe-only is the opposite of how you optimize video bandwidth.

I've had similar experiences in the past when trying to do remote desktop streaming for digital signage (which is not particularly demanding in bandwidth terms). Multicast streaming video was the most efficent, but annoying to decode when you dropped data. I now wonder how far I could have gone with JPEGs...

reply

Thinks: why not send text instead of graphics, then? I'm sure it's more complicated than that...

reply

reply

JPEG is extremely efficient to [de/en]code on modern CPUs. You can get close to 1080p60 per core if you use a library that leverages SIMD.I sometimes struggle with the pursuit of perfect codec efficiency when our networks have become this fast. You can employ half-assed compression and still not max out a 1gbps pipe. From Netflix & Google's perspective it totally makes sense, but unless you are building a streaming video platform with billions of customers I don't see the point.

                Reading time 2 minutes
      

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced on Monday that it is banning new foreign-made drones and drone components over national security concerns. The move could disrupt the drone industry as it aims to keep popular Chinese brands out of the U.S. market.

The FCC said the ban follows a review that determined drones and drone parts made outside the U.S. pose “unacceptable risks to the national security of the United States and to the safety and security of U.S. persons.”

As a result, foreign-made drones and components have been added to the FCC's Covered List, which includes communications services and equipment that are prohibited in the U.S. over security risks.

In a fact sheet, the FCC pointed to potential dangers at upcoming major events, including the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the America250 celebrations, and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, as reasons for taking additional steps to safeguard U.S. airspace.

The ban does not apply to drones that have already been purchased, nor does it prohibit retailers from selling models that were previously approved. The fact sheet also states that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Defense could grant exceptions for specific new models if they are determined not to pose a security risk.

The new ban stems from a defense bill that passed last year that called for a review of the national security risks posed by foreign-made drones, with a particular focus on Chinese companies such as SZ DJI Technology and Autel Robotics. The deadline for that review was Dec. 23.

Still, efforts to restrict Chinese-made drones in the U.S. stretch back nearly a decade. In 2017, the U.S. Army banned the use of DJI drones over cybersecurity concerns. DHS also warned in an internal memo that Chinese-made drones could be stealing sensitive flight data and sending it to their manufacturers.

The decision is already stirring backlash in the U.S. drone community. In recent years, drones have exploded in popularity among hobbyists, law enforcement agencies, and businesses. They're now commonly used for filming, real estate, security, agriculture, and mapping.

DJI accounts for an estimated 70% to 90% of commercial, local government, and hobbyist drones in the U.S., The Wall Street Journal reported. According to the newspaper, some drone users have already begun stockpiling DJI models in anticipation of the ban.

A DJI spokesperson told Gizmodo in an emailed statement that the company is “disappointed” by the decision and said concerns about DJI's data security practices are not grounded in evidence.

“As the industry leader, DJI has advocated for an open, competitive market that benefits all US consumers and commercial users, and will continue to do so,” the spokesperson said. “DJI products are among the safest and most secure on the market, supported by years of reviews conducted by U.S. government agencies and independent third parties.”

John Jesitus

 December 23, 2025  

Despite recent advances in rosacea therapy and an ongoing shift toward phenotype-driven treatment, experts told Medscape Medical News that addressing the multifaceted mechanisms of rosacea remains challenging. With research into novel therapeutic approaches largely in early stages, dermatologists must optimize an existing armamentarium that leaves room for improvement, particularly regarding symptoms beyond inflammation.

Dermatologists excel at recognizing rosacea and maximizing use of available therapies, said Christopher G. Bunick, MD, PhD, associate professor of dermatology and faculty member with the Program in Translational Biomedicine at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut. “But there's still a major unmet need for more effective therapies, partly because we're still not entirely certain of the root causes of rosacea. There are ideas, but there's still a lot of research to be done in understanding the root causes and developing new therapies.”

Benjamin Ungar, MD, assistant professor of dermatology and director of the Rosacea & Seborrheic Dermatitis Clinic at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, added that rosacea treatments have advanced to the point where several options can provide benefit. But generally, he told Medscape Medical News, these options work best on rosacea's inflammatory phenotype.

Medications approved by the FDA since 2020, all for inflammatory rosacea, include minocycline foam 1.5% (Zilxi), microencapsulated benzoyl peroxide 5% (Epsolay), and, in November 2024, low-dose oral extended-release minocycline 40 mg (Emrosi).

In the MVOR-1 and MVOR-2 phase 3 trials of adults with moderate-to-severe rosacea, 62.4% of those treated with extended-release minocycline achieved Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) success (defined as IGA 0/1 with at least a 2-point reduction from baseline) at week 16 vs 38.6% among those on extended-release doxycycline and 29% for placebo (P ≤ .01 for all analyses). Corresponding reductions in absolute inflammatory lesion counts were 19.65, 15.35, and 11.6, respectively (P < .001 for all analyses).

Ungar said that although extended-release minocycline has only been commercially available since March, he finds it encouraging that his patients with rosacea tolerate it well, and it generally has been helpful clinically. Compared with topical therapies, he added, having an oral agent will simplify consistent use for many patients.

Understanding how well extended-release minocycline helps particular symptoms or patients will be an ongoing process, Ungar said, as will monitoring for postmarketing side effects. “But so far, it seems to be going well.” 

Whether extended-release minocycline will alter physicians' prescribing habits remains to be seen, Ungar told Medscape Medical News. “For many dermatologists, and likely primary care physicians as well,” he explained, “there is often a bias toward topical medications that are seen as less likely to have side effects or as generally safer.” Despite extended-release minocycline's low total dose of 40 mg, he added, concerns over long-term antibiotic safety also may hinder uptake. Because the product is a specialty formulation, Ungar added, many insurers may not cover it, or high out-of-pocket costs could slow sales.

Neal Bhatia, MD, director of clinical dermatology at Therapeutics Clinical Research in San Diego, said that extended-release minocycline represents the future for treating ocular rosacea in particular. Bhatia, who was co-primary investigator in the phase 3 trials, explained that minocycline uses the same molecular mechanism as doxycycline to enter the vasculature, reduce cathelicidin biology and cytokine interactions, and address other promoters of rosacea inflammation such as matrix metalloproteinases and neutrophils.

Nondrug therapies being explored for rosacea's inflammatory component include transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS). A randomized clinical trial of patients with erythematotelangiectatic rosacea published in October showed that taVNS provided lasting improvements in both erythema scores and systemic comorbidities, including anxiety and depression.

Based on prior research, the study authors wrote, taVNS synergistically modulates the cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex and rebalances cytokine networks, specifically suppressing pathogenic cytokines including interleukin (IL) 1 beta, IL-6, high-mobility group box 1 protein, and TNF-alpha. Additionally, vagus nerve stimulation has been shown to produce antidepressant effects, partly by modulating monoaminergic neurotransmission, including altering serotonin and norepinephrine levels, in limbic circuits, while also upregulating neurotrophic factors that enhance synaptic plasticity and suppress neuroinflammation via the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, according to a review published in 2023.

To a large extent, Ungar said, recent advances in treating rosacea's inflammatory component have highlighted the need for better treatments for other manifestations of rosacea. Although many treatments are under investigation, he said, none are advanced enough to warrant a deep dive. “Different mechanistic approaches are being looked at, at least in principle,” Ungar said. “But it's hard to know if and when we'll actually see what's happening.”

The complexity of rosacea etiology likely will require multiple treatment approaches, he said, to address the inflammatory, neurogenic, vascular proliferative, and oxidative stress response components. “I tend to wait to see published phase 2 studies, let alone phase 3, before getting too excited about an individual treatment,” Ungar added.

The shift from subtype-driven diagnosis and treatment to a phenotype-based approach recommended by organizations including the National Rosacea Society, the American Acne & Rosacea Society, and the global Rosacea Consensus (ROSCO) panel remains a relatively recent development, said Ungar. Rather than targeting the previously recommended erythematotelangiectatic, papulopustular, and/or ocular subtypes, updated ROSCO guidelines recommend choosing treatments based on each patient's presentation.

For dermatologists who have been practicing for many years, Ungar said, the phenotype-driven model of diagnosis and treatment may not be as top-of-mind as it could be. Although there is likely no “silver bullet” for raising such providers' awareness, he said that as the dermatology community continues to discuss rosacea, adoption of this approach will expand.

Increasingly, Ungar said, clinicians intuitively recognize that rosacea, which stems from multiple recognized pathways and creates diverse symptoms that rarely fit neatly into a single subtype, demands an individualized strategy. “There is movement in the right direction,” he told Medscape Medical News, adding that he would not be surprised if the phenotypic strategy becomes the primary way of conceptualizing rosacea over the next few years. Development of additional treatments that target specific rosacea components will further fuel the shift, he said.

Bunick said he doubts that dermatologists consciously consider whether they are using a phenotype- or subtype-driven strategy when addressing rosacea. Rather, he said, diagnosing and treating rosacea effectively requires combining both approaches. Dermatologists' use of visual cues to recognize rosacea subtypes is consistent with the phenotypic strategy, he added. “You look at a patient and generally know that they either have phymatous changes on the nose, or papules and pustules, or they don't,” he said.

Where the phenotypic approach becomes more challenging, and where it is important for dermatologists to pay attention, Bunick told Medscape Medical News, is in addressing possible vascular and/or neurogenic rosacea. Identifying these phenotypes can be trickier, he said, depending on patient presentation. “ How do you distinguish redness from skin inflammation from the redness caused by vasomotor instability and dilated blood vessels? Are there symptoms — burning, stinging, pain, itch, swelling?” Swelling can signify vascular rosacea, he explained, while burning, stinging, pain, and itch may indicate neurogenic origins. 

The 2011 publication in which Tiffany C. Scharschmidt, MD, and colleagues first characterized neurogenic rosacea identified with burning, stinging, and erythema symptoms — key clues for the clinician to look for — in 100% of cases, Bunick told Medscape Medical News. “Dysesthesia out of proportion to flushing or inflammation was also common,” he added, “whereas papules and pustules are less common in neurogenic rosacea. Telangiectasias, the dilated blood vessels seen in vascular rosacea, are not as frequently associated with such dysesthesia, and the blood vessels can often be visualized on dermatoscopy distinct from any inflammatory erythema.”

Patients with rosacea should be screened for concomitant neurologic or neuropsychiatric conditions, which are more prominent in neurogenic rosacea, Bunick added.

To better understand neuroimmune dysregulation and systemic inflammation in rosacea at the molecular level, authors of a recent study used serum proteomic signatures to identify molecular rosacea endotypes. Specifically, quantitative proteomic profiling on plasma samples from 27 patients with rosacea and 25 healthy control participants showed that the former group had 431 upregulated proteins implicating inflammatory, metabolic, and neuroregulatory pathways, and 59 downregulated proteins linked to complement pathways. Further analysis uncovered both inflammatory-predominant and neurogenic-metabolic subtypes in 22 and five patients, respectively.

Ungar said that this paper reinforces much of the current understanding of rosacea pathophysiology, highlighting systemic inflammatory and neurogenic components and the clinical heterogeneity of disease presentation. Additionally, he told Medscape Medical News, the paper could provide a springboard for future research.

Bunick reported having no relevant financial relationships. Ungar reported being a consultant, researcher, and/or speaker for AbbVie, Arcutis Biotherapeutics, Bristol Myers Squibb, Botanix Pharmaceuticals, Castle Biosciences, Fresenius Kabi, Galderma, Incyte, Johnson & Johnson, LEO Pharma, Eli Lilly, Pfizer, Primus Pharmaceuticals, RAPT Therapeutics, Sanofi, Sun Pharma, UCB, Veradermics, and VRG Therapeutics. Bhatia reported having affiliations with AbbVie, Advanced Derm Solutions, Almirall, Arcutis, Beiersdorf, Galderma, Journey, La Roche-Posay, LEO, Ortho Dermatologics, Sagimet Biosciences, Skinfix, and Sun Pharma.

Following the recent approval of nerandomilast tablets for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in adults, the FDA has approved the medication for progressive pulmonary fibrosis as well, according to a press release from manufacturer Boehringer Ingelheim.

Nerandomilast, marketed as Jascayd, is a preferential inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4B with both immunomodulatory and antifibrotic effects, according to the press release.

The drug is the first of its kind to be approved for progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF), a life-threatening condition associated with underlying interstitial lung disease (ILD).

The approval was supported by data from the phase 3 FIBRONEER-ILD trial, in which nerandomilast significantly slowed lung function decline in adults with PPF over 52 weeks compared with placebo. In the study, approximately 1100 adults with PPF were randomized to 18 mg or 9 mg of nerandomilast twice daily, or placebo. The primary endpoint was an absolute change in forced vital capacity (FVC) in milliliters from baseline.

The adjusted mean change in FVC from baseline to 52 weeks in the 18 mg nerandomilast, 9 mg nerandomilast, and placebo groups were -86 ml, -69 ml, and -152 ml, respectively, with significant differences between both nerandomilast doses and placebo.

Nerandomilast was well-tolerated overall across both doses. Diarrhea was the most common adverse event and was more common among patients also taking nintedanib; 1% of patients not taking nintedanib discontinued the medication as a result of diarrhea. Serious adverse events were similar across all groups, according to the press release.

No significant differences appeared among the treatment and placebo groups in the key secondary composite endpoint of time to first occurrence of acute ILD exacerbation, hospitalization for any respiratory cause, or death.

Nerandomilast is now approved for both IPF and PPF in the US and China, and regulatory submissions are under review in the EU, the UK, Japan, and other countries, according to the company. Full prescribing information is available here.

The FIBRONEER study was supported by Boehringer Ingelheim.

 December 23, 2025  

GLP-1 receptor agonists have been linked to a reduced risk for epilepsy in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Results of an observational study showed that patients taking GLP-1s were 16% less likely to develop epilepsy compared to those on DPP-4 inhibitors. Among the GLP-1s studied, semaglutide showed the strongest association with a lower risk for epilepsy.

“More research is needed, but these findings support the theory that GLP-1 drugs may have neurological benefits beyond controlling blood sugar,” principal investigator Edy Kornelius, MD, PhD, at Chung Shan Medical University in Taichung, Taiwan, said in a news release.

The study was published online on December 10th in Neurology.

People with diabetes are significantly more likely than those without the disease to develop epilepsy.

As previously reported by Medscape Medical News, semaglutide was associated with a 50% reduction in the risk for epilepsy in people with diabetes. Another recent study also showed that starting GLP-1s was associated with a lower risk for seizure recurrence among adults with epilepsy and diabetes.

Findings from preclinical studies point to GLP-1 drugs reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, which are contributing factors to the development of epilepsy. Yet, real-world evidence linking GLP-1s to epilepsy risk is lacking, the investigators noted.

For the retrospective cohort study, the researchers used the TriNetX database, which included data from 452,766 patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age, 60.5 years; 47.1% women) from 2015 to 2023.

Within this cohort, they analyzed new users of GLP-1s and compared them to new users of DPP-4s, a second-line treatment for type 2 diabetes.

The primary outcome was incident epilepsy, identified by ICD-10 codes. The GLP-1 drugs evaluated were dulaglutide, liraglutide, and semaglutide.

The investigators used propensity score matching (1:1) to balance the GLP-1 and DPP-4 inhibitor groups for demographic and socioeconomic covariates as well as body mass index, comorbidities, and drugs used at baseline. Cox proportional hazard models were employed to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for incident epilepsy associated with either group of drugs.

After matching, 2.41% of patients using DPP-4 inhibitors developed epilepsy, compared to 2.35% taking GLP-1s.

GLP-1 use was associated with a lower risk for epilepsy than DPP-4 inhibitor use (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.78-0.90). This association held up across subgroups, including age, sex, high blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease.

Among the GLP1s studied, semaglutide showed the strongest association with a reduced risk for epilepsy (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.60-0.77), suggesting that “semaglutide primarily drove the overall protective association,” the investigators wrote.

In a sensitivity analysis, they excluded patients who had used both drugs and found a consistent association between GLP-1 use and lower epilepsy risk (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.64-0.78).

“Additional randomized, controlled trials that follow people over time are needed to confirm these findings, but these results are promising, since people with diabetes are at increased risk of developing epilepsy later in life,” Kornelius said. 

He also noted that the findings don't imply that DPP-4 inhibitors are harmful or that GLP-1s are definitively beneficial for brain health.

Limitations of the study included its observational design and potential residual bias from unmeasured variables.

The authors reported no relevant disclosures. The study was supported by grants from Chung Shan Medical University Hospital (CSH-2022-A-022).

The 'Futbol W' crew discuss what the future holds for Trinity Rodman after Washington Spirit's 1-0 defeat to Gotham FC in the NWSL Championship final. (1:44)

The NWSL on Tuesday implemented a ""High Impact Player"" rule (HIP), which would allow teams in 2026 to spend up to $1 million outside of the salary cap on star players, such as the Washington Spirit's Trinity Rodman, who meet certain criteria.

The news came minutes before the NWSL Players Association voiced their opposition, issuing a statement saying they would now take action to ""to enforce the rights of the Players we represent.""

In Tuesday's statement, the union said: ""The NWSL Players Association opposes the League's decision to move forward without bargaining over the High Impact Player Rule.

""Under federal labor law, changes to compensation under the salary cap are a mandatory subject of bargaining -- not a matter of unilateral discretion. Fair pay is realized through fair, collectively bargained compensation systems, not arbitrary classifications.

""A league that truly believes in the value of its Players would not be afraid to bargain over it.

""The NWSLPA has put forward a clear, lawful alternative: raising the Team Salary Cap to compete in a global labor market.

""Additionally, we have proposed that through collective bargaining, we work together to create a system for projecting revenue sharing numbers in future years so that Teams and Players can negotiate multi-year deals with certainty. The Union remains ready and willing to engage in good-faith bargaining.""

Earlier this week, NWSLPA executive director Meghann Burke told ESPN that the creation of any such rule requires collective bargaining and that the union opposed it.

""Our position is actually that this exceeds the scope of the league's authority,"" Burke told Abby Wambach and Julie Foudy on their ""Welcome to the Party"" podcast. ""Our position is that they must bargain with us over this kind of proposal, not that they merely consult with us.""

Burke told ESPN: ""The league is trying to control and interfere by trying to dictate which players get paid what with this pot of funds. Our position is that teams -- GMs, soccer ops, business folks at the team level -- are uniquely positioned to make judgment calls about how to structure their rosters, how to negotiate deals.

The league said on Wednesday that under the new rule, each club may exceed the league's established salary cap by up to $1M for high impact players beginning in 2026.

The NWSLPA had proposed that the NWSL raise the salary cap by $1M beginning in 2026, which is the same amount of money that the league has now cleared for each team to spend through the HIP rule.

The league said on Wednesday that the threshold will increase year over year at the same base rate as the salary cap. The additional allotment may be applied to a single player or distributed among multiple players, providing clubs with meaningful flexibility to recruit and retain high impact talent while preserving competitive balance. For any contract using this provision, the cap charge of the high-impact player must be a minimum of 12% of the base salary cap.

The league called the new measure a ""historic increase in league investment"" in a news release, noting that it will increase league-wide player spending by up to $16M and a total potential investment of up to $115M over the term of the current CBA.

""Ensuring our teams can compete for the best players in the world is critical to the continued growth of our league,"" NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman said in a news release. ""The High Impact Player Rule allows teams to invest strategically in top talent, strengthens our ability to retain star players, and demonstrates our commitment to building world-class rosters for fans across the league.""

The league said that teams would be able to sign players under the rule ""immediately, provided the contract terms do not require the team to utilize the rule until the effective date.""

The rule was implemented in the wake of the contract impasse involving Rodman, as well as the departures of United States women's national team stars Alyssa Thompson and Naomi Girma earlier this year. Both Thompson and Girma left for transfers of over $1M to join English side Chelsea.

In Rodman's case, her contract expires at the end of December, meaning she could sign elsewhere without the Spirit receiving any compensation.

The NWSL recently rejected a proposed contract between the Spirit and Rodman, alleging that the deal violated the ""spirit"" of the rules and accusing Rodman of preemptive ""salary cap circumvention.""

The NWSL Players Association then filed a grievance on behalf of Rodman against the league on Dec. 3. In the grievance, the PA said that the contract was legal and that the league's veto of the deal violated at least five points of the collective bargaining agreement. It is unclear the extent to which the NWSL Players Association is on board with the NWSL's latest announcement.

In Wednesday's news release, the NWSL said that per the terms of the current collective bargaining agreement, the league had ""exercised its discretion"" to implement the new rule following ""consultation"" with the NWSLPA.

With the 2026 World Cup just months away, GOAL looks at the state of USMNT coaching and infrastructure ahead of next summer.

The U.S. men's national team's 2025 campaign can effectively be split into two halves. The first was defined by struggle. The USMNT failed to live up to expectations at the Nations League finals and spent the summer rebuilding from it. The process wasn't easy, and it wasn't always pretty, but manager Mauricio Pochettino kept asking for one thing above all else: trust.

There was no set turning point for Pochettino, no ""aha"" moment where everything clicked together. No, instead, 2025 was a steady build, one that required some things to be knocked down so Pochettino and his staff could replace them with something bigger and better. There were growing pains, for sure, and there were moments where Pochettino had to ask for a bit more belief.

That trust, ultimately, started to pay off in the second half, when the team rattled off multiple key wins over World Cup-quality teams like Australia and Uruguay. Because of that, reflecting on what was an up-and-down year for the USMNT, it's easy to feel optimistic. It's also fair to wonder just how high those highs can go as the U.S. marches toward the biggest tests next summer.

So what does that mean for 2026? That remains to be seen. The optimism has been restored and, more importantly, so has the belief. Now, Pochettino's task has changed. He's put down the foundation, but now he must build on it, and the good news is that he has plenty of players right there alongside him who are clearly ready and willing to help him do just that.

As 2025 comes to a close, GOAL is looking at the state of the USMNT, analyzing the positional battles that will ultimately define next summer's team. Next up: Coaching and infrastructure. 

Previous State of the USMNT: Goalkeepers | Fullbacks| Center backs| Defensive midfielders| Attacking midfielders| Strikers

There have been several different looks under Pochettino, but after the good run of form in the fall, it seems like we have something resembling a base for this team to work out of going forward.

Starting with the Japan game, the U.S. have played a three-at-the-back system and, ever since, they haven't lost a match. It's a system seemingly designed to get the most out of this group. Full backs are able to push high as wing backs, attacking midfielders have freedom to roam through the middle, and there's a solid base of defensive midfielders and center backs that make the team hard to break through. It all makes sense.

It isn't simple, though. Pochettino has shown some wrinkles in all of it, and there could still be more to come. He's played full backs at the center back spot, allowing the team to shift looks in and out of possession. We haven't really seen it yet, but there could someday be a two-striker look if Folarin Balogun and Ricardo Pepi keep impressing with their clubs. The team can do different things with, say, Weston McKennie in midfield over Malik Tillman or vice versa. It's all very fluid, and it can all be tweaked depending on who is available at any given moment.

It took some time for Pochettino to sort out what he had, but now that he has, it's clear that there's a tactical foundation there, one that the U.S. are clearly building on going forward.

Grade: A-

Throughout his tenure, Pochettino has made it clear: buy in or get out. If a player isn't one million percent committed to what's going on, he'll find someone who will. That was the tone he was trying to set, and it's safe to say that it has been set.

All eyes were on Pochettino as he navigated the Christian Pulisic situation this summer. When Pulisic returned this fall, there was plenty of interest in seeing what the fallout of that would be. As it turns out, everything turned out just fine. Pulisic jumped right back into the fold, and Pochettino's message had seemingly been spread throughout the squad: even the best players are held to the same sorts of standards. It's no surprise that he wanted that message to be heard, too, particularly after his time coaching a PSG team that had an overabundance of stars and egos.

Now, that message dictates everything the U.S. has done. As Pochettino said at his final postgame press conference of the year, there are no ""regular"" players; just players. Everyone has been made to feel both involved and accountable. There are no exceptions or exclusions. It took some hard moments to get there, but Pochettino has built up that sort of relationship with his players, who now know exactly what the coach expects of them.

Grade: A-

Pochettino's last postgame interaction with reporters got testy following the win against Uruguay. The USMNT boss was visibly frustrated by questions regarding the labels and depth of his team. As he grew more frustrated, his emphasis was clear: there are no guarantees for anyone, regardless of stature, fame, or resume.

It is something he had been trying to drill home to fans and media for months, albeit in a much friendlier tone through most of it. Finally, it had gotten to a point where he really wanted to get it across that, regardless of who fans or media may think deserves to be in the team, he is the one who decides, and he's deciding on merit.

It also sent a message to players. The best coaches find ways to use the media to their advantage, particularly when it comes to either building up or humbling players who need those sorts of feelings. So as loud and clear as it was for reporters in the room in Tampa Bay, it was equally clear to those in the locker room, and those watching at home who are still fighting for a spot on the team.

Pochettino has, by and large, worked well to control how his team and decisions on personnel are viewed.

This section can be broken into two parts. The first falls on Pochettino and his ability to integrate talent ahead of the World Cup. The second is about the broader development pipeline - the systems that help ensure that talent is senior team-ready when the moment arrives and that's on U.S. Soccer.

On the Pochettino front, the USMNT boss has done an excellent job integrating new players. Alex Freeman is a fantastic example, as Pochettino has taken a player who was effectively an MLS rookie and helped him grow into a World Cup-quality option. Diego Luna, Matt Freese, Max Arfsten, Sebastian Berhalter, Patrick Agyemang - the list goes on. When given the chance to work with young, hungry players, Pochettino is always willing to put in the work, and he does so with a smile on his face. It's one of his favorite parts of the job, after all.

As for the U.S. Soccer pipeline itself, it's easy to see a new generation coming through. Both the U-17s and U-20s won their groups at their respective World Cups, only to be knocked out by Morocco - the same fate that befell their Olympic counterparts in 2024. Those exits sting, but they don't erase the broader takeaway: the talent is there.

Players like Pulisic and McKennie have shown that it's possible not only to reach the world's biggest clubs, but to thrive there. Cavan Sullivan, the most hyped American teenager since Pulisic, is already committed to a move to Manchester City. Mathis Albert is thriving with Borussia Dortmund's youth teams. Prospects like Noahkai Banks and Benjamin Cremaschi have already had tastes of the senior team environment and could become contributors sooner rather than later.

Overall, developing talent takes a village. It doesn't fall solely on U.S. Soccer, nor does it fall only on the national team coach. But with a healthy pipeline and a manager willing to trust young players, there does appear to be a new wave on the way - one that suggests the current level may be sustainable, rather than a fleeting “golden generation.”

Grade: B+

The federation is almost there. The team's new facility, the Arthur M. Blank U.S. Soccer National Training Center, is set to open in the spring, offering the federation a new home that should prove to be a fantastic base of operations for everything American soccer.

Located just outside Atlanta, the USMNT's new training center will feature 17 outdoor fields, two indoor fields, and 200,000 square feet of facilities to house everything the federation needs. It'll be a facility that rivals any in the world, just like England's St. George's Park or France's Clairefontaine.

Ahead of the World Cup, that facility will be put to use. The U.S. will play two friendlies in Atlanta in March, facing Portugal and Belgium in their final matches before Pochettino selects his World Cup roster. It'll be quite a start for the team's new base of operations, one that should be helpful for American soccer's national teams at every level for years to come.

Grade: A

This is ultimately what matters. At the end of the day, everything above can be filed under ""nice to have"". What really matters, what really is measured, will be the results. More specifically, Pochettino, the USMNT, and U.S. Soccer will be measured on the success, or lack thereof, at this particular World Cup, one that everyone has promised will change soccer forever stateside.

Obviously, we can't predict the results of next summer. The U.S. have gotten a favorable group, yes, one that includes winnable games against Australia, Paraguay, and a European playoff winner. Even so, you can't predict a World Cup, so everything involving that remains to be determined.

What we can look at, though, is how the U.S. performed in 2025. It was a year of peaks and valleys, to put it lightly. March's Nations League was a wake-up call. The summer's Gold Cup was a reset. Then came the fall, a time when everything seemingly came together. Wins over Japan, Australia, Paraguay, and Uruguay, as well as a draw with Ecuador, really set a tone. All five are World Cup-bound teams, including two future opponents. These were all big tests, and the USMNT passed them with flying colors.

Pochettino was getting some criticism earlier this year for a lack of results. Not anymore. The U.S. closed 2025 in several big highs, showing that this team is truly learning how to win, and they're learning how to do that against the type of teams they'll face when everything matters more next summer.

Italy coach Gennaro Gattuso admits that his ‘obsession' is to qualify for the 2026 World Cup, but warns the Azzurri about Northern Ireland: ‘In modern football, there are no easy games.'

Italy CT Gattuso released an interview with Vivo Azzurro just two days before Christmas.

The Azzurri will face Northern Ireland in the World Cup play-off semifinal in March 2026 and will visit the winner between Wales and Bosnia and Herzegovina if they progress to the Final.

“We must not make the same mistake as four years ago against North Macedonia. In modern football, there are no easy games,” Gattuso said, via TMW.

“[Northern Ireland] is a team that can cause trouble for us. We must be able to react and not go down if something negative happens. We'll play for something meaningful, and the entire country is waiting. We must be calm and get there with the right mentality, for the country we represent and for this shirt.”

Italy have not played in the World Cup for more than ten years, having failed to qualify in 2018 and 2022.

The last time the Azzurri played a knockout game in the competition was nearly 20 years ago, in 2006, when they won the trophy with Gattuso as one of the players.

That legendary team was coached by Marcello Lippi, a role model for Gattuso.

“Since I've been the Italy coach, I've made a copy and paste of what he had done,” he said.

“Being true and coherent, there's just one way if you want to create a group. Give that extra trust to a player when he's struggling a bit and try to help. Giving a sense of belonging. He was a master at this.

“My obsession is to go to the World Cup, returning to where we had been for many years, even as protagonists. We must want it at all costs and don't see ghosts after the first difficulty,” continued the Azzurri boss.

“I'm a new Gattuso now. I'm the first one who must convey tranquillity and make as few errors as possible. When we get to Coverciano, we'll focus on preparing for the match. In the next three months, I'll be working, travelling to watch games, meeting and talking to my players. I like to talk to them; we are often in touch.”

Gattuso won five of his opening six games as Italy's coach.

“The players gave their all in every game, except the last one [against Norway], where we made mistakes in the second half. The team was always ready, and I saw a positive attitude, mentality and great sense of belonging,” he said.

“I've appreciated the sacrifices the players have made. Somebody didn't feel well, but remained with us for a long time. During my playing career, I went to Coverciano on crutches many times and rightly so, because you don't create a group in just two or three days.”

Gattuso was hired in June to replace Luciano Spalletti and made his debut in September in a 5-0 win over Estonia.

“I've immediately accepted the proposal, without thinking about the pros and cons. I accepted, and I don't regret it. I represent my country, and I feel privileged,” he added.

“I have the chance to coach the Italy national team, and I think that a million people would like to be in my place. I have a lot of responsibility, but I also had it when I was 12 and went to Perugia. I was in a room, thinking that I could not return home, or I would have failed. I've been dealing with pressure for my whole life. I hope I can give the best with my lads and give the whole country great joy.”

Among all the new signings that were made last summer, Joan Garcia certainly stands out as one of the most successful in 2025.

Joining FC Barcelona from rivals Espanyol, Garcia has visibly improved Barcelona's solidity in between the sticks and has emerged as one of the best-performing ‘keepers in La Liga this season.

Garcia's mastery was evident once again as he awed the Barcelona bench with his saves against Villarreal. It was his sixth clean sheet in La Liga in just 12 matches.

Usually, a performance of such high calibre guarantees you a place in the national team. But Garcia has been particularly unlucky.

The first-choice Barcelona star was not fully fit when Spain were in action during the November international break. 

And now, with the FIFA World Cup 2026 just around the corner, Garcia could end up missing out on the international, reports Cadena SER.

The report points out how Spain coach Luis de la Fuente likes having a well-knit team, in which he can trust. 

In Unai Simon, Remiro, and David Raya, de la Fuente already has three goalkeeping options he can trust and therefore, unless one of them picks up an injury, Garcia may remain out of his plans.

This is extremely unfortunate for Joan Garcia, considering the fact that he has outperformed each of the three players ahead of him in the pecking order this season.

However, there is a considerable part of the season still remaining, and it will be interesting to see if Garcia gets to make his debut for La Roja in the upcoming Finalissima in March, where Lionel Messi could potentially face Lamine Yamal.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Jurgen Klopp 'would love' England job as ex-Liverpool boss tipped to move into international management","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/jurgen-klopp-would-love-england-job-ex-liverpool-boss-tipped-move-into-international-management/blt08574fcc9d4ed9e2","Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:34:29 GMT","

Former Liverpool star John Arne Riise believes that Jurgen Klopp ""would love"" to take charge of England, and has tipped the German to move into international management. The Champions League-winning coach may have stepped away from the Anfield dugout, but the gravitational pull of his reputation continues to link with a potential return to the touchline. 

Klopp's near-nine-year reign at Liverpool reshaped the club's modern identity. He transformed the Reds into serial challengers at the highest level, culminating in the 2020 Premier League title that ended a 30-year wait for domestic supremacy. By the time he walked away at the conclusion of the 2023–24 season, Klopp had delivered every major honour available and restored Liverpool's place among Europe's elite. Despite having a contract that still had two years to run, Klopp chose to leave on his own terms. The decision was driven not by results, but by exhaustion. The German spoke candidly in his farewell address, admitting that the demands of the role had finally caught up with him. Since leaving Liverpool, Klopp has taken on a senior strategic position with the Red Bull group as their global head of soccer, overseeing a network of clubs rather than living match to match.

Riise believes Klopp's next move, if there is one, would almost certainly be with a national team. England, in his view, stand out as a particularly attractive possibility.

Speaking in an interview with Casinostugan, he said: ""If he does come back, I think he'll come back as a national team manager somewhere. I don't think he's going to be a manager for a club. I think he would love the England job at one stage. But I see him as a national team manager because that's not as intense as being a club manager.""

While acknowledging that Klopp's legacy at Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool is already secure, Riise suggested that the relentless grind of club football may no longer appeal.

""Jurgen Klopp loves life, he loves what he's doing, he has passion for whatever he's doing,"" he added. ""I would love to see him back, obviously, because of the energy and who he is, but at the same time, his legacy now is high. He's done so well for Dortmund and for Liverpool, and I can't see that he can do even better at another club. So he might just be happy that 'I'm there now and I did what I did' and do other things. But anyway, I do think his job at Liverpool cost him a lot, he was mentally and physically drained because he put everything he had into that job, basically all his energy.""

For now, Klopp appears in no rush to test Riise's theory. Despite being linked with European giants such as Real Madrid, he has repeatedly signalled that he is content with his current lifestyle. His current role has offered distance from the relentless intensity of weekly competition, but the manager has not entirely closed the door on coaching.

He told The Diary of a CEO podcast: ""I said I will never coach another team, a different team, in England. So that means if then it's Liverpool, yeah, theoretically it's possible.""

However, unlike many of his peers, Klopp does not see management as something primary for his existence. Instead, he has spoken openly about how the job consumed his personal life, eroding the balance he now values deeply. In an interview with German outlet Welt, Klopp reflected on the tunnel vision that defined his career.

""I was in a tunnel, but never with myself,"" he said. ""Now I pay more attention to myself. As silly as it sounds, I stopped doing what I always wanted to do. But it took me too far away from normal life – and ultimately, I no longer had a normal life. Whatever normal life is: my car knew three ways – to the stadium, to the training ground, and home. Frustratingly, while I had many visitors in Liverpool, I hardly had time for them. In the last four months, I've been to two weddings – before that, none in 23 years.

""But I don't want that [management] anymore. I have a job now that fulfills me and is also intense. I don't sleep in the morning and I don't go to bed later at night, but I can organise my work much better. My wife, for example, is really happy with it because we can plan things much better that we couldn't before.""

Klopp's name will always surface whenever a major job becomes available, particularly one as prestigious as England manager - with Thomas Tuchel currently under contract in that position until the end of the 2026 World Cup. His charisma, tactical acumen and ability to connect with players make him an alluring candidate in theory. Yet his own words suggest that any return to the touchline would require extraordinary circumstances. For now, Klopp seems at peace, shaping football from a distance rather than living on its edge.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

	The rumors are true: Chris Evans is back in the MCU — and his life looks very different.


	The first official teaser trailer for the highly anticipated Avengers: Doomsday was released on Tuesday and reveals that Captain America is now a dad. The teaser follows Steve Rogers as he rides his motorcycle up to a farmhouse. With no dialogue and the “Avengers” theme playing in the background, Steve is shown holding a newborn baby, looking on in awe.




	He later pulls his Captain America suit out of storage, pausing as he looks at it, seemingly reflective of his past. The teaser ends with text appearing on a black screen: “Steve Rogers will return in Avengers: Doomsday.”

	The release comes shortly after leaked footage of the trailer reportedly played in theaters during early screenings of Avatar: Fire and Ash. A Thor-focused teaser featuring Chris Hemsworth has also allegedly surfaced online.


	The Russo brothers, Joe and Anthony, who are directing the film, wrote on Instagram: “The character that changed our lives. The story that brought us all here together. It was always going to come back to this.”


	Despite Evans' previous comments about being “happily retired” and not returning as Captain America, The Hollywood Reporter reported last year that he would return for the film. 


	The last time audiences saw Captain America on screen was at the end of 2019's Avengers: Endgame. After completing his time-travel mission, Steve Rogers returned to the main MCU timeline as an elderly man and passed the shield to his former sidekick, Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), who went on to become the new Captain America.

	











Avengers: Doomsday is set to be released in theaters on Dec. 18, 2026.

	It's official. Classic Star Trek characters Bones and Sulu will be making an appearance in the final season of Strange New Worlds, which recently wrapped production. Thomas Jane portrays Leonard “Bones” McCoy, played by DeForest Kelley in the original series, and rising actor Kai Murakami plays Hikaru Sulu, portrayed by George Takei in the OG.


	Both will appear in the final episode of Season 5, which brings the series to a close. 


	Neither character has yet appeared in the prequel series, as the show is set years before Star Trek: The Original Series, but there has been speculation that they would be introduced as the series moves closer to the OG timeline to round out the Enterprise crew before Kirk takes command.

Thomas Jane? He's 56! Deforest Kelly was 46 in the first season of TOS! 

Okay, now that I say it, it doesn't sound so strange. Beltalowda!

This show fell off a cliff in Season 3. It was nice with original characters but now they're just playing the OG with a terrible Kirk.

Fascinating. Yet, the trouble is this: the first time we have seen Bones in “Star Trek” was in the original series' first episode “The Man Trap.” I myself wish Gary Sinise would have been a perfect Bones in “Strange New Worlds.” I also wish Aljin Abella, whom I loved as Theo Martin in “Power Rangers Jungle Fury,” would have been a perfect Sulu.

Thomas Jane as McCoy is quite the get.

The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender, which was greenlit by the previous Paramount Animation administration, won't be getting a theatrical release. Rather, it's headed to Paramount+ next fall.


	The movie's most recent release date was Oct. 9, 2026. It had jumped around the calendar, first set of Oct. 10, 2025, then Jan. 30, 2026. In Comscore that leaves nine theatrical release dates for Paramount, the first up being the Jan. 9 Walter Hamada produced genre movie Primate. Paramount announced last month that next year will count at least 15 theatrical releases. 


	In the movie, directed by Lauren Montgomery with Steve Ahn and William Mata, Avatar Aang, the world's last Airbender, learns of an ancient power that could save his culture from extinction. With the help of his friends, he embarks on a global quest to find it before it falls into the wrong hands and threatens to upend the peace they sacrificed everything to achieve. Voice cast includes Taika Waititi, Geraldine Viswanathan, Dee Bradley Baker, Freida Pinto and Ke Huy Quan, joining previously announced Dave Bautista, Eric Nam, Jessica Matten, Dionne Quan, Román Zaragoza and Steven Yeun.

	There's also a new 2D series coming to P+, that being Avatar: Seven Havens from Avatar Studios. That series from Nickelodeon Animation is set in a world shattered by a devastating cataclysm where a young Earthbender discovers she's the new Avatar after Korra. But in this dangerous era, that title marks her as humanity's destroyer, not its savior. Hunted by both human and spirit enemies, she and her long-lost twin must uncover their mysterious origins and save the Seven Havens before civilization's last strongholds collapse. The series is comprised of Book 1 (13 half-hour episodes) and Book 2 (13 half-hour episodes). Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko serve as co-creators and executive producers. Ethan Spaulding is executive producer, and Sehaj Sethi is co-executive producer.

	











	Both properties are based on the original series Avatar: The Last Airbender created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko. The new movie and new series join The Legend of Korra and Avatar: The Last Airbender on Paramount+. The original series ranks among Nielsen's Top 100 most-streamed titles during 17 of 139 weeks since its debut on the OTT service in March 2023.

	Yes, Virigina, there will be Chris Evans as Steve Rogers in Marvel Studios' Avengers: Doomsday. The Disney studio label and the Russo brothers delivered an early Christmas gift to fans that Captain America is returning, but he's a father now with a little baby. The question is whether or not he puts on the suit and picks up the shield. The one minute and 20 second teaser shows Rogers picking up his tights and putting them in a box. 


We told you a year ago that Evans was coming back, this despite Evans' remarks to the press during The Materialists promo tour that he wasn't.

	“I mean, it's sad to be away. It's sad to not be back with the band,” Evans told ScreenRant this past summer. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Evans began playing Captain America/Steve Rogers in the 2011 movie Captain America: The First Avenger. He continued to reprise the Captain America role across the MCU until 2019's Avengers: Endgame. The characters passed on the Captain America shield to Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson in the Disney+/Marvel series Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Captain America: Brave New World. Evans wound up his role as Rogers in Endgame as an elderly man. 


	These bits and bobs of Doomsday teasers are playing in cinemas attached to prints of Avatar: Fire and Ash. There's reportedly a Thor-themed teaser with Chris Hemsworth.


	The Russo brothers last Avengers title, Endgame, is the second highest grossing movie of all-time with $2.799 billion. 


Avengers: Doomsday will be the big Christmas movie next year on Dec. 18, 2026. 

	











	Joe and Anthony Russo wrote on Instagram this AM, “The character that changed our lives. The story that brought us all here together. It was always going to come back to this.”

Because they made a YUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE mistake getting rid of him. Such a dumb move. At least now the CAP is BACK!! Just don't screw up DOCTOR DOOM.

LOVING THIS.

And RDJ is coming back too. Technically… haha… same storyline as Iron Man. Good life. Kid. Put they keep pulling me back in. Is that what they are doing?

“…'til you're 90.”

Doom will visit him and recruit him so technically Evans wasn't really lying since he will be with RDJ against the others.

Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic


	It is probably too much hyperbole to call Sony's Anaconda the funniest movie of the year, but for my money it really is. It initially started out to be the studio's desire to remake or “reimagine” their 1997 horror movie of the same name that starred Ice Cube, Jon Voight, and Jennifer Lopez among others, and dealt with a National Geographic film crew hijacked by an insane hunter in his quest to bag an elusive giant snake. Studios naturally love to find a way to just repeat their successful IP and Anaconda was enough of a hit to think about a reboot all these years later. If Jumanji keeps working for Sony, why can't this one also? And director Tom Gormican and his co-screenwriter Kevin Etten had a unique idea, quite an inspired one. Previously they had paired on the very funny 2022 comedy, The Unbearable Weight Of Massive Talent with Nicolas Cage playing a whacked out version of Nicolas Cage.

	Similarly their pitch for this one was to turn it into a comedy vehicle, that also takes satirical shots at the movie business. Two down-on-their-luck guys come to a point in life where they team up to do a remake of their favorite movie as teenagers, Anaconda. Take a sharp premise for laughs and add in the first-ever teaming of Paul Rudd and Jack Black, and you have a recipe for a LOL good time at the movies. Comedy has been in short supply of late, and this one is sort of sneaking in at the end of a year where a traditional movie comedy is suddenly an endangered species. Naked Gun ably filled the bill over the summer, and I loved Aziz Ansari's Good Fortune with Seth Rogen and Keanu Reeves also in the cast, but that one sadly opened and closed this Fall without making much of an impression on audiences. There just aren't that many comedies that aren't also masquerading as something else. This one just wants to make you laugh. It does.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Here Gormican switches up the expected casting by making Black largely the straight man to Rudd's crazier friend. Doug McCallister (Black) is a frustrated filmmaker stuck in a dead-end job as a wedding videographer, always wanting to sell his blockbuster tentpole ideas to the bride and groom who just only want the traditional treatment, not the blood and gore he has in mind. Ronald Griffin Jr, aka Griff (Rudd) is a failed actor with a few small credits, most notably a four-episode arc on Swat, who gets fired from his latest job and then comes up with the idea to call Griff, get their school cameraman Kenny (Steve Zahn) and Griff's ex-girlfriend Claire (Thandiwe Newton) back together to go to the Amazon and do a low budget remake of Anaconda, which through happenstance somehow Doug claims he has the remake rights.

	











	With a reluctant Doug finally aboard after his wife Malie (Ione Skye) convinces him to live the dream,  they all leave Buffalo for the snake infested waters of Brazil's Amazon. After getting a boat and a captain, Ana (Daniela Melchior) the first order of duty is sign on a title star, and they get one, a professional huge anaconda named Heitor who comes with his trainer and best friend, a local named Santiago (Selton Mello). Though Heitor  is claimed to be no more harmful than a puppy, there are some moments of fright for Griff who is a little uneasy acting opposite him and at one point panics and tosses him overboard resulting in Heitor's gruesome demise. Santiago is distraught and wracked with grief while Doug and Griff now have to figure out how to replace their star with another snake to keep this production afloat. Well isn't the Amazon full of these things? They will find one. Not a good idea when suddenly the real thing starts to eat everyone for dinner.


	With Australia's Queensland coast standing in the Amazon, Gormican skillfully milks all the inherent humor in the situation while also not letting the horror aspects of the original film overtake this one, at least not enough to threaten a PG13 rating. Thankfully he has this cast and a teaming of Rudd and Black who never go into Abbott & Costello territory with the premise but create likeable characters trying to find the spark of life and creative worth they once had in school. And although Black is largely playing it pretty straight he does have a killer signature scene involving a Wild Boar carcass attached to his back as bait for the real anaconda. Priceless Jack Black stuff. The rest of cast fits in nicely, particularly the ever-reliable Zahn and the great Brazilian actor, Mello (I'm Still Here) who is an amusing scene stealer as the grief-stricken anaconda trainer. Without spoiling anything you can also bet on a couple of ace cameos from the original 1997 film.


	As for all the creature action, the VFX work here is first rate as are all the big ass snakes employed to play the real deal. 


	Producers are Brad Fuller, Andrew Form, Gormican, and Etten.

Russell Brand is facing new charges after two women accused him of rape and sexual assault.

The Metropolitan Police released a statement on Tuesday announcing that the disgraced comedian, 50, has been charged with one count of rape and one count of sexual assault in relation to two women.

“The women who have made reports, including those connected to the two new charges, continue to receive support from specially trained officers,” Metropolitan Police Detective Chief Inspector Tariq Farooqi said in the press release.

“The Met's investigation remains ongoing, and detectives urge anyone affected by this case, or anyone with information, to come forward and speak with police. A dedicated team of investigators can be reached via email at CIT@met.police.uk,” Farooqi added.

“Support is also available through the independent charity Rape Crisis by contacting the 24/7 Rape and Sexual Abuse Support Line.”

Brand is slated to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court in January 2026 in relation to the two new charges.

Page Six has reached out to Brand's rep for comment, but did not immediately hear back.

The “Get Him to the Greek” star's latest legal trouble comes eight months after he was charged with one count of rape, one count of oral rape, two counts of sexual assault and one count of indecent assault after four women came forward.

At the time, the Metropolitan Police claimed the alleged incidents took place between 1999 and 2005.

The stand-up comedian denied the allegations, telling his Instagram followers that though he was a “fool” when he was younger, he “never engaged in nonconsensual activity.”

“I pray that you can see that by looking in my eyes,” he said in the clip.

Police first began investigating Brand in 2023, after receiving a number of allegations, which followed reporting by Channel 4's “Dispatches” and the Sunday Times.

One woman claimed Brand raped her “against a wall” in his Los Angeles home in 2012.

A second woman alleged she was in an “emotionally abusive and controlling” relationship with the actor when she was only 16. (Brand was in his 30s at the time.)

In relation to the five original charges, Brand's trial is scheduled to begin at London's Southwark Crown Court in June 2026.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Jack Black and Paul Rudd's winning Anaconda ""remake"" has the right amount of bite","https://www.avclub.com/anaconda-review-2025","Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:10:37 GMT","

It's hard to imagine anyone, anywhere getting too excited about a 2025 Anaconda reboot. The 1997 original, about a doomed documentary film crew pursued by a giant snake that can coil around a man until his crushed demise, is best known for a scene in which the serpent swallows and spits up a winking Jon Voight. Who could improve upon such perfection? Despite the length of its snake, the series' cultural tail was short. It could barely manage a single theatrical sequel before retreating to the direct-to-video shelf to square off against the gators of Lake Placid. It's hardly a revered series, which actually makes it a worthwhile launching pad for a Jack Black and Paul Rudd two-hander about a couple of dopes remaking the thing, “indie style.”

Playing lifelong friends stuck in a rut, Black and Rudd have endless commitment to a stupid idea, taking simple beats to ridiculous heights for a delightfully dim take on remake culture that neither takes itself seriously nor has much to say about the state of cinema. Anaconda isn't here to teach anyone about the craft or business of filmmaking. Devoid of venom and with shaved-down fangs, Anaconda slithers along, making just enough sense and generating just enough energy to move the plot forward and keep the jokes coming. 

Director and co-writer Tom Gormican, working with his Unbearable Weight Of Massive Genius co-writer, Kevin Etten, knows Anaconda is a bit shallow. As a Hollywood satire, it's not aiming for the specificity of The Studio or repeating Black's turn in Tropic Thunder. Gormican and Etten coil around familiar, surface-level industry issues the audience: Too many reboots about trauma, not enough new ideas. But the duo has a better handle on their postmodern comedy this time around, recognizing that “high-concept” doesn't have to mean “complicated.” All that's really important is they get Black and Rudd on the boat and in front of the snake. 

Black plays Doug, an ambitious wedding videographer who rarely gets to play to his horror-movie tastes. Once an aspiring filmmaker, Doug traded his Tinseltown dreams for a B+ life in Buffalo and let his best friend Griff (Rudd) make a run at Hollywood alone. Griff aimed for the stars and landed a few episodes on S.W.A.T., followed by years of rejection. Fired from his first role in some time, Griff returns home for Doug's birthday, bringing along a copy of their homemade, high-school creature feature, The Quatch, and rekindling some of that creative passion.

Here's where the movie slams the “just go with it” button. Revisiting their VHS heyday reminds Griff that—oh, right—he acquired the rights to Anaconda and suggests remaking it just like the good old days. It doesn't take much convincing. To its credit, Anaconda follows the funniest, silliest, and dumbest route in any given scene, offering just enough grounding to the jokes without grinding the story to a halt. Rather than spending too much time fighting the inevitable, Doug agrees to write and direct this reimagining and enlists the rest of their childhood film crew, Claire (Thandiwe Newton) and Kenny (Steve Zahn), to play Spielberg one more time. 

Anaconda doesn't dig too deeply into the logic of its plot or the interiority of its characters. Black is the closest thing the movie has to a straight man, but he rarely finds himself blocking characters from following their worst impulses. Zahn, who made a career out of the broad comedic roles that have become all too rare in recent years, revels in playing with his old Saving Silverman buddy again, activating a well-honed brain-dead look in his eyes and delighting in the frustration of poor decision-making. Rudd, too, abandons his everyman persona to play the Dumber to Black's Dumb. Where the film falters is in finding a game for Newton to play. Though never reduced to a scold or mere eye candy, Claire pays for the trip and co-stars opposite Griff. Yet, amid the illegal gold miners subplot and Griff and Doug's bickering over the movie's direction, Newton doesn't get a comedic moment to shine—even overshadowed by the productions' scene-stealing Brazilian snake handler (Selton Mello) and mysterious, underwritten riverboat captain (Daniela Melchior). 

Though it dutifully honors the original's beats, Anaconda does not aspire to much as an action or horror movie. The snake attacks are there, offering amiable, lively set pieces that rightfully emphasize laughs over thrills, all while the violence and mayhem are kept to a light PG-13 rumble. It's all the better for it. The few Anaconda-heads in the audience will get a kick out of the cameos, but this iteration is more attuned to Black's recently acquired Mario and Minecraft audience of 13-year-olds, who will surely enjoy a scene where Black begs Zahn to piss on him. 

Anaconda may be getting the benefit of the doubt here because of how few studio comedies make it to theaters. In another era, it might easily have gotten lost in a wave of post-modern updates that included The Brady Bunch and Starsky & Hutch. Its plot offers few surprises, but its simple foundations and character motivations give Rudd and Black so much room to play that it's an amiable time. The two stars keep the energy and charisma in strong supply, while their film uses low expectations to its advantage, knowing that a good comedy doesn't need to squeeze too hard.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Pro wrestling taught me everything I know about music","https://www.avclub.com/pro-wrestling-taught-me-everything-i-know-about-music","Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:20:51 GMT","

I'm a creature of habit. I've listened to the same music for most of my life. I'm not proud of that, but it's the truth: I've clung to my favorites for decades, dragging them from format to format like a 30-year-old time capsule. They were on recorded cassettes, then burned CDs, then on all my iPods, and now they live on my streaming playlists. Same rotation, different hardware. I'd make a terrible DJ, but I like what I like. Don't blame me, though. I didn't discover my favorite bands thumbing through used vinyl at a cool record shop, or through the osmosis of hanging around older kids chain-smoking behind the town's 7-Eleven. The foundation for my entire musical education—metal, punk, grunge, industrial, even hip-hop—instead came from one wild, unlikely source: a bunch of lunatics in a South Philly bingo hall.

When I was ten, I got a TV for Christmas—a 13-inch TV/VCR combo, to be exact. I don't like to brag, but that felt very fancy in 1997. My bedroom didn't have a cable jack, so I was forced to use an antenna to drag in whatever signals wobbled their way to the middle of nowhere, New Jersey. Most of the time, I'd watch a movie on tape or flip through the handful of channels that came in clearly, hunting for anything that wasn't an infomercial. But one night, long past my bedtime, I landed on WGTW Channel 48 out of Philadelphia—on ECW, Extreme Championship Wrestling. Even at ten years old, I was already a lapsed wrestling fan—a former Hulkamaniac who'd drifted away right around the time Hulk Hogan left World Wrestling Federation (WWF) for World Championship Wrestling (WCW). It was kookier than ever. The gimmicks had become more cartoonish but less interesting. Everyone had a “thing”—the plumber, the garage man, the deranged dentist, the guy whose entire personality was that he worked a job other than wrestling. Characters you could understand instantly, which meant there was nothing else left to uncover. The nWo wasn't in full effect yet, and the “Attitude Era” was still a few years away. I'd lost interest and didn't believe I was missing anything.

I'd seen ECW mentioned in wrestling magazines, but the grainy halftone photos made it look like a low-budget WWF knockoff. Watching it proved otherwise within about three seconds. This was something else entirely. Louder, stranger, and infinitely more alive. ECW felt illicit. This wasn't like WWF at all. The lighting was terrible, the camerawork was shaky, and the crowd looked seconds away from rioting. But the songs cut through everything. The wrestlers were making their entrances to real music, not generic themes cooked up in WWF's corporate headquarters—no disrespect to Jim Johnston. These were songs that played on cool radio stations well outside my tiny Top 40 bubble. ECW's musical world sounded bigger, messier, angrier. It sounded like real life.

And then that riff hit: “Enter Sandman.”

The whole crowd seemed to know what it meant. Then a guy with a protruding gut and draped in zebra-print Zubaz stormed through the audience with a cigarette in his mouth and a beer in his hand. It was The Sandman. The people weren't cheering for this guy—they were paying respect by singing along to the music. To them, this wasn't just a wrestler walking to the ring. It was a ritual—a crazy, 1,000-person karaoke session. And to me, sitting on my bed with the volume low enough not to stir my sleeping parents, it felt like the door to another world had just burst open.

My musical diet until that point was whatever was on pop radio, or whatever my parents played in the car. Metallica was a band I recognized from T-shirts worn by older kids who were definitely cooler than me. The energy of “Enter Sandman”—its tone, the lyrics—I'd never heard anything like it, and it sent me tumbling down the heavy metal rabbit hole: Sabbath, Motörhead, Danzig, Slayer, every heavy, scary, unhinged corner of music I could locate. Raven came out to the Offspring, which threw me into Bad Religion, Descendents, and Pennywise—an entire punk ecosystem I'd have missed without ECW. To this day, I know every word of “Natural Born Killaz” because it played on loop throughout every one of New Jack's matches. ECW wasn't just playing music, it was spoon-feeding me faraway genres one match at a time.

ECW owner, promoter, and mastermind Paul Heyman (yes, THAT Paul Heyman) truly had his thumb on the pulse of professional wrestling and whatever the hell was happening in '90s culture. The product was raw, underground, gritty—the programming was the kind of production that looked like it was (barely) being held together with sweat, duct tape, and the collective willpower of everyone involved. It looked like real life. ECW wasn't trying to define the '90s. Instead, it reflected what the decade actually felt like and cranked it up to an 11. The entire era felt DIY, angsty, suspicious of anything overly polished. ECW didn't try to clean anything up or package it nicely for a wider audience. Everything was amplified—Heyman held a funhouse mirror to the decade's noise, palpable frustration, and low-grade chaos. If WWF was Saturday-morning cartoons and WCW was corporate sports with a pyro budget, then ECW was the random gathering of kids in every parking lot around the country—all coexisting in one place without anyone telling them they didn't belong together. And the music was a massive part of what made it feel true.

It's been 30 years. I recognize that nostalgia's a hell of a drug—it'll convince you that your memories carried more weight than they probably did. So, to make sure I wasn't romanticizing all of this beyond recognition, I reached out and traded a few emails with the one guy who actually lived it: Harry Slash, ECW's music coordinator, composer of the promotion's iconic show-open song “This Is Extreme,” and leader of the Slashtones. His perspective confirmed everything I remembered. “It absolutely was a reflection of the times… Some fans discovered music for the first time on ECW programs,” he wrote to me. “The wide diversity of the music ECW used exposed fans to stuff they normally wouldn't listen to. While it was more of a rock/metal fanbase, there were also goths, club kids, hip hop fans, country fans, and they would all groove to each other's tunes. The entire (and often very diverse) audience would all sing ‘Enter Sandman' together.”

The songs in ECW weren't corny, homogenized, or corporate music written to accentuate merchandise lines. They were ripped straight out of the basements, bedrooms, and backseats of the times, not stuffy high-rise conference rooms. ECW's soundtrack felt lived-in in a way the other promotions couldn't kayfabe their way out of—“Because it wasn't ‘fake' generic music like WWF and WCW used. There were ‘real songs' that fans had heard before ECW,” Slash said, bluntly. “It gave more of an illusion of realism.” And here's the part that still feels crazy in hindsight: ECW could only use those “real songs” because Heyman just… used them. No licensing department. No negotiations. No legal team dotting i's and crossing t's. Heyman simply hit “play” on whatever song fit the vibe and worried about the consequences later—or, more accurately, didn't worry. “Everyone knew it would be a problem,” Slash admitted. “But Paul didn't care. He had the rights to some of the music we used, but for others, his stance was he'd keep using it until he got a cease and desist letter from an attorney.” This was ECW's philosophy about most things: Do it until someone yells at you. And honestly, it worked—mostly.

Slash told me that, every once in a while, a band tried to play hardball. He recalls an ECW wrestler wanting to use a band's song to give them exposure, only for the band to “demand” Metallica-level money in return. “ECW wasn't even paying Metallica, so Paul just chose another song from an established artist. The band then asked to have their song put back on the show after they realized the national exposure they'd get, and they were politely told to fuck off.”

Pro wrestling has always understood the power of an epic entrance. Gorgeous George weaponized his flamboyance by sashaying out to “Pomp and Circumstance” in the 1950s. His deliberately effeminate swagger wasn't just showmanship, it was provocation. In the ‘70s, Chris Colt convinced Southern arenas that he was utterly insane, thanks in part to him coming out to Alice Cooper's “Welcome to My Nightmare” at a time when even the scariest heels walked to the ring in complete silence. “Rowdy” Roddy Piper—never one for subtlety—debuted with a live bagpipe band marching him to the squared circle in his very first match. And of course, WWF played “Eye of the Tiger” for Hulk Hogan's entrance to capitalize on his breakthrough role in Rocky III before swapping in the repurposed and now-iconic “Real American” by Rick Derringer.

When American culture grew louder, angrier, and more self-aware in the 1990s, professional wrestling, typically dismissed as trashy entertainment, became one of the most honest places to see the country's true personality reflected. It's a weird little ecosystem where music, fashion, slang, attitude, and spectacle all collide like a zeitgeist demolition derby. Decades before we had “influencers,” wrestlers were shaping how kids talked, dressed, and even understood identity—through entrance themes, catchphrases, and the sheer force of personality. Just ask any middle school teacher from the '90s and ‘00s how many times they were told to “Suck It!” Wrestling wasn't following trends; it was creating them. And every Monday, Thursday, and Saturday night, millions tuned in to discover each one.

You see it everywhere now. Public figures try to be larger-than-life personalities complete with epic arrivals. Baseball closers don't stroll onto the field to crickets—they march out to metal songs that hit like an air raid siren for the other team. Even politicians, the least rock and roll demographic on the planet, now storm onto rally stages like mid-card heels, gesturing to the crowd as fireworks go off. It's all wrestling—a sport that taught us to listen for the cues, that a single riff or the sound of glass shattering could yank a crowd out of the doldrums, sending them into a feral upheaval in seconds. That connection is even stronger when the song exists beyond wrestling's fantasy. A familiar track doesn't just signal somebody's arrival—it brings their entire backstory along for the ride. You're not just reacting to the moment you're living in, you're reacting to every time you've heard that song before: in cars, at crowded parties, during the good times and the bad ones. The response is instinctual, and that's something Paul Heyman and Harry Slash knew all too well.

Another die-hard ECW fan was All Elite Wrestling (AEW) founder and creative force Tony Khan. That's why AEW's approach to music feels so familiar yet refreshing. At a time when WWE (rebranded from WWF in 2002) and Total Nonstop Action (TNA) themes are sanded down into algorithm-friendly soundalikes, AEW uses real music to soundtrack its programming. And, given Khan's financial fitness, I'm sure the songs are licensed through the proper legal avenues. Pixies' “Where Is My Mind?” turns Orange Cassidy's ringside appearance into a thesis statement without him even taking his hands out of his pockets; Jon Moxley evokes the cool-crazy of Japanese deathmatch icon Atsushi Onita when he comes out to “Wild Thing.” I'm convinced half the fans didn't know one-hit wonder band Baltimora until Jack Perry started using “Tarzan Boy” for his walkout.

That's not to say corporate music can't work. CFO$ created some world-class WWE themes a decade ago—tracks so effective they helped an entire generation of new WWE stars get over before they ever said a word. But since then, the shift to Def Rebel has flattened the soundscape, producing themes that function more like interchangeable branding exercises than identity-defining cues. Too many modern entrances feel like placeholders—generic, flat, and instantly forgettable. The exceptions prove the rule. CM Punk still walking out to “Cult of Personality” feels seismic because the song arrives with decades of not just pro wrestling but cultural residue baked in. Even Becky Lynch's theme recently got a makeover thanks to Philly's own The Wonder Years. An entrance needle-drop doesn't simply announce a wrestler. It drags an entire emotional history into the building with it. Real music hits differently and carries memory, meaning, and baggage.

Even when the corporate stuff works—and sometimes it really does—it's a distinct flavor. “The Undertaker's theme, a knock-off of Frederic Chopin's Funeral March from the 18th Century, is about as perfect as you can get for that character,” Slash told me. “Goldberg's WCW theme was iconic. In AEW's case, with all due respect to their people, the only songs that stand out for me are the licensed tunes like ‘Wild Thing' and ‘Tarzan Boy.' It's cool to use a commercially released song to add a touch of realism.” But here's a question: Will those songs still punch AEW fans in the chest 30 years from now?

This summer, I wound up back in the old ECW Arena at the corner of Swanson and Ritner in South Philadelphia—the same building where they taped the shows that rewired my pre-teen brain. 25 years later, I'm at a “legends reunion show,” the kind of thing that could've been a sad museum exhibit but wasn't. The place still vibrated with that old ECW energy you couldn't possibly recreate. The event itself was fun. The matches were whatever—a little sloppy, a little off-cue—but the nostalgia excused every missed spot. Then, mid-match, the PA crackled. And the first notes of “Enter Sandman” came blasting through the speakers.

The crowd jumped to their feet, myself included. Goosebumps. Full-body static. The Sandman appeared at the back of the arena and started his slow walk towards the ring. It was exactly as I remembered it—every move identical to the ones he made a few hundred times on WGTW. The Sandman is older, slimmer, and grayer now, but that didn't matter. It was The Sandman. He chugged beer, kendo stick in hand, as the entire building shouted his song like a hardcore hymn.

In that moment, it made perfect sense why music matters so much in wrestling, and why wrestling ended up shaping so much of how I understand music. Wrestling didn't just help soundtrack my life. It taught me that the right song, at the right time, can flip a switch inside people, transform the air in an entire room, and turn a half-empty arena into a thunderous cathedral. And yes, most of those illegally used ECW entrance tracks still live in my Spotify “Liked Songs,” and I fully expect to haul them onto whatever music-delivery gadget they cook up next.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Ariana Grande's Brother Frankie Shares Photo from Hospital Bed","https://entertainmentnow.com/big-brother/ariana-grande-brother-frankie-hospital-surgery/","Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:14:26 GMT","

Former ‘The Voice' coach & ‘Wicked' star Ariana Grande's brother, Frankie Grande, surprised fans on Monday, December 22, when he took to Instagram to share a photo of himself in a hospital bed.

Wearing a neckbrace and attached to various wires and tubes that were running in different directions, Frankie stuck his tongue out while seemingly snapping a selfie.

In the caption, he wrote, “Wink if you're freshly repaired 😉👅”

“Today I had a planned cervical spine surgery to relieve pressure on nerves in my neck that have been causing pain and neurological symptoms for a while,” he explained. “The procedure went exactly as expected, no surprises, no drama (for once 😅), just very precise work by an incredible medical team.”

He went on to say, “They removed bone and tissue that were compressing the nerves, giving my spinal cord, disks, and radiating nerves the space it needs to heal and function properly. Now comes 4 weeks of healing, rest, physical therapy, and being nicer to my body than I usually am. MERRY CHRISTMAS! 😜”

Frankie continued his message by saying, “I'm sore, I'm tired, but I'm safe, I'm relieved, and I'm already feeling hopeful. This was a necessary step so I can get back on my feet, back on stage, and back to living fully without pain running the show.”

“Thank you for the love, prayers, messages, and support,” he added. “Truly felt and deeply appreciated. This is healing in progress. 🦋✨”

He finished his message by writing, “See you soon… stronger, steadier, and standing tall. 😘💫”

While we're sure that Ariana would be right by her brother's side if he needed anything, he can also count on support and well-wishes from his friends and fans.

One person took to the comments of Frankie's Instagram post to write, “Healing energy and thoughts for a quick recovery 😍 happy to hear it all went well!!!! ❤️❤️”

“❤️Frankie! Sending you so much love and healing energy! Knowing you, you'll bounce back twice as fast as anybody else ever has and will be spinning around the room better than new! Love you so much!❤️🕺,” another follower added.

A third social media user wrote, “Frankie, I wish you a quick and easy recovery. Also, dare I say you look great for someone who's just had surgery? ❤️❤️”

“OMG Sending you ALL the healing vibes!! I'm so glad the surgery went well! Love you so much! ❤️❤️❤️,” came from another person.

Even singer and actress Deborah Cox left a comment, saying, “Sending love😍 and good energy for a speedy recovery ❤️‍🩹”

Singer Imogen Heap also popped in a message, writing, “Wow! Heavy! Glad it went well and you're all good. Someone to help spoon in the Christmas dinner this year?”

Ryan Coogler's audacious “Sinners” dared its post-production team to hack away at a haunted alternate universe — one that felt like a living-breathing thing from the start. Part musical, part horror film, part sideways historical reckoning, the “Black Panther” director's most passionate project to date refused a single rhythm. Instead, the jazzy gothic monster movie editor Michael P. Shawver with inventing something slick enough to fit the film‘s every occasion. 

Speaking at IndieWire's recent editing roundtable, Shawver described a process defined less by structure than by feeling. “Sinners” didn't come with a typical blueprint. Instead, the concept imparted a feeling of grief, rage, desire, and dread. Early cuts swung wildly in length as Shawver and Coogler tested how much mood this world could hold without losing its pulse.

That challenge crystallized in one of the movie's boldest sequences, the “Pale, Pale Moon” performance from Pearline (Jayme Lawson). Shot to the full length of the song, the blues sequence initially ballooned far beyond its sheet music. 

 










“When I first cut it together, it was four times as long as the actual song was,” Shawver said. He had to cut it to the track, per Coogler, and that limitation proved clarifying. “When you have parameters, it kind of gives you a little more freedom at times,” he explained. 

Working within the song's duration forced Shawver to create implicit meaning through juxtaposition. A party crowd stomping in rhythm outside had to bleed into a brutal beating in a back room. In turn, the near-feral stage performance of Pearline was cross-cut with Mary (Hailee Steinfeld) and Stack (Michael B. Jordan) growing certain something is wrong.

Those connections aren't spelled out literally so much as they are illuminated cinematically. Shawver matched movement to movement, threat to threat, and let the final edit communicate with speed what visual storytelling and explicit dialogue could not. The sequence became less about narrative progression than tonal alignment, and that philosophy shaped the entire film. 

Conversely, “Sinners” existed in a radically pared-down cut at one point. It was shortened in response to pressure to get to the vampires faster but as Shawver sees it that version missed the point. “The vampires are not the antagonists,” he said. “The horror is the lives they're living.” 

 










The edit had to make room for that truth, even if it meant working harder to keep the audience on board. Like others at IndieWire's roundtable, Shawver emphasized trial and error, instinct, and trust — particularly in Coogler's firm grasp on the concept and material. In the end, “Sinners” didn't find its shape by being controlled. It found it by being heard — and felt.

							By 

	Emily Zemler



	The first teaser trailer for Avengers: Doomsday is finally here. Instead of featuring the absolutely massive cast for the, the clip confirms one more notable addition: Chris Evans will return as Steve Rogers, the Marvel Cinematic Universe's original Captain America.


	The short clip zooms in on a rural house, where Steve hops off his motorcycle. Inside, he cradles an infant in his arms and smiles. “Steve Rogers Will Return in Avengers: Doomsday,” the title card notes before the film's release date of Dec. 18, 2026 flashes on the screen.


Avengers: Doomsday is directed by Joe and Anthony Russo and will feature Robert Downey Jr. in a new role as villain Doctor Doom. Earlier this year, Marvel unveiled an almost-implausible cast list featuring many of the stars of the studio's latest films. Among them: Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Anthony Mackie as Captain America, Sebastian Stan as The Winter Soldier, Letitia Wright as Shuri, Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm, Paul Rudd as Ant Man, Simu Liu  as Shang-Chi, Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova, Patrick Stewart as Professor X, Ian McKellen as Magneto, Channing Tatum as Gambit, and Pedro Pascal as Mister Fantastic (just to name a few).

	











	Evans was last seen at the end of 2019's Avengers: Endgame. His character passed the Captain America torch to Mackie's Sam Wilson, who led this year's Captain America: Brave New World. Steve, meanwhile, traveled back in time to create a life with Hayley Atwell's Peggy Carter. She is presumably the mother of the child in the new teaser.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The actor previously asserted that he had concluded his Marvel run. After several outlets reported he was planning to return as Steve Rogers, Evans told Esquire in January that the rumors were false. “This always happens,” he said. “I mean, it happens every couple years — ever since Endgame. I've just stopped responding to it. Yeah, no — happily retired.”

	While Evans has yet to comment on the end of this supposed retirement, the Russo Brothers — whose first entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe was 2014's Captain America: The Winter Soldier — shared a short note on Instagram about bringing Steve Rogers back: “The character that changed our lives. The story that brought us all here together. It was always going to come back to this…”


	Marvel released several films in 2025, including Captain America: Brave New World, Thunderbolts*, and The Fantastic Four: First Steps. Doctor Doom notably appeared in a post-credits scene in The Fantastic Four: First Steps.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Conspiracy+Theories","Column: How do you solve a problem like Candace Owens?","https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2025-12-23/candace-owens-conspiracy","Tue, 23 Dec 2025 18:30:00 GMT","

 This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here. 

Candace Owens has a very popular internet show in which she trots out deranged conspiracies about, among other things, the demonic nature of Jews, the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk (probably by Jews and their pawns, in her estimation) and the allegation that French President Emmanuel Macron's wife is really a man.

Owens is hardly alone. There's an entire ecosystem of right-wing “influencers” who peddle conspiracy theories brimming with racism, antisemitism, demonology, pseudoscience and general crackpottery in regular installments. There's an even larger constellation of media outlets and personalities who feed on controversy without ever quite condemning the outrages that cause it.

It's appalling and reprehensible. But this isn't really a column about all of that.

A foundational small-c conservative insight is, “there's nothing new under the sun” (Ecclesiastes 1:9). In a time of relentless technological change, it's understandable to think the utility of biblical wisdom has expired. But the point wasn't about new things. It's that human nature doesn't change.

In 1909, the Philadelphia Inquirer helped launch a regional panic with a “news” series on the New Jersey Devil. The Jan. 21 front-page headline blared, “WHAT-IS-IT VISITS ALL SOUTH JERSEY” alongside a photo of “actual proof-prints of the strange creature.” The Inquirer and competing papers hyped the bogus story relentlessly, with reports of sightings, animal mutilations, etc. Decades later, former newspaperman Norman Jeffries admitted to being the mastermind of the hoax.

In a sense, Tucker Carlson — demon attack survivor and journalistic sleuth of cattle mutilations — is part of a long American tradition.

In 1910, newspapers floated the theory that the tail of the then-returning Halley's Comet might release a kind of cyanide that, as French sci-fi writer and astronomer Camille Flammarion told the New York Times, could “impregnate the atmosphere and possibly snuff out all life on the planet.”

The ensuing Comet Panic of 1910 sold a lot of newspapers, snake oil “comet pills” and even “comet insurance.”

The parallels with pandemic era cure-alls, phobias about “chemtrails” — which may destroy the cloud-seeding industry — and even the Y2K panic a quarter century ago should be fairly obvious.

In 1920, Henry Ford's newspaper (nationally distributed through his car dealerships), the Dearborn Independent, launched its series on “the International Jew.” Ford adapted “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,” forgeries first published in 1903 in a Russian newspaper. In 1936, Father Charles Coughlin launched his magazine Social Justice, picking up where Ford left off. It rehashed “The Protocols” and other bogus propaganda, including the work of deranged Jew-hater August Rohling, the intellectual lodestar for Julius Streicher, the first Nazi to be hanged at Nuremberg for inciting genocide.

Owens, like Streicher, considers Rohling a primary scholarly source.

This stuff seems unprecedented thanks to a cocktail of historical ignorance, recency bias and widespread distrust of elite media. But it's also a function of technological change.

Monster sightings, baseless gossip, silly or sinister speculation and, of course, antisemitism never disappeared. The more harmless versions of this fare could be found in the checkout aisles of supermarkets for generations. The nastier stuff was relegated to obscure newsletters, AM radio and hard-to-find magazines.

The internet and social media changed all that.

In the 19th century, when newspapers and mass literacy converged, the “media” was an anything goes Wild West, with even respectable publications feeding readers sheer nonsense and literal fake news. (The Rest is History podcast has a wonderful series partly dedicated to how the British press helped fuel the panic over, and the legend of, “Jack the Ripper.”)

It took decades for professional standards and consumer expectations to reach a consensus about what was respectable and legitimate and what wasn't. The new media landscape is a new Wild West.

A century ago, a primary journalistic-marketing technique was to seduce readers by releasing information — and baseless allegations — piecemeal, in installments. Come back tomorrow for the next shocking development.

This is the modern podcasters' M.O. Sometimes it's straightforward and episodic “true crime” style stuff. Other times it's deranged hogwash, promising the real evidence (about Kirk, Jeffrey Epstein, Mrs. Macron, etc.) is coming — if the Deep State or the Jews don't get to them first.

They feed the audience just enough to get hooked in pursuit of the big reveal that is never quite revealed. Mixed in is relentless gossip about how other personalities are responding to the allegation du jure or each other. It's equal parts soap opera, conspiracy, gossip, taboo violation and fearmongering.

The market for such titillation and tripe never went away. What vanished were the post-WWII technological and institutional roadblocks to providing it at scale. Also vanished: the willingness of enough responsible people to condemn it.

The following AI-generated content is powered by Perplexity. The Los Angeles Times editorial staff does not create or edit the content.

Candace Owens and other right-wing influencers operate an ecosystem that peddles deranged conspiracy theories involving antisemitism, false accusations of murder, and baseless claims about public figures, which is appalling and reprehensible[1].

The proliferation of conspiracy theories through social media platforms represents not an entirely new phenomenon but rather the removal of technological and institutional barriers that previously limited the spread of misinformation[1]. Historical precedents exist in 19th and early 20th century media, including the 1909 New Jersey Devil hoax, the 1910 Halley's Comet panic, and Henry Ford's antisemitic propaganda series in the 1920s[1].

Professional journalistic standards that developed following World War II have eroded, leaving a modern media landscape resembling a 19th-century “Wild West” with minimal gatekeeping[1]. The internet and social media removed post-WWII institutional safeguards that once prevented sensationalism and misinformation from reaching mass audiences[1].

Contemporary conspiracy podcasters employ a historical marketing technique of releasing information and allegations in episodic installments, creating cliffhangers and promising “big reveals” that never materialize, functioning as a hybrid of soap opera, conspiracy narrative, gossip, taboo violation and fearmongering designed to maintain audience engagement[1].

      This post explores the idea that some (not all) UAP come from beyond the physical universe, from places such as the ""DMT realm"" or ""the afterlife"". Apologies if the post became too long, but i will try to keep it interesting. No AI was used
    


      Before reading the rest, look at this infographic:
    


      infographic: what exists beyond the physical universe



      mirrors: imgur upload



      TLDR: humans have evolved to exist in a tiny niche of an infinite multidimensional reality. We call this niche the physical universe. Beyond this exists an extreme variety of other realities and types of NHI, for example the DMT realm and entities and ""the afterlife"".
    


      Keep this infographic in mind when reading the rest of this post.
    


      Heres a one minute video visualising this idea that we evolved into a 3D niche of a multidimensional reality (timestamp 15:02 to 16:00). As explained in the infographic, earth is not actually round. Its a fictional representation (that is useful for survival) of something else entirely
    


      Garry Nolan: ""When your mind expands to a certain point in terms of what you might consider reality to be, other entities live there"" - Video: timestamp 18:27



      At this point one may think, ""this is all getting too insane, too far from what im familiar with"", but keep in mind that nature doesn't care at all how small we are or what little part of it we know about. The scale of the universe alone demonstrates this
    


      With UAP and the NHI that could be flying them, people often think its some other species or civilisation, they project human motivations on them. What else can we do after all.
    


      But to show that some NHI may be much stranger, here is an video reconstruction of a DMT entity. Just watch it a minute or so, see if you can understand it.
    


      Yesterday Kit Green published a paper/letter (pdf) about PTSD, psychedelics and ""entity encounters"". Kit Green has worked with Garry Nolan researching people that have come close to UAP. Both also worked for the CIA. Some quotes from the letter:
    


      There is growing evidence that post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be a precursor to, or even a cause of, some alien encounter-type experiences
    


      “Most respondents endorsed that the entity had the attributes of being conscious, intelligent, and benevolent, existed in some real but different dimension of reality, and continued to exist after the encounter.”
    


      He is not saying that the entities are real or not, but warning to ""exercise extreme caution"" in treating PTSD with psychedelics. Im adding it here to show that people are looking into links between the DMT entities and UAP encounters
    


      Surely the DMT entities are just figments of the imagination? Its possible. Should we assume this to be the true? No. We start out with this assumption because we consider our human state to be the default. We dont know any better.
    


      But some experiences (NDEs, DMT, UAP/NHI encounters, etc) crush this assumption. Such experiences do not fit in the 20th century idea of 'reality as a bunch of space with planets'. Whether this can be objectively demonstrated is another issue. For the DMT entities experiments are planned to actually prove that they are real



The infographic makes clear that such other states of being are actually to be expected. A natural consequence of accepting that the human state evolved. As usual, the big mistake is to consider that humans (the human state of mind) are the center of existence, the baseline of reality.
    


      In the infographic the difference between ""physical"" and ""spiritual"" is just the type of forms that are experienced. Saying that one is physical and the other ""spiritual"" is like saying everything besides the english language is spiritual. Its just a difference in experienced forms.
    


      There is no absolute distinction, no insurmountable problem or boundary between the physical and non-physical. The boundary can be traversed and technologies can exist to do so. If evolution can do it in billions of years, then artificially it can be done much faster, maybe even instantly.
    


      (btw these ""forms"" are not just spatial or geometric shapes, but ones that may be completely unimaginable to us. For example realities consisting purely of intricite interactions of totally unknown concepts and emotions, or other types of sensory experiences that are as unimaginable to us as our experiences are to an amoeba)
    


      In the infographic technically the entire yellow structure (bottom of image), minus the physical universe, is ""the afterlife"", since it is the biological body that keeps us in the physical plane, oblivious to what exists beyond it. In the same way everything beyond your house is technically the ""after-house"".
    


      However its possible there is some organisational structure to and from the physical plane, just like there's a door into your house, and a hallway to your living room. When people report NDEs, the tunnel, life review, dead relatives, souls, etc, this could be such an organisational structure. This would be a small section in the yellow structure of the infographic
    


      From a recent interview:
    


      Vallee: ""We need to project what's going to happen to us when we die. Where do we come from? What does all this mean? [...] The problem is much deeper. It's us. And what we imagine as being the universe. [...] You need to let go of the idea of time and space because those were secondary concepts built on top of something much deeper. And with UFOs, you have to go deeper""
    


      James Hodgkins (psionic from Skywatcher) said awhile ago:
    


Timestamp 19:36:
    


      James Hodgkins: ""[...] as I understand it, the eggs are typically not piloted. So there's not a biologic within those. And my interactions with them [the eggs and orbs] has led me to believe that this is likely some type of manifestation.
    


      James Hodgkins: ""[...] some of the messages that I've received [from the NHI] about what these craft actually are, is more extradimensional if you will. Actually the message that was used is, I was told that you can best understand us as coming from what you would call 'the afterlife'""
    


      If the eggs do come from outside the physical universe, where exactly? If people report having divine experiences with some craft, then it indicates the origin to be in the deeper layers or hierarchies of the yellow structure (closer to the core). For what purpose? Who knows
    


Timestamp 1:50:51:
    


      James Hodgkins: ""I think with the eggs in particular, I believe that is manifesting out of something else. I don't think they're necessarily a bunch of things that are, you know, zooming around. [...] Ive seen enough evidence to know there are human versions of some of these. [...] reverse engineered, that probably is the only explanation. [...] we have made some progress there""
    


      Interviewer: ""Would this maybe be like a tic tac type thing?""
    


      James Hodgkins: ""No, more of the saucer variety. I've heard the stories about tic tacs, the tic tac being Lockheed tech, I think. I don't know anything about that, but I have knowledge of a saucer that [...]""
    


      According to Jeremy Corbell, James Lacatski told him the US govt has gained access to the interior of an egg shaped craft. See first first minute of this video



      (not sure if Lacatski said ""egg shaped"", but his description sounds like it)
    


      Back to the DMT entities. Heres another quote from Kit Greens paper:
    


      Gallimore (2024) questions whether the human brain is capable of constructing such elaborate realities, noting that users report “objects of impossible geometry and structure that simply cannot exist in our environment.” He questions why and how the brain should suddenly begin rendering “hypertechnological cityscapes crawling with advanced intelligences with no referent in the waking world, that not only don't exist but couldn't exist”
    


      Notice the word ""hypertechnological"". This is even an understatement. People report extremely technologically advanced realities and entities.
    


      Below is a quote from Andrés Gómez Emilsson, a DMT researcher and director of Qualia Research Institute (QRI). He describes that some entities are capable of INSTANTLY solving mathemetical problems that would take us 'trillions of years':
    


Timestamp 1:23:05:
    


      ...there's somebody there, it's not just your imagination, because of their computational capabilities. They're they're capable of doing things [...] you will have to spend a trillion years. [watch the video at the timestamp for a full description]
    


      If such entities are so intelligent, then creating a mere 3 dimensional UAP craft would be a piece of cake.
    


      Posted on X:
    


      Dr. Eric Davis: ""There have been crashes. The superpowers on the Earth have had their share of crashes and they have recovered the vehicles from their crashes. That's why Jacques Vallee and I agree that even though these things behave like a conscious, spiritual, psychic entity, they do have an advanced technology, they have hardware. And there's a craft. And there's occupants [...]""
    


Timestamp 17:19:
    


      Peter Skafish: ""The vehicles often seem to be not only the sort of entities that ordinary descriptive language would call physical objects, but also [...] entities or beings of thought, or for some spirit. Even those events in which UAP leave in their wake indelibly physical traces, also demonstrate that their greatest effects are perplexing perceptual and noetic [mind] anomalies. [...] the UFO has a simultaneously physical and psychic nature""
    


      Heres what Nolan says about UAP technology(timestamp 56:48):
    


      Garry Nolan: ""I don't know whether it's a technology per se because I'm leaving open the idea that it's some form of consciousness that is non-material. And I know to my colleagues out there, I know this all sounds absolutely crazy, but if you've seen the things that I've seen, you would only be able to come to a similar conclusion""
    


      In the infographic, the entire yellow structure (bottom of image), is a communication system between minds. So the issue of how to get a 'craft' from this nonphysical multidimensional jungle into our seemingly 3D physical universe, is a communication issue.
    


      I think the often reported telepathy offers clues. This telepathy is not simply a language difference like between countries. It shows that such NHI beings, even if they stood right in front of you, their communication goes down into the deeper layers or reality, and then back up through the tree to wherever you exist.
    


Timestamp 17:00:
    


      Richard Dolan: ""[Ingo Swanns] belief was exactly that there is this universal language, I think he said is is telepathic. That that's the language of the the cosmos.""
    


      The NHI beings described in ufology almost always communicate using telepathy. This is also true for entities reported in DMT and NDE experiences. Coincidence? Of course not. Its as if we humans are the exception, that we are are missing a sense. Basically blind.
    


      The infographic shows this also: the entire yellow structure (bottom of the image) is a communication system between minds. Humans have evolved, artifically or not, so far away from the more unified states of being that we only communicate in physical forms, and believe that to be the default.
    


      My guesses would be, existence beyond death, the ability to move more freely through the giant tree structure (which in theory can be fully navigated by mind), basically mind over matter to transform reality into different forms
    


      Imagine thousands of years ago people came into contact with such beings and craft from the deeper layers of reality that manifest into the physical plane. They receive communication, clearly not physical, seemingly divine, glimpses of various beings that exist there.
    


      Is it really that impossible that some of these are described in old religious texts? That people have given them labels and tried to understand the relations, hierarchies, etc. Mix it all with myths, politics.
    


      Yet still those descriptions may be more accurate than current concepts of ""ETs from a different ball in space"".
    


      If you hate terms like angels/demons (not religious myself, so i fully understand), then instead consider some NHI as ""buddhists on steroids"" that have realised all kinds of metaphysical truths (including the functional relationship between mind and the material realm), that live in those planes of existence, and know how to travel to other ones
    


      A 33 second clip that describes the Varginha being



      1 minute clip: Vaginha being had ""zero evil intentions"" (edit: fixed link)
    


      Notice in the second clip the guy starts crying as he thinks back about the being. Just like Jake Barber and many many other experiencers. Note that obviously not all NHI are like this. But some of them are. In the infographic i tried to show that there could be an extreme or even infinite variety of NHI out there
    


      Below are some quotes from experiencers that have looked into the massive black eyes of the greys:
    


      ""big, intense black eyes that never blink""
    


      ""there is power in those eyes, they control with their eyes, you are compelled to look into them""
    


      ""when you look you feel the terror of losing control and must surrender""
    


      ""you become surrounded by blackness and its like being in a black box""
    


      ""you lose the energy to fight""
    


      ""its like becoming psychotic, losing touch with reality""
    


      ""they see your entire being, while you see something incomprehensibly alien""

      Jim Semivan: ""So the veil has been lifted, and now you see that you're not below God and the angels. You're now about 3 or maybe 4 down the line here. You're now a talking monkey, right, according to these new intelligences. That's a hell of a position to be put in overnight. And it's a hell of a position that they have to deal with.

      Many abductees will report that space-time as we know it collapses during their experiences. If you ask them “Well, where did this happen?” they may reply, “Well, it's really not in time and space as we know it.” Those of us who are trained in the Western world view have no way to deal with that, and even most physicists have no place for such ideas. The abductees speak of “other dimensions” from which they sense that the beings come, or they say they are taken to another dimension.
    


      Abductees may experience the aliens as intermediaries, beings that are closer to some kind of spiritual source, world soul or anima mundi. A word they commonly use is “Home.” They feel through their abductions they are connected with their true Home or spiritual origins. When they first feel the connection with this “Home” during a regression the experiencers will often break into tears. These tears, I have come to understand, reflect a feeling of awe in relation to the power of the reconnection with a divine source from which most of us in Western culture have been cut off. Abductees may also experience themselves as deriving from that source, and this also underscores their connection with the alien beings themselves. The tears may also relate to a feeling of grief that they ever had to be separated from this source to become embodied on Earth. In certain instances abductees have opened during regressions to cycles of embodiment, return to this spirit source and reembodiment, a continuous process in their personal or soul's evolution. have encountered many past-life experiences among abductees.
    


      They [abductees] will often decide they are not victims of this experience but have in fact, at some point (they are not necessarily sure when) chosen this experience. Many suggest the choice was made “before they were incarnated into human form.”
    


      I have come to feel this phenomena is a very complex engagement of a larger intelligence (‘Source' is the word most often used) through perhaps intermediaries (the ‘aliens'), towards some apparent end, which is the evolution of consciousness and the preservation of this planet.

After the Fukushima disaster in 2011, Japan shut down all its nuclear reactors. The planned restart of a reactor at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant has triggered protests in the coastal city of Niigata.

Japan is a step closer to restarting the world's largest nuclear power plant for the first time since the Fukushima disaster.

Kashiwazaki-Kariwa was among 54 reactors shut down after a massive earthquake and tsunami crippled the Fukushima Daiichi plant in 2011.

On Monday, the Niigata prefectural assembly, where Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is located, approved a bill paving the way for Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) to restart one of seven reactors at the plant.

TEPCO, which also operated the damaged Fukushima Daiichi plant, will now seek final permission from Japan's nuclear regulator to restart operations.

According to Japanese public broadcaster NHK, the operator hopes to restart one of the seven reactors at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa on Jan. 20, with another 1.36-gigawatt reactor expected around 2030.

Some general facts about the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant:

Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who took office two months ago, has backed nuclear restarts to strengthen energy security and counter the cost of imported fossil fuels.

So far, Japan has restarted 14 of the country's 33 reactors still considered operationally viable.

Kashiwazaki-Kariwa will become the first nuclear plant operated by TEPCO to resume operations since Fukushima.

But not everyone is happy about restarting Kashiwazaki-Kariwa.

Around 300 protesters demonstrated outside the assembly on Monday against the decision.

""I am truly angry from the bottom of my heart,"" Kenichiro Ishiyama, a 77-year-old protester from Niigata city, told the Reuters news agency after the vote.

""If something was to happen at the plant, we would be the ones to suffer the consequences.""

A survey published in October showed that 60% of residents did not think conditions for the restart had been met, and nearly 70% were worried about TEPCO operating the plant.

Niigata Governor Hideyo Hanazumi, who backed the restart, described Monday's decision as ""a milestone,"" but ""not the end.""

""There is no end in terms of ensuring the safety of Niigata residents,"" he said.

A foiled ISIS-inspired terror plot targeting Manchester's Jewish community has renewed fears over Jewish safety in Britain, after three men were convicted on Tuesday of planning a mass-casualty gun attack. English authorities said the Manchester case exposed a highly advanced ISIS-inspired terror plot that could have become the deadliest terrorist attack in U.K. history

Walid Saadaoui, 38, and Amar Hussein, 52, were convicted at Preston Crown Court of planning a firearms attack against Jewish targets in Manchester. A third man, Saadaoui's brother Bilel Saadaoui, 36, was convicted of failing to disclose information about the plot, according to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).

Prosecutors said the men planned a marauding gun attack using military-style weapons. Saadaoui paid an initial deposit toward the purchase of four AK-47 assault rifles, two pistols and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, with funds raised after selling his home and business. The plot was uncovered through an undercover police operation, and Saadaoui was arrested while attempting to take possession of weapons and ammunition, the CPS said.

Greater Manchester Police Assistant Chief Constable Rob Potts said the plan could have become ""the deadliest terrorist attack in U.K. history,"" warning that an assault on crowded Jewish sites would have had ""catastrophic"" consequences, according to Sky News.

According to the prosecution, Saadaoui admired Hamid al-Abaoud, the ISIS operative who led the deadly 2015 Paris terrorist attacks, and sought to replicate a similar style of mass murder. The court heard that Saadaoui told an undercover officer he wanted to kill ""young, old, women, elderly, the whole lot,"" and described Christian victims as ""a bonus,"" Sky News reported.

Prosecutors said the men planned to move between locations and intended to kill police officers who might respond to the attack. Saadaoui and Hussein also traveled to the White Cliffs of Dover in March and May 2024 to observe port security, believing they were surveilling how weapons would be brought into the U.K., according to the CPS.

The plot was disrupted on May 8, 2024, when Saadaoui was arrested while attempting to take delivery of firearms and ammunition during the undercover operation. Sky News reported that police body-worn camera footage showed armed officers arresting him moments after the handover.

(Greater Manchester Police/Reuters)

Sky News also reported that intelligence sources said MI5 believed Saadaoui had previously been in contact with a British extremist who left the U.K. to join ISIS in 2013.

Prosecutor Harpreet Sandhu KC told the jury the plan ""hardly had the innocence of a teddy bear picnic,"" describing it as a deliberate attempt to inflict mass civilian casualties, Sky News reported.

The foiled plot revived painful memories in a city that has already suffered major terrorist attacks.

Manchester was the site of the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, when an ISIS-inspired suicide bomber killed 22 people at a concert, the deadliest terror attack in the U.K. since the July 7, 2007, one in London.

More recently, counterterrorism police responded to an attack outside a synagogue in Manchester in October when an assailant rammed pedestrians and stabbed worshipers during Yom Kippur services, killing two Jewish men. British authorities declared the incident a terrorist attack, according to Reuters.

(Greater Manchester Police/Handout via Reuters)

The CPS said the foiled ISIS-inspired gun plot targeted an area of north Manchester predominantly occupied by the Jewish community, heightening concerns among security officials about repeated targeting of the same population.

The convictions come as new polling shows a sharp deterioration in British Jews' sense of security.

A survey published by the Campaign Against Antisemitism in December 2025 found that 51% of British Jews do not believe they have a long-term future in the United Kingdom. According to the poll, 61% said they had considered leaving the country within the past two years, citing antisemitism and safety concerns.

The survey also found that 96% of respondents said Jews are less safe in the U.K. than before the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel, while 59% said they avoid wearing visible signs of Jewish identity in public due to fear of antisemitism.

Confidence in the police and justice system was also low. Only 14% of respondents said police do enough to protect Jewish communities, 8% said the justice system adequately punishes antisemitic crimes, and 7% said prosecutors do enough to bring offenders to justice, the Campaign Against Antisemitism reported.

Members of the Federal Reserve rate-setting committee say they are factoring increased labor productivity into their economic forecasts as artificial intelligence technology becomes more widely adopted.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell addressed this topic in his December news conference, saying that in past technology waves ""there's always been more work and higher productivity and incomes have risen. What will happen here? We're going to have to see.""

Economists and investors say generative AI tools in particular have potential to increase worker productivity and shake up the labor market. Powered by machine learning, these tools may improve over time as more people use them to augment their work, according to researchers writing in the National Bureau of Economic Research. 

""This is because AI can learn. And human beings can also try to utilize AI more effectively, and train AI to suit each person. And the resulting productivity gain is huge,"" said Ping Wang, a professor of economics at Washington University in St. Louis and co-author of ""Artificial Intelligence and Technological Unemployment."" 

Wang and his co-author, Tsz-Nga Wong, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, modeled various scenarios for AI's development. In an ""unbounded growth"" scenario, in which the technology becomes fully developed over many decades, 23% of workers lose employment and labor productivity increases by as much as three to four times.

""Over the next decade which is more like an intermediate run, labor productivity will increase by about roughly 7% per year,"" said Wang in an interview with CNBC. He noted that this is a hypothetical scenario that may not unfold.

The potential effects could affect the employment side of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. The Federal Open Market Committee in December forecasted a federal funds rate settling near 3% over the longer run. This may be a moderately accommodative posture relative to an estimated medium-run neutral interest rate at 3.7%, according to Cleveland Fed economists. 

Some investors see similarities between today's rush to build data centers and a capital expenditures boom on network components in the 1990s.

""The fact that we see a run up in valuations makes us a little more cautious about future returns,"" said Dan Tolomay, chief investment officer at Trust Company of the South in an interview with CNBC.

Upexi (UPXI), a Nasdaq-listed crypto treasury firm focused on solana SOL$124.14, filed to raise as much as $1 billion in a shelf registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), 

The move gives the company the flexibility to raise capital by selling common stock, preferred shares, debt instruments, warrants or units in one or more offerings over time.

Based in Tampa, Florida, Upexi manages a number of consumer brands including Cure Mushrooms medicinal products and Lucky Tail pet care. It also manages the fourth-largest SOL treasury of any public company, with more than 2 million tokens ($248 million) on its balance sheet.

Proceeds from the securities sales, if and when executed, could be used for working capital, research and development, acquisitions and debt repayment, among other general purposes.

The company's shares fell almost 7% on Tuesday to $1.85. Year-to-date, UPXI has lost about 50% of its value, while SOL dropped by 34%.

The era of hype first, think later.

Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, summed it up in three words: “This is embarrassing.”  

Hassabis was replying on X to an overexcited post by Sébastien Bubeck, a research scientist at the rival firm OpenAI, announcing that two mathematicians had used OpenAI's latest large language model, GPT-5, to find solutions to 10 unsolved problems in mathematics. “Science acceleration via AI has officially begun,” Bubeck crowed.

Put your math hats on for a minute, and let's take a look at what this beef from mid-October was about. It's a perfect example of what's wrong with AI right now.

Bubeck was excited that GPT-5 seemed to have somehow solved a number of puzzles known as Erdős problems.

Paul Erdős, one of the most prolific mathematicians of the 20th century, left behind hundreds of puzzles when he died. To help keep track of which ones have been solved, Thomas Bloom, a mathematician at the University of Manchester, UK, set up erdosproblems.com, which lists more than 1,100 problems and notes that around 430 of them come with solutions. 

When Bubeck celebrated GPT-5's breakthrough, Bloom was quick to call him out. “This is a dramatic misrepresentation,” he wrote on X. Bloom explained that a problem isn't necessarily unsolved if this website does not list a solution. That simply means Bloom wasn't aware of one. There are millions of mathematics papers out there, and nobody has read all of them. But GPT-5 probably has.

It turned out that instead of coming up with new solutions to 10 unsolved problems, GPT-5 had scoured the internet for 10 existing solutions that Bloom hadn't seen before. Oops!

There are two takeaways here. One is that breathless claims about big breakthroughs shouldn't be made via social media: Less knee jerk and more gut check.

The second is that GPT-5's ability to find references to previous work that Bloom wasn't aware of is also amazing. The hype overshadowed something that should have been pretty cool in itself.

Mathematicians are very interested in using LLMs to trawl through vast numbers of existing results, François Charton, a research scientist who studies the application of LLMs to mathematics at the AI startup Axiom Math, told me when I talked to him about this Erdős gotcha.

But literature search is dull compared with genuine discovery, especially to AI's fervent boosters on social media. Bubeck's blunder isn't the only example.

In August, a pair of mathematicians showed that no LLM at the time was able to solve a math puzzle known as Yu Tsumura's 554th Problem. Two months later, social media erupted with evidence that GPT-5 now could. “Lee Sedol moment is coming for many,” one observer commented, referring to the Go master who lost to DeepMind's AI AlphaGo in 2016.

But Charton pointed out that solving Yu Tsumura's 554th Problem isn't a big deal to mathematicians. “It's a question you would give an undergrad,” he said. “There is this tendency to overdo everything.”

Meanwhile, more sober assessments of what LLMs may or may not be good at are coming in. At the same time that mathematicians were fighting on the internet about GPT-5, two new studies came out that looked in depth at the use of LLMs in medicine and law (two fields that model makers have claimed their tech excels at). 

Researchers found that LLMs could make certain medical diagnoses, but they were flawed at recommending treatments. When it comes to law, researchers found that LLMs often give inconsistent and incorrect advice. “Evidence thus far spectacularly fails to meet the burden of proof,” the authors concluded.

But that's not the kind of message that goes down well on X. “You've got that excitement because everybody is communicating like crazy—nobody wants to be left behind,” Charton said. X is where a lot of AI news drops first, it's where new results are trumpeted, and it's where key players like Sam Altman, Yann LeCun, and Gary Marcus slug it out in public. It's hard to keep up—and harder to look away.

Bubeck's post was only embarrassing because his mistake was caught. Not all errors are. Unless something changes researchers, investors, and non-specific boosters will keep teeing each other up. “Some of them are scientists, many are not, but they are all nerds,” Charton told me. “Huge claims work very well on these networks.”

*****

There's a coda! I wrote everything you've just read above for the Algorithm column in the January/February 2026 issue of MIT Technology Review magazine (out very soon). Two days after that went to press, Axiom told me its own math model, AxiomProver, had solved two open Erdős problems (#124 and #481, for the math fans in the room). That's impressive stuff for a small startup founded just a few months ago. Yup—AI moves fast!

But that's not all. Five days later the company announced that AxiomProver had solved nine out of 12 problems in this year's Putnam competition, a college-level math challenge that some people consider harder than the better-known International Math Olympiad (which LLMs from both Google DeepMind and OpenAI aced a few months back). 

The Putnam result was lauded on X by big names in the field, including Jeff Dean, chief scientist at Google DeepMind, and Thomas Wolf, cofounder at the AI firm Hugging Face. Once again familiar debates played out in the replies. A few researchers pointed out that while the International Math Olympiad demands more creative problem-solving, the Putnam competition tests math knowledge—which makes it notoriously hard for undergrads, but easier, in theory, for LLMs that have ingested the internet.

How should we judge Axiom's achievements? Not on social media, at least. And the eye-catching competition wins are just a starting point. Determining just how good LLMs are at math will require a deeper dive into exactly what these models are doing when they solve hard (read: hard for humans) math problems.

This post has been updated with Wayne Coyne's statement

Last week, Steven Drozd revealed in a since-deleted post that he's no longer in the Flaming Lips after a nearly 35-year-long run. The band hasn't formally released its own statement, but both frontman Wayne Coyne and current drummer Matthew Duckworth Kirksey have shared their thoughts.

In an Instagram post, Coyne confirms Drozd's departure before accusing him of lying about the circumstances of leaving the band. “For anybody who read Stevens post about the reason he is no longer in the Flaming Lips … I can say that is absolutely not true,” Coyne wrote. “The reason he left is sad , and infuriating.... it is HIS responsibility to tell everyone what happened… what he told everyone was a lie. I was trying to give him ( Steven ) his own space and time to let everyone know what REALLY happened… I will post more in just a few days.”

Meanwhile, Matthew Duckworth Kirksey defended Coyne in an Instagram post in collaboration with the band's official account.

“A lot of great friends and better people have come and gone along the way. I still love them, and miss them, and some of them are my family,” wrote Kirksey, who joined the Flaming Lips back in 2014. “This idea that Steven was THE musical genius, and Wayne is just some weirdo artist… Its just not true.”

Kirksey goes on to explain how hard it is to be in a band for a long time, going so far as to call their rehearsals “brutal” but “fucking FUN,” and credits Coyne's drive as making it all worthwhile. He also revealed that the Flaming Lips are releasing new music soon and called it “the best thing we've done in ages.”

Read Kirksey's full statement below:

“Man… hard to read a lot of these comments. Being in a band, for a long time, that never really stops touring is hard. Some People can hack it for 5 years, some people can hack it for 25 years… A lot of great friends and better people have come and gone along the way. I still love them, and miss them, and some of them are my family. I just want to say… If you haven't heard this newest iteration of the band, give us a shot. The music, and the show is better than ever. And remember… NONE of this ever happens without Wayne. This idea that Steven was THE musical genius, and Wayne is just some weirdo artist… Its just not true. Wayne pushes the creativity, the sound, and the show forward, like no artist I've ever been around. Being in The Lips is hard… I remember before I was in the band, I would see them rehearsing for hours and hours and think… man… thats brutal. But once you get to be a part of that vision… its fucking exhilarating. Its fucking FUN. Its Wayne's drive to be great that makes it all possible. Always has, always will. Derek has been is this band for 16 years. I've been in it for 12 years. It's our blood, sweat, and tears as well. We've given our whole selves to this thing… Because we love it, and believe in it. There is new music on the way and I think its the best thing we've done in ages. I can't wait for you to hear it. Come see us this summer if you get a chance. Happy Holidays!”

When a fan asked Drozd on Threads last week if he was “officially done with the FLips” because they noticed the musician was absent at the Flaming Lips' shows recently, Drozd answered, “They're done with me – but we're not talking about it. So yes I'm moving on. Just keep it to yourself for now. OK?”

Drozd joined the Flaming Lips in 1991 and served as their longtime guitarist, multi-instrumentalist, and a primary songwriter alongside Coyne during the decades that followed. He and Coyne did create a handful of side projects together over the years, but Drozd never took a break from the band during those periods.
