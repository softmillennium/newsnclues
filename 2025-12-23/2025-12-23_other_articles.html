                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apologies if the post became too long, but i will try to keep it interesting. Before reading the rest, look at this infographic: TLDR: humans have evolved to exist in a tiny niche of an infinite multidimensional reality. As explained in the infographic, earth is not actually round. Its a fictional representation (that is useful for survival) of something else entirely Garry Nolan: "When your mind expands to a certain point in terms of what you might consider reality to be, other entities live there" - Video: timestamp 18:27 At this point one may think, "this is all getting too insane, too far from what im familiar with", but keep in mind that nature doesn't care at all how small we are or what little part of it we know about. With UAP and the NHI that could be flying them, people often think its some other species or civilisation, they project human motivations on them. But to show that some NHI may be much stranger, here is an video reconstruction of a DMT entity. Yesterday Kit Green published a paper/letter (pdf) about PTSD, psychedelics and "entity encounters". Kit Green has worked with Garry Nolan researching people that have come close to UAP. There is growing evidence that post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be a precursor to, or even a cause of, some alien encounter-type experiences He is not saying that the entities are real or not, but warning to "exercise extreme caution" in treating PTSD with psychedelics. Im adding it here to show that people are looking into links between the DMT entities and UAP encounters Should we assume this to be the true? But some experiences (NDEs, DMT, UAP/NHI encounters, etc) crush this assumption. Whether this can be objectively demonstrated is another issue. The infographic makes clear that such other states of being are actually to be expected. A natural consequence of accepting that the human state evolved. If evolution can do it in billions of years, then artificially it can be done much faster, maybe even instantly. (btw these "forms" are not just spatial or geometric shapes, but ones that may be completely unimaginable to us. For example realities consisting purely of intricite interactions of totally unknown concepts and emotions, or other types of sensory experiences that are as unimaginable to us as our experiences are to an amoeba) However its possible there is some organisational structure to and from the physical plane, just like there's a door into your house, and a hallway to your living room. When people report NDEs, the tunnel, life review, dead relatives, souls, etc, this could be such an organisational structure. And what we imagine as being the universe. James Hodgkins: "[...] as I understand it, the eggs are typically not piloted. And my interactions with them [the eggs and orbs] has led me to believe that this is likely some type of manifestation. James Hodgkins: "[...] some of the messages that I've received [from the NHI] about what these craft actually are, is more extradimensional if you will. Actually the message that was used is, I was told that you can best understand us as coming from what you would call 'the afterlife'" I don't think they're necessarily a bunch of things that are, you know, zooming around. [...] reverse engineered, that probably is the only explanation. Interviewer: "Would this maybe be like a tic tac type thing?" According to Jeremy Corbell, James Lacatski told him the US govt has gained access to the interior of an egg shaped craft. (not sure if Lacatski said "egg shaped", but his description sounds like it) Gallimore (2024) questions whether the human brain is capable of constructing such elaborate realities, noting that users report “objects of impossible geometry and structure that simply cannot exist in our environment.” He questions why and how the brain should suddenly begin rendering “hypertechnological cityscapes crawling with advanced intelligences with no referent in the waking world, that not only don't exist but couldn't exist” People report extremely technologically advanced realities and entities. That's why Jacques Vallee and I agree that even though these things behave like a conscious, spiritual, psychic entity, they do have an advanced technology, they have hardware. Peter Skafish: "The vehicles often seem to be not only the sort of entities that ordinary descriptive language would call physical objects, but also [...] entities or beings of thought, or for some spirit. Even those events in which UAP leave in their wake indelibly physical traces, also demonstrate that their greatest effects are perplexing perceptual and noetic [mind] anomalies. [...] the UFO has a simultaneously physical and psychic nature" Heres what Nolan says about UAP technology(timestamp 56:48): Garry Nolan: "I don't know whether it's a technology per se because I'm leaving open the idea that it's some form of consciousness that is non-material. And I know to my colleagues out there, I know this all sounds absolutely crazy, but if you've seen the things that I've seen, you would only be able to come to a similar conclusion" So the issue of how to get a 'craft' from this nonphysical multidimensional jungle into our seemingly 3D physical universe, is a communication issue. This telepathy is not simply a language difference like between countries. It shows that such NHI beings, even if they stood right in front of you, their communication goes down into the deeper layers or reality, and then back up through the tree to wherever you exist. The NHI beings described in ufology almost always communicate using telepathy. This is also true for entities reported in DMT and NDE experiences. Humans have evolved, artifically or not, so far away from the more unified states of being that we only communicate in physical forms, and believe that to be the default. My guesses would be, existence beyond death, the ability to move more freely through the giant tree structure (which in theory can be fully navigated by mind), basically mind over matter to transform reality into different forms Imagine thousands of years ago people came into contact with such beings and craft from the deeper layers of reality that manifest into the physical plane. They receive communication, clearly not physical, seemingly divine, glimpses of various beings that exist there. That people have given them labels and tried to understand the relations, hierarchies, etc. Yet still those descriptions may be more accurate than current concepts of "ETs from a different ball in space". If you hate terms like angels/demons (not religious myself, so i fully understand), then instead consider some NHI as "buddhists on steroids" that have realised all kinds of metaphysical truths (including the functional relationship between mind and the material realm), that live in those planes of existence, and know how to travel to other ones 1 minute clip: Vaginha being had "zero evil intentions" (edit: fixed link) Note that obviously not all NHI are like this. In the infographic i tried to show that there could be an extreme or even infinite variety of NHI out there "you become surrounded by blackness and its like being in a black box" In John Macks books there are also descriptions of people being taken out of their body, into grey bodies, as well as some sort of 'agreements' made in the afterlife (or before birth) This is a video reconstruction of what someone experienced. Vallee: "There are experiments on how to communicate with aliens that have not been disclosed, but we know they exist. We know there have to be higher levels of existence. And we know that they can communicate with us" Garry Nolan: "So I think-- and this is, again, from inside the intelligence community, most of what we think we're seeing are avatars, biological robots that are basically put there to be the minions, if you will" If they are intermediaries, the question is of course "for who?". The craft and beings exist in physical form, but would originate from somewhere in the infinite multidimensional reality (see bottom of infographic) Also remember that Nolan was threatened with death by someone at the White House because of something he had publicly talked about. We dont know what triggered that threat, but this "the intelligence community thinks the greys are..." may well be it. In the past Semivan has stated there is some indigestible truth. Jim Semivan: "I think maybe the government realizes this, that if you come out and you tell somebody: "all right, NHI is here. Here's what they have the ability to do. Here's what we can do to counter that. Jim Semivan: "So the veil has been lifted, and now you see that you're not below God and the angels. You're now about 3 or maybe 4 down the line here. You're now a talking monkey, right, according to these new intelligences. Many abductees will report that space-time as we know it collapses during their experiences. If you ask them “Well, where did this happen?” they may reply, “Well, it's really not in time and space as we know it.” Those of us who are trained in the Western world view have no way to deal with that, and even most physicists have no place for such ideas. Abductees may experience the aliens as intermediaries, beings that are closer to some kind of spiritual source, world soul or anima mundi. These tears, I have come to understand, reflect a feeling of awe in relation to the power of the reconnection with a divine source from which most of us in Western culture have been cut off. Abductees may also experience themselves as deriving from that source, and this also underscores their connection with the alien beings themselves. In certain instances abductees have opened during regressions to cycles of embodiment, return to this spirit source and reembodiment, a continuous process in their personal or soul's evolution. Many suggest the choice was made “before they were incarnated into human form.” I have come to feel this phenomena is a very complex engagement of a larger intelligence (‘Source' is the word most often used) through perhaps intermediaries (the ‘aliens'), towards some apparent end, which is the evolution of consciousness and the preservation of this planet. When it comes to the most convincing UFO sightings ever recorded, Redditors have shared a wealth of opinions and insights. Here are some of the most frequently mentioned and highly regarded cases: "The Ariel school incident in Africa is my favourite.

Vanderpump Rules 2.0 is in full swing, and while most of the new cast doesn't have direct ties to the OGs, the same can't be said for SUR manager Demy Selem, who started working at the restaurant when Scheana Shay was still employed as a waitress. “Honestly, I wasn't super close with any of the old cast and with the new cast—Marcus, Kim, Natalie, Venus—we were all always hanging out anyway,” Selem told DECIDER over a Zoom call. In Episode 1, Natalie Maguire lands herself in trouble after coming to SUR on her day off—with her family—and berating Paulo, the faceless 54-year-old SUR bartender she was dating, for blocking her number. Selem, who has an on-again off-again friendship with Maguire, dated Paulo first. With the bartender opting to remain off-camera, some fans have wondered if his name was actually code for Peter Madrigal, SUR's longtime manager who appeared throughout the early seasons of Vanderpump Rules. That makes me sick because Peter's one of my closest friends,” Selem said. “Peter and I have laughed about it because he's that guy friend that I've had that has never tried to hit on me, never tried anything with me. Since I started at SUR, we've always just been friends.” When DECIDER caught up with Selem, she also spoke about SUR's new HR system that put an end to those risqué photoshoots, what it was like to work with Shay when the OG show was filming, and how business at the restaurant has changed since the pandemic. DEMY SELEM: Working when they were filming with the cameras around, I would just be like, “Oh, my God, I would never want to do this. This is crazy.” And now I'm doing it. I thought it was going to be way more intense. But the cameras are there and you don't notice them. Even when I was working there with the old cast and they were filming, I would just walk in the middle of a shot to go grab drinks and run to a table. But being in front of the camera, I thought would be way scarier than it actually is. I mean, there are security cameras literally all over SUR. What was it that made you want to go from never doing the show to giving it a shot? Honestly, I wasn't super close with any of the old cast and with the new cast—Marcus Kim, Natalie, Venus—we were all always hanging out anyway. I have to ask: what was it actually like working with Scheana Shay at SUR? And did she give you any advice going into this new chapter? When I started at SUR in 2017, 2018, Scheana was the very first person that asked me for my phone number to hang out with outside of work. She was doing that thing in Vegas for two or three months. I was only at SUR for like two weeks then. I went, we hung out in Vegas and she was super nice to me. We are a very different group of people. There have been a lot of conspiracies online that Paulo is actually Peter. That makes me sick because Peter's one of my closest friends. Peter and I have laughed about it because he's that guy friend that I've had that has never tried to hit on me, never tried anything with me. Since I started at SUR, we've always just been friends. He and I have slept in the same bed. When I'm drunk, because he lives down the street from SUR, I can go and sleep in his bed. Peter is one of my closest friends. So when people say that, I'm just like, “Oh, my God, you guys are insane. Who comes up with this kind of stuff?” Speaking of Peter, I have to ask for the diehards, how has he been? Will we see him in the background of any scenes? You might see him maybe in the background. So I honestly don't think he was there as much, but maybe in the background, yeah. In this week's episode, Lisa revives an old classic: the SUR photoshoot. Or do you think the new cast could've/should've let their freak flags fly a bit more? When Lisa said we have HR now, that was not a lie. Things are very different now than when I started at SUR. The little dresses that we used to wear, the Saint Tropez dresses, we don't do that anymore. I had a nip slip multiple times while working. Things are very different now, so I think this one just needs to be a little bit classier. I think we see a lot of that struggle in scenes with you and Natalie. What is it like to navigate that, specifically with Natalie? When I started working at SUR, Peter was my manager, and he's one of my closest friends and I would never, ever, ever think of talking to him that way. Also, as a friend, as someone who claims to love me and wants to fix our friendship, [she's] not acting like it. We love each other, but sometimes, we just don't want to be together and I can't stand her. This week, we see you get really worked up to the point where you're shaking – and Lisa even gets involved. Or do you try to keep it away from her? I don't really like to bring that to Lisa because she already has so much going on. But she happened to be there that day. But I normally do try to keep her [out of it]. I don't want to worry her with such little things. In the premiere, we saw Lisa talking about how the pandemic had an effect on business at SUR. As someone who has been there for a while, how would you say things have changed over the years? What Lisa said during that meeting, I feel like people are understanding that it's not even just a SUR thing. Things have not been the same since COVID. Now, if we have 250, it's a busy night. Things have not bounced back since the pandemic. We used to be open until 2 a.m. every night. It makes me really sad because I know that place is fun and people love being there. I know it'll get back to that one day. Getting home at 4 a.m. after work, I used to be in a good mood. It's not as fun for me at least. It's fun for everyone else, but they weren't there pre-COVID, so they don't know how fun it used to be. I've heard that Chris and Jason's OnlyFans is going to be a big topic. I learned what a penis pump is so that was something. Were you never able to look at them the same again? This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brain-computer interfaces are moving out of the lab and into real medical use. In this episode of The Michael Shermer Show, Michael Shermer talks with Matt Angle, founder and CEO of Paradromics, a neurotechnology company developing one of the most advanced high-data-rate brain implants in the world, similar to Neuralink. These devices record activity from individual neurons, making it possible to restore speech in people with paralysis, reconnect the brain to external devices, and potentially treat chronic pain and neurological disorders with far greater precision than existing approaches. Angle explains why progress in neuroscience has been limited not by biology, but by data—how much information we can actually read from the brain, and how fast. He describes how patients who can no longer speak may soon communicate fluently using only brain signals, why invasive implants can sometimes be safer than long-term drug treatments, and what it takes to bring a brain implant through FDA approval and into the clinic. Paradromics' BCI platform records brain activity with unmatched precision, capturing data at the level of individual neurons. This advanced technology enables the decoding of vast amounts of brain data, opening the door to next-generation treatments for paralysis, chronic pain, addiction, mental health conditions, and more. Angle earned his PhD in Neuroscience from the University of Heidelberg, followed by postdoctoral research at Stanford University. Paradromics engineered its first clinical product, the Connexus® BCI, received two FDA Breakthrough Device Designations, and performed the first-in-human neural recording in May 2025. The company is now preparing to launch a clinical trial in early 2026, pending regulatory approval.

When it comes to topics that fascinate and captivate the internet, there are few higher on the list than UFOs. There's one big reason why that's a fact. If the government does know what is going on, it certainly isn't being generous with the information. We now have a new situation developing in the Cowboy State. RELATED: Did Aliens Secretly Fight Soviet Soldiers? The Cowboy State Daily recently reported that officials are dealing with unknown objects flying over Sweetwater County's Red Desert and Jim Bridger Power Plant. The outlet reported that Sheriff John Grossnickle has seen the "drone-like flying objects with his own eyes," and sightings have been going on for a little over a year. That mirrors similar incidents where fighter jets had to be scrambled against unknown objects. Police believe the objects "move like drones, but are fundamentally still a mystery," according to the same report. Wyoming is dealing with a strange UFO problem. Yet again, we have another data point about UFOs/UAPs, and zero actual evidence or proof as to what is going on. The most fascinating part of this situation is that the drones are flying so high that they're outside of engagement distance. I'm not a drone expert, but how many civilian drones are capable of hitting altitudes that can exceed gunfire range? Now, does that mean it's little green aliens?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A satellite photo from July shows intricate snowy stripes painted across the Atacama Desert in Chile. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. This striking satellite photo captured a rare spectacle earlier this year, when "one of the driest places on Earth" experienced a rare snowstorm. This freak event temporarily turned the barren, rocky landscape white — and briefly shut down one of the world's most powerful radio telescopes. It is the world's oldest non-polar desert, having remained semi-arid for at least 150 million years. And it is home to the sunniest spot on Earth, the Altiplano Plateau, which experiences sunlight levels equivalent to those on Venus. Previous research has hinted that parts of the Atacama went nearly 400 years without any recorded rain, between 1570 and 1971. On June 25, a rare snowstorm hit Atacama after a "cold-core cyclone" unexpectedly drifted down from the north, covering over half the desert with white powder, according to NASA's Earth Observatory. This area is home to the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observatory — an array of more than 50 radio dishes that scour the "Dark Universe." (ALMA itself is not visible in the aerial photo.) This area is well-suited to astronomical research because it is remote, dry and well-elevated, which reduces interference and maximizes the amount of data telescopes like ALMA can collect. The icy dust may have also affected the Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) Telescope, located around 530 miles (850 km) southwest of ALMA, but to a lesser extent, according to Live Science's sister site Space.com.

The region has also experienced several intense bouts of rain in recent years. When this happens, it can trigger deadly mudflows. In March 2015, at least 31 people were killed after heavy rainfall triggered Atacama's largest ever flood, according to a 2016 study. Rain can also cause desert flowers, which normally appear in spring, to unexpectedly bloom during winter months, creating fields of vibrant petals to sprout up around the desert. This most recently happened in 2024, after a surprise rain shower caught the plants off guard. —10 bizarre 'dark voids' appear in the skies over uninhabited island near Antarctica —World's largest iceberg, A23a, is disintegrating into thousands of pieces alongside penguin refuge Precipitation is rare in the Atacama for two reasons. This makes Atacama inhospitable to most lifeforms, aside from hardy desert flowers and extreme microbes that live well below its dry surface. However, the recent instances of extreme precipitation in the region could be a sign that human-caused climate change is making it more likely for snow and rain to fall there.

A private jet pilot flying over Rhode Island reported a bizarre encounter with a small silver UFO at 3,500 feet, sparking questions about unexplained aerial phenomena (UAP) in U.S. airspace. The pilot described the object as hovering beside the aircraft, appearing to stand still before disappearing. Air traffic control confirmed no other sightings, while the FAA states that corroborated reports are shared with the UAP Task Force. This follows similar sightings, including one over a U.S. air base in Britain in 2024, fueling speculation about alien or secret aerial technology.</p>
