                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This post has been updated with Wayne Coyne's statement Last week, Steven Drozd revealed in a since-deleted post that he's no longer in the Flaming Lips after a nearly 35-year-long run. The band hasn't formally released its own statement, but both frontman Wayne Coyne and current drummer Matthew Duckworth Kirksey have shared their thoughts. In an Instagram post, Coyne confirms Drozd's departure before accusing him of lying about the circumstances of leaving the band. “For anybody who read Stevens post about the reason he is no longer in the Flaming Lips … I can say that is absolutely not true,” Coyne wrote. “The reason he left is sad , and infuriating.... it is HIS responsibility to tell everyone what happened… what he told everyone was a lie. I was trying to give him ( Steven ) his own space and time to let everyone know what REALLY happened… I will post more in just a few days.” Kirksey goes on to explain how hard it is to be in a band for a long time, going so far as to call their rehearsals “brutal” but “fucking FUN,” and credits Coyne's drive as making it all worthwhile. He also revealed that the Flaming Lips are releasing new music soon and called it “the best thing we've done in ages.” “Man… hard to read a lot of these comments. Some People can hack it for 5 years, some people can hack it for 25 years… A lot of great friends and better people have come and gone along the way. I just want to say… If you haven't heard this newest iteration of the band, give us a shot. And remember… NONE of this ever happens without Wayne. But once you get to be a part of that vision… its fucking exhilarating. Its Wayne's drive to be great that makes it all possible. Derek has been is this band for 16 years. It's our blood, sweat, and tears as well. I can't wait for you to hear it. Come see us this summer if you get a chance. When a fan asked Drozd on Threads last week if he was “officially done with the FLips” because they noticed the musician was absent at the Flaming Lips' shows recently, Drozd answered, “They're done with me – but we're not talking about it. Drozd joined the Flaming Lips in 1991 and served as their longtime guitarist, multi-instrumentalist, and a primary songwriter alongside Coyne during the decades that followed. He and Coyne did create a handful of side projects together over the years, but Drozd never took a break from the band during those periods.

Ryan Coogler's audacious “Sinners” dared its post-production team to hack away at a haunted alternate universe — one that felt like a living-breathing thing from the start. Instead, the jazzy gothic monster movie editor Michael P. Shawver with inventing something slick enough to fit the film‘s every occasion. Speaking at IndieWire's recent editing roundtable, Shawver described a process defined less by structure than by feeling. “Sinners” didn't come with a typical blueprint. Instead, the concept imparted a feeling of grief, rage, desire, and dread. Early cuts swung wildly in length as Shawver and Coogler tested how much mood this world could hold without losing its pulse. Related Stories ‘Anaconda' Review: Paul Rudd and Jack Black Star in Lazy Meta-Sequel That Squeezes All the Fun Out of Self-Reflexive Premise James Cameron and Sigourney Weaver on Their 40-Year Collaboration That challenge crystallized in one of the movie's boldest sequences, the “Pale, Pale Moon” performance from Pearline (Jayme Lawson). “When I first cut it together, it was four times as long as the actual song was,” Shawver said. “When you have parameters, it kind of gives you a little more freedom at times,” he explained. Working within the song's duration forced Shawver to create implicit meaning through juxtaposition. In turn, the near-feral stage performance of Pearline was cross-cut with Mary (Hailee Steinfeld) and Stack (Michael B. Jordan) growing certain something is wrong. Shawver matched movement to movement, threat to threat, and let the final edit communicate with speed what visual storytelling and explicit dialogue could not. Conversely, “Sinners” existed in a radically pared-down cut at one point. The edit had to make room for that truth, even if it meant working harder to keep the audience on board. In the end, “Sinners” didn't find its shape by being controlled. For more from all of our craft roundtables, click here. This conversation is presented in partnership with Warner Bros.

Yet, the trouble is this: the first time we have seen Bones in “Star Trek” was in the original series' first episode “The Man Trap.” I myself wish Gary Sinise would have been a perfect Bones in “Strange New Worlds.” I also wish Aljin Abella, whom I loved as Theo Martin in “Power Rangers Jungle Fury,” would have been a perfect Sulu. Thomas Jane as McCoy is quite the get. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russell Brand is facing new charges after two women accused him of rape and sexual assault. The Metropolitan Police released a statement on Tuesday announcing that the disgraced comedian, 50, has been charged with one count of rape and one count of sexual assault in relation to two women. “The women who have made reports, including those connected to the two new charges, continue to receive support from specially trained officers,” Metropolitan Police Detective Chief Inspector Tariq Farooqi said in the press release. “The Met's investigation remains ongoing, and detectives urge anyone affected by this case, or anyone with information, to come forward and speak with police. A dedicated team of investigators can be reached via email at CIT@met.police.uk,” Farooqi added. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Page Six has reached out to Brand's rep for comment, but did not immediately hear back. The “Get Him to the Greek” star's latest legal trouble comes eight months after he was charged with one count of rape, one count of oral rape, two counts of sexual assault and one count of indecent assault after four women came forward. Police first began investigating Brand in 2023, after receiving a number of allegations, which followed reporting by Channel 4's “Dispatches” and the Sunday Times. A second woman alleged she was in an “emotionally abusive and controlling” relationship with the actor when she was only 16. In relation to the five original charges, Brand's trial is scheduled to begin at London's Southwark Crown Court in June 2026. If you or someone you know is affected by any of the issues raised in this story, call the Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-330-0226.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's hard to imagine anyone, anywhere getting too excited about a 2025 Anaconda reboot. It could barely manage a single theatrical sequel before retreating to the direct-to-video shelf to square off against the gators of Lake Placid. Playing lifelong friends stuck in a rut, Black and Rudd have endless commitment to a stupid idea, taking simple beats to ridiculous heights for a delightfully dim take on remake culture that neither takes itself seriously nor has much to say about the state of cinema. Anaconda isn't here to teach anyone about the craft or business of filmmaking. Director and co-writer Tom Gormican, working with his Unbearable Weight Of Massive Genius co-writer, Kevin Etten, knows Anaconda is a bit shallow. Gormican and Etten coil around familiar, surface-level industry issues the audience: Too many reboots about trauma, not enough new ideas. But the duo has a better handle on their postmodern comedy this time around, recognizing that “high-concept” doesn't have to mean “complicated.” All that's really important is they get Black and Rudd on the boat and in front of the snake. Once an aspiring filmmaker, Doug traded his Tinseltown dreams for a B+ life in Buffalo and let his best friend Griff (Rudd) make a run at Hollywood alone. Griff aimed for the stars and landed a few episodes on S.W.A.T., followed by years of rejection. Fired from his first role in some time, Griff returns home for Doug's birthday, bringing along a copy of their homemade, high-school creature feature, The Quatch, and rekindling some of that creative passion. Revisiting their VHS heyday reminds Griff that—oh, right—he acquired the rights to Anaconda and suggests remaking it just like the good old days. Rather than spending too much time fighting the inevitable, Doug agrees to write and direct this reimagining and enlists the rest of their childhood film crew, Claire (Thandiwe Newton) and Kenny (Steve Zahn), to play Spielberg one more time. Black is the closest thing the movie has to a straight man, but he rarely finds himself blocking characters from following their worst impulses. Where the film falters is in finding a game for Newton to play. Though never reduced to a scold or mere eye candy, Claire pays for the trip and co-stars opposite Griff. Yet, amid the illegal gold miners subplot and Griff and Doug's bickering over the movie's direction, Newton doesn't get a comedic moment to shine—even overshadowed by the productions' scene-stealing Brazilian snake handler (Selton Mello) and mysterious, underwritten riverboat captain (Daniela Melchior). Though it dutifully honors the original's beats, Anaconda does not aspire to much as an action or horror movie. The snake attacks are there, offering amiable, lively set pieces that rightfully emphasize laughs over thrills, all while the violence and mayhem are kept to a light PG-13 rumble. The few Anaconda-heads in the audience will get a kick out of the cameos, but this iteration is more attuned to Black's recently acquired Mario and Minecraft audience of 13-year-olds, who will surely enjoy a scene where Black begs Zahn to piss on him. In another era, it might easily have gotten lost in a wave of post-modern updates that included The Brady Bunch and Starsky & Hutch. Its plot offers few surprises, but its simple foundations and character motivations give Rudd and Black so much room to play that it's an amiable time. The two stars keep the energy and charisma in strong supply, while their film uses low expectations to its advantage, knowing that a good comedy doesn't need to squeeze too hard.

The undisputed pinnacles of late 20th century Hollywood cinema. Each of these masterpieces invited the world to dream with its eyes open. Each of them has become synonymous with one of the three sacred elements that makes the movies so magical. Or so Tom Gormican's sweet-natured but wastefully slipshod new take on “Anaconda” would have you believe. Like almost everything in this soggy first draft of a comedy meta-sequel, the poster gag is so ambivalent that it's hard to know if it's meant to be a joke or not. Related Stories James Cameron and Sigourney Weaver on Their 40-Year Collaboration Craig Brewer on Turning ‘Song Song Blue' from True Story to Capraesque Fable: ‘Everybody in Town Said No' I guess it's funny that Luis Llosa's cable TV classic — a silly “Jaws” riff about a giant CGI serpent who slurps down the members of a documentary crew as they drift along the Amazon — would be canonized alongside two of the most iconic American movies ever made, but Gormican's film completely fails to contextualize the 1997 original on its own terms. Is it a winsome time capsule that's made all the more endearing by its shitty effects and star-bound cast? So far as this new “Anaconda” is concerned, the answer to all of those questions is both “yes” and “no” all at once. When talent-challenged background actor Ronald “Griff” Griffen Jr. (Paul Rudd) walks by the aforementioned one-sheets after being fired from a bit part in a TV medical drama, the “Anaconda” poster presumably catches his eye for a couple of different reasons, the most important two of which are braided together and relevant to the story at hand. The first is that it's the kind of movie Griff and his friends loved to watch — and tried to make — when they were kids growing up in Buffalo. Griff doesn't have any special affinity for “Anaconda” (his nostalgia is mostly limited to Jon Voight's immortal performance as a knife-licking Paraguayan snake hunter so slimy that it feels like his prey already spat him back out), but that's precisely what makes it the perfect subject for a satire about how modern Hollywood would rather trawl the collective unconscious for half-remembered ideas than come up with any of its own. Alas, this “Anaconda” is a lot better at illustrating the problem than it is at poking fun at it, even if Gormican — whose more coherent “The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent” also flubbed its self-reflexive concept — mostly resists the temptation to pretend that anyone does or should give a shit about the original. Indeed, the sharpest aspect of his screenplay, co-written by Kevin Etten, is that it diagnoses its workaday characters with their own versions of the studio executive mindset. Similar to some of the people who greenlit this misshapen turd, the slowly extinguished potential of which still lingers in the air like a faint smell, Griff's friends back East have all betrayed their childhood dreams in favor of accepting “B, or maybe even B+” lives because they've been conditioned to believe they didn't have any other choice. Horror obsessive Doug McCallister (a relatively grounded Jack Black) aspired to be the next John Carpenter, only to settle for being the goriest wedding videographer in all of upstate New York. Burnout Kenny Trent (a wasted Steve Zahn, forced to squeeze an entire role out of a throwaway joke about being “Buffalo sober”) must have also had ambitions of some kind at one point, but I'm struggling to remember what they were. The same goes for Claire Simons, who's played by Thandiwe Newton in a “since when does she do stuff like this?” performance that's premised on the idea that one of the world's most beautiful women might have spent her teenage years hanging out with the cast of “Saving Silverman.” Once upon a time she starred in Doug's junior high creature feature “Squatch,” and now — bored and Buffalo rich from a recent divorce — Claire is happy to plunk down some of the $43,000 that he needs to shoot his masterpiece in the Amazon. Emphasis on “ostensibly.” Truth be told, “Anaconda” is determined to be about as little as possible, a bug that it tries to will into a feature with a running gag where Doug and Griff repeatedly strain for big ideas they can glom onto their script (which amounts to Black whispering the word “themes” while he squints into the distance). There are worse things than watching Black, Rudd, and Zahn play three gormless morons on a mid-life misadventure, but almost every scene and setpiece is constructed with a haphazardness that blunders away their charm. The dysfunction is on full display from the total “huh?” of a prologue, and it only gets worse when our heroes' DIY creature feature is suddenly upended by the appearance of a real anaconda (and by “a real anaconda” I, of course, mean “a CGI behemoth so fake-looking it makes the snake from the original seem photorealistic by comparison”). The serpent's introduction is so lackadaisical that it's hard to tell if it's supposed to be scary or funny (Gormican aims for both and settles for neither), and the movie is so uncertain about its own sense of humor that it never really commits to whether or not Doug sees the monster as a blessing in disguise. It's no wonder that the best thing about “Anaconda” is Selton Mello's supporting performance as the snake wrangler our boys meet up with in Manaus, as the functionality of his role allows the overqualified Brazilian actor to stay on task in a way that proves impossible for his more prominent co-stars; it's also inherently funny to see the dad from last year's hyper-serious “I'm Still Here” make such an extreme pivot to this kind of silliness. “Anaconda” constricts its premise a little tighter as it moves along (if only because the absurdity ratchets up in a way that forces the film to adopt a clearer sense of itself), and there are some undeniably amusing bits of stupidity along the way. And honestly, all I've ever asked of a movie — any movie — is that it make at least two jokes at Jon Voight's expense, and on that score I have no choice but to acknowledge that Gormican's meta-sequel delivers, if only just. Still, this self-reflexive Hollywood sendup is so slapdash and unsure of itself that it ultimately feels less like a bad in-joke than a case of a snake eating its own tail.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first official teaser trailer for the highly anticipated Avengers: Doomsday was released on Tuesday and reveals that Captain America is now a dad. The teaser follows Steve Rogers as he rides his motorcycle up to a farmhouse. With no dialogue and the “Avengers” theme playing in the background, Steve is shown holding a newborn baby, looking on in awe. The teaser ends with text appearing on a black screen: “Steve Rogers will return in Avengers: Doomsday.” The release comes shortly after leaked footage of the trailer reportedly played in theaters during early screenings of Avatar: Fire and Ash. A Thor-focused teaser featuring Chris Hemsworth has also allegedly surfaced online. Despite Evans' previous comments about being “happily retired” and not returning as Captain America, The Hollywood Reporter reported last year that he would return for the film. After completing his time-travel mission, Steve Rogers returned to the main MCU timeline as an elderly man and passed the shield to his former sidekick, Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), who went on to become the new Captain America.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After trailers playing in theaters last week seemed to confirm that Chris Evans' Steve Rogers will return in 2026's Avengers: Doomsday, Marvel finally released the footage to those of us who haven't bought a ticket for Avatar: Fire And Ash yet. Otherwise, the clip doesn't reveal too much. Steve pulls up to a country home aboard his bike, Triumph. Inside, he holds and gazes lovingly at an infant. Perhaps, or perhaps Steve has picked up a couple of babysitting gigs now that he's no longer Captain America. We will find out more in a year! Evans' return for Doomsday—which kicked off its hype cycle at San Diego Comic Con in 2024 by confirming another major Avengers actor would return—has been speculated for a while. “Yeah, no—happily retired!” Evans told Esquire the following month, lamenting that “This always happens. I mean, it happens every couple years—ever since Endgame. I've just stopped responding to it.” In June, Evans, who at the time was promoting Materialists with Fantastic Four star Pedro Pascal, told ScreenRant, “It's sad to not be back with the band, but I'm sure they're doing something incredible.” How sad could it have been, really?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first teaser trailer for Avengers: Doomsday is finally here. The short clip zooms in on a rural house, where Steve hops off his motorcycle. Inside, he cradles an infant in his arms and smiles. Avengers: Doomsday is directed by Joe and Anthony Russo and will feature Robert Downey Jr. in a new role as villain Doctor Doom. Evans was last seen at the end of 2019's Avengers: Endgame. His character passed the Captain America torch to Mackie's Sam Wilson, who led this year's Captain America: Brave New World. Steve, meanwhile, traveled back in time to create a life with Hayley Atwell's Peggy Carter. The actor previously asserted that he had concluded his Marvel run. After several outlets reported he was planning to return as Steve Rogers, Evans told Esquire in January that the rumors were false. “I mean, it happens every couple years — ever since Endgame. 40 Years Later, Slick Rick Still Has a Story to Tell San Francisco Cop Corrects the Record on Shocking Comments Allegedly from Luigi Mangione's Mom Melissa Hortman Died in a Shocking Act of Political Violence.

It's an ode to both Harrison's love of gardening and his musical career, as he was known for lovingly tending to his Friar Park plots, often referring to himself as “just a gardener.” You can watch the folks at Nobody Told Me Studios and Tye Down Pictures and a team of 20 stop-motion artists bringing Wolfhard's vision to life in the exclusive clip. “[But] I'm not the one every day moving everything.” The video was executive-produced by George's son, Dhani Harrison, and David Zonshine. 40 Years Later, Slick Rick Still Has a Story to Tell San Francisco Cop Corrects the Record on Shocking Comments Allegedly from Luigi Mangione's Mom Melissa Hortman Died in a Shocking Act of Political Violence. “Finn is one of the sweetest and most talented people I know of his generation, and he is the perfect person to direct a video for my dad,” Dhani said in a release. “My dad would have loved this, and I hope his wonderful, creative, heartfelt ideas help this song reach another generation.” This year, Wolfhard starred in the final season of Stranger Things, as well as The Legend of Ochi, a cuddly creature feature that also boasted some particularly incredible practical effects. The new edition was remixed by engineer Paul Hicks, who also did the 2019 All Things Must Pass box set, with a bonus disc of alternate takes. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sean Ono Lennon says it's possible that future generations could lose touch with the music and legacy of The Beatles, a thought he admits once felt unimaginable. Speaking on CBS Sunday Morning, the 50-year-old musician and producer reflected on his role as a steward of his late father John Lennon's legacy — a responsibility he says has increasingly come into focus as culture, technology and listening habits continue to shift. Enrique Iglesias Welcomes Fourth Child With Anna Kournikova: 'My Sunshine' Nicki Minaj Isn't a 'Good Role Model' for Young Black Women, Charlie Kirk Said in Resurfaced 2024 Clip I do, actually,” Sean said when asked if he believed younger generations could one day move on from the Beatles' catalogue. Sean explained that while he has “technically” stepped into the role of caretaker for his father's work, following decades of stewardship by his mother Yoko Ono, he views the legacy as something shared with the wider world. “I'm just doing my best to help make sure that the younger generation doesn't forget about The Beatles and John and Yoko. The Beatles — completed by Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and the late George Harrison — remain one of the most influential acts in music history, with a catalogue that reshaped popular music from Please Please Me (1963) through Let It Be (1970). “My parents gave me so much that I think it's the least I can do to try and support their legacy in my lifetime,” he said. Sean has continued to engage with his parents' work in contemporary ways. In 2023, he and filmmakers Dave Mullins and Brad Booker released the animated short War Is Over!, inspired by John and Yoko's 1971 song “Happy Xmas (War Is Over).” The film won win an Academy Award for short film (animated) in 2024.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A source in Canada confirmed that as of earlier Monday evening, the full original 60 Minutes episode, including the “Inside CECOT” segment that was pulled at the last minute, was available via Global TV's streaming platform. How to Stream Part Two of 'Everybody Loves Raymond' Reunion Special Bari Weiss On Decision to Preempt '60 Minutes' Story: "It Was Not Ready" “I held a 60 Minutes story because it was not ready,” she told staff Monday morning. “While the story presented powerful testimony of torture at CECOT, it did not advance the ball—the Times and other outlets have previously done similar work. The public knows that Venezuelans have been subjected to horrific treatment at this prison. That's my north star and I hope it's yours, too.” The result is that the segment is now widely available on platforms like X and YouTube from viewers posting their videos of the segment, though copyright complaints from CBS could temper that enthusiasm. “In my view, pulling it now—after every rigorous internal check has been met is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.” Weiss told staff that she is serious about getting the story on air once her concerns have been addressed, though Global TV's move will now let viewers see whatever changes CBS makes to the final version.
