                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eric Adams, who will be New York's mayor for eight more days, on Friday unveiled the city's new “blockchain plan,” a 61-page document intended to guide agencies as they investigate new uses of the distributed-ledger technology best known for undergirding cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. According to a press release, the plan also expands on an executive order Adams signed last October establishing an Office of Digital Assets and Blockchain Technology. The office is led by Moises Rendon, who for more than a year-and-a-half had served as a digital assets and blockchain policy adviser in the city's Office of Technology and Innovation. The city's plan notes that blockchain is a “fast-growing technology attracting intense global interest and development,” and points to the technology's marriage with bitcoin and a recent rise in the number of new “digital assets.” The plan frames blockchain as an “emerging technology” that must be studied before the city can “chart a responsible path forward.” (A contact for Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani didn't immediately respond to an email asking whether the blockchain plan will continue under his administration.) The plan outlines several new initiatives, including a pilot project led by the city's Department of Environmental Protection that explores using blockchain to verify asbestos certification. No further details on the pilot are provided, except that the IT office will also “engage other interested agencies on potential applications such as digital credentials, permits and licenses, or broader data management efforts.” There are plans for an interagency working group, a new “information hub” to advance public information and consumer safety, and technical guidance for agencies, centered on issues of “equity, privacy and data security, access, public benefit.” Not addressed in the plan is why the nation's largest city is expending resources on a technology widely considered, outside of the crypto industry, to be of little utility. More than four years ago, this publication published an article noting the rapid decline of blockchain, a technology buoyed by the success of cryptocurrency, but that never found widespread use in state or local government offices. Blockchain occasionally crops up in association with digital identity software being considered by state agencies, or is proposed as a way to register historic locations. The California Department of Motor Vehicles last year used blockchain to record 42 million vehicle titles, in hopes of reducing fraud and providing owners more autonomy when selling their vehicles. In 2023, the Rhode Island Department of Commerce, led by Secretary Elizabeth Tanner, experimented with using blockchain to replace an outdated paper process for applying for business licenses. The department, which is no longer led by Tanner, did not respond to an email asking for an update on the success of that project. Early iterations of mobile voting software used blockchain, only to be handily dismantled by security researchers. Blockchain has been tried for many other uses, such as recording land deeds or streamlining disaster-response processes in the federal government, though the value added by blockchain has never been obvious. In 2022, more than 1,500 software engineers and other technologists signed a letter letting Congress know they'd had enough of blockchain technologies, which “facilitate few, if any, real-economy uses.” technologies that serve the public must always have mechanisms for fraud mitigation and allow a human-in-the-loop to reverse transactions; blockchain permits neither.” Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University in Washington, D.C., said blockchain is a performative gimmick that won't seem to go away, despite the clear message sent by the technology's many detractors. Blockchain's conceit is largely the same as the cryptocurrencies that it enables: Centralized power, like that of banks, has led to levels of corruption, unfairness and institutional lethargy that do not serve the interests of the masses — but decentralized and transparent technologies can usher in a new paradigm in which people are empowered to transact on their own terms. So then, just use the simple database that's quick and efficient.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kolkata: The All India Fair Price Shop Dealers' Federation (AIFPSDF) has threatened to launch a nationwide movement amid concerns that the Centre may introduce the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), or e-rupee, enabling beneficiaries to redeem entitlements at fair price shops through a cashless, Aadhaar-authenticated system. The Government of Gujarat has recently sent a concept note to the Government of India through its Secretary of the Department of Food & Public Distribution on issuance of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) / e-Rupee for public distribution system in Gujarat, which will enable the beneficiaries with a cashless, Aadhaar-authenticated redemption at ration shops. As proposed, the CBDC will be issued in the form of Digital Food Coupons. There will be a total of 7 such coupons for a beneficiary every month- two for central commodities and five for state  commodities. The five coupons for state commodities meant for supply of Tur Dal, edible oil, salt and sugar at subsidised prices from state exchequer of the Gujarat government. “The  implementation of this project is a method to implement Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)  will  lead to the abolishment of ration dealers and so we will oppose this DBT and coupon system tooth and nail, “ said Biswambhar Basu, national general secretary of AIFPSDF. The Federation will wait till the Budget Session of  the Parliament next year and if the scheme is implemented a nationwide movement will be launched. The  Federation will  also file a special leave petition (SLP) at the apex court in this matter, anticipating that the concept note will be implemented by the centre. All rights reserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Bitmine continues its Ethereum accumulation journey, are Tom Lee's bullish price predictions getting closer? Tom Lee, chairman of Bitmine, has remained heavily bullish on Ethereum's long-term price, recently predicting it could surge as high as $62,000 — but is it possible?

Earn rewards worth up to 5,000 USDT on your first deposit According to on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, Bitmine's most recent purchase on Dec. 22 saw the company acquire  13,412 ETH for approximately $40.6 million. “We are making rapid progress towards the ‘alchemy of 5%' and we are already seeing the synergies borne from our substantial ETH holdings,” Lee said. “In 2025, we're tokenizing everything — stocks, bonds, real estate — and Wall Street is going to create products on a smart contract platform,” he said. “The vast majority of that infrastructure is being built on Ethereum.” Tom Lee says #ethereum  is going to $62,000 within a few months pic.twitter.com/2QY9LXsOQH With Bitmine making progress toward accumulating 5% of the total Ethereum supply, CCN asked ChatGPT and Grok whether Lee's bullish price predictions could become reality. When asked to assess Ethereum's outlook, OpenAI's ChatGPT highlighted the asset's structural advantages. “Ethereum's long-term investment case is supported by network effects, institutional adoption, and its central role in tokenization infrastructure,” the model said. However, ChatGPT noted that price appreciation of the magnitude outlined by Lee would likely require sustained demand growth and a significant shift in risk sentiment. “In the near term, Ethereum may continue to face resistance. “Ethereum, Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies can achieve massive growth in short spans of time, but at some point predictions have to be grounded in realism,” it added. The model said large price projections often underestimate how long markets can remain indifferent. “People have been calling Ethereum ‘undervalued' for years,” Grok said. Grok added that institutional accumulation alone is not enough to drive prices higher. “One company buying millions of ETH doesn't magically flip market structure,” it said. While Grok acknowledged Ethereum's role in tokenization, it cautioned against extrapolating that into near-term price action. “Ethereum can be the backbone of finance and still trade sideways. According to CCN's analysis, Ethereum's recent lack of upside follow-through has coincided with weakening on-chain and derivatives indicators. “The Seller Exhaustion Constant has fallen to 0.027, its lowest level since June,” said CCN analyst Victor Olanrewaju. “If current conditions persist, Ethereum could drift toward the $2,740 region,” he said. However, he added that a slowdown in selling pressure may “allow Ethereum's price to reassert itself above the upper boundary of the descending channel.” “In that scenario, a move toward $3,163 would come back into focus, though such a breakout would require confirmation from momentum and volume,” Olanrewaju concluded.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Based on Sega's Code of Jokers arcade TCG, the new title was planned to launch outside of Japan in late 2025. Developer Jokers, a company founded by former Sega staff, announced on December 22 that it has halted development of Code of Jokers Evolutions, a blockchain mobile game it had been working on under official license from Sega. Originally announced in March this year, Code of Jokers Evolutions was unveiled as a digital card game based on Sega's arcade trading card game IP. The arcade version of Code of Jokers was in circulation from 2013 to 2019, and it received a short-lived mobile version called Code of Jokers Pocket (also developed by Sega) in 2017, which ended services the following year. While it happened a bit later than overseas, Japan's NFT game fad appears to be fizzling out even in the eyes of the people making them. As mentioned, Jokers is a game company founded by former Sega staff Yasuhiro Nishiyama (producer of the original Code of Joker, Sangokushi Taisen) and Wataru Sato (Bakugan producer at Sega Toys).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Residential News » Miami Edition | By WPJ Staff | December 23, 2025  7:27 AM ET Digital currencies like Bitcoin, long associated with volatile trading and speculative finance, are increasingly being examined for a more utilitarian role in one of the world's oldest and least digitized asset classes: real estate. From cross-border property purchases to fund settlements and rental payments, proponents argue that blockchain-based currencies could eventually streamline transactions that today remain slow, fragmented, and costly. Real estate is uniquely exposed to the shortcomings of legacy financial infrastructure. Property deals often involve multiple intermediaries, manual escrow processes, jurisdictional compliance hurdles, and international wire transfers that can take days or weeks to settle. For global investors, foreign-exchange costs and capital controls further complicate participation. These inefficiencies have prompted a new wave of experimentation around digital currencies designed specifically for real estate rather than for general consumer payments. One emerging concept is the use of stablecoins--digital tokens pegged to traditional currencies--as settlement rails for property transactions. In theory, a dollar-backed stablecoin could function as digital cash, allowing buyers, sellers, lenders, and service providers to move funds instantly, with full auditability and without exposure to price volatility. A frequently cited example is TransactionCOIN, an emerging USD-backed stablecoin designed explicitly for real estate transactions. Unlike cryptocurrencies that fluctuate in value, TransactionCOIN would be fully collateralized by U.S. dollar reserves and used primarily for payments, escrow, and settlement across the real estate lifecycle. In practice, that could mean earnest money deposits placed on-chain, closing proceeds released automatically once contractual conditions are met, or rent and mortgage payments settled in real time rather than through batch-processed banking systems. Cross-border real estate investing--already a multi trillion-dollar market--could be materially altered if capital could move frictionlessly while remaining denominated in dollars. Stablecoins also intersect with another developing trend: the tokenization of real estate assets. Tokenization refers to representing ownership interests, debt, or income streams as digital tokens that can be issued, traded, and settled on blockchain networks. While the concept has attracted attention for years, liquidity and settlement challenges have limited adoption. That is where projects such as RealEstateCOIN, an AI-managed global real estate token fund proposed by World Property Bank, come into focus. The fund concept envisions institutional-grade exposure to tokenized real estate debt, equity, credit, and derivative instruments across global markets. In this model, a stablecoin such as TransactionCOIN serves as the connective tissue of the ecosystem, acting as the native settlement currency for buying and selling RealEstateCOIN and other institutional-grade real estate tokens, distributing rental income or dividends, and redeeming investor capital. By standardizing settlement around a single digital dollar, proponents argue the system can reduce operational complexity while enhancing transparency for both investors and regulators. Mortgage finance, private credit and real estate debt markets represent another potential use case. Regulatory clarity varies widely by jurisdiction, and real estate transactions are among the most heavily regulated financial activities in the world. Instead of speculative trading, the focus is moving toward digital infrastructure -- how money moves, settles, and is accounted for in the world's largest asset class: Real Estate. World Property Bank founder Michael Gerrity says, "If that shift continues, digital currencies may not replace traditional real estate finance overnight. But they could quietly become the rails beneath it, digitally moving trillions of dollars annually and reshaping how property is bought, sold, leased, financed, and financially managed on a global scale."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Payments, remittances, savings, and online services now rely on blockchain tools in everyday settings. Inflation pressure, currency controls, and a mobile-first population have started pushing practical use cases into the open. Some countries now stand out for infrastructure, policy clarity, and user participation. These markets offer a useful snapshot of where crypto activity is gaining durable traction across the continent. Nigeria remains Africa's most active crypto market by volume and participation. Peer-to-peer trading is deeply integrated, driven by currency volatility and a demand for faster payments across borders. A good deal of Nigerians use stablecoins for commerce, freelance income, and international transfers. Local developers also play a role, building wallets and blockchain analytics tools. Crypto-enabled entertainment platforms show how tokens are used outside traditional finance, with users prioritising practical benefits such as faster deposits, quicker withdrawals that do not rely on bank processing times, and transaction records that can be verified on-chain. A Bitcoin casino list typically highlights these payment patterns across platforms, reinforcing why Nigerian users often associate crypto with speed, accessibility, and fewer intermediaries. In that sense, leisure use cases sit alongside remittances and everyday payments rather than outside them. Despite regulatory caution, activity has continued through licensed fintechs and peer networks. Instead, they pushed users toward decentralized tools and regulated payment providers willing to work within new rules. Authorities classify crypto assets as financial products, bringing exchanges and service providers under oversight. Major exchanges operate openly, offering rand on-ramps, custody services, and tax reporting tools. Banks have also taken a more cooperative stance than in many neighboring countries. This has reduced friction for both retail users and professional traders. The country also benefits from a mature financial sector and strong technical talent. Blockchain startups tend to aim for enterprise adoption rather than informal peer-to-peer trade, which sets South Africa apart from other high-volume markets. Kenya's long history with mobile money has shaped its crypto usage. Crypto tools often plug into this mindset rather than replace it. Stablecoins are very often used for cross-border commerce and freelance payments. Many developers in Nairobi's tech hubs experiment with blockchain for micro-payments, digital identity, and carbon credit tracking. These applications align with existing mobile habits, so the learning curve is lowered. Ghana's crypto market is a lot smaller than Nigeria's, but it still shows steady participation. The Bank of Ghana has explored digital currency pilots, thus signaling openness to new payment systems. While crypto regulation is still evolving, it is the absence of aggressive enforcement that has allowed platforms to operate with a relative level of stability. Adoption grows through education, fintech partnerships, and regional trade use cases, not rapid speculation. Demand for crypto is strong, fueled by inflation concerns and restrictions on foreign currency access. At the same time, regulation remains strict, and official approval is limited. Developers focus on privacy-focused tools and decentralized finance applications that operate without local custodians. Egypt's large population and technical talent pool suggest long-term potential, even if short-term growth faces constraints. Much depends on whether policymakers soften their stance or introduce clearer licensing pathways. This has created space for informal adoption, particularly among younger professionals and digital workers. Many Moroccan developers work for international crypto firms, contributing expertise even if local markets face limits. Crypto offers an alternative route for cross-border transfers, especially when traditional channels are slow or expensive. The country produces skilled engineers who contribute to both open-source blockchain projects and international startups. Local trading volumes are modest, although development activity is still worth noting. Early experiments with digital currencies and blockchain education programs have created keen awareness. There are several shared factors that explain why certain African nations show stronger crypto prospects. In countries where digital wallets and app-based payments are already normal, crypto tools are feeling like a natural extension and not a radical shift. This is particularly the case when local engineers are connected to global crypto firms and open-source projects. Finally, legal signals, whether they are formal frameworks or simply the space to experiment, are helping to determine how confidently platforms and users can and do engage with the technology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Yes, tokenization of real-world assets is rapidly becoming a key trend in modern finance. It turns physical or traditional assets like real estate, private credit, or government bonds into digital tokens that can be traded and managed more easily. For example, instead of needing to buy an entire property, you could own just a small fraction through tokens. This approach makes expensive or illiquid assets available to more people. It also creates new ways to trade, track, and manage investments without relying on slow or outdated systems. Deloitte projects that tokenized real estate in the United States could reach 4 trillion dollars by 2035. Private credit and tokenized U.S. treasuries are also among the leading categories right now. Several drivers explain why tokenization has become so important: Big players like Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon are taking part. Some governments are offering clearer rules or regulatory sandboxes that reduce legal risk for businesses. Advances in blockchain, smart contracts, custody, and interoperability are making tokenization more practical. Investors can buy fractions of assets, making them more accessible. Asset owners can also unlock capital that was tied up. Here are some of the most active areas for tokenization today: Here's a table that helps explain how tokenization changes the picture for investors and institutions: Institutions will use it to issue and trade assets in a more efficient way, while individuals gain new access to markets that were once out of reach. The biggest question is how regulation and secondary markets evolve. If standards, trust, and global rules catch up, then tokenization could reshape finance at scale. If you are in finance, marketing, or technology, tokenization is not just theory. It is already happening with bonds, credit, and real estate. For people interested in careers at the intersection of finance and AI, the Data Science Certification is useful to understand how data powers tokenized markets. If you are aiming to lead in business transformation, the Marketing and Business Certification will help you learn how to drive adoption of new technologies. Tokenization of real-world assets is not a distant future. From treasuries to real estate, billions of dollars in value are now tokenized and traded. The benefits are clear: more access, faster settlement, and greater transparency. Whether tokenization becomes the backbone of finance will depend on how quickly these hurdles are addressed. Our mission is to foster a collaborative environment where experts from diverse disciplines share their knowledge and promote varied use cases for a technologically advanced world.Blockchain Council is a private de-facto organization of experts and enthusiasts championing advancements in Blockchain, AI, and Web3 Technologies.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This follows multiple unsuccessful attempts on behalf of Bitcoin, as well as most other leading altcoins, to reclaim pivotal technical levels going into the last few days of 2025. As we reported yesterday, Bitcoin was trying to breach $90,000 on what seemed like the first sign of sustainable gains in the past few days. At the time of this writing, BTC has retraced by roughly 2.5% in the past 24 hours, currently trading around $87,5000. Naturally, almost $200 million of those were long traders, according to data from Coinglass. At this rate, Bitcoin is set to close the fourth quarter of 2025, charting a loss of around 22%. This would mark its weakest Q4 performance since the bear market in 2018. On-chain signals, macro pressure, as well as a notably fading speculative activity, all point to a fragile phase, at least in the short term. Ethereum also failed to sustain its price above $3,000 and is currently located at around $2,950, charting a loss similar to that of BTC. SOL, TRX, DOGE, ADA, XRP, BNB, and many others are down between 1.5% and 2%, while Zcash (ZEC) and Monero (XMR), both privacy-oriented coins, are down a more sustainable 6% on the day. Today's biggest gainer is Provenance Blockchain's HASH token, which is up 8.4% in the past 24 hours, followed by Rain (up 6.5%).
