                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Chelsea Hirschhorn started her company, she didn't buy into the expectations of how a "traditional founder" would approach the business, she says. However, her approach to building Frida was "a little bit more measured," she told CNBC's Julia Boorstin on the latest episode of the "CNBC Changemakers and Power Players" podcast. In fact, she considers it her superpower as a leader. "From a career perspective, I'm very ambitious," she said, but prior to starting her company, she described herself as "pretty risk-averse." Hirschhorn worked as a bankruptcy attorney before she launched Frida. In 2014, Hirschhorn launched Frida with the NoseFrida as its flagship product. It was a difficult decision for Hirschhorn to leave her previous career, she said, and she "needed a lot of encouragement" from her husband, who now serves as the president of Frida, to take the leap. Rapid growth was "never our objective," she said. That approach, along with a level of "comfort with bucking the trend," have been consistent threads in her story as a founder, Hirschhorn said – and it helped her build a "winning strategy" for the company. Hirschhorn described her current leadership style as "empathic, transparent" and "informed by the stage of life that I'm in," she told Boorstin. When Hirschhorn first launched Frida, she was "singularly focused on building the actual foundation for the business" and prioritized "achieving certain milestones" in Frida's growth trajectory, she said. Since then, her leadership philosophy has "evolved meaningfully," she told Boorstin. Today, she prioritizes empathy and strives to be "comprehensive in my understanding of different people's motivations." From the outside, those perks may not seem "that significant or meaningful," she said, but they represent her commitment to prioritizing well-being. Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ServiceNow will acquire cybersecurity startup Armis in a cash deal valued at $7.75 billion, the company said Tuesday. "This is about making a strategic move to accelerate growth, and we see the opportunity for our customers," CEO Bill McDermott told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Tuesday. "In this AI world, especially with the agents, you're going to need to protect these enterprises [because] every intrusion is a multimillion-dollar problem." ServiceNow said the deal is expected to close in the second half of next year, financed by a combination of cash and debt. The company has been on an acquisition spree in 2025 as it sought to accelerate growth, McDermott  said. ServiceNow announced a deal for AI agent platform Moveworks for $2.85 billion in March, and at the beginning of December, said it would acquire identity security platform Veza. "ServiceNow will have the only AI control tower that drives workflow, action and business outcomes across all of these environments," McDermott added. Bloomberg first reported earlier this month that Armis was exploring a possible $7 billion deal with ServiceNow. In November, the California-based company, which helps businesses protect internet-connected devices from cyber risks, said it had raised $435 million at a $6.1 billion valuation. At the time, co-founder Yevgeny Dibrov told CNBC that Armis was looking to go public in 2026 or 2027, but his main objective was to surpass $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. "The need for what Armis is doing and what we are building, in this cyber exposure management and security platform, is just increasing," he said, adding that there's "very unique and huge" demand for its tools. Many companies have opted to stay private for longer or get acquired as a turbulent initial public offering market has begun to rebound. Large companies such as Stripe and Databricks have found an influx of capital in private markets. In the age of AI, companies are spending more on cybersecurity to protect against increasingly sophisticated threats. This year has also been significant for major cybersecurity deals as companies look to enhance their threat protection capabilities. ServiceNow said Armis has topped $340 million in annual recurring revenue with 50% year-over-year growth, up from $300 million disclosed in August.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Department of Justice on Tuesday released another batch of files related to deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The latest documents appear to contain court records, emails, and some heavily or completely redacted files. In a Tuesday morning post to X, the DOJ announced the latest drop and claimed to have released "nearly 30,000 more pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein." "Some of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election," the post states. "To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already." Trump, who was largely unmentioned in the initial batch of files released by the DOJ on Friday, is a former friend of Epstein's and has long denied any wrongdoing related to the disgraced New York financier. Included in the latest batch from the DOJ is a handwritten letter Epstein wrote to convicted sex offender Larry Nassar from the Manhattan Correctional Center that appears to reference Trump. In the letter, which appears similar to a letter described in a 2023 report by the Associated Press, Epstein says, "Our president shares our love of young, nubile girls." "When a young beauty walked by he loved to 'grab snatch,' whereas we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system. The envelope is stamped three days after Epstein's jailhouse suicide. In the letter, Epstein tells Nassar, "As you know by now, I have taken the 'short route' home." Another reference to Trump appears in the latest release, in a 2020 email from an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York whose name is redacted. The prosecutor wrote that Trump "traveled on Epstein's private jet many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware)." Trump is listed as a passenger on at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996, according to the email. Trump and Epstein were the only two listed passengers on a 1993 flight, according to the email, and Trump, Epstein and a then-20-year-old (whose name is redacted) were the lone passengers on a second flight. "On two other flights, two of the passengers, respectively, were women who would be possible witnesses in a Maxwell case," the prosecutor wrote. Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite, was convicted in 2021 of procuring underage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. Last week, Maxwell filed a long-shot petition to vacate her conviction. When asked about Trump's appearance in the files, a White House spokesperson referred CNBC to the DOJ's statement. This is the second major release of files since Friday, when all documents were required under the Epstein Files Transparency Act to be made public with minimal redactions. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on Monday that he would force the Senate to vote on suing the DOJ for the full release of files. Khanna also threatened to begin impeachment proceedings against Bondi and Blanche if the DOJ continues to flout the law. A group of Epstein survivors on Monday joined the call for congressional oversight in a statement. Nineteen survivors signed the letter, which urged "hearings, formal demands for compliance, and legal action, to ensure the Department of Justice fulfills its legal obligations." "At the same time, numerous victim identities were left unredacted, causing real and immediate harm," the group wrote. The Justice Department has maintained that it is working to review and redact material required by the law to protect the privacy of Epstein's victims. "This is an arduous process, as each document and photograph must be individually reviewed by the DOJ and the Southern District of New York for potential redactions to protect victims or potential victims," the DOJ said in a fact sheet. Clinton's spokesman, Angel Urena, on Monday issued a statement urging the DOJ to "immediately release any remaining materials referring to, mentioning, or containing a photograph of Bill Clinton." "What the Department of Justice has released so far, and the manner in which it did so, makes one thing clear: someone or something is being protected. We do not know whom, what or why. Clinton has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Europe is pressing ahead with plans to ban Russian gas imports by the end of 2027, effectively capping Moscow's energy future in the region and leaving a bevy of stranded assets in its wake. The dual Nord Stream 1 and 2 subsea pipelines were early casualties of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the infrastructure being sabotaged in late 2022 and the latter pipeline — costing $11 billion to build and aimed at doubling cheap Russian gas flows to Germany — never being certified for use. There had been speculation that the major energy infrastructure could eventually be resurrected if, or rather when, the war between Russia and Ukraine ends and there's a peace agreement between the parties. However, talks to try to establish the grounds for a ceasefire have been moving at a snail's pace with neither side willing to cross "red lines" regarding the permanent surrender of territory, be it sovereign or occupied. Speaking with British news website UnHerd, Vance said Monday that while the U.S. is going to "try to get this thing solved," he "wouldn't say with confidence that we're going to get a peaceful resolution." Hopes of a deal have led to questions over what economic and energy links between Russia and the rest of the world could be re-established and, when it comes to Europe, whether a ceasefire could lead to a reintegration of Russian gas and the resurrection of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. Such a move would be highly contentious and divisive on the continent, given Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and attempts in the region to wean itself off cheaper Russian gas. Ukraine would be outraged by any move that benefited its invader, and Poland has called for the pipelines — one of which has never been used — to be "dismantled." The Nord Stream pipelines were specifically designed to circumvent Ukraine and avoid such fees, but the transit agreement could be one of many levers to use during negotiations if the tap is turned back on. The U.S. would likely baulk at the return of Nord Stream as it has hoped to muscle out Moscow and increase its market share of liquefied natural gas (LNG) sales to Europe. But Germany, which is directly connected to the pipeline and whose industries are struggling with high energy costs, might find the lure and return of Russian gas supplies hard to resist. The European Council and Parliament in December struck a provisional agreement on regulation to phase out imports of Russian gas. It is set to implement a full ban on liquefied natural gas (LNG) and pipeline gas imports from the end of 2026 and autumn 2027, respectively. The Danish Energy Agency in January granted permission for Nord Stream 2 to carry out preservation work on its damaged pipelines that are located within Denmark's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the Baltic Sea. The Danish Energy Agency has not received any such applications," it said. So you could have to cut a few miles of [the damaged] pipeline and replace it. But this could be done," he told CNBC in October. "It could easily cost $1 billion or something like that, but there's still one [pipeline] at operational strength so that could be used," he said. Asked if the pipelines — which are filled with stagnant gas — are being looked after currently, Vakulenko said: "They're not looked after at all." Whether Europe could resume purchases from Russia again is the big question. "Each of the Nord Streams [pipelines] were 55 million cubic meters. So that one remaining is 27.5 million cubic meters ... and that's probably the top of what Europe would be prepared to buy from Russia," Vakulenko said. He said that if there was a change of government in Russia and Putin was no longer president, Europe would be "quite willing to buy some Russian gas," but not if the same amounts it was buying before. "On the one hand, Europe, or at least there are parties [countries] in Europe, who wouldn't mind having at least some Russian gas in the European energy mix for a number of reasons, to not be too reliant on U.S. supply. Russia is the lowest cost supplier to Europe," he said. The Dutch Title Transfer Facility, Europe's main benchmark for natural gas prices, was double its pre-war prices in early 2025, per the IEA. If it becomes politically, ethically palatable, then there will be quite a lot of stimuli to do so, but that's again for the time when there is indeed some rapprochement between Russia and Europe, and that's [a] big 'if'," Vakulenko said. However, Tancrede Fulop, utilities and renewables analyst at Morningstar, told CNBC that it would be too difficult to reintegrate Russian gas, at least in the short term, because of the fresh European legislation. He noted, however, that the legislation does include some exceptions for Hungary and Slovakia in emergency situations. The policy shift was also rooted in a drive for energy independence after Russia's "weaponisation of gas supplies," the EU said. As a result, member states are likely to stay clear of an overreliance on one state going forward and instead invest in boosting overall domestic capacity. "Everybody thinks the energy crisis started with war in Ukraine, but it actually started in 2021," Fulop said, noting several drivers of a cold winter, low wind speeds, and therefore high gas consumption. This suggests that the move from Russia may have been intended to add pressure on Europe to pick up the pace with Nord Stream 2. On the other hand, "Russia is not in a very strong negotiating position," according to Vakulenko. "For Russia, that gas is a stranded resource. Russia has also looked to Asia as an alternative partner to Europe and has deepened ties with China via the Power of Siberia pipeline. Even if a peace deal with Ukraine is reached, "the message is quite alarming" around another potential conflict with Russia, Fulop said, given the flouting of European airspace in recent months. Ultimately, a renewed embrace of Russian gas "doesn't seem like the most realistic scenario." It helps that gas prices have fallen lately, he added, perhaps with market watchers pricing in a peace deal. "This is bearish for gas prices, positive for Europe, and that could offset the end of Russian gas imports," Fulop said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval of Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 pill gives the Danish pharmaceutical giant a head start over U.S. rival Eli Lilly, which has also filed for FDA approval for its oral weight loss drug orforglipron. "As the first oral GLP-1 treatment for people living with overweight or obesity, the Wegovy pill provides patients with a new, convenient treatment option that can help patients start or continue their weight loss journey," said Novo CEO Mike Doustdar in a statement late Monday. Wegovy's starting dose of 1.5 milligrams will be available in pharmacies and via select telehealth providers with savings offers for $149 per month, Novo said. Cash-paying patients can access it for the same price via President Donald Trump's direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx, according to the deal Novo Nordisk struck with his administration last month. Drug pricing has been top of mind this year as the U.S. looks to reduce the costs paid by consumers. The approval caps a turbulent year for Novo, which has been marked by multiple guidance cuts, mass layoffs, dramatic leadership shakeups, and a high-profile public bidding war against U.S. rival Pfizer. Novo's latest news "is a redemption for the investors," Danish Jyske Bank analyst Henrik Hallengreen Laustsen told CNBC, especially after a year in which shares halved in value as confidence faltered in Novo's ability to compete with Eli Lilly and others. "A welcome 'Christmas gift' for Novo investors — and for patients as New Year weight-loss resolutions typically kick in — given that Novo expects to launch the product in early January 2026," Hallengreen Laustsen said. "The Wegovy pill represents a key growth driver over the coming years and a critical competitive tool versus Eli Lilly, which is expected to receive approval for its oral obesity drug in March–April 2026," he said, adding that the Wegovy pill's approval covers both weight management and reducing the risk of adverse cardiovascular events such as strokes and heart attacks. Novo's clinical data looks "fantastic," Rajesh Kumar, who heads up European life Sciences and healthcare equity research at HSBC, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Tuesday. "Efficacy-wise, Novo's product, on the clinical trials at least, looks better," Kumar said. "Tolerability looks quite attractive compared to [Lilly's orforglipron]. The Wegovy pill has so far shown that it can help patients lose on average 16.6% of their body weight over about a year. "Novo actually might have an edge, and it will entirely depend on how they execute," he added. Even so, oral Wegovy must be taken on an empty stomach, and that might make it easier for doctors to prescribe orforglipron — which doesn't have the same restrictions — to patients because of compliance, Kumar noted. Novo has said it doesn't see oral Wegovy's food restriction as a significant barrier, as it can be taken in the morning on an empty stomach and then only requires patients to wait about 30 minutes before eating. Lilly reported positive findings from a maintenance trial where patients switched directly from taking the company's injection Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's rival shot Wegovy. This may help Lilly "keep a bit of market share," Kumar said. "That's the thing we have to watch," he added. Even as analysts and investors alike are mostly optimistic about the Wegovy pill U.S. launch, investors will be watching how Novo and its new pill will fare in relation to Lilly's oral version. A first-mover advantage is no guarantee for future sector dominance and success. Ozempic, which contains the same active ingredient semaglutide as Wegovy but is approved for treating type 2 diabetes, had a four-year head start on Lilly rival Mounjaro. Still, Lilly has now overtaken Novo in terms of U.S. prescriptions as Novo has struggled to meet demand, allowing a market for compounding pharmacies to flourish. — CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino also contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Raised in a humble home in Casablanca, Morocco, without running water or electricity, Ilham Kadri's journey to becoming CEO of Syensqo is a story of strength. My mother left the country, so my grandmother raised me," Kadri told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick on the "Executive Decisions" podcast. "She was told she had two exits in her life: the first to her husband's home and the second to the grave," Kadri explained. Kadri credits her grandmother with instilling the belief that education could be her "third exit" — a way out of poverty and into possibility. That mindset propelled her from public schools in Morocco to a scholarship at a French university, and eventually to a Ph.D. in macromolecular physical chemistry. "I never dreamed of being a CEO. For me, each step was already a victory," Kadri said. Her career spans global giants like Shell and Dow, and leadership roles at Diversey and Solvay, where she spearheaded a historic split of the 160-year-old company. After 11 years leading Solvay and then Syensqo, Kadri is ready for her next chapter. That's a great legacy as well," she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shares of South Korean firm Hanwha Ocean surged 10% Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the firm would help build new frigates for the country's Navy. Speaking at a press conference, Trump said that the warships will be built at the Hanwha Philly Shipyard in Philadelphia, acquired by the South Korean company in 2024, and in which it has pledged to invest $5 billion as part of South Korea's $150 billion shipbuilding pledge. The shipbuilding pledge is part of the broader U.S.-South Korea trade deal that saw tariffs reduced on South Korean exports to 15%, in exchange for a $350 billion investment pledge from Seoul, among other concessions. Hanwha Ocean is one of South Korea's major shipbuilding firms, having expertise in building commercial ships such as LNG carriers, as well as and military naval platforms including submarines and surface vessels. South Korean defense stocks have been on a roll this year, with major defense players such as Hanhwa Aerospace and Hyundai Rotem gaining over 170% and 270%, respectively year to date. Hanhwa Ocean has surged more 220% so far this year. Last week, the U.S. Navy announced the FF(X) class of ships — smaller combatant ships — which it said will complement larger, multi-mission warships and enhance operational flexibility around the globe. Secretary of the Navy John Phelan said the new frigate class would be part of Trump's envisioned "Golden Fleet." Trump on Monday stateside said that the U.S. Navy will build two new "Trump-class" battleships, and may expand the count to as much as 25 such ships. "Describing them as "the fastest, the biggest, and by far, 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built," the Trump-class battleships are envisioned to be equipped with hypersonic weapons, lasers, cruise missiles, and nuclear weapons, according to the U.S. President.
