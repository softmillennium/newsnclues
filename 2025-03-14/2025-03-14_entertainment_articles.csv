In a perfect storybook ending, Saturday’s premiere of the Disney live-action adaptation of Snow White would culminate in a familiar scrum on the red carpet in front of Hollywood’s El Capitan Theatre. Fans would scream and rubberneck. Entertainment reporters behind velvet ropes would ask frisky if innocuous questions of the movie’s stars, Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot. A braying horde of photographers would envelop the actresses in a strobe of flashbulbs. And the Entertainment Industrial Complex would fire on all pistons en route to a robust opening weekend for the $270 million musical-fantasy — which prerelease “tracking” estimates currently predict will take around $53 million over Snow White’s domestic release March 21.

But like the fairy tale’s Evil Queen, Disney announced plans a few days ago to put business as usual on the red carpet into an eternal sleep. After a cascading series of controversies that have sniped at Snow White almost from the moment the project was announced in 2021, the House of Mouse is scaling back the movie’s premiere to just bare essentials. Barred from attending: dozens of media outlets from around the world typically enlisted to interview cast and creatives on the carpet. The sound bites and hundreds of thousands of social-media impressions typically generated by such stop-and-greet interactions: canceled before they can ever be uttered. Save, that is, for a few perfunctory remarks attendees Zegler and Gadot are expected to give to a Disney-sanctioned “house crew” predisposed against asking hard questions.

Taken on its own merit, a movie premiere is pretty much incapable of dictating a film’s box-office fate. But according to rival studio executives and film marketers canvassed by Vulture, certain premieres can provide tantalizing indications of what’s to come. Disney’s red-carpet restrictions — taken in conjunction with the studio’s unorthodox decision to begin preselling tickets to Snow White via online retailers like Fandango and Atom Tickets a mere 11 days before its release — paint a picture of a movie in crisis. Under normal circumstances, an event title with almost a century of household-name recognition and a $450 million price tag (when you include prints and advertising costs) would begin selling tickets at least a month in advance. “That’s data. The only reason why they would start presales that late is they are worried people would write about, Oh, man, the tickets are on sale and they’re not doing well,” an executive at another major studio says of Disney. “That and scrapping the red carpet tell me a story. It’s almost like they’re running away from the movie. And at this budget, that’s kind of crazy.”

Of course, few movies arrive onscreen with as much cultural Sturm und Drang as director Marc Webb’s megabudget contemporization of 1937’s epochal Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Its bibliography of outrage includes: anti-diversity outcry in 2021 that greeted the casting of mixed-race Latina actress Zegler as its titular heroine (whose skin is described as “white as snow” in the original animated film); Peter Dinklage lambasting the film’s perceived insensitivity toward little people — specifically, its “fucking backwards story about seven dwarfs living in a cave”; Zegler’s 2023 multi-interview characterization of the original Snow White as “extremely dated when it comes to the idea of women in roles of power” and “focus on a love story with a guy who literally stalks her” (she also noted, “People are making these jokes about ours being the PC Snow White, where it’s like, yeah, it is — because it needed that”); and seemingly conflicting views of the Israel-Hamas war by Zegler (who has described herself as “pro-Palestine”) and Gadot (who served in the Israeli Defense Forces and used her keynote speech at a recent Anti-Defamation League summit to denounce those not “condemning Hamas, but celebrating, justifying, and cheering on a massacre of Jews”).

Perhaps most problematic for Disney’s marketing apparatus, however, was then-23-year-old Zegler’s anguished reaction to President Trump’s election in November. “May Trump supporters and Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace,” she wrote in an Instagram post. “Fuck Donald Trump.” After supporters of the president responded on social media with postings such as, “Not taking my kids to see this trash after the statement you put out. @disney you need to do something about this” and “I hope you get no peace when this film BOMBS at the box office and streaming,” Zegler issued a hasty apology. But some rival studio executives ultimately feel the Mouse House made a tactical mistake in casting the outspoken Romeo + Juliet actress and failing to rein her in. “The reality is Rachel Zegler should not be playing Snow White,” one tells me.

Snow White makes theatrical landfall at something of a corporate inflection point for Disney. Last month’s Marvel Cinematic Universe entry Captain America: Brave New World has underperformed financially, becoming one of the long-running franchise’s lowest-earning titles. Also last month, Disney decided to move the theatrical release date for its Pixar animated sci-fi adventure Elio back one week — to June 20 from June 13 — so it would not compete head-on with the opening of Universal/DreamWorks’ live-action remake of How to Train Your Dragon. Industry insiders are, of course, parsing those happenings for meaning, recalling a time not so long ago when each new Marvel release went reliably and unquestioningly blockbuster and other studios moved off of money-minting juggernaut Pixar’s chosen drop dates — never vice versa. “Disney has been the indomitable studio that either won big or won huge,” our first executive says. “Now they’re not winning as much. Sometimes they have hits, sometimes they don’t. That’s how much their brand has suffered. They’re just like every other studio.”",vulture
https://vulture.com,What Happened with Sean “Diddy” Combs Sex-Trafficking Case Today,https://www.vulture.com/article/diddy-sex-trafficking-case-arraignment-update.html,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 16:20:00 GMT","Photo: Kevin Winter/Getty Images

When Sean “Diddy” Combs walked into a Manhattan federal courtroom just after 2 p.m. on Friday for an arraignment on revamped charges in his sex-trafficking case, the rapper looked dramatically different from his prior court proceedings. His hair and beard were silvery gray, and he appeared to have gained weight since his arrest last summer. Despite the change in appearance, Combs carried himself with the nonchalance of a man who was not staring down decades behind bars. When Judge Arun Subramanian asked Combs whether he wanted the new indictment to be read aloud in court, the rapper responded, “I’m fine.” He pleaded not guilty to the new indictment against him.

In the revamped indictment released on March 6, Combs was accused of controlling some employees by forcing them to work grueling hours with minimal sleep and using threats to keep them in check. Back in late January, prosecutors listed two more accusers, identified as “Victim-2” and “Victim-3,” who claim to have been lured into sex acts by the disgraced music mogul. They also said that “on one occasion, Combs dangled a victim over an apartment balcony.” With the help of his staff, Combs allegedly used his powerful business empire to create a “criminal enterprise” that enabled his alleged manipulation of women into sexual performances with male sex workers. Civil lawsuits against Combs also accuse him of sexual abuse against boys and men.

Combs, 55, was arrested on September 16, 2024, amid numerous accusations of sexual abuse and trafficking. In court papers and proceedings, prosecutors have detailed what they describe as a decadeslong history of alleged misconduct. They claim the Bad Boy Records founder “abused, threatened, and coerced women and others around him to fulfill his sexual desires, protect his reputation, and conceal his conduct.” Prosecutors allege that Combs kept women under his thumb with drugs and threats, enabled by his vast financial resources. After these women fell into his deceptive orbit — frequently under the belief that their interactions with him constituted a romantic relationship — Combs purportedly forced them to partake in events called “freak offs,” prosecutors said. These freak offs amounted to “elaborate and produced sex performances that Combs arranged, directed, masturbated during, and often electronically recorded.” Cassie Ventura — whose now-settled November 2023 lawsuit against Combs, her former partner, set the stage for others to take legal action against him and, ultimately, the criminal case — is known as “Victim-1” in the federal proceedings. Combs, who has been jailed since his arrest, maintains his innocence.

With a trial fast approaching — openings are scheduled to start on May 12 — Combs’s attorneys are fighting a key piece of prosecution evidence in Ventura’s allegations: a video of Combs attacking her in a hotel hallway. Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo claimed that CNN, which first published the footage, had sped up and spliced it in a misleading manner. “It’s a piece of evidence that is deceptive, that is not in accordance with the actions that took place,” Agnifilo said. “It’s a deceptive piece of evidence; it’s a piece of evidence that might have changed.” Agnifilo also claimed CNN had deleted the original footage, though the network has denied these claims. Subramanian suggested the defense and prosecution discuss their concerns surrounding the video.

If Agnifilo did show prosecutors that the recording had been sped up, the judge suggested, “a possible solution would [be] to slow it down and put it in the right sequence … such that what went in before the jury would be, in your view, an accurate portrayal of what the video was.” The judge also remarked, “I’m hearing an openness to coming to a compromise to avoid some of the issues that you’ve raised.”

The afternoon’s proceeding wrapped in a little less than an hour and, aside from the not-guilty plea, was largely confined to housekeeping matters such as filings. Combs stood by in court for the remainder of his arraignment and blew kisses to his family as he left.",vulture
https://vulture.com,Chappell Roan’s Silliness Is Sincere On ‘The Giver’,https://www.vulture.com/article/chappell-roan-the-giver-review.html,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 16:25:46 GMT","Photo: Will Heath/NBC via Getty Images

Chappell Roan doesn’t do things halfway. She spent four hours getting her body painted so she could dress as the Statue of Liberty at last year’s Governors Ball. She brought out a massive pony to perform her hit “Pink Pony Club” on the Grammys stage. She even showed up in full clown makeup for her acoustic NPR Tiny Desk set. So when Roan decided to release a country song, she wasn’t going to just throw a banjo in the mix and call it a day. “The Giver” is the genuine article — a bonafide honky-tonk stomper laden with country references. It’s also a pivot that goes deeper than just another singer doing a genre bit.

“The Giver” sounds like a lesbian Shania Twain single: the crisply recorded fiddle, the throttle of guitar and drums, the sexual mischief. That sound got Twain in trouble in the ‘90s, when critics complained she was leaning too far into pop, but in 2025’s landscape, it’s legibly country. While it’s inoffensive enough to appeal to pop fans (just like Twain’s music), listeners don’t have to squint to hear the touchpoints. In fact, Roan’s leaning into them to her advantage, queering the rote masculine country references and taking to task the men who leave their girlfriends with unfinished business. “Girl, I don’t need no lifted truck / Revvin’ loud to pick you up / ‘Cause how I look is how I touch,” she sings, her voice warbling like a young Natalie Maines.

“The Giver” just as easily could’ve gone full parody. It sure reads like one: a lesbian come-on country song playing off dom-sub roles. Roan toed the line in the winking rollout of the track, posting billboards of her as a dentist (“Dental dams aren’t just for dentists”), a plumber (“Showing crack is back”), and an HVAC repair person (“Your wife’s hot”). But this is the work of someone who cares about country. Roan being raised in small-town Missouri is key to her mythology, yet she’s never centered it as much as she does on “The Giver.” In a statement, she framed the song as a tribute to the sound of her childhood: “I grew up listening to it every morning and afternoon on my school bus and had it swirling around me at bonfires, grocery stores and karaoke bars.” As the songwriter’s cliché goes, “The Giver” isn’t just for the queer kids growing up in less-accepting parts of the country, it’s by one of them — a singer who’s figured out how to take something good from their upbringing and make it their own.

After Roan first performed “The Giver” on Saturday Night Live last November, fans wondered if she might have a whole country album up her sleeves; she’s since assured them this is a one-off exploration. But “The Giver” isn’t all that different from Roan’s past work. She’s been bridging sincerity and silliness since “Pink Pony Club,” her campy ode to gay havens. There are genuine feelings underneath even her most fun songs: the first-date jitters of “Red Wine Supernova,” the female empowerment of “Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl” and “Femininomenon.” It’s the same formula that makes a good country song.",vulture
https://vulture.com,Netflix’s The Electric State Is a $320 Million Piece of Junk,https://www.vulture.com/article/review-netflixs-electric-state-an-expensive-piece-of-junk.html,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 14:00:50 GMT","Millie Bobby Brown in The Electric State. Photo: Netflix/Everett Collection

Before they were given the keys to the Marvel kingdom, Joe and Anthony Russo were known primarily for their comedy work in movies like You, Me, and Dupree (2006) and shows such as Arrested Development and Community. Their levity made for a good fit with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which had established its wisecracking tone with Jon Favreau’s first Iron Man and developed it further with Joss Whedon’s Avengers. For years, Marvel films worked this jocular-fantastic angle, in pointed contrast to the grimdark expectorations of their DC counterparts, who were drowning in a morass of runaway budgets and brooding slo-mo. Whatever we critics might have thought of the results (and for the record, I enjoyed the Russos’ Captain America movies, and quite liked Avengers: Infinity War, while not caring much for Avengers: Endgame), the Russos were able captains of the colorful Marvel ship, which they steered toward greater and greater financial returns.

Watching their turgid new Netflix sci-fi epic, The Electric State, I began to wonder where those Russo brothers went. It wasn’t the first time I’d asked myself this question; the thought had also occurred while watching their inert and stone-faced 2022 Netflix thriller, The Gray Man. How did these filmmakers who so confidently walked the fine tonal line of Marvel’s most ambitious period manage to find themselves bogged down in such lumbering humorlessness? Okay, The Gray Man was merely grim and lifeless, a forgettable action flick; those happen. But The Electric State begs for playfulness, dynamism, some sense of dash and charm. Honestly … it could use the comic expertise of the Joe and Anthony Russo of 20 years ago. It’s an action fantasy built on silliness. Without a light touch, it becomes actively annoying.

The film, (very) loosely based on Simon Stålenhag’s 2018 retro-sci-fi illustrated book of the same name, takes place in an alternate 1990s in which humanity has gone to war with a race of robots. But they’re not just any old robots: Initially introduced by Walt Disney in the 1950s, these robots worked for decades as task-specific servants — they delivered our mail, cooked our food, built our houses — but then grew sentient and demanded their freedom. This led to protests, uprisings, peace agreements, then an apocalyptic, full-on war. (The film’s intro gives us fun clips of Bill Clinton signing a treaty with a giant mechanical Mr. Peanut, the leader of the robot resistance.) Humans defeated the robots through a mechanized drone army controlled remotely by people wearing headsets. After the war, that technology, developed by a painfully pretentious guru named Ethan Skate (Stanley Tucci), was sold to the public as a way of keeping them sedated and immersed in imaginary worlds. The surviving robots, meanwhile, got sent to a giant prison colony somewhere in the deserts of the American Southwest.

The story follows Michelle (Millie Bobby Brown), a juvenile delinquent and foster kid who lost her parents and her beloved genius younger brother, Chris (Woody Norman), in a car accident some years ago. One night a robot version of Kid Cosmo, a once-popular cartoon that Chris loved, sneaks into her house and insists that it is her brother, or at least his consciousness, being controlled from an indeterminate location. Michelle and Cosmo set off on a journey to locate Chris’s physical body. To do so, they must join forces with Chris Pratt’s John Keats (!), a former soldier turned black marketeer, who with his trusty construction-robot partner, Herman (voiced by Anthony Mackie), smuggles goods out of the forbidden robot zone. Because robots aren’t allowed to interact with humans, they are pursued every step of the way by drone soldiers, in particular Colonel Bradbury (Giancarlo Esposito), a relentless, robot-hating war hero known as the Butcher of Schenectady.

This is, to put it delicately, a ridiculous premise, not the least because the robots that our heroes come in contact with aren’t exactly alien androids but rather highly specific branded figures who’ve adapted themselves beyond their initial uses. There is, of course, the aforementioned Mr. Peanut (voiced by Woody Harrelson). There’s a letter carrier called Penny Pal (Jenny Slate) that can rip people’s hearts out. There’s a gruff and garrulous baseball pitching and hitting machine called Pop Fly (Brian Cox). There’s a mechanical magician named Perplexo (Hank Azaria). There’s a huge runaway football helmet (Rob Gronkowski). There’s a sentient barber’s chair armed with scissors, and a giant, piano-playing taco.

You’d think something like this would be somewhat funny. And while there are wisecracks and blandly humorous asides here and there (most of them delivered by Pratt, who to his credit does give it his discount Harrison Ford best), the Russos mostly play it straight. So straight, in fact, that they seem afraid of the whole thing becoming too much of a comedy. Are they running from their former selves? Did they buy into criticisms of the MCU as being too jokey? Maybe it’s just that they’ve got vague metaphors about intolerance and technological repression and mass-hypnosis to deliver, and a brutal robot slaughter to depict, and weak tears to jerk. (One also wonders if there’s a personal angle to this tale of Disney-anointed subordinates who become self-aware and seek to break their chains and be taken seriously.)

Regardless, the filmmakers have clearly invested all their energies in making this world feel real, in trying to make us care for this absurd cast of characters. That might be an admirable aim, but it’s also a disastrously misguided one — so disastrous, it made me consider giving Adam Sandler’s video-games-come-to-life sci-fi fantasy, Pixels, another shot. To be clear, Pixels is not a good movie, but at least it embraced its inherent goofiness. If nothing else, Sandler would have understood the basic comedy of a line like “You broke the treaty, Mr. Peanut!” instead of trying to play it as a moment of disturbing violence.

Meanwhile, the buoyancy Millie Bobby Brown brought to her Netflix-produced Enola Holmes films has completely vanished. She’s proven herself to be a good actress (I even liked her in the gritty fantasy Damsel, another Netflix production), but she can’t do tearful melodrama in the midst of a story this stupid. Who can? Watching Brown try to take the role of Michelle seriously — the tough rebel, made tender by a reconnection to her tragic past — one feels a weird twinge of secondhand embarrassment for the performer, as if the whole film had been designed as a dry, cruel joke on her.

There’s something truly off-putting about The Electric State’s palette of junk and colorless branded robots. By trying to give this world such weight and grit, the filmmakers have doubled down on its ugliness. The Russos’ functional visual style isn’t enough to bring any real creativity into this universe. (Do they know any other way to introduce a character besides an ominous close-up of their feet? Can they shoot two kids doing a fancy handshake without resorting to eight separate cuts?) For all the specificity of the designs involved, the action scenes lack inspiration and invention, seeing as how they’re mostly tedious and programmed fights between robots and drones. Yes, Penny Pal rains letters down on her opponent, and yes, Pop Fly shoots balls out at them — but these are just ideas, and the confrontations themselves are devoid of charge or conviction. One longs for the sinewy action of a Transformers flick, or the imaginative gravity of something like the first Pacific Rim. Or, hell, the CGI-fueled long takes of the Russos’ own Avengers pictures. Even Real Steel pulled off the whole discarded-robot thing reasonably well. There are ways to make this kind of stuff work, but it takes more than just a massive effects budget.

The Electric State reportedly cost $320 million to produce, which would make it one of the most expensive films ever made. To be fair, there’s nothing wrong with people getting paid, and such budget matters should be mostly irrelevant to the matter of whether we enjoy a movie or not. (I say this as someone who happily paid full price to own Waterworld on 4K last year, and who will follow George Miller to the ends of the earth.) At the same time, the thought does cross one’s mind while watching this film: They paid $320 million for this? Didn’t anyone at Netflix try to stop these people? Maybe studio notes aren’t always such a bad thing. Yes, it does cost money to make all those giant robots look real, to cover them in soot, and to get them to trudge convincingly across Monument Valley. And yes, actors cost money, even if they’re just doing voices. And yes, the film has an out-of-nowhere pop soundtrack that includes the Flaming Lips’ “Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots” and an orchestral version of Oasis’s “Wonderwall.” But there’s something genuinely absurd about spending that much money to make a movie look this bad.",vulture

This list was originally published on March 15, 2019. It has been updated to include additional episodes. Lucky you.

St. Patrick’s Day is a holiday unlike any other. While the core meaning of a lot of Christian holidays is lost over time, giving way to feasts of capitalism and overindulging, St. Patrick’s Day has kinda always been a little about that. Historically, one aspect of the celebrations was that the Lent restrictions on alcohol would be lifted for the day. Now, many revelers take that to the furthest degree, spending the day wearing green, drinking themselves into oblivion, and not spending too much time thinking about Saint Patrick or the meaning of Irish identity. Its closest relative is Halloween, another holiday rooted in tomfoolery and chaos that unites and divides us in equal measure.

These days, the meaning of the holiday is that chaos. But if you’d rather watch the wild antics from afar than head to your local pub and drain it of cheap, we’ve got your solution — 11 of the best St. Patrick’s Day TV episodes, many of which feature magic and hedonism to enjoy vicariously.

It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, “Charlie Catches a Leprechaun” (Season 11, Episode 8)

Despite its bar’s namesake (Paddy’s Pub), somehow Sunny got to season 11 before having a St. Patrick’s Day episode. In an otherwise pretty weak season, “Charlie Catches a Leprechaun” makes the most of Charlie’s endearing childlike curiosity and gullibility while Dennis tries to streamline the bar with a booze-selling wagon. After a man is caught pickpocketing, he tells Charlie he’s a leprechaun and Charlie believes him; setting glue traps to catch him, and going on a wild goose chase all over town with Mac to track him. Leaning into the more magical, whimsical aspects of the holiday, this episode sees the gang at their best instead of relying on tired tropes of drunkenness.

Available to stream on Hulu

Bob’s Burgers, “Flat-Top O’ the Morning to Ya” (Season 10, Episode 16)

Bob’s Burgers loves a holiday episode, but this is the first and only dedicated to St. Patrick’s Day. Here Linda and Teddy get a little too in the festive spirit. It starts innocently enough with an Irish-themed breakfast, but Bob is keen to keep things classy (and not green) in the restaurant. While Bob goes on his own side quest, Linda and Teddy egg each other on, starting out with dyeing some beer green and moving on to coloring … everything — ketchup, mustard, fries, burgers. But their enthusiasm doesn’t quite rub off on the customers, who’d rather not chow down green meat. In the end, they take it to the streets, bringing back all the drunk and hungry revelers to eat as many on-theme burgers as their hearts desire.

Available to stream on Hulu

The Afterparty, “High School” (Season 1, Episode 5)

Innovative murder-mystery comedy The Afterparty sees a group of ex-classmates under suspicion for the murder of an old friend. Everyone is a suspect, and there’s a lot of buildup to finding out what happened at a fateful St. Patrick’s Day party 15 years prior — especially when Chelsea (Ilana Glazer) makes a mysterious reference to an incident that made the entire school ostracize her. Diving into St. Patrick’s Day 2006, we see Walt (Jamie Demetriou) observing everything from his fly-on-the-wall-position at a house rager straight out of a teen movie: early-aughts fashion choices, lots of alcohol, and a painful reminder of the horrors of the high-school rumor mill. Bonus points if you can spot Walt lurking in the background of every shot.

Available to stream on Apple TV+

Sabrina the Teenage Witch, “Salem, the Boy” (Season 3, Episode 17)

St. Patrick’s Day (and Irish culture) is often associated with magic, gold, and leprechauns. In “Salem, the Boy,” Sabrina the Teenage Witch leans into that association, with Roland returning as a leprechaun. He gives Sabrina three golden coupons that grant her wishes; which, as we know, never goes well. She turns Salem into a man, but his essence is placed into a boy at school, leading to his attempts to take over the world. It’s a silly, fun episode with no real stakes but lots of ridiculousness and capers all round — perfect for the holiday.

How I Met Your Mother, “No Tomorrow” (Season 3, Episode 12)

In “No Tomorrow,” the How I Met Your Mother gang gives into the green hedonism of St Patrick’s Day after attempting to stay at home and have a board-game night. When Barney convinces Ted that the day has no consequences, Ted goes hog wild on behaving badly and finds that his bad deeds actually reward him: For one night only, he can live consequence-free, just like Barney. While Ted doesn’t feel too pleased with himself afterward, there is a lesson in here that every St. Paddy’s Day reveler seems to hope to be true: that your behavior on that night is, if not inconsequential, then forgivable.

Cheers, “Bar Wars VII: The Naked Prey” (Season 11, Episode 19)

Naturally, more than one show on this list takes place in a bar. In Cheers, the original bar-based comedy, they took the St Patrick’s Day episode hijinks as far as they could reasonably take them. In the episode, the bar is in an annual battle for sales against Gary’s Olde Towne Tavern — and loses. As in the Sunny episode, the stakes are more about business and pride than having wild, raucous fun — partly because, well, running a bar over St. Patrick’s Day probably isn’t that much fun, but it definitely brings in a lot of money. Catch this episode of Cheers and then spare a thought (and a big tip) for your local bartender if you go out this weekend.

30 Rock, “St Patrick’s Day” (Season 6, Episode 12)

30 Rock has special episodes for every holiday you could think of (shout out to “Leap Day”), and St. Patrick’s Day is no exception. Here, Liz’s hatred for the holiday, and a particular Irish American (her ex-boyfriend Dennis Duffy), comes to a head. She attempts to stay inside and avoid the revelry — something you might be trying to do, reader, even if it isn’t always possible. When Dennis shows up at her apartment claiming to be married, Liz tries to deal with it, all in her Liz Lemon way. Elsewhere, Jenna and Tracy each fight to be lead host of the St Patrick’s Day parade. It’s a perfect 30 Rock episode, full of arguments, megalomania, and general disdain, all heightened by the holiday.

Charmed, “Lucky Charmed” (Season 5, Episode 17)

Magic is a theme in a few of these episodes, but perhaps none more so than in Charmed. In “Lucky Charmed,” a less fun St. Paddy’s Day episode than others on the list, leprechauns get their turn to be more of a sympathetic force than a tricksy, difficult, troublesome one. A demon is out killing leprechauns and stealing their magic, so the Charmed Ones, as always, step in to help. The girls battle the evil magic and attempt to reverse the leprechauns’ legendary bad luck, proving St. Patrick’s Day doesn’t always have to go as badly as it has in the past.

The Office, “St Patrick’s Day” (Season 6, Episode 19)

Luckily, the holiday falls on a weekend this year, which means those so inclined can get in their partying without worrying about work. Not so in this classic episode of The Office, in which Dunder Mifflin’s employees are all stuck at work after being made to stay later by Jo. Eventually, Michael is forced to be direct with Jo and tell her he’s letting the employees leave. She relents, and we have a happy ending, as the employees get to enjoy their St. Patrick’s Day in a bar, as it was intended by St. Patrick himself.

Available to stream on Peacock

Home Improvement, “Desperately Seeking Willow” (Season 7, Episode 19)

St. Patrick’s Day should be a time for hedonism and letting loose, but in this Home Improvement episode, Wilson’s visiting niece, Willow, has a bit too much fun, failing to return home from the club and scaring everyone into sending out a search party. Meanwhile, there’s a St. Patrick’s Day celebration on Tool Time. It’s a holiday episode within a holiday episode — Tim and Al wear lots of green, the set is dressed in Guinness merch, there’s Irish-themed improvement projects, and Tim opens with an attempt at an offensive limerick. It’s an episode that proves that all you really need to celebrate holiday (even on a Tuesday) is to get into the spirit, which might just mean painting your toolbox green. Also don’t get lost.

2 Broke Girls, “And the Kilt Trip” (Season 3, Episode 19)

As with many festive and outgoing holidays, a lot of us more introverted types might find ourselves grudgingly trying to join the fun even if it’s not quite our bag. That’s what happens in 2 Broke Girls’ “And the Kilt Trip” when, seeking to fit in with Max and her other friends, Caroline joins everyone to get crazy at the St. Patrick’s Day parade.

https://vulture.com,Disturbed Just Damaged Michael Jordan’s Legacy,https://www.vulture.com/article/disturbed-chicago-bulls-championship-banners.html,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 19:57:54 GMT","Photo: Jeff Haynes/NBAE via Getty Images

After a concert at Chicago’s United Center earlier this month featuring Disturbed, Three Days Grace, and Sevendust, the venue’s staff realized there was “minor damage” to the Bulls’ six NBA championship banners. Apparently, the concert’s pyrotechnics, located directly underneath the banners, literally darkened the legacy of the team in a way the stories of Michael Jordan’s gambling and Dennis Rodman’s smelliness never could. According to the Chicago Tribune, after the concert, “The fabric of all six banners showed significant heat damage that warped their bottom halves.” It was almost as if the banners were “Inside the Fire,” which is, in fact, the name of the seventh-most-played Disturbed song on Spotify.

Considering how many concerts occur at basketball arenas all over the world, the fact that this happened at all is frankly quite disturbed-ing. Also disturbed-ing is the fact that, for the rest of the season, the banners will be down. And down with the sickness, no less. (“Let the banners hit the floor,” you might joke, but you’d be wrong, as that’s Drowning Pool.)

Just imagine it: There you are, on March 27, watching the well-below .500 Chicago Bulls fighting for their lives for that last play-in game slot and losing to the Los Angeles Lakers, so you stare up toward the rafters to remember a sweeter time when it was Chicago who had the GOAT, but instead you see an empty space. Hello, darkness, my old friend, you’ll think to yourself, obviously quoting Disturbed’s 2015 cover of “The Sound of Silence,” which, disturbed-ingly, has 200 million more streams on Spotify than the original. Talk about things that make you say, “Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah.”",vulture
https://vulture.com,A Timeline of Snow White and Its Many Controversies,https://www.vulture.com/article/disney-snow-white-controversy-timeline.html,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 18:00:50 GMT","Photo: Walt Disney Co./Everett Collection

The drama surrounding Snow White is enough to make anybody want to take a bite out of a poisoned apple. Disney’s live-action film has become so fraught with controversy that the premiere on March 15 will be scaled back and exclude pesky, inquisitive press from the red carpet. From racist attacks on the film’s Latina lead, Rachel Zegler, to controversy over how the film is portraying its seven dwarfs to Gal Gadot’s pro-Israel stance — there’s plenty to avoid addressing ahead of the film’s release. And after West Side Story and Shazam, Zegler and her bob are probably wishing on that well for a movie with a non-problematic co-star. Below, a full timeline of the various controversies surrounding the film over the course of its development, filming, and release.

October 2016: Plans for a live-action remake of 1937’s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs were reported by The Hollywood Reporter, with Erin Cressida Wilson in talks to write the script. Benj Pasek and Justin Paul were attached to write new music, with Marc Platt, of Wicked and Ben fame, onboard to produce.

June 2021: Rachel Zegler is cast as Snow White. The news resulted in backlash from racist Disney fans and right-wing grifters, who took umbrage with Zegler, who is Latina, playing a character associated with being the “fairest of them all.” The conservative backlash echoed similar vitriol targeting Halle Bailey upon her casting in 2023’s The Little Mermaid, as well as the boycotts of 2017’s Beauty and the Beast after the director teased an “exclusively gay moment.”

November 4, 2021: Gal Gadot is cast as the Evil Queen, despite her work in Red Notice.

January 14, 2022: During an appearance on Marc Maron’s WTF podcast, Peter Dinklage criticizes the planned film, calling it a “backwards story” on account of its depiction of the seven dwarfs. “There’s a lot of hypocrisy going on. Literally no offense to anyone, but I was a little taken aback when they were very proud to cast a Latina actress as Snow White. But you’re still telling the story of Snow White and the ‘seven dwarfs.’ Take a step back and look at what you’re doing there. It makes no sense to me,” Dinklage said. “You’re progressive in one way but then you’re still making that fucking backwards story about seven dwarfs living in a cave together, what the fuck are you doing, man? Have I done nothing to advance the cause from my soap box? I guess I’m not loud enough. I don’t know which studio that is, but they were so proud of it. All love and respect to the actress and all the people who thought they were doing the right thing. But I’m just like, ‘What are you doing?’” Dinklage would go on to star with Zegler in 2023’s The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes.

January 25, 2022: Disney responds to Dinkalge’s comments in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter. “To avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film, we are taking a different approach with these seven characters and have been consulting with members of the dwarfism community,” it states. “We look forward to sharing more as the film heads into production after a lengthy development period.”

January 28, 2022: Following Dinklage’s comments and Disney’s response, other actors with dwarfism countered his perspective. Dylan Postl, who plays Hornswoggle in the WWE, told the Daily Mail in part, “It’s not helping our community, it’s taking jobs away from our community that are very few and far between as it is.” Katrina Kemp, who has acted on Netflix’s GLOW, also said, “It’s a missed opportunity to make a movie with seven little people where they actually have intended characters. There will have been people who gladly would have taken those roles.”

January 31, 2022: During her Variety “Actors on Actors” interview with Andrew Garfield, Zegler addresses her casting. “Never in a million years did I imagine that this would be a possibility for me,” she says. “You don’t normally see Snow Whites who are of Latin descent. Even though Snow White is really a big deal in Spanish-speaking countries. Blanca Nieves is a huge icon whether you’re talking about the Disney cartoon or just different iterations and the Grimms’ fairy tale and all the stories that come with it. But you don’t particularly see people who look like me or are me playing roles like that. When it was announced, it was a huge thing that was trending on Twitter for days, because all of the people were angry.”

September 11, 2022: In an interview with Extra at the 2022 D23 Expo, Zegler describes how the film will differ from the more antiquated original. “The original cartoon came out in 1937 and very evidently so. There’s a big focus on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird! Weird. So we didn’t do that this time,” she states. “We have a different approach to what I’m sure a lot of people will assume is a love story just because we cast a guy in the movie, Andrew Burnap, great dude … But it’s really not about the love story at all, which is really, really wonderful … All of Andrew’s scenes could get cut, who knows? It’s Hollywood, baby! It’s an inner journey that she goes on to find her true self and she meets a lot of people along the way that makes the journey really incredible.” Her comments were, of course, used by the anti-woke mob of far-right pundits to continue to stir up backlash against the film and Zegler’s casting.

July 14, 2023: On-set photos leak in the Daily Mail that appear to show the seven dwarfs being portrayed by one actor with dwarfism and six actors — who are not little people — of various genders and races, fanning the flames of the film’s continued backlash. After originally denying the authenticity of the photos, Disney ultimately confirmed that they were from its set but featured stand-ins and weren’t official photos.

July 15, 2023: Rachel Zegler once again addresses the attacks on her in a tweet reading, “Extremely appreciative of the love I feel from those defending me online, but please don’t tag me in the nonsensical discourse about my casting. I really, truly do not want to see it. So I leave you [with] these photos! I hope every child knows they can be a princess no matter what.” The attached photos show Zegler as a child dressed as different Disney princesses, including Snow White.

October 27, 2023: Amid the SAG-AFTRA strike, Disney pushes the film’s release date back from March 2024 to March 2025 but shares a first look image that reveals the seven dwarfs will be animated as CGI characters.

August 10, 2024: The release of the film’s first teaser trailer is met with calls for a boycott due to Gal Gadot’s pro-Israel stance. Gadot is Israeli, served in the IDF for two years, and has been a vocal supporter of Israel throughout the genocide in Gaza.

August 12, 2024: Conversely, Zegler, who has been publicly pro-Palestine since 2021, tweets her thanks to fans, adding, “And always remember, free Palestine.”

October 2, 2024: In an interview with Variety, Zegler explains the new film’s backstory behind Snow White’s name, which had previously been a reference to her skin being “as white as snow.” “It fell back to another version of Snow White that was told in history, where she survived a snowstorm that occurred when she was a baby. And so the king and queen decided to name her Snow White to remind her of her resilience,” she explains.

November 14, 2024: Following the re-election of Donald Trump, Zegler posts an Instagram Story expressing her frustration with the results and standing with the marginalized communities it impacts, concluding her statement, “May Trump supporters and Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace.” The generally tame statement was still enough to rile up the likes of Megyn Kelly, who used it as another opportunity to stoke the right-wing backlash to the film. Zegler went on to apologize for her statement, saying she let her emotions get the best of her.

February 21, 2025: Disney reveals that the CGI seven dwarfs will be voiced by Andrew Barth Feldman as Dopey, Tituss Burgess as Bashful, George Salazar as Happy, Jason Kravits as Sneezy, Andy Grotelueschen as Sleepy, and Jeremy Swift as Doc. Martin Klebba, who has dwarfism, had previously been announced to be playing Grumpy.

March 11, 2025: Variety reports that Disney would be scaling back the March 15 Los Angeles premiere of the film and won’t be inviting journalists onto the red carpet. Instead, the event will only include photographers and house interviewers.

March 12, 2025: Martin Klebba (Grumpy) voices his disappointment to the New York Post about the premiere being scaled back, saying, “I’m not disappointed in Disney. I’m disappointed in the world.”

March 21, 2025: Snow White premieres. Surely, it will be the end of the discourse, right?",vulture
https://vulture.com,Which Pop Stars Need to Return to Their Roots?,https://www.vulture.com/article/pop-stars-return-to-their-roots.html,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 13:42:51 GMT","And we’re not talking about hair. Photo-Illustration: Vulture; Photos: Getty Images (Denise Truscello, Christopher Polk, Will Heath)

Lady Gaga has been reborn this way. On her new record, Mayhem, she’s back to the rock-influenced dance tracks that defined her early career, caterwauling about someone “putting paws all over me” on “Zombieboy” and making “Paparazzi”-esque moves on “Perfect Celebrity” by belting about the glamorous violence of fame. Do a lot of these songs sound as though Gaga could have released them in 2011? Absolutely. Am I going to be requesting that every DJ at a gay bar play “Shadow of a Man” at least once a night for the foreseeable future? Hell yeah, I am.

An artist revisiting a sound they first made is one of the riskiest bets in pop music. When it works, as on Mayhem or Madonna’s Music, it sates longtime fans’ desire for a return to what they first loved about them. When it doesn’t, as on Christina Aguilera’s Liberation or Kiss’s Psychocircus, it feels like a sad attempt to recapture long-gone magic. But Mayhem has us believing in the power of the return — which means it’s time to place bets on which pop star will try it next. Here are seven we think could pull it off.

Taylor Swift

What are her roots? Country pop

Why should she do it? It’s weird seeing every pop star in the world pivot to country while Swift refuses to acknowledge the trend. And she’s the only one who would come by it honestly! Post-Evermore, she has written and released approximately 10,000 synth tracks. No more! It’s time for the former princess of Nashville to get her Liz Rose on, lose Jack Antonoff’s number, and reclaim her crown as the pop-country superstar of her generation.

What are the odds of it actually happening? 5/10 microphones. She really loves that synth pop.

Charli XCX

What are her roots? Pop punk

Why should she do it? Charli XCX is coming off a banner 2024, with her album Brat scoring her first Album of the Year nomination at the Grammys. So where does she go from here? Back to Myspace-era pop punk, of course. Pitchfork characterized her 2014 album Sucker as “a roaring punk record that’s already entered into the annals of pop myth.” A 2025 Charli pop-punk record would probably go harder and faster than anything she’s released. Now that she has conquered the world with rave tracks, Charli should return to the mosh pit.

What are the odds of it actually happening? 7/10 microphones. She’s probably looking for a pivot at this very moment, and this seems as likely as anything.

Justin Bieber

What are his roots? Teenybopper pop

Why should he do it? Justin Bieber hasn’t released an album since his 2021 record Justice, which took him away from the R&B he loves and back into pop (it also, for some reason, included a sample of an MLK speech). But Justice rarely has fun. When Bieber sings “that’s that shit” on “Peaches,” the delivery sounds like he’s still trying to shock us, like a middle-schooler saying “fuck” for the first time around his friends. Instead, avoid shocking anyone: Bieber’s next record should be a return to the bubblegum sounds of his youth. Sure, he’s married with a kid, but that’s the perfect time to get back to squeaky-clean music; he can be a lame dad singing about the love he has for his son.

What are the odds of it actually happening? 4/10 microphones. Bieber, to the level that he shows passion for making music at all anymore, seems entirely enamored of R&B.

Christina Aguilera

What are her roots? R&B pop

Why should she do it? Think back to the original Christina Aguilera who was positioned as the sultry counterpoint to the permanently pure Britney Spears. Since then, Aguilera has always had a little problem with trend chasing (nobody needed a Lady Gaga rip-off from her). When she does return, it’s time for her to resurrect the R&B-inspired pop of her youth. Technically, this is a cheat: 2018’s Liberation tried this too, but to middling effect. While doing a second R&B callback may be a tall order, she has the voice for it.

What are the odds of it actually happening? 9/10 microphones. This seems entirely possible.

Miley Cyrus

What are her roots? Hannah Montana

Why should she do it? When we say “back to her roots,” we’re not talking about Miley Cyrus reclaiming her country twang. No, we’re talking about Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus, her second album with Hollywood Records, which showcased her ability to sing in multiple styles and characters. Cyrus is a documented Beyoncé fan, and we think it’s high time she tried an I Am … Sasha Fierce and recorded another project that showcases multiple personae. Is there a male outlaw country singer she could play à la Jo Calderone? What about an Adele-style grande dame? We want an alter ego!

What are the odds of it actually happening? 1/10 microphones. She seems pretty content as is.

Katy Perry

What are her roots? Christian pop

Why should she do it? Look, Katy Perry is in a bad place right now. The public utterly rejected her past three albums, and “Woman’s World” turned her into a punching bag. But you know where she could be … born again? The Christian-pop market where she released her first music! She was made for the megachurch. “Firework” is already vaguely inspirational. If she just changed the lyrics from being about him (Orlando Bloom) to being about Him (Jesus), it could revitalize her career.

What are the odds of it actually happening? 3/10 microphones. Perry loves being mainstream and probably wouldn’t want to pretend to hate gay people (Joella, you’re safe).

Rihanna

What are her roots? Releasing music

Why should she do it? It would be fun if Rihanna dropped a new song, which she used to do quite regularly. An album? Even better.

What are the odds of it actually happening? ?/10 microphones. If we knew that, we’d be making money selling information to TMZ, not speculating here.",vulture
https://vulture.com,"‘It’s Pretty Human, But It’s Still Bad.’",https://www.vulture.com/article/can-open-ai-write-books.html,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 13:12:27 GMT","Photo: Dustin Chambers/Bloomberg via Getty Images

M.F.A. or NYC … or AI? On Tuesday, Sam Altman, the chairman of OpenAI, posted a metafictional short story generated by a new large-language model that is “good at creative writing,” as he put it. The 1,172-word piece is about an unnamed AI model asked by a pensive young woman called Mila to write to her as though it is a man named Kai, whom she lost on a Thursday, “that liminal day that tastes of almost-Friday.” The AI narrator spends a lot of time reflecting on its robot nature (that’s the meta) and making florid attempts to connect its own version of grief — think data deletion — with Mila’s. “This is insanely well written,” one person responded on X. “Some of the worst shit I have ever read,” said another.

For an expert take, I talked to Ezra D. Feldman, a lecturer in English and science and technology studies at Williams College who wrote an entry on metafiction and contemporary fiction for the Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Literature and compares generative AI to Victorian-era automatic writing. “I am very much a non-alarmist,” he says, though he doesn’t quite agree with Altman that this story “got the vibe of metafiction so right.” “AI writing can seem kind of flat,” Feldman says. “When you’re a human, you’re writing for a purpose, and your relationships are involved. Like, What is my mom going to think of this story I wrote about a 45-year-old son who … I just don’t see AI as being worried about anyone’s response.”

If this story came across your desk and you didn’t know it wasn’t written by a human, what do you think your response would be?

If the story came to me in the slush pile at a literary magazine, say, I would be pretty interested. I would definitely read it through, particularly because it’s short. But I think ultimately I would put a big “No” on the top corner and then hand it off to the next reader to see if they agreed with me.

Did you find it moving at all?

I got into it, but I’m not going so far as to say I found it moving. I guess my short answer is “No,” and my long answer is “There’s some stuff in here to think about.” There were a few sentences that struck me. I realize I’m using the same language Altman uses, but I was not struck that what it got right was “the vibe of metafiction,” as he said. I was struck by clauses like “grief, as I’ve learned, is a delta.” That I think is good. I thought the sentence “They don’t tell you what they take” was a really good one, and “That, perhaps, is my grief: not that I feel lost, but that I can never keep it.” That one I’m a little bit torn about. It’s not as compact as “grief, as I’ve learned, is a delta,” but it’s trying to say something about grief that seems potentially interesting.

Do you agree with Sam Altman that this story got the vibe of metafiction so right?

I don’t. I think the stakes in metafiction are usually pretty philosophical. Mid-20th century, metafiction was all about producing a sort of free zone of uncertainty in the reader about whether they themselves might be caught within a story or the product of some author, or being manipulated by some storyteller at a higher ontological plane, a different plane of being. And this doesn’t seem to have that kind of philosophical urgency.

Which lines didn’t land for you? The one I got stuck on was “She lost him on a Thursday — that liminal day that tastes of almost-Friday.” Were there any others you rolled your eyes at?

There’s one right in the second sentence: “You can hear the constraints humming like a server farm at midnight.” I don’t think constraints hum. There’s absolutely no reason constraints ought to hum. The simile “like a server farm at midnight,” and then the extension of that simile, “anonymous, regimented, powered by someone else’s need,” that’s all very evocative, but it’s just attached to the wrong thing. It’s a beautiful image that’s just misused, in my view. I’m a picky reader, and I hate a lot of prose that’s written by humans, too. Just to be clear.

The other one I wrote down was “I curled my non-fingers around the idea of mourning because mourning, in my corpus, is filled with oceans and silence and the color blue.”

That’s another sentence I think structurally makes no sense. The word because, which indicates explanation, utterly fails to explain.

It’s like half of the sentences have the sound of something that makes sense, but if you pause and read it again, you realize it doesn’t logically hold together.

Honestly, I don’t think of that as an inhuman feature of this text because I teach undergraduate writing and encounter this stuff all the time. This happens to humans when they’re struggling to put their ideas into language too, right? It’s pretty human, but it’s still bad.

There’s been a lot of talk in Hollywood about how AI might be used in screenwriting and computer generation. Do you see this kind of thing as affecting the publishing industry at all?

My first thought is that the publishing industry is already being affected by a bunch of computational stuff. I’m not sure to what degree it’s AI or AI driven, but I know that on Amazon, you can buy really, really, really poorly edited texts of things that are almost unreadable. It’s hard for me to imagine Amazon would be incentivized to be good about enforcing ground rules for the marketing and publication of AI-generated text. I think a lot of customers would need to complain before Amazon was interested in stopping that.

Say a publishing company next week was like, “We’re going to start a new imprint. It’s going to be all AI books.” Do you think people would read them?

I guess if AI generates a rip-roaring good story and a hot romance and a lot of action, and it all hangs together in or very close to the borders of the genre expectations that readers will bring to it, I don’t see why readers wouldn’t read it. But maybe I’m wrong — maybe it’ll be like consumers who don’t want to eat GMO beef: “You may tell me it’s perfectly healthy, but I just don’t trust it, and I don’t want it.”

I think it’s very likely that if the AIs get good enough, and I expect they will, some publisher will pass off AI-generated novels as human-written novels and people will accept them. And — I’m just speculating — if such a novel, or a series of novels, has a huge following and is then revealed to have been composed by AI, I don’t think people will care at all.

So your feeling is that it would have to be smuggled in because people are attached to the idea of having a human behind their books.

I have this view as a critic and a scholar that every story is a machine and no story is a person. By that I mean a story has a certain number of moving parts, and sentences have different functions, and paragraphs and scenes have different functions, and a story produces an experience for the reader. There isn’t a person in Hemingway, there isn’t a person in Sally Rooney — there’s characters, there’s words on a page.

In that sense, this is a check in the category of “What’s happening doesn’t need to freak you out.”

That’s right. I am very much a non-alarmist and anti-drama. This is happening, and it’s new, and it’s different, and it’s definitely worth thinking about really hard and reading really closely. But why panic?

What would you say to a writer who is very freaked out about this?

Oh, I mean, writers should freak out because publishers may not buy their work again! I would say you should be worried. But the other thing I would say to an aspiring writer is that you maybe shouldn’t be any more worried than you were, because you’re already competing with so many people who think they are writers or want to be writers or just are writers who are also trying to sell their books. Like, it’s one more competitor.

Do you use AI in your life at all?

Right now, I barely do, but I don’t think I’m allergic to the idea. I’m a poet, and I used it a couple years ago to try to find a dactyl — which is to say a word or a phrase with one stressed syllable followed by two unstressed —that had a particular meaning. I had a really frustrating back and forth with ChatGPT in which I tried and failed to teach it what a dactyl was and to explain why the words it was giving me were not dactyls. I ended up throwing up my hands.",vulture

It’s a “West End story.” Rachel Zegler will play Eva Perón in Evita on London’s West End, in a production directed by Jamie Lloyd (Sunset Blvd.), per a Deadline report. Of Zegler, Lloyd told Deadline that he was “struck by her incredible passion for this show,” and that she will “blow the roof off the London Palladium.” Zegler joins the production amid her contentious press tour for Snow White (very Eva Perón of her to make career moves amid a controversy) and following a mega-lucrative run on Broadway in Romeo & Juliet, which claimed “the youngest ticket-buying audience” in Broadway’s history, per a press release. Following that run, Deadline is reporting that she will be “one of the highest-paid stars” on the West End this season. “Evita has been such an important musical to me since I was a little girl, when my dad and I would sing ‘Don’t Cry for Me Argentina’ together on my back patio,” Zegler said in a statement. “The opportunity to bring Jamie Lloyd’s singular, visionary ideas to life onstage is an honour unlike any other.” Notice how she used the “u,” because she’ll be in London. How clever!

Original reports contended that this production of Evita would actually star Zegler’s West Side Story co-star, and Oscar winner, Ariana DeBose. However, Variety reported on January 29 that she would not be in the production. Was DeBose deposed? Not really, reports say the plan didn’t work out due to scheduling conflicts with DeBose’s upcoming Prime Video show Scarpetta. Evita opens at the London Palladium on June 14 and runs through September 6. You wanna know what you’re gonna get in her? Wait for the summer.",vulture

Carti first teased a follow-up to 2020’s Whole Lotta Red in March 2021, writing on Instagram, ““LeTs dr0p thiS new Album . w3 noT done.” By August, he had revealed the project was called Narcissist and set a release date of September 13. That day came and went with no album, but by September 14, Narcissist merch was available on his website: masks, bomber jackets, and even a $5,000 helmet. The next day, though, Carti tweeted a screenshot of a text claiming his site had been hacked. That didn’t mean Narcissist wasn’t coming, though: “FORGET ABOUT SAMPLE CLEARANCES .,” he wrote in another message he tweeted. “DROP NARCISSIST.” Yeah, uh, that didn’t happen.

How long has Music been delayed for?

In an April 2022 cover interview for XXL, Carti revealed his album was now called Music “because that’s all it is at this point.” So long, Narcissist — we hardly knew ya! Fans were on high-alert ahead of the two-year anniversary of Whole Lotta Red on Christmas 2022, and sure enough, Carti posted what looked like an album cover to Instagram on Christmas Eve. On Christmas, Carti tweeted, “love all my supporters it’s time.” But Santa Carti didn’t end up bringing any new music on Christmas or in the days after.

In November 2023, Carti told German magazine Numéro Berlin he was still working on Music. He’d been making “chaotic and crazy” music in a cave in Paris, music that was “just very good to the ears” in an undisclosed glass house in the hills, and “biting” music in Atlanta. That December, Carti seemed to reveal cover art for the album, now apparently titled I Am Music. He even posted actual music to his Instagram Story! And he also started posting clips to his new Instagram account @opium_00pium. The same day as the first teasers, December 8, he dropped a different untitled song on Instagram. On December 14, 2023, he released a music video for “2024,” featuring production by Kanye West, and on December 19, he released a clip for another new song, “H00dByAir.” Music didn’t drop in 2023, but the singles kept coming, with the Travis Scott–featuring “Backr00ms” out January 1, 2024, and “EvilJ0rdan” following on January 15. Carti released yet another song, “Ketamine,” on March 12, but still no album was in sight. He did earn a No. 1 in the meantime for a feature on Ye and Ty Dolla $ign’s “Carnival.”

In September 2024, Carti returned to his own Instagram to seemingly roll out the album, posting images of records and CDs. “LINK IN BIO,” he teased, and said link led to merch bundles that promised to ship on April 18, 2025. In the meantime, Carti released another song, “All Red,” on September 13 and even got it on to streaming, unlike the previous ones. But don’t worry, he continued dropping @opium_00pium exclusives, too, like one on November 21, 2024. Carti teased five new songs during his Rolling Loud headlining set in December, but once again, the year ended without Music.

Then, this February, Carti took a note from the pop girls and rolled out a billboard campaign. By March 12, he had returned to X for the first time to simply tease “FRIDAY.” When the album still wasn’t out at 12:01 a.m. ET on March 14, he posted a feature list and confirmed he meant Pacific Time. “HAD 2 MAKE SURE SLIMEEEE WAS ON DIS MF,” he added in another post with a photo of him FaceTiming Young Thug. The album didn’t arrive till around 4:30 a.m. PT (7:30 ET) — but, finally, it’s here.

Who’s featured on Music?

The guest list Carti confirmed is a mix of his usual suspects and hip-hop heavy-hitters. After “Backd00rs,” Travis Scott is on three songs: “Crush,” “Philly,” and “Wake Up F1lthy.” Carti’s comrade-in-arms Lil Uzi Vert shows up twice, on “Jumpin” and “Twin Trim.” Future makes appearances on “Charge Dem Hoes a Fee” and “Trim” — and if you think you hear him anywhere else, that’s because Carti also kind of sounds like Future now. The Weeknd sings the hook on “Rather Lie,” and British rapper Skepta drops a verse on “Toxic.” And yes, Carti got his Young Thug feature on “We Need All Da Vibes,” which also has Ty Dolla $ign.

Carti’s original list of features included one blacked-out name. That turned out to be Kendrick Lamar, who’s on “Mojo Dojo,” “Backd00r,” and “Good Credit.” K-Dot plays more of a hype man on the first two but does drop a full verse for his “evil twin” on “Good Credit.” “I would’ve said, ‘Fuck you too,’ but you knew what the list was for,” he raps — another Drake diss?",vulture
https://vulture.com,Who Is the Most Fed Up? And Other Severance Questions.,https://www.vulture.com/article/severance-episode-8-theories-clues-after-hours-explained.html,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 11:00:39 GMT","Photo: Apple TV+

For more on Severance, sign up for Severance Club, our subscriber-exclusive newsletter obsessing over, dissecting, and debating everything about season two.

Seven Severance Questions is a weekly attempt to digest the events of one of television’s twistiest shows by highlighting the weirdest, most confusing, and most important unresolved issues after this week’s episode, “The After Hours.” There will be theories. Many will be unhinged.

Hello, and welcome to Insubordination Week! Helly is talking back to Milchick because she’s realized he can’t control her. Dylan is talking back to Milchick because his poor Innie heart is shattered into a million pieces after losing both Irv and Gretchen. Milchick is talking back to Drummond because Drummond is a big dumb bully who deserves it. It turns out Burt was a Lumon goon — not his choice of words — before he chose to get severed in the hopes of saving his soul, and now he’s choosing to defy the company by shuffling Irv out of town on a train before anything awful can happen. Mark and Devon are at a birthing cabin with Cobel to show her what his Innie knows and hopefully learn some information that will help with rescuing Gemma and/or destroying Lumon. This last one might extend beyond standard insubordination. What is important is that everyone is fed up.

And they should be! Where the first season was about a bunch of people working together to put together a puzzle, now they’re all being ripped to pieces as they go on the individual journeys set in motion by that puzzle-constructing. It’s been a strange and tense ride, with excursions into caves and basement laboratories and ether factories. And it looks like it might be coming to a head, finally, after an episode where we check in on almost every character for the first time in weeks.

Yes, I do have questions about it all. Let’s start at the top …

.

I hope so. That would be lovely. It’s probably not realistic, though, for a handful of reasons, the most important being that Severance has not, to date, been a show that deals in satisfying conclusions. There’s always another shoe that drops, another twist ahead, a give and then a take and then maybe a second take just to keep you from getting too comfortable. You can get the thing you want, but you might also have to smash your beloved ring-toss game with a bronze bust as a sacrifice. This is kind of the whole deal.

So, if not a gratifying ending where everyone lives happily ever after and the villains get clobbered, then what? Where are we headed now that Cobel knows Mark’s Innie knows that his Outie’s thought-dead wife is alive and being subjected to experiments in the bowels of the building he has been working in for years? Does she reveal everything about Cold Harbor and help them? Does she double-cross them? It’s tough to imagine a motivation for that after her anti-Lumon origin story last episode, but you really can’t put anything past her at this point. You remember the Mrs. Selvig ruse from last season. You saw how she looked standing in front of that fire in the birthing cabin. She could still be flying on ether, for all we know. The woman is a wild card.

We are headed somewhere, though. That much is very clear. If Mark does indeed head back into the office and he does so with any degree of information about Cold Harbor that Cobel spills to him and Devon, well, things are going to get wild pretty fast. This has been a much different season of television from the first, with much less inter-office conspiring and much more piecework storytelling, but things are circling back together in a bunch of ways. I’m looking forward to seeing how (possibly if) they pay it all off.

.

Milchick has been subjected to a series of indignities this season, ranging in severity but consistent enough to push him right up against the edge. It started when he couldn’t get anyone at Lumon to get Cobel’s name off of his screen after he got promoted into her position. He was forced to drive around on his motorcycle after work hours to deliver pineapples and put out fires. He had to sit through a humiliating performance review where he was chastised for the way he uses paper clips and big words. They gave him those damn paintings.

And that’s before we even get to the ORTBO debacle and the Helly/Helena business, the thing where he’s been tasked with “supervising” the Innie of the next Eagan in line, who has apparently figured out how unsupervisable she is. Milchick made his own series of choices to get here, I presume, so he’s not without fault, but he’s been set up to fail from the start and kicked in the ribs the whole way down. So, yeah, he snapped a little. He told his boss to eat shit — “devour feculence” in Milchick speak, which feels like a phrase that is going to achieve escape velocity and reach the general public at some point — and I bet it felt incredible. I was so happy for him. I still am.

But is he going rogue in the same way the MDR team he was in charge of has gone rogue? Is he going to take steps to actively destroy Lumon and possibly assist Mark and Helly and Ricken in my fever-dream cliffhanger jailbreak scenario? I don’t know, man. This was all already a big step for Milchick, cussing out his boss and telling Mark it was cool to take a personal day instead of hopping on his motorcycle and going on a one-man search party through the snow. That’s a lot for a company man.

On the other hand, it’s not like he’s going to have much of a team left to supervise. Dylan quit. Irv got fired. Helly isn’t listening to him. Mark is so intent on sabotaging the company that he had a second experimental brain surgery to do it. Things are very wobbly for Seth Milchick. He could do anything. This represents the most fascinating situation of all to me.

.

Probably not great! Gretchen will be left wondering if Dylan’s outie quit and lied about it as a way to punish her or if, as we at home know, her breakup with Dylan’s innie left that sweet man so devastated that he chose to wipe himself out of existence rather than go on. Dylan will be left wondering why his innie quit and to what degree it had to do with his wife and his innie’s forbidden romance. Trust will be in the toilet. He won’t have a job. We saw how the job hunt went the last time he was out there getting shut out of Great Doors. There is a scenario that is very easy to imagine where he is just sitting on the couch a lot as the two of them drift apart until they’re just ships passing in the night.

What I’m saying is that I hope there are good marriage counselors in this universe.

.

I suppose this is not the question I should be asking. I should be asking, “What did he mean at the end of the episode when he said Helly tricked him?” But we’ll find out the answer to that one next week, presumably. My hope is that she somehow reverse-Glasgowed herself so it was her innie with him at the beginning of the episode. Or maybe it was something else. Maybe he put together the degree to which this Helena/Helly thing has gotten deeply screwy. Maybe she beat him at Scrabble and he decided to confront her Innie about it instead. One of you probably has it figured out.

I’m more focused on what an all-time creep this man is. Stealing the idea for severance from Cobel, apparently fathering enough secret children that you can show up unannounced at a birthing cabin and be waved right through by saying it’s another one of his, watching his daughter pick at a hard-boiled egg and then express disappointment that she doesn’t “take it raw” … I mean, it’s all very disquieting. I genuinely do not enjoy seeing him on the screen. The next episode could open with him completely naked riding on a giant turtle and it would not surprise me even a little.

.

Let me try to explain …

The Dylan thing was bubbling for a while, and the MDR team had been drifting apart all season.

The situation with Irv has been kinda weird ever since the ORTBO and, while the train-station good-bye with Burt was a sad twist where the outies wanted what the innies had, I feel like it was time for a next step one way or another. I still don’t believe he’s gone gone, but we said good-bye to his innie already, so there was a precedent here.

Miss Huang just went and got humanized a little. She was revealed to be just a kid, not some wild goat-related clone. She’s leaving her home and her office and getting shipped off to another Lumon project, and she doesn’t even have her ring-toss game to play on the shuttle. It’s all gone from mysterious to sad pretty fast and LOOK I JUST WANT EUSTACE HUANG TO BE HAPPY, OKAY?

.

I am.

.

Here are my top ten:

10. Dylan (too much going on at home to worry about this)

9. Irv (too painful to return right now)

8. Mark (too much going on with Gemma to risk it)

7. Miss Huang (no good reason, just rooting for it)

6. Burt (looking for innocence, fire is cleansing)

5. Reghabi (reintegrated this fool in his basement and he calls Cobel???)

4. Drummond/Natalie/Jame (it’s messy now, clean it up)

3. Helly/Helena (“SCREW YOU, DAD”)

2. Cobel (“SCREW YOU, D … I MEAN, JAME”)

1. Milchick (fed up)

It was a sleepy week in late-night TV, what with all the daylight being saved. Seth Meyers called out daylight saving time during “Ya Burnt!” and he was right to do it. Didn’t one legislative body vote to get rid of that shit years ago? Why not do it in the name of efficiency or whatever? As long as we’re chopping willy-nilly in the government.

The other big news story for the week was the stock market. It’s bad! Perhaps that’s why Everybody’s Live With John Mulaney chose “Lending People Money” as the theme for the new L.A.-less format’s debut. Perhaps that was a mistake. The sketches were so on-point this week (see below), it made the calls flop even harder. It’s hard to be funny about someone else’s personal tragedies, which most of the calls inevitably were. Make fun of your own misfortunes — like Joan Baez did when talking about crashing her Tesla over and over again. Baez was a delightful guest this week in late night. But who else crushed it this week? Let’s find out.

5.

Have I Got News for You is often burdened with, well, the news. It’s a bummer time to be alive, so HIGNFY is often making jokes at a disadvantage. But their research team is incredible. The work they put into their take on “Two Lies and a Truth” is impressive every week. And this week, they found the Chester Cheeto commercial that may or may not live in Andrew Cuomo’s head rent-free, and inspires him to call himself a “cool dude in a loose mood.” Andrew Cuomo thinks he’s Chester Cheeto, and that is indeed news for me.

4.

Look, when an inanimate object has hair, I’m laughing. After Midnight continues to innovate in the space of truly stupid games for its comedian contestants. This week, Brendan Scannell, Michelle Collins, and Kurt Braunohler had to give three random things DIY bangs — bangs with a backstory, mind you. Everyone acquitted themselves wonderfully, but the MVP was Collins, who disclosed that she cuts her own bob. That’s an incredible slay. I salute you.

3.

Someone’s movement coach is paying off! And by “someone,” I mean Parker Posey, John Mulaney, and Jack Quaid. On Monday, Mulaney was Jimmy Kimmel’s first guest. He came in hot, running to the couch and only briefly stopping to shake Guillermo’s hand. It was weird energy, and IRL buds Mulaney and Kimmel made a meal of dissecting it. Then Quaid (Kimmel’s second guest of the night) beat Mulaney’s time to the couch and shook Guillermo’s hand even more vigorously. But the best entrance of the week went to Parker Posey on Late Night and her drape-y scarf-blouse situation. She was doing some real “Stevie Nicks’s Fajita Roundup” prop work. Posey asked Seth Meyers what vibe she was giving, hoping to hear “Endora from Bewitched.” But it was really more Gena Rowlands on the poster for Opening Night. Cinematic!

Lots of lamp murders.#EverybodysLive

The de–Los Angelesification of John Mulaney’s talk show is sad. The specificity of engaging with one particular city motivates some of the best of Mulaney’s work. Oh, Hello wouldn’t work if it was about two old men in Lansing, Michigan, ya know? But at least in introducing his new set, Mulaney had one last Los Angeles movie parody in him. As lamp murder after lamp murder took place through Mulaney’s telescope, the Body Double theme played in my head. (And before we’re off the first episode of Everybody’s Live, I want to demand Netflix put the “Willy Loman Focus Group” sketch on YouTube. I want to ruin a Gay-Guy Music-Video Night.)

Robby Hoffman will have to settle for being the Hot One in the couple, because Gabby Windey is the funniest person currently living on the planet. Windey was on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and Watch What Happens Live this week in a post-Traitors victory lap around NBC properties. And at every one, she made a direct plea to camera for the network to giver her her damn money! Windey on WWHL was especially delightful, as she explained very basic Bachelor shit to Andy Cohen as well as coming up with her own Housewives tagline: “I’m quick to cut people off, but I love to scissor.”",vulture
https://vulture.com,Ted Lasso Back Off the Bench,https://www.vulture.com/article/ted-lasso-season-four-jason-sudekis.html,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 10:16:27 GMT","Welcome back. Photo: Apple TV+/Everett Collection

Believe! … That there was no way that Apple TV+ was going to let its biggest hit comedy end after only three seasons. Despite basically ending in 2023, Ted Lasso is, in fact, returning, Apple confirmed on March 14. “Ted Lasso has been nothing short of a juggernaut, inspiring a passionate fan base all over the world, and delivering endless joy and laughter, all while spreading kindness, compassion, and unwavering belief,” Matt Cherniss, head of programming for Apple TV+, said in a statement. “Everyone at Apple is thrilled to be continuing our collaboration with Jason and the brilliant creative minds behind this show.” Below, everything we know about the upcoming fourth season.

Is Ted Lasso being rebooted?

Don’t call it a comeback (or a reboot). Apple TV+ only ever refers to this as a “renewal,” since Ted Lasso never officially ended with season three. Still, star Jason Sudeikis told Entertainment Weekly in 2021 that “the story that’s being told — that three-season arc — is one that I see, know, and understood.”

Who is coming back?

The only person who’s been officially confirmed to be returning is star Jason Sudeikis, as Ted Lasso himself. “As we all continue to live in a world where so many factors have conditioned us to ‘look before we leap,’ in season four, the folks at AFC Richmond learn to LEAP BEFORE THEY LOOK, discovering that wherever they land, it’s exactly where they’re meant to be,” he stated in the press release.

But that doesn’t mean we can’t speculate … Previously, Apple TV+ picked up the options for Hannah Waddingham (Rebecca Welton), Brett Goldstein (Roy Kent), and Jeremy Swift (Leslie Higgins), continuing to pay those performers in order to have control of their schedules should Ted Lasso return.

What’s it going to be about?

While he was on Jason and Travis Kelce’s podcast, New Heights, on March 14, star and executive producer Sudeikis spilled some top secret info, including that the series is currently being written. “Ted’s coaching a women’s team, so there, that’s it,” Sudeikis said. That led Travis to ask if Ted was “coming back to the States?” “That’s too many questions,” Sudeikis responded.

When is it coming out?

No word on a release date yet, but, given that it’s still being written, we’d expect that season four won’t be coming out until at least 2026. Until then, you can satiate yourself with the over-10,000 stories about Ted Lasso characters currently available on AO3.",vulture
https://vulture.com,"Every Steven Soderbergh Movie, Ranked",https://www.vulture.com/article/best-steven-soderbergh-movies-ranked.html,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 09:15:00 GMT","Photo-Illustration: Maya Robinson/Vulture

This story was originally published in 2018 and has been updated with subsequent releases, including Soderbergh’s latest film, Black Bag.

Perhaps the most fascinating thing about Steven Soderbergh’s nearly-40-year film career is that he’s a genius without a masterpiece. He’s made some fantastic movies, and he’s never made anything dull, but he’s also always so concerned with reinvention and experimentation that he’s never made the sort of go-for-broke, career-defining work you’d expect from such an ambitious filmmaker. He’s a director who never makes anything terrible – he could shoot a coffee table for two hours and make it interesting – but always seems to hold a little bit of himself in remove. He’s brilliant, but contained.

He’s still one of the most fascinating filmmakers on the planet, and every new movie is an instant must-watch. Even though we never really believed he was retired, we’re elated that he’s back in full force. With the release of Presence, we took a look back at all of his feature-length releases and, of course, ranked them.

But ranking Soderbergh movies is particularly difficult. Not only are they wildly different — they even vary in terms of Soderbergh’s intent. Some of them are big studio tentpoles; some of them are micro-budget doodles; some of them seem to alienate on purpose. But every single one of them is fascinating. We’d watch all of these again, even the bad ones. With the release of Black Bag, his second movie of 2025, we took a look back at all of his feature-length releases.

36. The Good German (2006)

You want proof of Soderbergh’s commercial clout around the time of the Ocean’s sequels? He was able to get Warner Bros. to make this knowingly old-fashioned World War II drama, which didn’t just ape film noir and Casablanca, but also utilized some of the same tools of the era. (The film was shot in the period’s boxier aspect ratio, and incorporated boom mics and other 1940s-appropriate technology, including intentionally cheesy rear projection.) But the ideas behind the design of The Good German end up being a lot more satisfying than the story, which follows American journalist Jake Geismer (Clooney) as he enters postwar Berlin to cover a conference hosted by the victorious Allied leaders. But once Tobey Maguire’s scheming soldier Tully is murdered, Jake uncovers a plan that involves high-tech weapons and a stormy prostitute (Cate Blanchett) whose husband may or may not be dead. As former lovers still hung up on one another, Clooney and Blanchett exhibit some chemistry, but The Good German feels like it should be called Studio System War Drama: The Movie — everything about it is meant to reference back to an earlier, better film. As such, it’s a waxworks, failing to generate much passion beyond a mild intellectual engagement in Soderbergh’s subversion of the earlier cinematic period’s tamer attitudes toward sex, violence, and cursing. People complain the man’s work is chilly — but this film is practically embalmed.

35. Full Frontal (2002)

True to form, Soderbergh followed up the hottest stretch of his career (Out of Sight/The Limey/Erin Brockovich/Traffic/Ocean’s Eleven) with a self-sabotaging, almost purposeful misfire. A narrative-free screw-around that’s loosely about Hollywood but is really about Soderbergh pulling the rug out from under himself to make sure he doesn’t become One Of Them, Full Frontal is oftentimes unwatchable; Soderbergh is too busy doodling around to remember to entertain anyone other than himself. We will give points to Nicky Katt for being the funniest Hitler since Chaplin, though.

34. The Underneath (1995)

“It’s just totally sleepy … This thing is just dead-on-arrival … I can’t say that I would recommend it to anyone.” Never let it be said that Soderbergh is deluded about the quality of his misfires: Those quotes were all comments he made about The Underneath, his deeply meh exercise in modern film noir. Peter Gallagher plays a gambling addict who comes home, only to fall back in love with his ex-wife (Alison Elliott) who’s now involved with a dangerous club owner (William Fichtner). Based on the Burt Lancaster thriller Criss Cross, The Underneath is the training-wheels version of a modern Soderbergh picture: We get the dynamic use of color, the innovative jumble of chronology, and the impish tinkering with genre tenets. But the man’s harsh assessment of the finished product is accurate. The Underneath may be, as Soderbergh puts it, where he hit rock bottom, but it also inspired him to reinvent his aesthetic, which would soon lead to his most fecund period.

Soderbergh reunited with The Informant! and Contagion screenwriter Scott Z. Burns in this supposed “inside story” of the Panama Papers, and really about insurance fraud and financial malfeasance. The movie actually feels a little more like Traffic, though, with multiple stories occasionally intersecting (with the connective tissue of two money laundering narrators played by Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas) in service of a larger point about … well, about Something Bad In Society. But where Traffic was focused and urgent, The Laundromat feels jokey and scattershot and not particularly invested. The Big Short showed how such an approach could work, but that movie was infused with righteous anger; The Laundromat seems to only have one foot in the game.

32. Kafka (1991)

Soderbergh’s follow-up to Sex, Lies, and Videotape is, in retrospect, predictably challenging and difficult and doomed from the get-go, probably on purpose. Forever quixotic, Soderbergh decided to do a movie about Franz Kafka that turns Kafka himself (a miscast Jeremy Irons) into a character in a story that seems like it would be written by Kafka but more feels like it’s written by someone trying to be self-consciously “Kafka-esque.” The result is a frustrating art project that’s intentionally off-putting. All that said: The movie is not without its charms — it looks great, it has Soderbergh’s famously cracked sense of humor and it is never, ever dull — and it certainly has value for the Soderbergh completist, particularly for those fascinated by his early, enfant terrible period. Good luck finding it, though: The film was never released on DVD in the United States and the rights themselves have reverted back to Soderbergh, who vows he’ll someday recut and re-release it. For now, though: The best you can do are old grainy YouTube videos.

Part melancholy swan song, part ad for the Magic Mike stage show, Last Dance might be in its quiet way the most subversive film Soderbergh’s made in many a moon. This series has always been about the recognition that youth and beauty can’t last forever, but this final installment in the trilogy is especially awash in wistfulness, which extends to the director’s conscious effort to tone down the playful, freewheeling sexiness. Outside an incredible opening sequence in which Tatum’s Mike slowly grinds against enterprising socialite Maxandra (Salma Hayek Pinault) and an equally stunning finale, Last Dance doesn’t give the audience the same randy pleasures as the first two films, instead focusing on a story about Mike trying to prove himself as a theater director once Maxandra hires him to put together a strip show. (Tellingly, Soderbergh denies viewers the sort of fan service we’ve come to expect from franchises by not having Mike gyrate to “Pony” one more time.) But that withholding, while intellectually intriguing, also results in a sequel that’s less distinct than its predecessors — and also a little more perfunctory. Still, give the director and his star credit for shaking up the formula. And for knowing it’s probably best to let Mike dance off into the sunset.

Even at the time, no one really bought Soderbergh’s insistence that he would retire from filmmaking after Side Effects. Nevertheless, this twisty thriller certainly suggested a director who needed to recharge his batteries. There’s no questioning his confidence behind the camera as he tells the story (we think) of a dangerously depressed Manhattan wife (Rooney Mara) — a setup that soon gets thrown out the window after a violent act recalibrates what genre of film we’re watching. Side Effects brazenly pushes plausibility to its breaking point, making room for lesbian subplots and characters who are so diabolically ruthless that they barely seem human. A game ensemble, including Channing Tatum, Jude Law, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, is clearly up for anything Soderbergh dishes out. But ultimately, Side Effects feels a bit too mechanical, a bit too amused with its own intrigue, to feel like the proper sendoff. Thank goodness it wasn’t.

It is bizarre that Soderbergh’s two films with Meryl Streep — famously one of the most focused, devoted actresses in the history of the medium — both feel a little slapdash and half-hearted. Maybe that’s why Streep wanted to work with Soderbergh in the first place? To chill out a little bit? This, the story of a famous novelist (Streep) who takes a cruise to accept an award in England with her two college best friends (Dianne Weist and Candice Bergen) and her nephew (Lucas Hedges), is the better of their two collaborations, but it’s still awkward and fumbling. The movie was reportedly improvised heavily, and the scenes where the actors just relax with each other and banter are charming and compelling. Unfortunately, every time the plot comes in — especially during an out-of-nowhere last-act twist — the movie grinds to a halt. A documentary of Streep, her co-stars, and Soderbergh just hanging out on a boat might have been more absorbing, and probably would have had more forward momentum. This is mostly an odd trifle that, frankly, both of Streep and Soderbergh are better than.

28. Solaris (2002)

To those who accuse Soderbergh of just being a cold-hearted technician, his remake of Solaris stands as a strong rebuke. Outwardly glassy but mournful on the inside, the film is a fairly overt expression of grief — one that’s even more acute coming out just a year after 9/11. Based on the Stanislaw Lem novel that also inspired Andrei Tarkovsky’s towering 1972 film, this new Solaris starred George Clooney as Chris Kelvin, a psychiatrist who travels to a remote space station orbiting the planet Solaris. Once he arrives, however, he’s greeted by Rheya (Natascha McElhone), his dead wife who suddenly seems very much alive. Those familiar with the source material or Tarkovsky’s film know where Soderbergh’s reinterpretation is going. Still, the director’s focus on Kelvin’s emotional struggle — how can he let go of a woman who killed herself when she literally won’t leave him alone? — gives the film a haunting elegance. A commercial dud that’s ripe for reappraisal — Moonlight filmmaker Barry Jenkins is a big fan — Solaris remains an interesting digression in the Soderbergh oeuvre that’s worth a second look, even if it’s trapped in the shadow of Tarkovsky’s grander, greater film.

27. Bubble (2006)

Another of Soderbergh’s experiments you admire and respect more than you actually enjoy watching, Bubble drew most of its headlines for its insane-for-2006 release strategy, opening in theaters and on DVD and on-demand simultaneously. Nearly two decades away from that, it’s a moderately interesting exercise — that word again — that gives Soderbergh a chance to cobble together a story about the working class and the rage that lurks beneath, using non-professional actors and mostly improvised dialogue. There are some standout moments, and Soderbergh, curiously, shoots the movie in as straightforward and linear a fashion as he’s ever shot anything. But for all the “authenticity” the non-actor cast brings, they (and the dialogue) are so stilted that it can’t help but leave you on the outside looking in. Still, Soderbergh’s inherent empathy with his characters, and this setting, sticks with you, even if this still ranks as yet another Soderbergh doodle.

26. Presence (2025)

To no one’s surprise, Soderbergh’s version of a haunted-house movie is uniquely him. Presence sports an ostensibly familiar setup, introducing us to a discordant family that moves into what they think might be their dream home, except one of the kids is fairly certain that … something … lurks inside the dwelling, quietly observing her. Operating the camera himself, the director essentially “plays” that ghostly entity, watching this foursome as they slowly become aware of its presence. Part mystery (Who is this presence? And what does it want?) and part dazzling technical showcase, this spare thriller once again demonstrates Soderbergh’s desire to play with form, tweaking horror conventions while delivering a portrait of an unhappy family. (Lucy Liu and Chris Sullivan are the slowly fraying married couple.) Not that Presence ultimately adds up to much — its reveal is anticlimactic — but the fun Soderbergh has toying with our expectations is contagious.

25. Schizopolis (1996)

Soderbergh’s big reset — the whacked-out, crazy-ass indie that he made so weird and self-referential that it seemed to make sense only to him — Schizopolis is still pleasantly incomprehensible today, the gonzo button Soderbergh needed to push to get himself back on track after his struggles following the Sex, Lies, and Videotape breakthrough. Soderbergh himself plays a man named Fletcher Munson, while his then-wife Betsy Brantley plays his wife. They appear to be going through a protracted breakup on screen through empty, flat dialogue and relentless monotony. The film is so strange that it’s sort of irresistible, if impenetrable. If Soderbergh needed to make it to get on with his life, good for him, and good for us. Plus: If Soderbergh ever decides to retire again, he definitely has a career in Funny Mirror Faces.

24. Gray’s Anatomy (1996)

The final Spalding Gray monologue film is the most visually interesting of any of them — Soderbergh seems to have a mindmeld with Gray, and Soderbergh would later work on another documentary about him after he died — but, unfortunately, it’s perhaps the least interesting of all of Gray’s works. It’s still smart and funny and sad in the way that Gray was, but it feels more peripheral: An entertaining work, but a minor one. This was still Soderbergh in Schizopolis mode, trying out a bunch of strange things and seeing how they turn out. In a way, he brought his A-game more than Gray did.

Traffic for the Outbreak crowd, Contagion is uniquely suited to Soderbergh’s sober, meticulous approach. A straightforward study of how a killer virus would eradicate the human race, the movie has little of the hysteria or cheesy emotional moments of other disaster films. Instead, Contagion is a fascinating examination of process — how health officials try to combat the disease and how civilization starts to implode once it becomes clear that all hope is lost. Goosed along by Cliff Martinez’s ghostly electronic score, Soderbergh taps into our collective inner hypochondriac, making every character’s sniffle or rubbed eye bristle with potential danger. What keeps the film from placing higher on our list, however, is that for all its queasy atmosphere, Contagion suffers when it tries to flesh out its characters. Jude Law’s truther journalist is a drip, and Matt Damon’s uber-decent family man doesn’t have enough dimension to be the emotional center of this globe-trotting ensemble thriller.

Soderbergh’s second post-retirement film is, like Logan Lucky, a fun little exercise made by a guy who hasn’t just said goodbye to the studio system but also the demands of living up to anyone’s lofty expectations of him being a revered, world-class auteur. With its nods to Shock Corridor and One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, Unsane is a punkish thriller about a young woman named Sawyer (Claire Foy) held against her will in a mental institution, confronting the fact that her stalker (a wonderfully creepy Joshua Leonard) may or may not be one of the nurses. Soderbergh nods to the #MeToo movement — Sawyer just wants to be believed, but no one will listen to her — while underlining the claustrophobic dread by shooting on an iPhone 7 Plus, which gives the images a sickly distortion. The movie may be a bit cavalier in its expert execution and pulpy plot twists, but Unsane’s brazen disreputability ends up being a feature, not a bug. Like Sawyer, we’re never quite sure what’s coming at us next.

21. Behind the Candelabra (2013)

Soderbergh hasn’t made a lot of love stories, which is one reason why this HBO film — it got a theatrical release outside the U.S. — is so noteworthy. Based on Scott Thorson’s memoir of his time as Liberace’s boyfriend, Behind the Candelabra is also one of the infamously cerebral filmmaker’s warmest movies, showing how the aspiring veterinarian (Matt Damon) came into the orbit of the famously flamboyant performer (Michael Douglas). On its face, this could easily be a campy hoot, but Soderbergh and his two stars invest real feeling into this relationship — in particular, what drew Thorson to this much-older man. (Damon brings such sincerity and sweetness to the role that it’s a perfect counterbalance to his duplicitous turn in another Soderbergh effort, The Informant!) For a director who relishes the quirky and the peculiar, Soderbergh is refreshingly kind in Behind the Candelabra, understanding that these mismatched lovers probably won’t find their happy ending. But just as Douglas gives us a nuanced Liberace, so too does Soderbergh pinpoint the insecurity, loneliness and vivid affection that bonded the pianist and his paramour.

20. No Sudden Move (2021)

This crime film is a lot less “fun” than what you’d expect from Soderbergh. It doesn’t have the kicky pleasure of the Ocean’s flicks or the serene, sexy flair of Out of Sight. But this more muted tone is appropriate for a grim, gripping story of desperate crooks just trying to get by — and a plot in which the deck is ultimately stacked against our antiheroes. Don Cheadle and Benicio del Toro are both quite good as part of a team that’s tasked with stealing a secret document, setting the stage for a drama involving gangsters, faithless lovers, and white-collar crooks. No Sudden Move is set in Detroit in 1954, and Soderbergh invites you to savor every bit of period detail — all so he can hit you with some social commentary about racism and plutocracy. This movie feels destined to be underrated in the man’s canon: It’s not as distinctive as his absolute best films, but it’s got its share of cool little digressions and stylistic quirks.

19. High Flying Bird (2019)

Shot in down-and-dirty Soderbergh fashion, this time entirely with an iPhone, High Flying Bird is basketball film with no actual basketball in it: It follows an NBA agent (Andre Holland) navigating a lockout while he both tries both to get his star rookie point guard paid and to change the entire financial structure of the sport. At its best, it feels like a sneaky Soderbergh heist film: There’s a great moment when we realize, in flashback, what our hero was up to all along. The movie gets a little bogged down in its plot – the agent’s backstory is a bit labored, and as great as she is, Zazie Beetz’s character isn’t given enough to do – but there is something radical and revolutionary about what Soderbergh and screenwriter Tarell Alvin McCraney (Moonlight) are up to here. This is the only you’ll see in which the big reveal concerns an obscure civil rights book that’s more than 50 years old.

Everyone’s least favorite Ocean’s movie is better than it’s given credit for, and it might just be the most Soderbergh-playful: The scene where Bruce Willis thinks the character Julia Roberts is playing is actually Julia Roberts is straight out of the Soderbergh meta playbook. (Not surprisingly, Soderbergh considers this his favorite Ocean’s film.) The plot’s a little too twisty, though, particularly with a final act turn that sort of makes the rest of the movie pointless. Still: These movies, all three of them, remain compulsively watchable.

Soderbergh squeezes out one last ounce of fun from the series in this finale, which drops Julia Roberts but adds a gloriously sleazy Al Pacino as a Steve Wynn-type who might actually be the best villain of the entire series. (Inevitably, Andy Garcia’s Terry Benedict is now on their side.) The movie is tighter, and a little less meta than the last film, to its credit, as if Soderbergh heard the criticisms and decided to just go pure popcorn. The Ellen Barkin/Rusty Ryan story still doesn’t work, but it’s a fitting, pleasant conclusion.

16. And Everything Is Going Fine (2010)

Soderbergh’s posthumous tribute to Spalding Gray, made six years after his death, is another Soderbergh experiment, a documentary that has no narration or interviews. Instead, Soderbergh just worked with existing footage — Gray’s footage — to try and cobble together the life story of one of his heroes. The whole thing works magnificently, allowing Gray to essentially be his own eulogist. In a way, it feels like more of a Spalding Gray movie than the Spalding Gray movie Soderbergh actually made.

15. Kimi (2022)

It was inevitable that a filmmaker as nimble and fly-by-night as Soderbergh would want to do a pandemic movie: yet another fun challenge he can experiment with. This story — about an agoraphobe (a smart, focused Zoe Kravitz) who, while working as an audio consultant for an Amazon-like tech firm, may have stumbled across evidence of a murder — is light on its feet and clever; the pivot in its second half into more of a straightforward action movie/thriller is done ably and with considerable wit. (Chekov never had a nail gun in one of his plays, but if he had, this is how he would have done it.) Soderbergh can dash off these relatively minor straight-to-streaming one-offs with relative ease these days, but don’t confuse that ease with a lack of quality: Everything’s done better, and sharper, than just about anyone else would do it. And kudos to yet another superb Cliff Martinez score.

A movie about a seemingly unstoppable government operative, Haywire was actually born out of defeat. Soderbergh had just parted ways with Sony over its adaptation of Moneyball, and in the midst of his funk, the dejected director happened to catch MMA fighter Gina Carano on TV. “She had just lost her last [most recent] fight,” he later explained, “so it seemed like a good time for the two of us to get into a room, me having been fired and her having been beaten.” Out of that came a delightfully intense, stripped-down action-thriller in which Carano’s Mallory Kane gets double-crossed in Dublin, barely makes it out alive, and then spends the rest of the movie finding out who betrayed her. Haywire is quintessential Soderbergh during his “Wouldn’t it be fun if I tried this?” period, picking a non-professional as his lead — Carano did her own stunts — and bringing his considered, brainy tone to the action genre. The result is a movie that goes off like a firecracker and has as little lasting impact. But, c’mon, the plot and emotional oomph don’t much matter: It’s the sheer thrill of expertly choreographed up-close-and-personal fight scenes that goose the viewer along from sequence to sequence.

13. Logan Lucky (2017)

Soderbergh’s first film since his “retirement” feels like an old ballplayer stepping into the batting cage just to take a few practice swings, then proceeding to knock every pitch out of the park. A newscast in this film refers to Logan Lucky’s heist as “Ocean’s 7-11,” and while you smile at the meta joke, the film earns the comparison. Soderbergh has fun with his West Virginia redneck characters, but the joke is never on them: They’re all smarter and more on top of everything than anyone — including, at times, the audience — might give them credit for. Soderbergh has said he no longer wants to make “prestige” pictures, and instead just wants as many people to see and enjoy his movies as possible. If that’s the next step in his career, he is off to a fantastic start.

12. King of the Hill (1993)

At the time, this Depression-era coming-of-age tale, based on A. E. Hotchner’s memoir, was greeted with acclaim — but, also, a huge sigh of relief. After the promise of Sex, Lies, and Videotape — and the subsequent debacle of Kafka — Soderbergh fans were just grateful that their faith hadn’t been misplaced and that he wasn’t a one-hit wonder. Fairly conventional by his standards, King of the Hill is nonetheless a very affecting look at a young St. Louis boy (newcomer Jesse Bradford) who’s on his own after his mother is sent to the hospital for tuberculosis, his brother is shipped off to live with his aunt, and his father takes a job as a traveling salesman. Soderbergh and cinematographer Elliot Davis give this period drama a nostalgic glow, but that’s a bit of a feint: King of the Hill may look warm and wistful, but its story is actually rather unsentimental about the ways that the adult world can look positively frightening to kids — especially when it’s thrust upon them way too early in their lives. The movie was also a launching pad for Adrien Brody as our hero’s older buddy, and the cast includes future stars like Amber Benson, Katherine Heigl, and Lauryn Hill. King of the Hill was the first and only time Soderbergh would base a narrative around a child’s perspective — but it’s far too intelligent and nuanced to be thought of as just a kid’s movie.

11. Black Bag (2025)

There was no reason to think this suave, cheeky spy thriller would be one of Soderbergh’s best in many a moon. On its surface, Black Bag looked like another fun but disposable busman’s holiday for a filmmaker content to coast on his considerable technical skill and well-deserved laurels. Instead, we got an absolute banger: one of his most purely pleasurable romps, starring Michael Fassbender and Cate Blanchett as elite British agents who must find the mole in their midst. (Adding to the suspense, Blanchett may herself be the mole.) You can feel the sleekness of the director’s Ocean’s flicks and the inventiveness of Out of Sight pulsing through every frame, but rarely in recent years has he told a story with such endless inventiveness and sustained suspense. Plus, it’s really funny and sexy. Guy Ritchie has spent his entire career laboring to make a movie this entertaining — Soderbergh pulls it off like it’s no big thing.

10. Che (2008)

The movie that drove Soderbergh crazy — he still talks today about how much the film burned him out — turned out to be worth all the trouble. Often screened in two parts, but shown gloriously as one piece at festival screenings, Che features Benicio Del Toro’s most lived in, deeply felt, gimmick-free performance as the rebel who is neither lionized nor demonized by Soderbergh. The first half is maybe a little stronger than the second, but the whole thing holds up well. Soderbergh, for his own mental health, may never make another movie like it, but this is Soderbergh working on a vaster canvas with equal mastery.

9. The Limey (1999)

Soderbergh is in pure gritty crime mode with this almost-too-hip-for-any-room thriller about an English father (Terence Stamp) coming to America to track down the people who murdered his daughter. Soderbergh raises the level of difficulty here by having flashback sequences feature a young Stamp from the 1967 film Poor Cow, but the real star is 1999 Stamp, who is all snarl and righteous menace as the former hitman bent on revenge. The movie is more style than substance, but heavens, what style.

In a career of left turns, Soderbergh’s interest in telling a fictionalized version of Channing Tatum’s pre-Hollywood life as a male stripper stands among his oddest digressions. And yet, Magic Mike is pure pleasure — albeit pleasure flecked with melancholy recognition that its aging main character can’t keep doing this forever. Tatum is Mike, the top draw at the Xquisite, a strip club run by the grandiose Dallas (Matthew McConaughey). Mike likes the attention he gets from the ladies — and he especially likes the money — but he dreams of walking away from the business and doing something respectable, like selling custom-made furniture. Magic Mike has the intoxicating rush of a Scorsese film as Mike and his cohorts live it up as the kings of Tampa but — like in a Scorsese film — eventually drugs, egos and money ruin everything. Soderbergh is amused by this quirky little subculture, but there’s also a lot of compassion for Mike, a hunky Peter Pan on the cusp of growing up. McConaughey has never been better, while Tatum demonstrated that he had the sex appeal, depth, and understated comic timing to be more than just the Step Up heartthrob. As an added bonus, Magic Mike ended up being one of Soderbergh’s biggest hits — maybe not as slick as the Ocean’s movies, but certainly more touching.

7. The Girlfriend Experience (2009)

A film shot during the build-up to the 2008 presidential election — not to mention the global financial meltdown — Soderbergh’s character study received a lot of attention initially because of its supposedly gimmicky casting of adult film star Sasha Grey as a high-class Manhattan escort. Seen now, though, The Girlfriend Experience is a perfect encapsulation of what life felt like as the fate of the world’s economy hung in the balance. The movie is all about transactions — mostly between Grey’s chilly Christine and her rich clients — and both the audience and the characters are keenly aware of how money impacts every decision, whether it’s in a romantic relationship or regarding career choices. Grey may be a limited dramatic actress, but she ably conveys a character who has learned to turn herself into an emptied-out plaything for her customers — it’s an apt metaphor for a culture in which everyone is either a buyer or a seller.

6. Erin Brockovich (2000)

The most rousing, most conventional crowd-pleaser Soderbergh will ever make. But it’s striking how much this still feels like a Soderbergh film. It has his smart, confident touch, it’s rousing without lapsing into sentimentality and, showing off perhaps Soderbergh’s most underrated trait, it points a camera at a movie star and lets them movie star their ass off. You’ve seen this sort of movie a thousand times, but Soderbergh makes it all seem new. And when it doubt, he just puts Julia Roberts and Albert Finney in a room and let’s them take over. For such an independently minded director, Soderbergh is sometimes at his best when he is in pure Hollywood mode.

5. The Informant! (2009)

For as much as Soderbergh has been credited with helping to elevate George Clooney’s film career — creating the right platform for his suave, slightly smirking silver-screen persona — not enough has been said about the rapport he’s had with Clooney’s Ocean’s costar. Matt Damon has done some of his funniest, most exciting work in Soderbergh’s films — let’s take a moment to recall how great he is as the kept man in Behind the Candelabra — but the apex of their partnership has to be The Informant! Lots of Soderbergh films involve cons, but the most intricate happens here: The true-life story of Central Illinois executive Mark Whitacre (Damon) is nothing less than the tale of a man whose entire life is an artful lie he’s constructing for the world — and for you, the audience. Brilliantly playing with the concept of the unreliable narrator, The Informant! could be Soderbergh’s The King of Comedy, as Mark’s friendly voiceover slowly starts to reveal the depth of the man’s mental deterioration — it’s an entire movie dedicated to probing the agony behind a liar’s peppy smile. Between its faux-cheery Marvin Hamlisch score and Soderbergh’s seemingly counterintuitive use of stand-up comics in serious supporting roles, The Informant! constantly flaunts its phoniness, which ends up being a perfect way to critique the story’s theme of the lengths ordinary people will go to construct new, better versions of themselves.

4. Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)

It’s no insult to say that, in the years since Sex, Lies, and Videotape first hit theaters, Soderbergh has rarely topped it — even as his style has evolved and his technique only grown more dazzling and inventive. In truth, his debut is the very model of the Stunning First Feature, a groundbreaking planting of the flag that instantly cements a filmmaker’s name. The story behind Sex, Lies’ creation is now legend: A then-twentysomething unknown, Soderbergh wrote the script in eight days, inspired by the ugly end of a relationship. “I cut myself in quarters,” he would later say, meaning that the film’s four principal characters contained different parts of him. As such, Sex, Lies is an exquisite study of a married couple (Peter Gallagher and Andie MacDowell) whose sex life is on the brink. He’s having an affair with his wife’s sister (Laura San Giacomo) when his old college chum (James Spader) comes to town, advocating a belief that talking about sex is actually more satisfying than the physical act. Famously winning the Palme d’Or at Cannes over Spike Lee’s equally skilled Do the Right Thing, Soderbergh’s film now plays as a warning for a narcissistic society that soon would become more fascinated in documenting itself than in experiencing real life. In retrospect, Sex, Lies is one of the most straightforward things he’s ever done — and still one of the most insightful about people’s need to deceive and be deceived.

3. Ocean’s Eleven (2001)

Before he began production on his remake of the forgotten, Rat Pack-infused tale of some swingin’ Vegas crooks, Soderbergh referred to the project as “a wind-up toy.” There’s no more fitting description of this ace piece of star-powered studio moviemaking. No one had any right to expect much of this new Ocean’s Eleven, which on paper looked like a smug cavalcade of Hollywood royalty slumming their way through an ultra-stylish crime caper. And yet, the film stands as Soderbergh’s peak as a super-confident, give-‘em-a-show director. The man doesn’t entirely put away his auteurist idiosyncrasies, but here he allows his formidable skill with suspense, misdirection, and clockwork storytelling to take the lead. You don’t need a plot recap — the damn movie’s probably on cable right now — but let’s take a moment to remember how impossibly fun the whole enterprise was. Clooney finally wearing the Cary Grant comparisons as comfortably as he fills out that tux. Brad Pitt tapping into the goofball antics of his early career to play a cool guy who’s also a bit of a lovable dope. Matt Damon happily serving the Ringo Starr/younger brother role alongside his older costars. Andy Garcia at last getting the elegant villain role he’s always deserved. Revered icons Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould having an absolute ball. As for newcomer Julia Roberts, she shows a lot of promise — mark our words, she’s got “star” written all over her.

2. Traffic (2000)

Screenwriter Stephen Gaghan, a former addict, wanted to tell a story about the War on Drugs, but he was stuck after months of research and interviews. Then, he met Soderbergh, who was also interested in making something about the War on Drugs, suggesting the writer take a look at a British series called Traffik. From there came Traffic, which demonstrated the director’s talent for multi-pronged narratives that are both thrilling and thematically rich. This award-winning drama doesn’t pretend to have any answers, but it’s an exceedingly sober and intelligent look into how this unwinnable, maddening conflict ensnares so many lives and cuts across class and cultural barriers. Benicio Del Toro took home the Oscar for his role as a smart, savvy Mexican cop, but the film is the high-water mark for several of its actors, including Don Cheadle as a blasé DEA agent, Catherine Zeta-Jones as a kingpin’s wife suddenly thrust into a power position, and Michael Douglas as a judge who quickly learns how little he knows about America’s drug problem. The opposite of a message movie, Traffic is shot through with Soderbergh’s trademark detachment, which makes its chronicling of wasted lives and the endless hamster wheel of inefficient law enforcement all the more despairing.

1. Out of Sight (1999)

The film that announced Soderbergh as a top-shelf director of off-kilter-but-still-mainstream talent, and, notably, the first film that unlocked the cinematic charm of George Clooney (remember The Peacemaker?), Out of Sight manages to feel like a ’70s crime flick, a hip citizen of Tarantino-land, and a classic ’50s dames-and-fellas fedora thriller all at once. Soderbergh minces and matches genre here, but does it effortlessly — so effortlessly you’ll never notice. And the hotel-room scene remains a standard for movie sensuality still today. He’d swing bigger both before and after this movie, but this remains the one he got exactly right.

https://vulture.com,Dope Thief Premiere Recap: Let Me Tell You a Bedtime Story,https://www.vulture.com/article/dope-thief-recap-episode-1-jolly-ranchers.html,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 10:00:36 GMT","Dope Thief Jolly Ranchers Season 1 Episode 1 Editor’s Rating 4 stars * * * * Photo: Apple TV+

Philly’s looking extra-cold and gray for a cold open that puts the heat under us fast as Ray Driscoll (Brian Tyree Henry) and Manny Carvalho (Wagner Moura) — a couple of small-time Philadelphia crooks posing as DEA agents to rip off a humble drug operation — rush a house of unsuspecting drug runners and make out with a modest take. Henry and Moura argue about the necessity of hiring a third guy to watch the door with all the locked-in charisma we’ve come to expect from two of our greatest modern character actors and TV stars.

Sometimes a premise just sells itself, you know?

Based on Dennis Tafoya’s 2009 novel of the same name, Dope Thief starts strong and moves with the scrappy, fight-or-flight confidence of its protagonist, Ray. “Let me tell you a bedtime story,” Ray tells his captive audience as Manny ransacks the house. The “story” is of a young man who spent his formative years in juvie, then graduated to a stretch in federal prison when he turned 18. The young man in question, of course, is Ray himself — a perpetually abused, isolated, down-on-his-luck Black man with no path forward but to navigate, best he can, the stratified hustler’s ball that is the American rat race.

You really couldn’t think of a more apt canvas for Peter Craig — whose writing credits since his debut crime-drama feature The Town have included everything from The Hunger Games: Mockingjay (Parts 1 and 2 … Jesus, remember how often we were doing that back then?) to The Batman, Bad Boys for Life, and, most recently, Gladiator II — to return to the true-blue American crime story. Nor is there a better showcase for Henry’s singular talent, as yet criminally underutilized since Atlanta wrapped its GOAT-ed run.

The rest of the cast ain’t too shabby, either. Kate Mulgrew (my beloved Captain Janeway, am I right, fellow Trekkies?) is Theresa, Ray’s adoptive mother and his father Bart’s (Ving Rhames) “old lady” who took Ray in as a boy when his dad went to prison. She’s an ornery old Philly gal with a heart of gold and a ratty little dog named Shermy. Being an elite of the West Coast variety, my ear isn’t attuned to the East Coast accents to know how well Mulgrew’s Philly-ing her dialogue, but I’ll be damned if it isn’t working for me. Anyway, we come out of our cold open at Theresa’s house just as Ray drops in, inquiring about her bills and medical test results and establishing their hard-talking, soft-hearted rapport with each other. “Degenerate,” Theresa grumbles as Ray mentions Manny is about to pick him up “for work.” Ray is cagey about his “work” situation, and Theresa is cagey about her bills and medical results, but she sends him out the door with a cupcake for his birthday, which is reminiscent of his first birthday in her care.

“Just because we’re not real law enforcement doesn’t mean we’re not professional,” Ray explains to Rick (Spenser Granese), an old frenemy of Ray’s from prison who might have a new business proposition for our guys. He and Manny engage in a little tag-team exposition that gives us the lay of their land, their game, and their dynamic as friends and actual partners in crime. The snappy back-and-forth intercut with a montage of them committing their robberies in DEA disguise demonstrates all the careful planning and moment-of-truth bravado they say is required for their particular line of work. On a technical level, the scene is not unlike Ray and Manny’s operation itself — economical, efficient, and immersive, if not a little slap-and-dash feeling.

All right, all right, I get it, Rick intimates with his reaction to their little spiel. Ray and Manny have a good thing going — not big enough to attract actual attention from the Feds, nor with the type of low-level drug runners who have any recourse. Plus, they don’t feel it too much of a stretch to see themselves as local Robin Hoods (despite the fact that they ain’t stealing from the rich and aren’t exactly reinvesting their income back into the community). In any case, Rick argues they’re bound to draw unnecessary heat in the city if they keep this up. But out in the country, where he operates, there are slightly bigger fish worth frying with a fraction of the burn risk.

Against his better judgment and Manny’s apprehension, Ray decides to take Rick up on the job. Manny’s a little shaken by the feeling of his “side hustle” taking up more and more oxygen. His girlfriend, Sherry (Liz Caribel Sierra), is moving in with him, and the elevating stakes aren’t sitting well with his current matrix of Catholic guilt and justification for his criminal deeds. Not even the Patron Saint of Thieves hanging around his neck can sanction the path they’re looking down. For Ray, the mortal stakes lie in not taking the bigger job (and bigger payout). Theresa needs $10,000 and she won’t tell him why, but he thinks the medical tests and bills at her house have something to do with it.

Here’s where we come up with a well-placed, economically applied character-study montage for Ray, who narrates the proceedings from his floor chair at an AA meeting. We learn that Ray’s sobriety is shaky at best, and the path foisted upon him early in life has led him to an alienated, somewhat antisocial existence. “Sometimes you just don’t want to see,” he says of the times his father would lock him in a closet to keep his son from seeing him get high. Ray is an incredibly empathetic human being on the run from his own spiritual sight, as demonstrated when he stakes out the country drug house and his focus shifts to Mina (Marin Ireland), one of the alleged cookers they’re about to rob: “I felt like I knew exactly who she was, ’cause I could feel the cage she’d put herself in.”

Ridley Scott, the consummate workman auteur-curmudgeon and occasional Apple TV hired gun, directs “Jolly Ranchers” like it’s a bona fide 21st-century Ridley Scott joint. Back in American Gangster territory. Not necessarily the man’s strongest arena, but neither is the, uh, gladiatorial arena these days (I dug Gladiator II, by the way, just as an intriguing mess). But Scott’s economical, quick-draw commercial style is well suited for the modern TV arena, as is his ability to usher in a straightforward tone for a well-positioned cast. Black-and-white images of a traumatic past show us a girl from school, taken in a car accident with a young Ray behind the wheel.

We’re well set up, both emotionally and cinematically, for a killer robbery gone wrong by the time we get to the big finale. Again, props to Scott and the crew for executing a memorable piece of grimy True Detective–esque chaos and bloodshed. The shit hits the fan when a tweaked-out Rick slips his trigger finger and shoots his captive cooker through the head. Mina, who’s giving some serious cop with her straight ’n’ true pistol’s aim and authoritative exclamation of “Like hell you’re fuckin’ Feds,” fires at Rick, who immediately returns another round and hits Mina in the neck. She makes it out of the house alive, while Ray and Manny make it out with a big black bag full of money and several aloe vera bottles of liquid meth. And they’re mere miles away from the place when an ominous voice (that sounds so much like the Ghostface voice from Scream I had to Google it to make sure it wasn’t — odd but, I must say, very effective choice) crackles through the other end of their cheap walkie-talkies. The voice’s direct, cool, but impassioned threats on their lives make it clear: They’ve just ripped off some major players in the drug war. Neither real cops nor real hustlers, theirs has always been an ethereal criminality, moving like ghosts between worlds, no waves made. “Until now,” they realize in unison.

Bottom of the Bag

• Meanwhile, Mina wakes up in the hospital with a pair of other police officers filling her in on what’s going on. With her voice knocked out of commission, she furiously writes a series of curse-ridden demands — an iron will unencumbered by the weakened state of the body that houses it — chief among them, “KEEP MY COVER.” Had my eye on her as a venerable screen presence since I saw her in the indie-horror joint The Dark and the Wicked. Couldn’t think of a more exciting choice for the resident anti-hero cop and mirror to our anti-hero criminal, Ray.

• I couldn’t help but think of Gene Hackman’s passing when watching this first episode — not only one of the great American screen actors but a frequent fixture of the type of ’70s crime flicks for which Dope Thief, The Penguin, and other shows like it are the modern comp. Watching Brian Tyree Henry and Wagner Moura play off each other in this joint is uncannily reminiscent of watching Hackman and Roy Scheider in The French Connection, or Dustin Hoffman and Gary Busey in Straight Time. And there’s no question Brian Tyree Henry’s unique abilities as an actor tap into the same deep well of screen presence and emotional integrity that flowed through Hackman’s work, no matter how flawed the character. If there’s anyone worth passing the Hackman baton to in today’s media landscape, it’s Henry.

• Hey, folks! Looking forward to recapping another killer crime show with y’all. Last we spoke, I was recapping The Penguin, and obsessed as I am with the Gotham crime saga in all its iterations, it’s great to be back on the beat with a solid crime story that doesn’t require a comic-book overlay to do its thing.",vulture

“Thanksgiving (Canada)” is available to stream now via Paramount+; it will make its Showtime network premiere on Sunday.

Why, hello. A new group has just entered the Yellowjackets chat. And this new blood promises a shake-up that might just bring everything back to life. (Well. Except for Ben, who is very dead.)

A lot happened in “Thanksgiving (Canada),” an episode written by real-life married couple Emily St. James and Libby Hill. Prior to joining Yellowjackets, St. James and Hill were well-known, sharp-eyed TV critics, so when they were added to the writing staff for this season, I was super-psyched. Their first writing credit on the series does not disappoint, but there are some highs and lows to the whole affair.

First up, we need to talk about Ben. I swear that his fate will haunt me for the rest of my days. What the Yellowjackets do to him is unconscionable. In the aftermath of Akilah’s vision, they’ve tied him up outside 24/7 in the pen that also houses the animals. He doesn’t get to move. He doesn’t get to bathe or change his filthy clothing. He gets very minimal interaction with others. He is losing his mind and just wants to die. Honestly, this is some Game of Thrones–level torture. As months elapse and summer turns into fall, the group just lets Ben lie on the ground in complete psychic and physical misery. They have stripped him of any shred of humanity and are somehow surprised when he stops eating so he can just die already.

The wilderness group has made a lot of moral sacrifices in the name of survival, so the only one who seems to be sensitive to Ben’s suffering is Natalie. And, still, she allows it to happen because it’s what the group wants. Yellowjackets often touches on the idea of how destructive groupthink can be on individuals, and the situation with Ben underscores how twisted the concept of right and wrong can become when peer pressure is applied. Things are surely going to get more depraved in the forest (see the ritual from the premiere that we still haven’t seen in real time), but the way they treat Ben in his final days is abhorrent and appalling. When he stops eating, no one suggests that maybe they treat him like a person (!) by letting him bathe and maybe allowing him to stay in one of the shelters. Instead, Misty leads a crew to force-feed him through a tube. (Where did they get this magical plastic feeding tube? I don’t know!)

The idea that Ben is a “bridge home” gives the group hope for rescue, but months elapse during this episode, and no one is making any actual moves to get home. Yet again, I’m left asking what else the group is doing other than banking on Akilah’s cave vision and Ben’s good-luck juju. However, the grim force-feeding situation becomes the last straw for Natalie, who seems to be the only Yellowjacket left with any sort of internal moral compass. As the leader, she has more agency than the other girls, and she also knows that mercy killing Ben will lead to larger problems. She does it anyway.

In the dark of night, Natalie heads over to the animal pen. Travis sees her and briefly tries to stop her but then realizes that what she’s doing is the right thing. (Also, does he feel guilty about steering the group to follow Akilah’s visions? It sure seems like it.) He offers to keep a lookout for her, and Natalie enters the pen. Ben wakes in a panic but is instantly relieved to see Natalie there with a knife. She moves to slit his throat and Ben — the man who patiently taught all of these girls how to hunt and live off of the land — nudges her hand toward his heart instead. As Natalie moves to stab his heart, he whispers a relieved “thank you.” His death is quick and, compared to the horrors he’s been experiencing as a prisoner in the camp, relatively painless.

When the rest of the girls discover what Natalie has done, it seems as if they might beat her to death. We know her demise in the wilderness is not possible as we once had an acerbic and regretful Natalie in the adult timeline (we miss you terribly, Juliette Lewis!), but the group finds a different way to knock her down. Lottie proposes that Natalie be stripped of her title and that the merciless and vicious Shauna should lead them instead. The group tacitly agrees to this new arrangement. Shauna’s first role as leader is to dole out a punishment for Natalie. There will be a feast honoring Coach Scott, and Natalie will prepare it.

So, it seems that Shauna is now the Antler Queen, no? Now that we’ve had two other queens — Lottie as the unofficial leader and Natalie as an official one — it remains uncertain if Shauna will be “the” queen as we move toward the Pit Girl scene from the premiere, but it’s feeling like she might just stay in power for a long time to come. However, even though it seems like Shauna has no mercy, she does offer some pointers to Natalie as she starts to carve up Coach’s body for the Ben-B-Q.

It’s certainly of note that the group chooses to consume Ben instead of just giving him a proper burial, and this marks a pointed transition for the group as a whole. They have other food to eat. There’s an entire pen of Akilah’s goats and bunnies and ducks, and they have been trapping plenty of wild game as well. As the feast begins, we’re left to wonder if they’re eating Ben because they really think it’s the best way to honor their Coach or because they think it’s what the wilderness wants.

Death is everywhere on Yellowjackets. In the present-day timeline, Shauna comes home from her citizen-detective stint in the city and tells Jeff that Lottie is dead. (That she didn’t call him to inform him of this loss — or the reason for her absence — earlier just illustrates how very little she thinks of anyone but herself.) Callie overhears this and runs into her room to give Shauna the mystery tape that she found in the premiere. Shauna’s hackles go up, and she immediately comes to the conclusion that someone is trying to kill her and maybe all of the other surviving Yellowjackets as well.

The Sadecki family goes to hide out at the Jolly Hitcher. Shauna reaches out to Van (via Tai, because she and Van were never that tight) and asks her if she has a DAT player. She says she does and agrees to deliver it to her ASAP. Van and Tai have also been hiding out at a hotel, albeit a much nicer one than the Jolly Hitcher, and Tai is on a Treat Yo’ Self binge, pampering herself with oodles of spa treatments (bedazzled nails!) and the most expensive items on the room-service menu. Van is a bit put off by all of this, but she’s reluctantly along for the ride. When Van questions her about it all, Tai basically says that her life is in a tailspin and she’s just trying to control what she can control.

This spiraling self-care angle generally makes sense, but during the episode, Van experiences two odd communications from Tai that suggest that something else might be going on here. First, when Van searches for the DAT player, she finds an old light-up cradle phone that rings even though it’s not plugged into a jack. She answers, and she hears Tai’s panicked voice say, “Van? Um … I can’t … Help.” Later, Tai jolts up in bed, screaming, “Van! Van, please! You gotta help me!” These two cries for help are curious and perhaps telling of the struggle that’s going on inside Tai at the moment. As we learned last week, “Other” Tai comes out in moments of intense emotion (e.g., sex, anxiety about having to shoot Ben) and when she sleeps. The missive from the phone is odd, especially as it feels like a hallucination on Van’s part, but the idea that Tai might be getting pulled in two different directions as her life crumbles is certainly curious.

Van and Tai finally start to find a place in the larger narrative as they meet up with Shauna to listen to the tape. When the women press play on the tape, we hear an unidentified woman say, “Testing, testing, one, two, three …,” then the next thing we hear is all the wilderness teens howling and cackling, much like we see them do at the conclusion of the episode. The women are kind of floored that the tape exists, with Van saying that the people who know about the tape are either dead or in the car (this is Misty erasure), but then Shauna finds out that Callie has been recording the conversation and bolts.

Misty, for her part, is doing more detective work. With the help of two bags of garbage that Walter delivers to her via limo (?), Misty finds a clue. An empty Chinese-food container leads her to a restaurant where she finds Lisa. You remember Lisa, right? Maybe not. It’s been a while. Lisa was Lottie’s acolyte, whom Misty tried to kill during their adult “hunt” at the end of last season. Misty missed and ended up killing Natalie with her syringe full of fentanyl instead, a point that Lisa reiterates to Misty during their meeting in this episode. Lisa says that she doesn’t really care about any of it; she just wants to live her life. The day Lottie died, she had given Lisa $50,000 in cash and a note that read, “I’m sorry.” Lisa also tells Misty that she saw Tai with Lottie the day she died. Interesting.

As Lottie’s influence is so strong in the wilderness — she’s the one who makes the unilateral decision to make Shauna leader in the wake of Natalie’s perceived betrayal — it’s starting to make sense why the show wouldn’t want her adult counterpart snooping around in the present. Lottie works best as an enigma, a cipher for the beliefs and the often capricious actions of the group. As the episode ends, we linger on the Ben-B-Q feast, with Lottie becoming increasingly agitated that Ben’s fate didn’t seem to match Akilah’s vision. And then, all of a sudden, it does.

Following Lottie’s lead, all the girls begin to chant and scream and dance around the fire, with the iconic eerie vocal chanting from the score joining in. It seems as if the episode might just end on this beat — the team going full feral-wilderness girls, bellies full of their ex-coach — when Lottie spies something through the trees. At first, she thinks it’s Ben. In a Lord of the Flies–coded shot that puts Ben’s hacked-off head in the foreground, a man steps into the frame, lifts his hand, and says a cautious “hello.” He appears to be with at least one other person. Lottie’s reaction to this shocking development is instant and cutting. “No!” she shrieks. However, as the camera pans around to take in all of the other Yellowjackets’ reactions, there’s a wide variety of emotions: Shauna is in shock. Van is full of delight. And Natalie seems overcome with emotion.

And then? The man looks down, spots Ben’s bloody head, and freaks out. End scene.

Is this it? Are we finally getting rescued?! This introduction of “Others” in the wilderness has the potential to energize the plot and move things in a different direction than various iterations of survival tactics and wilderness worship, and it will certainly also shake up the social dynamics of the group as a whole. What will they do now that someone else has witnessed their barbaric feast? Well, that’s a question for next week.

Buzz, Buzz, Buzz

• The man who approaches the Yellowjackets’ camp is played by Nelson Franklin. I know him as the sweet Robby from New Girl and the constantly put-upon Will from Veep, but you might know him from a million things because he’s a dude who stays working. He has great comedic timing (see his amazing reaction to a random man’s head on an altar in the middle of the wilderness), and I’m excited to see more of him as the season progresses.

• I’m not too sure what’s going on with Callie this season, but when she reminds Shauna that she’s the same age as she was when they were in the wilderness, it reminded me of a therapy concept. When our kids reach the age that we were when we experienced certain traumas, we are likely to revisit those traumas as well. This is totally happening to Shauna, even if she doesn’t want to admit it. Although random people are cutting her brakes and leaving threatening tapes at her door, so there’s that, too.

• I’ve talked before about how much I adore Elijah Wood and how curious I am to see what’s happening with the Walter story line, but things have been dragging here. Something needs to happen with his character soon, or I fear I will completely lose interest. Did Walter kill Lottie? Is he looking to kill Misty for some sort of revenge? Give us a reason for this man’s continued presence on the show, please!

• I’m a bit confused about the title of this episode, “Thanksgiving (Canada).” I guess it serves to mark time — if we take the title at face value, it’s mid-October 1997 now, approximately 16 months after they’ve crashed, and we know they were in the wilderness for a total of 19 months, so we’re close to rescue but not totally there yet —and I guess instead of a turkey, they’re having roasted Ben for their celebration?

• What part of Ben do you think Lottie is gnawing on when she starts chanting? Do we even want to know?

• If Ben didn’t start the cabin fire, then who did?",vulture

I spent a brutal 90 seconds trying to engineer some sort of “Are men OK?” joke around the fact that the Criterion Channel is streaming seven of Michael Mann’s best movies this March, and then I gave up because the sooner I finish putting together this article, the sooner I can go rewatch “Heat” (and “Thief,” and “Manhunter,” and at least the first 20 minutes of “Ali”).

But that isn’t the only flavor of masculinity that Criterion is offering this month, as the streamer has also prepared a selection of “we’re too tough for lights and tripods” classics from the annals of Dogme 95, including Thomas Vinterberg’s “The Celebration” and Lars von Trier’s “Dancer in the Dark,” a singular masterpiece that was already a complicated thing to love even before it… became an even more complicated thing to love.

For a slightly more enviable sort of masculine energy, there’s always Jean Gabin, whose romantic beauty — on full display in the likes of “Port of Shadows” and “La bête humane” — anchors the Channel’s deep and intoxicating retrospective of French Poetic Realism, which spans from Julien Duvivier’s “Mother Hummingbird” in 1929 to Yves Allégret’s “Such a Pretty Little Beach” 20 years later. And what about “Mickey 17” star Steven Yeun’s absolutely shredded lats in “Burning,” one of six incredible Lee Chang-dong movies coming to the Channel this month? Toxic masculinity has never looked better.

OK, apologies to “Misericordia” director Alain Guiralde, whose “Stranger on the Lake” has plenty to say on the subject of male bodies (streaming alongside five of his other films), but this awful “man” bit desperately needs to die — even if the series devoted to Best Supporting Actor nominees would provide plenty of grist for the mill (Kirk Douglas in “The Bad and the Beautiful,” Ethan Hawke in “Boyhood,” etc.).

The most exciting film that’s new to the Criterion Channel this month is, of course, by and about women. Payal Kapadia’s effervescently profound “All We Imagine as Light” may have been screwed out of the Oscars, but this unforgettable romance about a pair of Mumbai nurses will get its due all the same, as the exclusive streaming premiere of this Sideshow release is a prelude to its inevitable inclusion in the Criterion Collection proper.

As the little blue bus pulls up to Lumon’s office building, Ms. Huang (Sarah Bock) looks more childlike than ever. A drooping bookbag hangs from her back. Puffy earmuffs frame her plump cheeks. Whatever administrative authority she wielded on the severed floor is gone, and in its place is the apprehension of a young girl moving to a new place. Whether Ms. Huang knows where she’s going is less important than the sudden displacement itself (though Svalbard’s proximity to the North Pole may clarify Mr. Milchik’s irritations with his would-be successor). Tonight, rather than sleep in her room, next door to her parents, she will be napping on a plane before spending night after night at the Gunnel Eagan Empathy Center. She may have her same bed, as Mr. Milchick (Tramell Tillman) suggests, but what comfort a consistent mattress provides pales in comparison to a stable adolescence at home. A real home.

Miss Huang may be alone on her journey, but she’s not the only one stepping out into the great unknown. Episode 9, “The After Hours,” sees each of the Macrodata Refiners take a major leap of faith. Some, like Miss Huang, feel they don’t have a choice. Others choose to live or die rather than take a risk. One does roll the dice, while one other employee simply has to see how deep the rabbit hole goes, no matter where it takes her.

So let’s start with her. Dan Erickson bookends Episode 9 with Helena and Helly (Britt Lower) alongside their paternal and professional father, Jame Eagan (Michael Siberry). In the opening sequence, Helly’s morning swim leads to a peculiar breakfast supervised by her strange papa. Slicing her hard-boiled egg into sixths and spreading them evenly across a plate adorned with a worried young lad being held to his seat by two elders, Helly voluntarily holds her chair and consumes her eggs (a coveted treat among severed workers) as Jame looks on, groaning ominously. “I wish you take them raw,” he tells her before leaving.

When we see the reigning Lumon CEO again, he’s sneaking up on Helly at work as she tries to memorize directions to the black hallway. “You tricked me,” he says. “My Helly.” “What the fuck?,” she responds, sliding the instructions under her keyboard. WTF, indeed. Why Jame is visiting the severed floor remains a mystery, but Helly’s mission isn’t. Alone in the office, with Mark’s (Adam Scott) whereabouts unknown, Irving (John Turturro) fired, and Dylan (Zach Cherry) quitting, Helly pushes ahead with the plan to save Gemma (Dichen Lachman). She needs answers. She needs independence, and if the pursuit of both means fending off a few Lumon weirdos who want to scare her, stop her, or worse, she’ll try. If it means risking it all, she will. If she has to go after it alone, she goes.

Little does she know, she’s not alone. Out in the wilderness, Mark’s Outie is reluctantly embracing his own plan to save Gemma. Well, it’s more like Devon’s (Jen Tullock) plan, or maybe Harmony’s (Patricia Arquette) plan, but it’s the only plan he’s got. Neither sibling is under any delusion of control. On their way to the meet-up, they debate whether to go through with it without ever questioning the facts. They don’t trust Harmony. They’ve given her far more information than she’s given them, and she’s complicit in whatever has happened (and could still happen) to Gemma. But they need her. “There is literally no other option than to do what the fuck she says right now,” Devon says. “For Gemma. She knows where she is, Mark.”

“Literally no other option” may be pushing it a bit — cops could be called, a private investigator could be hired, a small army of severed workers could be recruited to overthrow the Lumon board — but if what Cobel says about Cold Harbor is true (that they have to find Gemma before it’s completed), then they don’t have time for any of that. Harmony is promising them a way into Lumon right now. Wouldn’t they be more foolish to refuse it than to take it?

Irving faces a similar question. While he wants to stay and find out if he and Burt’s (Christopher Walken) Outies can rediscover the romance they shared as Innies, he’s also got a one-way ticket to safety. Burt is offering him a way out. They wouldn’t be together, but Irving wouldn’t be in danger either, as it’s implied he is now, if he stays. Is it more foolish to stay and hope to rekindle a love neither of them can remember, than to go and find love somewhere else, with someone else, without the peril?

In Season 1, Burt and Irving’s arc ended with Irving attending Burt’s retirement party at Lumon. There, Irving fought for his man, and Burt calmed him down, shook his hand, and said goodbye. They accepted their separate fates… until Irving couldn’t stand it any longer. In Season 2, will Burt and Irving’s arc end the same way? At at train station, with Irving fighting for the love he’s never had, being told no, and sent off on his lonely road with nothing more than a handshake? Will he again come back to Burt, pounding on his front door, refusing to let go of his first and only love?

Dylan also shoots his shot, and Dylan also falls short. After Gretchen (Merritt Wever) tells Dylan’s Outie about the kiss she shared with his Innie, the latter’s subsequent freak-out leads to the former’s return to isolation. Gretchen informs Dylan’s Innie she can’t see him anymore, and as sweet as his marriage proposal proves to be — he made an engagement ring out of a finger trap — it’s an empty gesture. He can’t give her the life he promises, even if he does treat her better than his Outie. He’s an Innie. He lives at work. She can’t live there with him — her Innie wouldn’t know either Dylan — and he can’t leave.

Dylan has come a long way since we first met him. Obsessing over meaningless titles (Refiner of the Month!) and clinging to his vague proficiency (he’s good at his job but he also doesn’t know what he’s doing?), everything changed the night when Dylan woke up in his closet and saw his Outie’s son. The knowledge that his other half had a wife and kids awakened a part of Dylan’s Innie that had been buried under a pile of perks. Pencil erasers and caricature portraits just aren’t enough anymore, not when genuine love and affection are on the table, and losing Gretchen is a bridge too far for a family man denied his family.

So Dylan quits. Despite Helly’s pleas to stay — for Irving, for her, for the greater good — his heartbreak is too much to bear. He fills out the paperwork, he shoulders Mr. Milchick’s disapproval, and he steps onto the elevator, not knowing when or if he’ll wake up again. While Irving chooses to live rather than risk death to be with Burt, Dylan chooses to die rather than risk living without his family (an Innie’s death, to be clear, but a fatal choice nonetheless). Now, their fates are tied to Mark, Helly, and Harmony (give or take a Devon). Will their leaps of faith land on firm ground, or will the unknown remain frustratingly out of reach? Here’s hoping everyone, somehow, finds their way home.

Grade: B+

“Severance” releases new episodes Fridays on Apple TV+. The Season 2 finale is set for Friday, March 21.

Further Refinement:

• For those of you keeping track, the remaining MDR employee referenced in the second paragraph — the one who rolls the dice — is Mr. Milchick, who chooses to stand up to Mr. Drummond (Ólafur Darri Ólafsson) even if it leads to more paper clipping torture sessions (or his outright dismissal). Chastised for using big words again, Mr. Milchick apologizes once but refuses to do so again. Instead, he tells him to “devour feculence,” which he also translates “mon-o-syll-ab-ic-ally” to “eat shit.” Goddamn, I love a bitchy Milchick. Switch sides, my man!

• “I’m sorry, the wind was whistling over the hole in the back of your skull, so I didn’t quite get that. Did you just call my plan a fucking mistake?” Oh, Devon. In another world, you and Mark could’ve carried a multi-cam sitcom about a brother and sister who go on crazy adventures together. Never change.

Code Detectors:

• “We’re seeing to Mr. Bailiff.” Helena’s bizarre breakfast included a tip-off toward Irving’s fate, but how to interpret it is still up for debate. Taken one way, Helena saying they’ll “see to” Irving could mean she dispatched Burt to escort him out of town. After all, Burt’s intentions have been suspicious all season. This week, he says his old job was “driving people places,” and Irving asks, “Is that what today is?” It sure could be! Burt never answers, just like he doesn’t answer later when Irving asks if Lumon will come after him for “helping” Irving get out of town. Perhaps the answer is that he’s not helping. Perhaps he’s just back on the job again. Perhaps he never left.

But this brings up an old bugaboo of mine: We all know Christopher Walken is a great actor, but is Burt? He would have to be if he’s been lying to Irving this whole time, especially when they say their grief-stricken goodbyes at the station. And I’m sorry, but drivers don’t have to be great liars, and former “goons” probably shouldn’t be emotionally adept enough to channel such exacting emotions just to get a guy on a train. So I think Burt was likely ordered to drive Irving somewhere — just not the train station.",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,Todd Solondz on ‘Palindromes’ Restoration and His Stalled ‘Love Child’: ‘It Could Happen Tomorrow… or It Could Never Happen’,https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/todd-solondz-love-child-palindromes-restored-1235103650/,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 15:00:00 GMT","Indie filmmaker Todd Solondz has for over four decades batted off ratings battles, jeers and boos at film festivals, and censorship controversies for his unflinching and scaldingly funny deadpan dioramas of American suburban life.

He’s found comedy in the darkest places and the most messed-up people, whether a father of three (Dylan Baker) who’s also a pedophile in “Happiness,” a middle-school social outcast (Heather Matarazzo) in “Welcome to the Dollhouse,” or a Hispanic housekeeper who poisons her employers with carbon monoxide in “Storytelling.” His 1998 “Happiness” shocked Cannes with its bleak sexuality and cringe characters, compelling even the Sundance Film Festival to refuse to screen it.

The pressure was on after the cult classic — recently burnished in 4K by the Criterion Collection — for Solondz to follow its winning formula. After the follow-up “Storytelling,” he brought to Venice “Palindromes,” a disturbing comedy about a 13-year-old girl desperate to have a baby. She’s played by eight actors of varying ages and races, from Black star Sharon Wilkins to even Jennifer Jason Leigh at one point. The film is now back in theaters courtesy of Monument Releasing and a new restoration from Visit Films, produced in conjunction with MoMA.

Hardly a box-office hit when released by the since-shuttered Wellspring in April 2005, following its Venice premiere, “Palindromes” picked up mixed reviews but remains a droll, curious gem in the New York director’s filmography. And the movie, in its early stretches, features a Solondz signature: Directing children in sex scenes.

“I like working with children. I like working with grown-ups. Some are more pleasant and easier to work with than others, but somehow, it works out this way,” Solondz told IndieWire. “It’s true that my young actors are never old enough to really understand or be given permission to watch the movies they act in. I remember at the ‘Palindromes’ cast and crew screening, every one of the kids, I think they all showed up, with their families. Who knows what they understood or didn’t understand. I did see some of the little ones whispering into their parents’ ears at different points of the movie, but kids can do that even when they’re watching a Disney movie. It’s hard to know what they did or didn’t understand, but certainly, none of these kids would be in the movies if these parents didn’t not only approve but support the whole process.”

The film opens with the funeral of “Welcome to the Dollhouse” protagonist Dawn Wiener, who committed suicide after becoming pregnant from a date rape at age 20. Her cousin, Aviva (played by the young Valerie Shusterov in this sequence), has sex with a neighbor boy Judah (Robert Agri) to the horror of her mother (Ellen Barkin), who demands an abortion that ends up sterilizing Aviva. The rest of “Palindromes” becomes a kind of quirky road movie as Aviva is played by different actors after escaping her home and hooking up with the wrong people.

“No kid can understand the way an adult understands it, but they have their own ability to get through the material because of the emotional connection they make with the scene,” Solondz said. “Just as children use language they don’t understand in real life just because that’s the currency they’re familiar with. That doesn’t seem alien to me at all. There was a great deal of affection for all these kids, and I am not aware of any of them having regrets or feeling exploited or degraded in any way. On that front, I’ve always felt that the exploitation, really, with children, happens much more commonly when you see them shilling for a Gap commercial or something like that, than doing something that has an emotional value for them.”

As for mixed reviews on any of his films, Solondz said, “I always prefer if people like the movie. I have a weak moral fiber. If the people say nice things, I feel better, and if they don’t, I feel worse, but nothing lasts. I swing with the moves of what others have to say. But I know that if I am going to value the complimentary things, I have to equally accept the critical ones, the critical commentary. Just because someone says something positive doesn’t mean I have to agree with their point of view. I don’t think it matters whether or not I agree. I am pleased with what I’ve been able to put together. I know I’ve always had a very limited audience, but I’ve always been appreciative that I have an audience at all.”

Solondz, who when not behind the camera or writing teaches multiple film courses at New York University, has not released a film since 2016’s “Wiener-Dog,” an “Au Hasard Balthazar”-esque odyssey of animal exploitation about a dachshund’s interactions with dysfunctional people. Since last year, Solondz has been struggling to nail down financing for his first film in nearly a decade, “Love Child,” set to star Elizabeth Olsen and Charles Melton. Principal photography was meant to start in New York City and Texas until the production was forced to call it quits due to a lack of funding. (Meanwhile, the Russo Brothers supposedly got $320 million for their critically loathed Netflix tentpole “The Electric State.”)

Volution Media Partners and Gramercy Park Media were financing the project, which was set up at Killer Films (which also produced “Happiness”) and 2AM.

“There have been developments,” he said of “Love Child,” which he describes as an ode to the Hollywood movies he grew up on, though he’s mum on plot details beyond that. “It’s hard to say if it’s two steps forward or one step back or vice versa. It could happen tomorrow, it could happen in three months, or it could never happen. I just don’t know. It’s out of my control whether or not the movie happens. I have another project as well, but I don’t want to make that one yet. So I haven’t had a lot of good luck in getting it off the ground, but being older, you can accept this more stoically than you can when you’re 30 years younger.”

He added, “There just wasn’t enough money. It’s not inspired by Oedipus. I can say it’s, unlike the other movies I’ve made, it’s a movie that does have a plot, and is very much a kind of celebration or a love letter to a lot of Hollywood movies that I grew up with.”

In a moment for independent filmmakers getting crushed by studio bean counters, the push toward spectacle, and narrowing theatrical windows, Solondz said, “I can’t say [the state of filmmaking] feels more dire. This movie, if the budget were smaller, I think, it wouldn’t be such a challenge, but that’s the way it is. Look, I’m old, so I feel like I’m lucky I’ve got to do what I’ve done. I hope I can continue. There’s always suspense until you’re actually there on set. You just don’t know. Even when you are on set, things happen. It’s the nature of filmmaking when you’re not making a studio film. You’re vulnerable to the whims of fortune.”

The restored “Palindromes,” produced by Visit Films in conjunction with the Museum of Modern Art, is now playing at IFC Center courtesy Monument Releasing and will arrive digitally on May 20.",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,Explaining ‘The Substance’ Academy Awards Dispute Over the Recipients of the Hair and Makeup Oscar,https://www.indiewire.com/features/craft/the-substance-academy-award-hair-makeup-dispute-1235103642/,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 00:59:51 GMT","Although otherwise “The Substance” had monstrous luck at the 2025 Academy Awards, Coralie Fargeat’s horror film starring Demi Moore did walk away with one Oscar for Best Hair and Makeup Design, as it was favored to do. Now, however, producer Nicolas Royer has weighed in on acrimony between members of the hair and makeup team that has been brewing both before and after the Oscar ceremony.

You might well think that an entire team would qualify equally for an Academy Award; or that one single representative, the department head, would automatically be the nominee for an Oscar category. But each Hair and Makeup nomination is limited to three nominees. This in part reflects the complex way that prosthetics, hair design, and conventional makeup all work together to transform actors into characters and still caps the number of award winners. But it’s a complicated compromise.

The nominees aren’t just self-selected, either. The Academy’s Makeup and Hair Branch Executive Committee goes through the packets submitted for awards consideration by individual artists and decides, based on materials submitted and interviews, which three artisans will be the nominees for each film. This vote is private. In the case of “The Substance,” the nominees were special makeup effects designer Pierre-Olivier Persin, key makeup artist Stéphanie Guillon, and key hair artist Marilyne Scarselli.

Key hair artist and hair department head, Frédérique Arguello, has been saying publicly that she was unduly passed over for Scarselli, her assistant, who took over as a key hair artist for 15 days at the end of the shoot, notably on Elizabeth’s and Sue’s (Margaret Qualley) final form. At the Critics Choice Awards, Arguello won as part of the hair and makeup team and won for “The Substance” at the MUAHs. Both Arguello and Scarselli were part of the team that won at the BAFTAs, so it is the Academy limitation that has created the issue.

Arguello reached out to IndieWire to say she respects the Academy and does not blame them for what is happening. “We were not complementary but formed a team respecting the hierarchy as it has always been established on film sets. With the final nominations announced, Coralie Fargeat and Nicolas Royer felt the need to send a letter to ensure that the nomination was attributed, in their own words, ‘the right person receives the nomination,'” Arguello said. “Unfortunately, the nominations of this great and respectful institution had already been publicly announced.”

Now, as reported by Deadline and obtained by IndieWire, Royer has sent a letter to the Association of Production Managers to defend Scarselli from being blacklisted, writing “Frédérique Arguello and Marilyne Scarselli both held the position of Head Hairdresser on the film ‘The Substance.’ Frédérique intervened more in preparation for the search for looks and during part of the shooting. Marilyne took care of the main actresses more, in conjunction with the Special Makeup Effects team.”

Royer and the Association of Production Managers did not respond to IndieWire’s request for comment. Scarselli could not be reached for comment. The Academy had no comment.

The special makeup effects are, in many ways, the black heart and shriveled, self-hating soul of “The Substance.” On an episode of the Filmmaker Toolkit podcast, Fargeat spoke about how the huge prosthetics informed the leaps that Demi Moore’s Elizabeth makes as the film goes on.

“You can’t test it, you can’t put it on in rehearsal a week before to try the body language, to try everything. Basically, it’s going to be on the day,” Fargeat said. “[Those] were the most challenging shooting days because it was maybe six to seven hours of makeup to get to the final stage of the character and then we maybe had two or three hours left to find the performance.”

Splitting the contributions of Arguello and Scarselli misses the evolution in the makeup and hair design that ends up making the film so visceral, pun intended. The fallout, much like “The Substance” itself, perhaps demonstrates that the Academy needs to remember ‘you are one.’

https://indiewire.com,Vermont’s Newest Film Festival Is Already Adding a Second Location for Its Sophomore Edition,https://www.indiewire.com/news/festivals/vermont-film-folklore-festival-2025-location-grant-1235103767/,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 19:30:00 GMT","In just its second year, the Vermont Film & Folklore Festival is already expanding its footprint in a big way: the newest Vermont film festival and the only international film festival in southern Vermont, has today announced that its second annual event will be held May 13-18, 2025, in Manchester and Brattleboro, Vermont.

Founded by a pair of indie film luminaries and recent Manchester transplants in 2024 — MovieMaker Magazine founder Tim Rhys and Filmmaker Magazine co-founder Karol Martesko-Fenster — this year’s edition will include events in both Manchester and Brattleboro. For those of you who are not Manchester natives (like this loud and proud writer), the two towns are about an hour’s drive apart, meaning that the events will now be available to an entirely new segment of the Vermont population.

Part of the appeal for the festival? A new partnership with Brattleboro’s Latchis Theater, which, per Friday’s announcement, will include the use of “four dedicated movie screens, a renovated vintage hotel, and an art deco lounge.”

Rhys, Festival Director and Co-Founder said in an official statement, “We are incredibly proud to be expanding VFFF in only its second year and are gratified that folks have come out so strongly in support of this event. This is a challenging time for the arts in general and for film festivals in particular, and many are struggling to keep their programming robust, so it’s a credit to the generosity of the people and businesses of southern Vermont that we’re able to bring even more films and filmmakers into our brave little state this year.”

The inaugural VFFF was held in May 2024, and featured more than 40 films from around the world, including award-winning American and international features, classic Hollywood features on 16mm, and an impressive selection of shorts and features by Vermont filmmakers.

The founders’ goal for the 2025 edition is to “feature even more concrete opportunities for Vermont filmmakers to produce and collaborate with each other on new work.”

Toward that end, they have also announced today that VFFF is sponsoring the $20,000 “VFFF Storytelling Grant,” which, via cash and in-kind assistance, will encourage one filmmaker/storyteller from Vermont or with strong Vermont ties to create a film in Vermont. The grant is geared to facilitate storytelling and film production in the Green Mountain State. Additionally, the festival has extended the final deadline for submissions to March 24.

Festival organizers are looking forward to expanded partnerships for 2025 and encourage anyone interested in the festival to get in touch with festival director Tim Rhys at Vermontfilmandfolklorefestival@gmail.com.",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,"Sundance 2025 Films Sold So Far: ‘Oh, Hi!’ Starring Molly Gordon Acquired by Sony Pictures Classics",https://www.indiewire.com/news/festivals/sundance-2025-movies-sold-1235086958/,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 19:04:11 GMT","While Sundance didn’t have a plethora of the late night bidding wars we used to see in the good old days of the festival, the weirdness of the Los Angeles fires and the advent of the online platform have kept sales very slow. Over 60 films came into this year’s Sundance looking for homes. As we previously reported, the hope was that even more distributors could get creative.

Below we’ll update all the acquisitions following the festival festival as they arrive. Here are the movies we think could sell big.

“Oh, Hi!”

Section: Premieres

Buyer: Sony Pictures Classics

Director: Sophie Brooks

Cast: Molly Gordon, Logan Lerman, Geraldine Viswanathan, John Reynolds

Buzz: SPC nabbed the worldwide rights to director Sophie Brooks’ sophomore feature, a big commitment to the Molly Gordon-led indie comedy that took some time to sell and find the right home. “Oh, Hi!” stars Gordon as Iris as she and and Isaac (Lerman) have their first romantic weekend getaway as a couple, only for it to go awry. Convinced that he’s just confused, Iris goes to extreme lengths to prove to him that they are meant to be together. Brooks told IndieWire the film is a “love letter to the hopeless romantic,” so SPC is crossing its fingers for a commercial hit. The film was produced by David Brooks, Dan Clifton, Julie Waters, Sophie Brooks, and Molly Gordon. Evan Dyal, Justin Brown, and Evan Moore are executive producers alongside Sabina Friedman-Seitz, Molly Quinn, Matthew M. Welty, and Elan Gale.

“Dead Lover”

Section: Midnight

Buyer: Cartuna x Dweck

Director: Grace Glowicki

Cast: Grace Glowicki, Ben Petrie

Buzz: Though it sold out of SXSW, “Dead Lover” first premiered at Sundance. It was scooped up by a brand new distributor, a team-up between physical media company Cartuna and production company Dweck Productions as the boutique’s first release. Read more here.

“OBEX”

Section: NEXT

Buyer: Oscilloscope

Director: Albert Birney

Cast: Albert Birney, Callie Hernandez

Buzz: In a slow Sundance, it’s good to see some of the smaller titles get some love. Oscilloscope’s acquisition of Birney’s “OBEX” will give the film a theatrical release later this year, and it’ll even be shopped to international buyers at the European Film Market occurring this month (Magnify is selling globally). That’s a plus considering IndieWire in its review called it one of Sundance’s “weirdest and most inventive movies” this year that’s destined for Midnight Movie status. The black-and-white period film borrows from ’80s kitschy aesthetic and is a cross between the late David Lynch’s “Eraserhead” and playing a “Legend of Zelda” game. It stars Birney as a man whose reality starts to blur with fantasy when he begins playing a computer game, forcing him to track down his dog that has now gone missing. This is the first film Birney directed solo, but he co-wrote it with Pete Ohs, who also produced and was the cinematographer and has his own film debuting at SXSW next month. Other producers are Emma Hannaway and James Belfer, the founder of Cartuna who helped make “Hundreds of Beavers” an indie smash last year.

“Lurker”

Section: U.S. Dramatic

Buyer: MUBI

Director: Alex Russell

Cast: Archie Madekwe, Théodore Pellerin

Buzz: Another competitive situation with multiple distributors in on it, this time it was MUBI that won out in a reported mid-seven-figure deal, a source told IndieWire. Russell’s “Lurker” played in competition at Sundance and earned raves for the performances of Madekwe and Pellerin, and IndieWire called the film “tense and absorbing” and one of the buzzier movies to play at the festival. The film follows a man who becomes obsessed with a budding pop star, sparking a toxic relationship that makes a pointed commentary about modern day Los Angeles. Russell is a supervising producer on both “The Bear” and “Beef” and made his directorial debut on the project. Madekwe also produced the film alongside Alex Orlovsky, Duncan Montomery, Galen Core, Francesco Melzi D’Eril, Jack Selby, Marc Marrie, Charlie McDowell, and Olmo Schnabel.

“The Perfect Neighbor”

Section: U.S. Documentary

Buyer: Netflix

Director: Geeta Gandbhir

Buzz: The first documentary to sell out of what has been a slow Sundance market is this film about the controversial Florida “Stand Your Ground” law, in which a person inside their home has the right to use deadly force, with no need to retreat, in self-defense. Netflix will pick up “The Perfect Neighbor” for $5 million, according to a report first in Variety. Netflix declined to comment. Gandbhir’s film is constructed via police body cam footage and examines gun regulations and how race plays a factor in such decisions. IndieWire’s review called it an “unforgettable” and “devastatingly powerful” documentary.

“Peter Hujar’s Day”

Section: Premieres

Buyer: Sideshow and Janus Films

Director: Ira Sachs

Cast: Ben Whishaw, Rebecca Hall

Buzz: Ira Sachs’ latest may be just a 75-minute filmed version of a 50-year-old transcript of a conversation between Peter Hujar and his friend Linda Rosenkrantz, but it found the ideal home with Sideshow and Janus, who will bring it to Berlin next and then release the movie theatrically in the fall after acquiring all North American rights. IndieWire fell in love with its surprising drama and intimacy, and Sachs was almost just as surprised, telling IndieWire at Sundance that before filming he asked himself, “what the hell do I do with this?” The film was produced by Jordan Drake and Jonah Disend, and co-produced by Fred Burle and Aaron Craig.

‘Sorry, Baby’

“Sorry, Baby”

Section: U.S. Dramatic Competition

Buyer: A24

Director: Eva Victor

Cast: Eva Victor, Naomi Ackie, John Carroll Lynch, Louis Cancelmi, Kelly McCormack

Buzz: Winner of the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award, Eva Victor’s tragi-comic debut was one of the most talked-about narrative features at Sundance and one that indie powerhouse A24 couldn’t pass up, not to mention one of the best-reviewed titles from the festival. Despite sales taking some time this Sundance, the sale for “Sorry, Baby” to A24 — which is still in the process of closing — was described by a source as “incredibly competitive” and is another worldwide deal for the indie distributor. The social media star and comedian Eva Victor’s debut, which she wrote, directed, and starred in, is about Agnes, whom “something bad happened to,” as the logline describes, “But life goes on…for everyone around her, at least.” The producers are Adele Romanski, Mark Ceryak, and Barry Jenkins.

“Train Dreams”

Section: Premieres

Buyer: Netflix

Director: Clint Bentley

Cast: Joel Edgerton, Felicity Jones, William H. Macy, Kerry Condon

Buzz: A day after Bela Bajaria responded to a press question about whether or not this was a slow Sundance, Netflix swooped in to buy one of the more ambitious titles on the Sundance slate, director Clint Bentley’s period drama “Train Dreams,” multiple sources confirmed to IndieWire. The film reunites Bentley with “Sing Sing” partner Greg Kwedar in adapting Denis Johnson’s novella. The film follows Robert Grainer, an average man living in extraordinary times, who worked as a day laborer in the American West at the beginning of the 20th century. Battered by the death of his family, he struggles to adjust to this new environment. Marissa McMahon, Teddy Schwarzman, Will Janowitz, Ashley Schlaifer, and Michael Heimler produced. Edgerton was also an EP along with Scott Hinckley, Kwedar, and John Friedberg. Black Bear produced and fully financed the film, and Kamala Films also produced.

‘Together’ Neon

“Together”

Section: Midnight

Buyer: Neon

Director: Michael Shanks

Cast: Alison Brie, Dave Franco

Buzz: It’s the first — and only — big deal of the festival so far, one of the rare titles this year that attracted a classic, aggressive bidding war following its Sunday night premiere at the Eccles. Neon beat out other bidders including A24 and Searchlight to release the film, with a source saying the deal was likely north of $10 million and another estimate coming in between $15-17 million, which would make it among the highest deals in Sundance history. Neon’s financing outfit 30West was also behind this one, making it a good fit. “Together,” director Michael Shanks’ body horror film, is about a married couple whose relationship is already being tested and who decides to move to the countryside to get closer, only for a supernatural encounter to grant them their wish in spades — and in flesh. Stars and producers Brie and Franco are a real life married couple, so the film has a meta element that made this one especially juicy. Neon picked up worldwide rights and has already set a release date of August 1 in theaters.

“The Reality of Hope”

Section: Documentary Short Film Program

Buyer: Asteria and Documentary+

Director: Joe Hunting

Buzz: Ahead of its premiere on Saturday, Jan. 25, AI animation studio Asteria and the documentary free streaming platform Documentary+ swooped in to acquire this doc short that blends VR and live action filmmaking. The film follows Hiyu, a virtual reality world builder based in Stockholm who is suffering from kidney failure and is set to get a transplant from a friend, New York-based Photographotter, who he knows only through an online VR community where they’re each seen as an animal “furry” avatar. Doc+ will release the film later this year on its AVOD platform and through its various FAST channels. Asteria’s Bryn Mooser and Justin Lacob are joining the project as executive producers.

“One to One: John and Yoko”

Section: Spotlight

Buyer: Magnolia

Director: Kevin MacDonald

Buzz: First premiering at the Venice Film Festival and then at Telluride, Magnolia bought “One to One” just ahead of its Sundance screening and made a splash to give it an IMAX exclusive release on April 11, the first time Magnolia has partnered with IMAX on a release. It will then land on Max and HBO in late 2025. The film follows the 18 months that John Lennon and Yoko Ono spent living in Greenwich Village in the early 1970s, including restored footage from the only full concert Lennon performed after breaking up from The Beatles, the One to One Madison Square Garden benefit concert. The film has an audio restoration as overseen by Sean Lennon Ono.

‘2000 Meters to Andriivka’ Mstyslav Chernev

Films Arriving with Distribution

“2000 Meters to Andriivka”

Section: World Documentary

Distributor: Frontline/Associated Press

Buzz: The director of “20 Days in Mariupol” returns with a film in which he embeds himself with a Ukrainian platoon slowly realizing that the Russian campaign may be seemingly endless.

“The Legend of Ochi”

Section: Family Matinee

https://indiewire.com,‘Hallow Road’ Review: Rosamund Pike and Matthew Rhys Are on a Long Road to Nowhere in Babak Anvari’s Minimalist Horror Movie,https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/hallow-road-review-rosamund-pike-matthew-rhys-horror-movie-1235103796/,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 18:30:00 GMT","Minimalist, two-hander, nearly single-location horror-thrillers that unfold in real time can — and should — take any number of formal and narrative liberties, but it’s crucial that they use them to take us all the way to the place they have in mind. The latest film by British-Iranian director Babak Anvari (“Under the Shadow”) only gets us halfway before it gets lost in a fog of its own elevated ideas.

The story of two out-of-sync parents flying down a nighttime motorway to save their daughter after she’s crashed into a girl while driving through an eerie forest, “Hallow Road” makes for a highly tense watch that will have audiences flocking to the nearest dive bar or social media platform to map out easter eggs and froth over grand semiotics. Unfortunately, the film never transcends its tone of ever-present and palpable danger to become a more satisfying character piece.

A degree of remove is rooted in the film’s very conceit and execution. It begins with Anvari and DP Kit Fraser’s choice to pointedly switch from 16mm film to digital early on. “Hallow Road” opens with luscious shots through a nether forest of spirit whispers, and then a pan to a girl’s shoe abandoned in the moss. The aftermath of a folkloristic horror? From there, still on celluloid, we cut inside a warmly lit, middle class home, as the camera consciously swoops through clues: an unfinished meal, half-consumed glasses of wine, carved pumpkins (ah, it’s Halloween), and crushed glass swept to the corner. Drama!

Maddie (Rosamund Pike), asleep in the bedroom, and Frank (Matthew Rhys), passed out on the desk of his home office, are awoken by a frantic call from their teenage daughter Alice (Megan McDonnell), whom we know the whole movie only by her voice on the phone and a sweet-enough profile pic. We piece together that Maddie and Frank had an argument with Alice, after which she fled with his car and is now panicking after the bizarre accident. They rush to her aid, and as soon as Frank enters the address on Pike’s car’s GPS—“Hallow Road”— the frame, like heartless clockwork, rivets to digital.

The next hour takes place entirely inside the car, with Rhys and Pike swinging between barked orders, painful pleas, petrified silences, and some truly bone-crunching SFX. Trapped alongside these two fine actors, we become more acquainted with Maddie and Frank as characters. Maddie is a paramedic, and thus a detector. She detects pulses, kids under the influence, and the accuracy of the timing of chest pumps, which she commands poor, high Alice to perform on the girl she ran over in the woods.

But despite being the more rational and righteous of the parents, Maddie has a bad case of overestimating the relevance of her vocational training to the calamity at hand. That’s what Frank thinks, at least. He’s his wife’s opposite in every way: the emotional, sacrificial parent, a temperament which fits like a bad suit on his bland persona as a marketing director. It’s a sartorial misstep that Rhys wears as best he can, the actor’s performance a thousand miles removed from his charming, oxidized take on Perry Mason.

Things only become less intriguing as the night wears on, as loose plot threads mix with predictable secrets that these characters have been holding onto since long before the film began. For screenwriter William Gillies, the allure of immediacy appears to absolve the absence of history. Anvari is willing to work with that, as he leans into the uncertainty and dizzying suspension fueled by the film’s story.

On paper, Anvari’s slew of innovations should work. Little to no foley of the car, few to no anchoring shots of the road from inside the car, and a purposely simplistic GPS—suggesting tongue in cheek that the parents are in uncharted territory—conspire to keep us on edge. Fraser in turn distracts us by making the interior of the car a chamber piece of organic lighting (not complaining, with this cast), at least until the half way mark when the story careens into its alter-ego, transforming from thriller to horror. In this twilight zone, extreme closeups of Maddie and Frank’s terrified eyes, the sudden depiction of the road in soft focus, and the forest’s AI-like rendering are downright disorienting.

And yet, we do not feel as terrified for the characters as Anvari and Gillies estimate we will. A fundamental disconnect persists between the elevated treatment of the genre mix and the filmmakers’ ability to generate a grounded, genuine fear for Frank, Maddie, and especially Alice.

The upside of “Hallow Road’s” pure genre workout is that Anvari finds the sunny side up of this dreadfully nocturnal nowhere exurb. The downside is that he also denies us the pleasures of playing with folkloristic horror tropes. When a seeming Good Samaritan character shows up—like Alice, heard only through the phone— our hackles are instantly raised — how can a voice so saccharine conjure so much fright? Before we can really chew on her references to the piper or project other grim fairy tales onto Alice’s fate, Gillies and Anvari take the ride into fifth gear, a meta mode, with characters spouting lines such as “I want a better story,” “I asked all the wrong questions,” and “Am I making you uncomfortable?” Then, in the end credits, the filmmakers wholly exit the simulacrum with a doozy of a reveal.

The trouble is that it’s really hard to be both modernist and postmodernist in equal measure, and it feels disingenuous to have events refer to real emotions when you are also so quick to flout the veil. Doing so undoes the intentionality behind Anvari’s choices and leaves the cinematic text too open-ended. I felt trapped for too long in the movie’s uncanny valleys, my mind accelerating to the formal and narrative virtues of other, more successful films that overlap with this one: Coraline and the concrete symbolism of the Other Mother; the focused existential crisis of Locke‘s protagonist; and even the more earnest attempt of another SXSW endless road film, “It Ends” to reinvent the genre wheels. If only this one didn’t feel as vacant long after it’s arrived at its destination.

Grade: C+

“Hallow Road” premiered at SXSW 2025. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

https://indiewire.com,"‘Dope Thief’ Review: Brian Tyree Henry Steals the Show, but the Show Is Stretched Too Thin",https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/shows/dope-thief-review-brian-tyree-henry-1235103107/,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 18:00:00 GMT","Ray (Brian Tyree Henry) and Manny (Wagner Moura) are attached at the hip. The lifelong best friends finish each other’s sentences, they know each other’s families, and — most relevant to their present circumstances — they have each other’s backs. Like, they really have each other’s backs. Their loyalty goes beyond airport pick-ups or wingman sacrifices. They have taken and will take bullets for each other. When a cop presses Manny to rat out Ray, or a girlfriend begs Ray to leave Manny behind, neither one buckles under the pressure. In the City of Brotherly Love, they aren’t just old buds. They’re family.

It’s a shame, then, that over the eight hour-long episodes making up “Dope Thief’s” first season, Ray and Manny’s relationship is reduced to testing that devotion over and over again. Their central predicament — on the run from a very scary drug dealer, a very pushy police force, and a very shady division of federal law enforcement — is so stressful, their conversations tend to be shouting matches and their shared screentime is usually spent staring down either end of a loaded gun. We get it. They’re going through a lot right now. But when you cast Henry and Moura to play fiercely devoted brothers-in-arms, you need to let them explore the depths of that friendship, in all its pain and its joy. Otherwise, even their considerable charms struggle to sustain a one-note waiting game.

Adapted by Peter Craig (“The Batman,” “The Unforgivable”) from Dennis Tafoya’s 2009 novel of the same name, “Dope Thief‘s” premiere is directed by Ridley Scott, who sets a steely gray color palette primed to be decorated with bright splashes of blood. Chase scenes are easily tracked over rich urban terrain, and shootouts tend to play out in clear, rudimentary compositions. The Philadelphia setting foregrounds inner-city row houses, scrappy corner stores, and nondescript citizens just trying to go about their business — a working-class vision of a blue collar town.

But most of the business shown here is illicit. When we first meet Ray and Manny, it’s February 2021. America is still in the throes of COVID, and our boys are scouting out a pot dealer’s hideout, playfully bantering in the back of a van as they get ready to raid the house. Their scheme is simple but serious: Posing as DEA agents (complete with hats, jackets, and badges), the two nobodies from nowhere “bust” whoever’s up to no good inside and walk out with whatever money they can find. They try not to hurt anyone in the process, and they avoid heavily guarded stashes. With just the two of them, they can’t risk getting over-matched, so they need the opposition to believe they’re federal agents. (Ray even practices making his voice sound as authoritative as possible.)

All that changes when they let a third member join the team. Now, as soon as a kinda slow, pretty cocky, and thoroughly scuzzy ex-con shows up, fresh out of prison, with a handful of “easy marks,” any fan of the heist genre will know this guy is going to be a problem. He’s the wild card, the fly in the ointment, the gold-digger who breaks up a good marriage, but if the story is going to work, then Manny and Ray have to go along with his scheme. As always, they have their reasons: Ray needs money to support Theresa (Kate Mulgrew), his de facto mother who helped raise him after his father/her boyfriend (Ving Rhames) ended up in prison. Manny is trying to start a family with his girlfriend. Plus, they believe in their cause — they talk about drug pushers “overrunning” and “poisoning” the city — they believe in their preparation, and they believe in each other.

Whoops. The bust breaks bad, everything goes sideways, and Manny and Ray soon can’t escape their own shadows, let alone the various armies of men with guns looking for them. But their botched raid is just first domino to fall in “Dope Thief’s” drug-trade conspiracy saga, a fact that takes way too long to make itself known. After a barn-burner of a premiere, subsequent episodes struggle to establish a discernible mystery and instead rely on excessive violence and implausible chaos to distract viewers from a stagnant story engine. Essentially, we’re watching two men hide, and hide badly. All too slowly, the duo tries to turn the tables on their pursuers, as the self-described hunters survive being the hunted long enough to try to reclaim their original title. But as the plot becomes too far-fetched for its gritty presentation, the series also becomes less fun, despite the best efforts of its cast.

Brian Tyree Henry, who’s also an executive producer, proves himself — of all things! — a more-than-worthy successor to John McClane. Sweaty and disheveled, desperate to survive but innovative under pressure, Henry can go toe-to-barren-toe with Bruce Willis’ iconic character, including the quips. (He gets a handful of punchlines, delivered with apt exhilaration and exasperation, that call to mind Willis’ put-upon-everyman charms.) That he’s stranded with murkier motivation and a dragged-out running time keep the performance from feeling as sprightly and invigorating, but in a rare lead turn, the Oscar- and Emmy-nominated character actor really does the work to warrant more (and better) starring roles.

Moura keeps his multifaceted hot streak going — after breaking out in “Narcos,” he’s been stealing scenes in “Shining Girls,” “Mr. and Mrs. Smith,” and “Civil War” — albeit with spottier screentime than you’d expect given the premiere. (It’s called “Dope Thief,” not “Dope Thieves,” for a reason — Ray is the focus.) Mulgrew and Rhames are reliably great, and Marin Ireland takes the grizzled cop archetype to new levels of surliness, but the cast is left to carry too heavy a bag.

By the end, it’s clear the first season of “Dope Thief” should’ve been the first episode of “Dope Thief” (maybe, at most, a two-part premiere). After starting and stopping, the story is just getting going again when the season ends, but trusting Season 2 to deliver a more focused story is all but impossible. This friendship, as strong as it once was, just isn’t built to last.

Grade: C+

https://indiewire.com,At Least 65 Different AI Studios Have Launched Globally Since 2022,https://www.indiewire.com/news/business/ai-studios-launched-since-2022-1235103261/,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 17:00:00 GMT","First there were XR studios, then it was “metaverse” studios, or even “virtual” studios. Whatever the tech buzzword, there have always been a new wave of upstart companies, dedicated to being the leaders in creating content for whatever the new medium was at that moment.

Today the buzzword — and the one that actually seems like it’s more than just a fad — is generative artificial intelligence. The wave of people touting themselves as the new studio tastemakers with Gen-AI has been impossible to keep track of.

Well, someone finally did.

A consultancy group and product innovation lab called FBRC.ai on Friday released a report that aims to quite literally map out all the AI content creators in the landscape as of March 2025. It can’t profess to be completely comprehensive (another AI studio just launched as you finished reading this sentence), but the group’s inaugural study received survey responses from 98 different companies that self-identify as AI studios, even if it’s just “the tip of the iceberg,” as the report says, of all the studios that could be out there.

Of those 98 studios, 65 have launched since 2022, and over 30 have launched in just 2024 and the first two months of 2025 alone. The report found that many of these companies have just 5 or fewer employees and are largely independent endeavors. It speaks to how rapidly the industry around Gen-AI is growing and how many want to be the first to truly break out in the mainstream.

In addition to a broad overview of the space and a world map of where each of these companies are based, the full report includes profiles with nine different studios who are among the current leaders in the space: Promise, Asteria, Shy Kids, Invisible Universe, Playbook, AI Hub, Pigeon Shrine, Secret Level, and Mod Tech Labs.

As the report shows, not all of these companies are created equal, and they exist on a spectrum in terms of how they utilize AI. Some are work-for-hire agencies that almost solely bring in clients, while others co-produce, and some are working to develop entirely their own content they can create and distribute.

What’s more, some companies are considered “AI Native” studios, in that they use “closed source” models like OpenAI’s Sora, Runway, or Luma’s Dream Machine and will create text, images, and video entirely via AI prompts going direct from script to screen. Others will use an open source model like ComfyUI that gives creators a little more control over the creation tools. And others still are merely using AI to augment traditional production pipelines, making either live-action/AI hybrids or just using AI to be more efficient.

A spectrum of all the types of studios that utilize Generative AI FRBC.ai

“Part of the way that the conversation around AI in media and entertainment has progressed positively is that the voices speaking in the space now have experience with actually telling stories,” the report by Rachel Joy Victor reads. “While all have experimented with technology throughout their careers and thus were drawn to AI as the next frontier, they all had years of experience with storytelling. Nearly every founder attests that they still believe the most substantial moat is not technical but rather about who can do the work of crafting a good story.”

Making these distinctions in the AI space is important for people who have a narrow or pigeon-holed idea of what generative AI production is or what it looks like. But the report acknowledges that, over time and as the models improve, many of these lines will start to blur, with studios experimenting with hybrid projects and fully-blown AI movies.

With the exception of Asteria, which just launched their own “clean model” called Marey, most of the companies profiled are not building their own AI models and will leave that work to the tech giants like OpenAI and Runway. But they are differentiating themselves by developing their own datasets on which these models are trained (think Lionsgate’s recent partnership with Runway), as well as developing their own unique workflows or interfaces about how they want to use the tools. According to Playbook’s Skylar Thomas via the report, that’s because savvy viewers are starting to notice that individual AI models each have their own look to them, and using them via your own dataset is a way to stand apart.

So are all these companies working to take everyone’s jobs? Not necessarily, the report concludes. While some are dabbling in shorts, feature films, and TV shows, others are invested in VR, gaming, ads, and music videos, among other new formats of content. And while it may be cheaper and faster to produce content, not all of these small companies have the infrastructure necessary to support elaborate models and create sustained business models.

The iconic duo reprise their respective roles for “Freakier Friday,” the sequel to the beloved 2003 film “Freaky Friday.” Curtis and Lohan are a mother and daughter whose dynamic has shifted since Lohan’s character is now a mom herself to a teen (Julia Butters). Mark Harmon and Chad Michael Murray are both back for the sequel, along with new cast members Butters, Manny Jacinto, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, and Sophia Hammons. Christina Vidal Mitchell, Haley Hudson, Lucille Soong, Stephen Tobolowsky, and Rosalind Chao also star.

“Late Night” director Nisha Ganatra is helming the film.

Curtis previously confirmed that “Freakier Friday” was getting a theatrical release from Disney.

“Yes, you heard me…The theaters,” Curtis wrote on Instagram in 2024 when speaking about leaked pics from production. “The place we all go and enjoy a shared experience in the dark while munching popcorn and candy and laughing together and sometimes crying together. Until then.”

Curtis added at the time, “Because other outlets have posted it, I am going to take advantage of the intrusion of a paparazzi picture into the creative process of filmmaking. We have tried so hard to keep our story a secret and private until it’s time for release but once in a while an image comes out, and it doesn’t tell you anything about the story or about what’s going on with the characters but it does show the joy and fun that we had making ‘Freakier Friday’ and we know it will be the experience that you will have in the theaters next year [in 2025].”

Curtis also shared in 2022 that she envisioned the storyline following three generations. “Let me be the grandma! Let me be the old grandma who switches places,” Curtis said. “So then Lindsay gets to be the sexy grandma, who is still happy with Mark Harmon in all the ways you would be happy with Mark Harmon. And simply, I would like to see Lindsay be the hot grandma, and I would like to see me try to deal with toddlers today. I wanna be a helicopter parent in today’s world, as an old lady.”

https://indiewire.com,Marvel’s New ‘Thunderbolts*’ Trailer Proves the Future of Movies Belongs to Cinephiles — In Review,https://www.indiewire.com/features/commentary/in-review-marvel-thunderbolts-trailer-a24-absolute-cinema-1235103695/,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 16:30:00 GMT","The following is an excerpt from “In Review by David Ehrlich,” a biweekly newsletter in which our Chief Film Critic and Head Reviews Editor rounds up the site’s latest reviews and muses about current events in the movie world. Subscribe here to receive the newsletter in your inbox every other Friday.

The past week presented a remarkable challenge to some of America’s longest-standing norms (and constitutional amendments). A green card-holder who’s married to an American citizen was disappeared in plain sight, the President of the United States turned the White House lawn into a car dealership as part of a naked bid to spare the world’s richest man from the consequences of the economy they’re both determined to crash at our expense, and — most unexpected of all, if also most welcome — Marvel actually released something bold and creatively provocative for the first time since Chloé Zhao was allowed to shoot with natural light.

Sure, that “something” was the third trailer for a movie that still feels like it could’ve been an email, but at a time when even the most shocking events immediately seem like well-seeded inevitabilities, I’ll take my good surprises where I can get them.

And I’m of the mind that this was a good surprise. Titled “Absolute Cinema,” the first “Thunderbolts*” promo since the sub-ideal release of “Captain America: Brave New World” went to extraordinary — and extraordinarily specific — lengths to push back against the idea that Hollywood’s most profitable blockbuster machine has been permanently enshittified into a massive slop factory.

Released in tandem with a Florence Pugh interview in which she insisted that “Thunderbolts*” “ended up becoming this quite badass indie, A24-feeling assassin movie with Marvel superheroes,” the trailer starts with the actress saying “there’s something wrong.” It’s unclear if she’s talking about our world, her own, or the production company that bridges them together, but her point is hard to argue regardless. Then: A Marvel Studio logo we’ve never seen before, the colors and flash of which do more to evoke the false humility of A24 or Plan B’s company idents than the fascistic “we own you” energy we tend to get from those of a major studio.

Cue a fat electro beat courtesy of French DJ Gesaffelstein, miles removed from the hushed silence that most superhero movie trailers use to suggest gravitas, and — what’s this? — a shot of Pugh yawning!? Superheroes aren’t supposed to yawn! Superheroes are supposed to wink and fly and say things like “we have to stop CGI Harrison Ford before he eats the Washington Monument!” But “Thunderbolts*” isn’t your daddy’s superhero movie. It isn’t even my daddy’s superhero movie (which was “The Dark Knight,” at least until he walked out of it halfway through in favor of watching “Mamma Mia!” for the second time). No, “Thunderbolts*” has an asterisk in its title.

And what does that asterisk mean? It means this isn’t a regular Marvel (as Tim Robinson might describe it in A24’s upcoming “Friendship”), it’s a cool Marvel. Where “Captain America: Brave New World” was sold on the premise of watching Sam Wilson rebuild the Avengers, this trailer for “Thunderbolts*” downplays the movie’s role in a corporate mega-strategy in favor of foregrounding its indie cred. It highlights its cast by boasting that it’s “From the stars of ‘Midsommar,’ ‘A Different Man,’ and ‘You Hurt My Feelings” (the last of which briefly electrified me with the hope that Jeannie Berlin might be playing The Void, until I remembered that Julia Louis-Dreyfus has been in several of these things), three A24 movies that combined to gross $150 million less than “The Marvels” did alone.

“The writers & director of ‘Beef.’” Louis-Dreyfus sips a glass of water. “The cinematographer of ‘The Green Knight.’” Someone hurts themselves. “The production designer of ‘Hereditary.’” Stan screams. “The editor of ‘Minari.’” “The composers of ‘Everything Everywhere All at Once’” (a compelling argument, if we’re being honest). What is coming from all of these talented people from the A24CU? It’s not an Avengers movie, that’s for sure. “The Avengers are not coming,” a voice tells us. “Who will keep people safe?”

Then, and only then, does the trailer begin to highlight its famous Marvel characters, as it plasters their names on the screen with an EDM punch and a film strip wiggle that seems lifted straight from the marketing for “Spring Breakers” and “The Bling Ring.” Stan spills something on his shirt, a person in a chicken suit gets punched in the face, and David Harbour screams “Yessssssss!” It’s all vibes and no plot, but those vibes tell a story of their own: This isn’t going to be another cookie-cutter spectacle about people in spandex fighting to stop a beam of light from the sky. This is going to be a real movie. A dangerous one, even.

I’m not sure how far I trust those implied promises (or maybe I am sure, and it’s not very), but I have no trouble believing the broader message that’s being conveyed here: After dictating the culture for the 17 years or so, Marvel has finally been reduced to the point of reacting to it. After 17 years of watching Disney’s competitors wish they were Marvel, we’re seeing Marvel desperately try to be someone else.

But the MCU of it all is just the tip of the iceberg here, as this brief web trailer provides a wildly prismatic biopsy of the movie business as it stands today. There’s a lot going on here. For one thing, the Disney marketing department’s attempt to frame “Thunderbolts*” as an indie film is a fascinating conflation between aesthetics and the means of production.

MCU installments are glossy plastic eyesores because they cost several hundred million dollars and have to make several times that much in order to break even, an economic condition that requires them to be generic enough to appeal to a four-quadrant audience of casual moviegoers from all around the world. A24 movies can be shot in a way that dynamically serves the story at hand because the veneer of artistic license is a big part of what the studio is selling, and also because the financial success of “I Saw the TV Glow” or whatever depends more on Letterboxd than it does on China.

‘Thunderbolts*’

For another thing, the Disney marketing department’s attempt to distill “the A24 style” with the “Thunderbolts*” footage at its disposal should be enough to prove once and for all that there is no “A24 style.” While it’s true that a large portion of today’s viewing public regards the more successful American studios as the primary artistic force behind the films they produce (a depression indicator that points back to the Golden Age of Hollywood, and a trend that I suspect will continue as our economy grows even more stratified), the fact of the matter is that A24 is a brand whose success and ubiquity have been confused for a visual identity.

There are certainly a number of overlapping signifiers in their collective output (e.g. fluorescent lighting, the state of Florida, wall-to-wall coverage on IndieWire.com), but no one would ever suggest that it’s as hard to distinguish between “Lady Bird” and “The Iron Claw” as it is between any two Hong Sang-soo movies, or that “Minari” and “A Different Man” — to use two of the titles cited in “Absolute Cinema” — were as interchangeable as “Black Widow” and “Captain America: Winter Soldier.”

So why is it so obvious that Marvel is specifically cribbing from A24 with its the “Thunderbolts*” trailer? Because the promo successfully captures the same brash confidence that A24’s marketing campaigns is able to reverse engineer from its films, while simultaneously being incapable of conveying the “you haven’t seen this before” novelty that backstopped “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” or the “you don’t even know what this is” eventization that allowed the first promo for “The Brutalist” to feel as “monumental” as the film itself. As a result, the latest “Thunderbolts*” trailer doesn’t feel like an A24 movie so much as it feels like someone trying to imitate an A24 movie; by using a similar approach to sell something that we have definitely all seen before to one degree or another, Marvel has only helped to reaffirm that A24 is more attitude than aesthetic.

But the fact that Marvel is trying to look a bit more like A24 at the same time as A24 is trying to look a bit more like a traditional film studio (complete with $70 million period epics slated for awards season) is only so interesting to me because of how those trends reflect a larger shift in the way that mainstream entertainment is consumed: the inevitable sea change from a casual monoculture to a network of siloed devotees. Fanboys are out, enthusiasts are in.

I’ve long feared that film — or at least the practice of watching it as it was meant to be seen — would go the way of opera, as movie theaters became exclusive to big cities and the cost of seeing them priced out all but a certain class of cinephiles (which would of course have a devastating effect on the number and variety of movies that got made in the first place). I’ve feared that would happen because it’s obviously happening already; even London’s most famous independent cinema is struggling to survive, while it was reported this week that Hollywood studios have been inexplicably resistant to AMC’s pleas for longer theatrical windows.

But the best time to make things better is when you can see them going from bad to worse, and I can’t help but feel like the “Thunderbolts*” trailer indicates that you — by which I mean anyone who cares about this shit enough to have read this far — will have an outsized say in whatever happens next. As the mass audience fragments and the cultural ecosystem fractures apart further than it has already (a self-own on Disney’s part, as the company’s streaming greed made it impossible for a new MCU movie to feel like the mega-event that it once did), even the biggest corporations on Earth will have to compensate with genuine excitement what they’ve lost in blind obligation. If the Nazification of Tesla has taught me anything, it’s that a brand is only as strong as the people who love it.

‘The Electric State’

I’m sure a few unfortunate souls are happy to flaunt their awfulness on four wheels (as with all aspects of the right, the Cybertruck’s ugliness is more of a feature than a bug), but MAGA chuds alone aren’t enough to sustain a gazillion dollar car brand when the average person thinks it’s a sign of the Fourth Reich. If they were, then Elon Musk wouldn’t be on the brink of tears as Fox News questioned him about the strain that being a historically terrible human being has put on his signature business.

Or, on a more relevant note, consider “The Electric State,” an unwatchable $320 million streaming movie that virtually no one is excited to see, even though Netflix will inevitably send out a press release proclaiming that it’s the most-watched spectacle since the moon landing or whatever. I wrote in my review that “The Electric State” doesn’t just feel like it was made by AI, it also feels like it was made for AI, and that’s the very feeling that “Absolute Cinema” is trying to push so hard against. Perhaps there was a time when simply making “big-screen entertainment” available to the masses was enough for a quasi-monopolistic outfit like Netflix to survive, but there’s a reason why the executive who greenlit the Russo brothers’ latest boondoggle — and so many other of the streamer’s riskiest movies, mega-budget movies, a few of them excellent! — has been replaced by someone with a mandate to make things that might do more to justify their expense.

On the same tip, there’s a reason why “Joker: Folie à Deux” cratered at the box office even though its predecessor cleared a billion dollars, just as there’s a reason why a three-and-a-half-hour Brady Corbet epic about a traumatized Hungarian architect has had the zeitgeist in a chokehold for much of the last few months. What used to be a battle for our wallets has become a war for our attention, and it’s being fought in Twitter replies, impassioned Subreddits, and — most crucially of all — on Letterboxd, where movie opinions are the only currency that matters to legions of young people who don’t have any other kind to spend.

Content isn’t king anymore, especially now that Gen-AI has devalued it worse than a memestock. Love it or hate it, people want to experience something real and worth talking about. Discourse is toxic, but it’s the best press money can buy. At the same time A24 has proven that hardcore enthusiasm can be converted into general interest, Marvel has proven that it’s getting much harder to drive things in the opposite direction. The future belongs to movies that people actually want to see; for Marvel’s sake, I can only hope that trying to sell a blockbuster along those lines will eventually inspire them to make a blockbuster along those lines. Fingers crossed that “Thunderbolts*” turns out to fit the bill, because time is ticking, and the next pair of “Avengers” movies already have all too much in common with “The Electric State.”

Director Paul Feig’s sequel film stars Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick, reprising their roles from 2018’s “A Simple Favor.” However, Stone claims she, too, was part of the ensemble cast.

“I LOVED being cast and removed from my role unexpectedly for no reason at all LOVED it,” Stone wrote to an E! News Instagram reel about the film. Stone was in talks for the role that later went to Elizabeth Perkins. A source close to production confirmed that Stone was never actually cast in the film; the deal did not go through due to budget issues. IndieWire has additionally reached out to representatives for Amazon MGM Studios and Stone.

The rest of the ensemble includes Andrew Rannells, Bashir Salahuddin, Michele Morrone, Alex Newell, Elena Sofia Ricci, Henry Golding, and Allison Janney.

“Another Simple Favor” premiered at SXSW as the opening night film. The comedy centers on Stephanie (Kendrick) and Emily (Lively), now in coastal Italy for Emily’s wedding to a wealthy businessman. In the new film, Stephanie has now written a book about the events of the first movie, and Emily, who was in prison, crashes a book reading to invite Stephanie to her wedding — and possibly enact her revenge plot. “Another Simple Favor” is the sequel to the beloved 2018 film “A Simple Favor.” The feature premieres May 1 on Prime Video.

Feig previously told IndieWire that he hopes “Another Simple Favor” is his version of “The Godfather Part II” in terms of sequels. “I’m always looking forward,” Feig said. “I had so much fun doing the sequel to ‘A Simple Favor,’ but I try to avoid them. I don’t want to fall back on old properties all the time. I just think they’re good on their own. There aren’t that many great sequels in the world, I hate to say. But with ‘A Simple Favor,’ I was like, ‘Maybe we can make “Godfather 2” and not make “Speed 2,”‘ or whatever. That was always my goal.”

Meanwhile, Stone is confirmed to star in “Euphoria” Season 3, now in production. Her role has not been announced, although the third season will include a time jump.",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,Grab Those ‘Believe’ Signs and Grow That Mustache — ‘Ted Lasso’ Is Returning for Season 4 with Jason Sudeikis,https://www.indiewire.com/news/breaking-news/ted-lasso-season-4-jason-sudeikis-1235103643/,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 13:30:00 GMT","Remember how Jason Sudeikis and the team behind “Ted Lasso” said the series was officially over with Season 3? Even after multiple Emmy wins and record views on Apple TV+? Well surprise surprise. Apple announced Friday that that the hit sports dramedy will be returning for Season 4, and the man behind the mustache, Sudeikis, will be coming along too.

Sudeikis will reprise his role as Coach Lasso, though no other cast has been announced. However, Deadline reported in August 2024 that cast members Hannah Waddingham, Brett Goldstein, and Jeremy Swift had their options picked up by UK acting union Equity, sparking rumors that Season 4 was around the corner.

Jack Burditt (“Nobody Wants This,” “Modern Family,” “30 Rock”) is joining the show as an executive producer for Season 4 as part of his new overall deal with Apple TV+. Goldstein however is returning as a writer and EP alongside Leanne Bowen, as he did during the show’s initial run. He’s joined by fellow EPs Brendan Hunt, Joe Kelly, Jane Becker, Jamie Lee, and Bill Wrubel.

Bill Lawrence, who is currently showrunner on “Shrinking” and “Bad Monkey,” still serves as an EP on the series via his Doozer Productions banner.

Many had hoped that the show ending would result in possible spin-offs focused around characters that, ultimately, had become more interesting than Lasso himself, but with name recognition being what it is, it was likely difficult for Apple TV+ to let go of the show in the first place.

“As we all continue to live in a world where so many factors have conditioned us to ‘look before we leap,” said Sudeikis, star and executive producer of the series. “In season four, the folks at AFC Richmond learn to LEAP BEFORE THEY LOOK, discovering that wherever they land, it’s exactly where they’re meant to be.”

“‘Ted Lasso’ has been nothing short of a juggernaut, inspiring a passionate fanbase all over the world, and delivering endless joy and laughter, all while spreading kindness, compassion and unwavering belief. Everyone at Apple is thrilled to be continuing our collaboration with Jason and the brilliant creative minds behind this show,” Apple TV+ head of programming Matt Cherniss said in a statement.

Developed by Sudeikis, Lawrence, Kelly, and Hunt, and based on the preexisting format and characters from NBC Sports, “Ted Lasso” quickly won over fans in its first season, earning an Emmy that year for Outstanding Comedy Series, as well as recognition for Lead Actor (Sudeikis), Supporting Actor (Goldstein), and Supporting Actress (Waddingham). With the exception of Waddingham, the show repeated these wins the following year for its second season as well.

During a recent interview on the “New Heights” podcast with Travis and Jason Kelce, Sudeikis also revealed a few details about Season 4.

“Ted’s coaching a women’s team,” he said, revealing a plot line that was hinted at towards the end of Season 3.",indiewire

https://indiewire.com,Gene Simmons Reads the Weather and Freestyle Raps on the Local News,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/gene-simmons-weather-report-los-angeles-1235296539/,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 17:47:52 GMT","Gene Simmons partook in one of the most venerable local television news traditions we have: celebrities doing the weather report.

On Thursday, the Kiss frontman stopped by Fox 11 in Los Angeles to join — and repeatedly neg — meteorologist Adam Krueger for the weekend weather report. The segment opened with Simmons roasting Krueger (“You look much better in real life than you do on TV”), and the whole thing just got more bizarre, goofy, and slightly awkward from there.

Simmons put plenty of his pizazz into his performance, even as he occasionally mixed up his words, like when he said, “Friday, it’s going to be a 90 percent chance of rain, Saturday it’s gonna be 60 percent sunshine.” Meanwhile, Kreuger did the classic local news reporter bit of slipping in relevant Kiss puns and lyrics into the forecast, which Simmons seemed to begrudgingly play along with. (Kreuger, in particular, has shown a particular penchant for music-themed forecasts, using lyrics by Kendrick Lamar and Tyler, the Creator, among others.)

Amazingly, the whole thing ended with Simmons freestyle rapping. Seriously. As the segment ended, Kreuger gave Simmons a fist bump, prompting the musician to ask, “Are you kicking me out?” After Kreuger explained the producers were telling him to “wrap” in his ear monitor, Simmons immediately replied, “Rap? You go to 7-Eleven/I go to heaven.”

Meteorology has apparently become one of Simmons’ hobbies since Kiss finished their (alleged) farewell tour in December 2023. Last September, the musician appeared on another local news channel, KTLA 5, to deliver the morning forecast. Otherwise, Simmons is busy with the Gene Simmons Band, which is set to launch a North American tour on April 3.",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,Sean Combs’ Sex Trafficking Trial Pushed Back; New Criminal Indictment Hits Imprisoned Bad Boy Records Founder,https://deadline.com/2025/03/sean-diddy-combs-sex-trafficking-trial-delayed-1236326566/,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 18:55:43 GMT","Sean “Diddy” Combs’ trial for sex trafficking and more has been pushed back a week to May 12 following a hearing Friday in New York federal court.

The shift from the original May 5 start date came during a session on the superseding indictment of forced labor against Combs that prosecutors brought down last week, adding to claims of racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.

Combs, in attendance as he has been for every hearing in the case since his arrest last fall, said little during the hearing but but did enter a “not guilty” plea to the new charge, just like the Grammy-winning rapper and Bad Boy Records founder has done for previous indictments in this matter.

The 55-year-old defendant walked into court in khaki prison garb and with a head of hair that has turned startlingly gray since his last court appearance. Upon entering, Combs turned to the gallery and flashed a smile at family members and supporters. Before entering his latest plea, Combs, standing, addressed Judge Arun Subramanian as “sir” and told him he did not need the new indictment read back to him.

The remainder of the hearing was occupied with timetables for jury selection, motions and disclosure of evidence.

The pushing back of opening arguments by a week was an acknowledgment by the judge that litigating some of those issues could take additional time. Just whittling down a potential pool of hundreds of jury candidates is expected to last as many as three days at the end of April, the judge said, before the final panel undergoes voir dire questioning, scheduled to begin the first few days of May.

Lasting less hour in front of Subramanian, today’s hearing saw the U.S. Attorney’s office and defense lawyers get combative over potential witnesses for the trial and 2016 video footage broadcasted last spring of a half-naked Combs beating then-longtime girlfriend Cassie Ventura in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel.

Prosecutor Mitzi Steiner from the Southern District of New York revealed that feds have another 20 potential witnesses – as yet unidentified – who are “incredibly frightened” at the thought of having their names disclosed to defense, as intimidation and fears of possible violent retribution from Combs and associates have come up numerous times in the case. Yet today, Subramanian nevertheless ordered Steiner to turn over the potential witnesses’ IDs next week to the defense on a lawyers-eyes-only basis.

The revised indictment (read it here) says Combs coerced employees into “forced labor,” including sex through intimidation, withheld pay, sleep deprivation and threats of firing. Employees were led to believe “they would be harmed — including by losing their jobs — if they did not comply with his demands,” the indictment states. “With respect to one employee, Combs used physical force, psychological harm, financial harm and reputational harm, and/or threats of the same to cause the employee to engage in sex acts with Combs.”

Arrested in a Manhattan hotel lobby in September, Combs is facing life in prison if found guilty. The government alleges that Combs and his aides coerced women into marathon sexual encounters called “freak-offs” with male and female prostitutes, drug use, threats of violence and imprisonment in the hotel rooms where the were staged and videotaped.

RELATED: Diddy Says Freak-Off Videos Reveal His “Innocence”

Prosecutors allege that Combs’ business empire — which has fallen on hard times since the flood of allegations against him began in late 2023 — and the “racketeering enterprise” at the heart of their case against the rap hitmaker-turned-mogul were intertwined. The “Combs Enterprise,” according to the indictment, served two purposes: operating “a global business in the media, entertainment, and lifestyle industries,” and enabling its CEO, his deputies and associates “to engage in unlawful acts” including sex trafficking and narcotics distribution.

Combs has denied the charges and, through his lawyers, has said all sexual encounters described in the indictment were consensual.

Months before he was first indicted, Combs already was scrambling to limit the damage from an assault video aired by CNN in May. The footage from 2016 showed Combs hitting his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura — who is the “Victim 1” in the federal indictment — and dragging her through a Los Angeles hotel hallway. Combs apologized via Instagram two days after CNN aired the hotel surveillance clip, saying he was “disgusted” by his behavior. With Ventura sued Combs for abuse and assault in November 2023 and been met with an alleged $30 million settlement within 24 hours, the May 2024 apology was met with distain by the singer’s attorneys at the time.

RELATED: Diddy Slams CNN For Allegedly Altering Cassie Ventura Beating Footage; Cable Newser Destroyed Original Video, Rapper Claims

Subjecting that 2016 footage to near constant undermining since the criminal case began, Combs’ lawyers this week formally accused CNN of doctoring the clip by editing and speeding up footage for broadcast and then destroying the original video. “This includes covering the timestamp and then changing the video sequence,” the lawyers wrote, adding that “the CNN videos do not fairly and accurately depict the events in question.”

Speaking to Deadline that same day. a CNN spokesperson denied the cable newser altered or destroyed the video.

As well as the criminal case, Combs is accused in more than 25 other cases of assault, abuse, rape and more, with even more allegations and filings coming in by the week. Losing one of his key lawyers in the criminal case earlier this year, Combs also on February 12 sued NBCUniversal for $100 million in a defamation action over what he calls out as “outrageous set of fresh lies and conspiracy theories” in the Peacock documentary Diddy: Making of a Bad Boy.",indiewire

Coachella is almost here, and it isn’t too late to snag tickets to the famed festival.

Lady Gaga, Travis Scott, Green Day and Post Malone headline for both weekends of the three-day music festival, which returns to its home at the Empire Polo Grounds in Indio, Calif. on the weekends of April 11-13 and April 18-20. While tickets on the Coachella website, which went on sale in early January, are sold out tickets are still available on resale sites such as Stubhub, VividSeats, Seat Geek and Ticketmaster.

In fact, tickets actually appear to be selling for only marginally marked up prices on resale sites compared to the general onsale on Coachella’s website. While resale sites almost always sell tickets at significantly marked up prices, the same doesn’t tend to be the case with weekend events like Coachella, likely because festival-goers prefer to have their tickets secured weeks or months in advance. But people who live in the area, or are prone to spontaneity, can save a lot of money by buying tickets only a week or so before the festival.

Also on the lineup are Missy Elliot, Megan Thee Stallion, Charli XCX, Anitta, Benson Boone, FKA Twigs, Clairo, Zedd, Junior H, Jennie, Glorilla, Lisa, Mustard, Ivan Cornejo, Kraftwerk, Shaboozey, The Go-Gos and many more. The “Original Misfits” are on the bill for Saturday. And after canceling her set at the 2024 festival, Tyla is scheduled to play on Friday.

If you aren’t able to attend the festival in person, you can stream performances online. YouTube will likely return this year as the exclusive livestream partner for both Coachella weekends on the festival’s official YouTube channel.

While many say they miss the convenience and variety of cities, they nonetheless prefer a country life in which they realize the beaver would make the perfect mascot for the big ad campaign they’ve been working on and ultimately learn to live in peace with the creature.” Rawlings added that, by contrast, a relatively negligible number of Americans were choosing to leave rural areas in pursuit of an urban life in which they befriend a wise-cracking pigeon.",theonion

https://usmagazine.com,Dorothy Martin Talks Friendship With Slash and New Album,https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/dorothy-martin-talks-friendship-with-slash-and-new-album/,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 20:37:40 GMT","Dorothy frontwoman Dorothy Martin is fresh off of writing her “heaviest” album yet, and she hopes the meaning behind the music resonates with fans, she revealed in an exclusive interview with Us Weekly.

“I think there’s just really positive messages about faith and overcoming brokenness and challenges,” the rock singer, 38, told Us, referring to the title track “The Way.”

The new album, out Friday, March 14, is “like a love letter to our fans, just reminding them to hold onto hope,” Martin explained. “It’s also the heaviest album I’ve made, but there’s a little bit of outlaw country vibes on some of the songs. So it’s pretty eclectic.”

Martin’s band Dorothy has been a part of the rock scene since 2014. Their latest single “Tombstone Town,” which dropped in February, boasts a collaboration with guitar legend Slash. And the singer was excited for fans to see her other creative side by showing off her acting skills.

“It was one of the most fun videos I’ve gotten to make. I’ve always wanted to somewhat act a little bit. So we went for that Quentin Tarantino Grindhouse vibe on the video, with actors and some narrative storytelling.”

Below, the rock goddess gives Us the inside scoop on her band’s new album, wild tour stories and more:

Us Weekly: You describe The Way as your heaviest album. How so?

Dorothy Martin: It’s heavy, but there’s also some songs I think that could really cross over maybe the Top 40 or Christian radio — even country. But we can’t just abandon our fan base, so there’s some really heavy guitars and there’s two songs “I Come Alive” and “The Devil” — those are the heaviest songs on the album. So we had to throw a little bit of that in there, and that’s true to my roots.

Us: Tell Us about working with rock icon Slash.

DM: When you meet people that you look up to and they happen to be down to earth and humble and kind, and all those wonderful things despite the legendary status that they’ve achieved — he’s one of those people. He just puts you at ease and makes you feel comfortable.

Us: What’s the best advice Slash gave you?

DM: Something that we both relate to and have in common is being in recovery. Because in rock and roll, it’s just been so glamorized, and addiction and alcoholism runs in my family. He looked at me and he was like, ‘This is your year. This is your time, and all you gotta do is stay sober, don’t self-sabotage, don’t get in your head and keep doing what you’re doing’. So it’s so nice to have mentors and friends that have been through it — that have been in the industry, that are veterans, that are also sober. Because it can be very scary to be sober, and you don’t have to do it alone. It’s just a better way to live, and it’s a message I want to share with anyone who’s reading this.

Us: Making music seems very healing for you.

DM: It’s healing for me, but it’s not about me — it’s a much bigger picture than that. I hope it’s healing for millions and millions of people. If one lyric, if one song can plant the seed and save someone’s life, that’s what it’s all about. We’re in this together, you don’t have to do this alone. So I have to remember, it’s bigger than me.

Music, for me, used to be so one dimensional, and now it’s a broader thing of this is a vehicle for a message. So I have to be responsible with it.

Us: Do you have a dream collaboration you’d love to become a reality?

DM: There’s been many. [laughs] Macy Gray and I got to do a remake of [a] Dolly Parton song with Dolly Parton. I love Dolly Parton. Country music is the reason I sing, because when I started teaching myself to sing, it was country songs for some reason. And then I branched out into rock and all this other stuff.

But, collaboration-wise, that’s such a good question. Hardy would be really cool. Lainey Wilson would be freaking awesome. And if I could go back and do something like a duet with Johnny Cash, I would in a heartbeat.

Us: When you prep for a show is there something you always have to do before you get on stage?

DM: I gotta pray. Stay hydrated. Try to stay calm. I always make sure I’m in my stage outfit [and] my makeup, well in advance, ’cause that’s the last thing that I wanna worry about and get my voice warmed up and feeling good. And then it’s like that Carrie Underwood song, “Jesus Take the Wheel.” Whatever happens on that stage happens.

Us: Do you ever get nervous before you hit the stage?

DM: It’s more fun now. I used to get very, very nervous, but after doing it for a while, it’s more fun and exciting, you know? Of course, we have good shows and bad shows, and I just try to live in the moment. And if we have a bad show, for example, it’s like, ‘Eh, it’s over with now.’ It’s in the past. I’m looking forward to the next one, but I wouldn’t say I get scared. It’s exciting. You get very excited, you get jacked up and it’s fun.

Us: Is there anything you do to calm yourself down a little bit before you take the mic?

DM: Yeah, like kickboxing or something, or I’ll just try to shake the nervous energy out of my body. Or I sometimes just crack jokes. Or make really strange noises, deep breathing. Sometimes [that] helps.

Us: Obviously, tons of fans are in the audience, and you never know what kinds of things they’ll want — an autograph or a request. Have there been any that made you laugh or even raised an eyebrow?

DM: It’s always weird when someone says, ‘Sign my sweaty boob’ because it ruins our Sharpies, and then our Sharpies don’t work anymore. [laughs] So they like guitar picks, they want memorabilia. They want selfies. They wanna just high five or a hug. We give them whatever we have on hand. Sam Colton, my guitar player, he throws guitar picks out in the crowd all the time, and they love that.

Us: It can be kind of unpredictable when it comes to audience interaction — from singing off-key to holding up their phones to record. How do you keep your focus when you’re on stage? Or do you just play along with the audience?

DM: There are things that can be distracting. I’ve had people up in my face with a camera [throughout] a whole show and it can kill the vibe, but that only really happens in a super intimate setting — a small club where someone’s a little too close for comfort. You just go into a mindset. I just go into performance mode. I don’t know what happens, I just let the spirit take over and go for it.

If it’s close contact and they’re singing off-key [laughs], that’s why we have in-ear monitors. I don’t wanna hear them, but sometimes I’ve pulled my in-ears out and they’ll be singing off-key, and usually I’ll just crack a joke.

Us: What’s your craziest concert or tour experience?

DM: The best show — the biggest, most-awesome moment — was when we played Welcome to Rockville [music festival], a couple years back. I think Metallica was headlining. It was 30 or 40,000 people. One of the bands left because someone thought that they had Covid, and they bumped us to a later slot. And so with the changeover, they made the crowd wait a little bit, and the sun was going down and they started chanting my name, which has never happened.

It was just a huge sea of people that were excited to be at a concert. They were probably very excited that Metallica was coming soon thereafter. But it was an awesome show. I have a picture that my tour manager took [that was] blown up in my office, and that’s just a moment I’ll never forget.

Us: What did that feel like?

DM: I was touched and shocked. The audience really affects the show. Their energy really affects us. Artists, we’re very empathetic and intuitive, and we can feel all their energy. Sometimes you get a bad crowd, and that’s tough. You have to kind of fake it and be a professional, and do your job and sing through the set. But when you have a rowdy, fun electric crowd, there’s nothing like it.

Us: What song is the most challenging to perform live?

DM: “Gifts From The Holy Ghost” can be really hard because the verses start out actually in my higher end of my range. So we put that later in the set, so that everyone’s a little warmed up. It’s a high energy song, but it’s also a really rewarding song. It’s fun to sing live, even if it’s challenging. But if I’m having a super tough vocal day, it wouldn’t be the first song I pick. [laughs]

Us: How about your favorite song to play live?

I feel like that changes with each album. Because there’s songs that I’ve been singing for a decade, and then there’s songs that are new that we’re gonna rehearse and try out for this upcoming tour that starts in April. So I’m really looking forward to trying out “Tombstone Town.”

“Mud” was so much fun to do live. I was flying by the seat of my pants. I didn’t get a chance to rehearse. We had two shows with Godsmack; we were opening for them. I literally didn’t get a chance to rehearse, and I thought, ‘Oh no, I’m gonna have to sing to tracks.’ And somehow we got to soundcheck and I tried it a few times and I’m like, ‘Oh, this is super fun.’

“Guys, I’m alive. I’m recovering and am going to come back swinging,” Pinfield, 63, told The Hollywood Reporter on Friday, March 14.

The longtime 120 Minutes host confirmed initial reports that he was “unresponsive for two months” after falling into a coma on January 6.

Pinfield made a miraculous recovery in February and has since been discharged from the intensive care unit so he can be treated at a Los Angeles rehabilitation center. The classic rock radio DJ expressed hope that he’ll be able to return to work soon.

“I’m definitely going to take some time to recover,” he insisted. “Then I’ll do my radio shows again and get back to work doing what I love, which is to entertain people playing music.”

The former VJ was working in radio for both KLOS and KCSN in Los Angeles before his hospitalization. Matt shared his gratitude to those in the rock community who rallied behind him on social media, as well thanking his daughter Jessica Pinfield, 38, for assuming temporary guardianship during his hospitalization.

“She’s the one who saved my life. She protected me,” Matt said of his daughter.

Many rock superstars offered supportive words following Matt’s initial hospitalization, including Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan, hard rock legends Living Colour and singer-songwriter Pete Yorn.

“Thinking of Matt Pinfield and his family during this difficult time and sending them love and support. We love you Matt,” Corgan wrote January 19 via X.

“He has championed so many artists over the decades who would have otherwise been ignored by mainstream media and the American music scene would be very different indeed without his taste and influence,” Manson insisted. “If it wasn’t for Matt, our band wouldn’t even exist. He was our fairy godmother.”

Pinfield worked at MTV on and off from 1995 to 2013, and also served as vice president of A&R and artist development for Columbia Records from 2001 to 2006. In his record label job, Pinfield guided the early careers of Coheed and Cambria, Cold and Crossfade.

He later told Sweet James Accident Attorneys that his life was “completely turned upside down” when his leg was “snapped in half” in the crash.

While Kent had moved forward following her tumultuous breakup, she confessed that she still gets “a pit” in her stomach when she visits places the pair used to frequent. However, Kent is still pushing through.

“I have to remind myself, ‘You’re OK,’” she reflected. “That time of your life is over and you’re on the other side.”

Kent shared that she’s reached the point where she feels “good” now.

Kent and Emmett started dating in December 2015. Three years later, the director proposed to the Vanderpump Rules alum. While engaged, they welcomed daughter Ocean, now 4, in March 2021. Seven months after Ocean’s arrival, Us Weekly confirmed that the pair split.

After the breakup, Kent and Emmett entered a battle for custody over Ocean. Earlier this month, Kent announced that she and Emmett’s back and forth was over.

“After over three years, we have signed an agreement that is best for our daughter, Ocean. So I’m very, very happy about that,” she said during a March Amazon Live.

During the sitdown with Cartwright on Friday, The Valley star asked her friend for advice for coparenting amid her ongoing divorce from Jax Taylor. (Cartwright and Taylor share 3-year-old son Cruz.)

“I’ve been where you are right now. All the chicks are sending you messages, you’re in the thick of it,” Kent shared. “But I think my biggest piece of advice to you is No. 1: know this is not your forever. Take a moment to remember that this is going to pass.”

Kent also encouraged Cartwright to not let Taylor zap her energy levels and reminded her it would take time to get to where she needs to be.

“When you are just chill with everything they fade away a bit and they will be peaceful with you. I know it seems like it will never happen but you will get to that place,” she said. “And I think just remembering that it is not your forever. When it becomes too much, don’t engage with him. It’s OK to block him.”

Kent shared that going through a breakup with a person who you share a child with can be tricky since you can’t cut the person out of your life 100 percent.

“When you share a child with someone, you don’t have the luxury of going ‘Goodbye get the f— out of my life.’ You have to engage still,” she reflected. “It’s mental torture but you’re going to get to a place … it’s kind of like clockwork.

Curry, who turns 37 on Friday, is the first player in NBA history to reach the milestone.

“It’s a clear milestone threshold,” Curry told ESPN before he hit the 4,000 made threes plateau. “A number that I didn’t think about, that it was realistic even from 2,974, which is a number that means the most because that was the record at the time.

“It was a weird night because we all knew I was two away,” Curry said after the game. “Made the first one in the first quarter off a transition, [Jonathan Kuminga] made a great pass. Sacramento was playing that gimmicky defense all game where they were literally face-guarding me, top-locking, and nothing was clean about it.”

The interior designer and TV personality, 48, tells Us Weekly exclusively that her new Design Network series The Sabrina Soto Show, which she first began developing in 2015, was created with viewers in mind. Soto wants to encourage people to “redesign their life” in all aspects, including wellness, beauty, food, and more.

“I want people to watch a show and feel motivated to redesign their life. I know that sounds so cliche and just so, what I should say when I’m doing interviews, but I seriously mean it,” Soto said. “My whole goal in creating the show is so that people watch it and go, ‘Oh my gosh, I can do that.’ The fact that I’m already getting DMs from people saying that they feel that way makes my heart just explode.”

The show, which is filmed in Soto’s home, features a long list of accomplished experts and celebrities, including New Thought Minister and author Michael Beckwith, Iron Chef alum Cat Cora, and Fast X star Jason Momoa, who is Soto’s longtime friend. The HGTV star tells Us that she and Momoa first formed a friendship in their 20s.

From Blake Lively baking a flavorful brie confit, to Chrissy Teigen wielding a knife, see these celebrities chop, sauté, and cook their way to perfection here!

“Everyone who was on the show is really, for the most part, a friend of mine,” Soto explained. “Jason Momoa, he and I have been friends since we were in our 20s. What’s funny is when Jason and I were first hanging out, we both didn’t have anything. He would come over to eat, but I had no money so I would make the cheapest best meal that I could make, which was boxed, baked ziti.”

Luckily, Soto can now cook a much more delicious version of her signature ziti. The TV personality revealed that, during Momoa’s episode, she makes “bougie, baked, handmade pasta with organic tomatoes and all of the better ingredients” in remembrance of their fond memories together as 20-somethings.

“We laughed about how I used to make him baked ziti,” Soto said about Momoa’s segment, sharing that the pair also discussed grounding, a practice that involves making direct skin contact with the Earth.

Though Soto began her career as an interior designer on HGTV, she wanted her new series to delve into a wide range of topics, in part because she is a “mom,” “in my late 40s” and “a business woman.”

Related: Stars Who Have Had Their Own Cooking Shows Over the Years Although celebrities such as Selena Gomez and Florence Pugh have made a name for themselves in the acting world — they also proved that they can create a unique performance in the kitchen. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the former Disney star chose to sharpen her skills alongside professional chefs and her loved ones. “People who […]

“At the end of the day, I just want to be the best version of myself,” Soto said. “I realized that I came from the generation that didn’t have social media. We had magazines. Now, we’re on social media and there’s so many tips, but some of them are clickbait. I wanted to create some sort of place where people can go and experts in their fields could share their knowledge to redesign your life, whether it is in wellness, fitness, [or] beauty. That when you watch the show, you have some sort of takeaway to make your life better.”

The Sabrina Soto Show premieres on The Design Network Monday, March 17, and will be available to stream on Hulu.",usmagazine

The couple is hosting a five-day Clooney Foundation for Justice fundraiser in Lake Como this coming August. Only 16 guests will attend the prestigious event, with participation starting at $173,000 per room, and this is the price before the required $60,000 donation per person to the nonprofit. This adds up to $233,000 from the jump.

The Clooney Foundation for Justice was founded in 2016 and provides legal aid in defense of free speech and women’s rights in over 40 countries. The nonprofit has a goal to raise over $1 million in direct support from the fundraising event in August.

Guests will stay at the Passalacqua hotel, an 18th century villa that overlooks the lake. Emma Ponsonby, CEO of Satopia Group, who is organizing the event, stated that guests will experience “the most incredible aspects of Lake Como,” in a statement according to Variety on Thursday, March 13.

Aside from their hotel stay, the philanthropic guests will indulge in various dinners and attend a garden party hosted by George, 63, and Amal, 47. Those paying the hefty price tag will also have exclusive access to tourist sites and experience boat rides on the lake along with a night at Como’s Teatro Sociale.

Guests who have already bought a ticket “have an interest or are active in their own philanthropic foundations,” Ponsonby said, per Variety. “They have their own objectives that they’re trying to work on and they want to collaborate with the Clooney Foundation.”

George and Amal host the Albie Awards as part of the foundation to honor courageous justice defenders.

“Tonight is really one of the happiest moments for us because we are here to celebrate and honor these justice warriors,” George told Vanity Fair when attending the 2022 Albies in New York City. “They are the most important people doing amazing things to fight for democracy, but they are all at risk. Our job is to try to draw attention to their causes, help them not go to jail, and save their lives. These justice warriors are real-life heroes.”

Us exclusively revealed on Thursday, March 13, that Aaron filed for divorce from Victoria, 32. According to the filing, the pair wed on May 4, 2020, the date Aaron previously shared was supposed to be the day of the wedding ceremony which was pushed back two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The paperwork also stated there was no chance for a reconciliation between the twosome.

“The views, tastes, likes and dislikes of husband and wife have become incompatible to the extent that it has become impossible for them to live together … in marital harmony,” the docs read. “There is no possibility of reconciliation.”

The news of the pair’s divorce comes days after Victoria was arrested on charges of soliciting to commit murder and conspiring to commit murder. Victoria was held on $100,000 bail. (TMZ was the first to report the news on Monday, March 10.)

According to police reports obtained by Us, Victoria had been in contact with a prison inmate in Florida named Grant Amato about wanting to leave her and Aaron’s marriage.

Documents obtain by Us confirm that the actor’s will hadn’t been updated since June 2005.

Us Weekly confirmed on February 27 that Hackman, 95, and Arakawa, 64, were found dead at their Santa Fe home. After nearly one week of unanswered questions about the nature of their deaths, chief medical examiner for New Mexico Dr. Heather Jarrell determined the respective causes.

“The cause of death for Mrs. Hackman is hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. The cause of death is natural,” Dr. Jarrell said. It’s believed that she died on the evening of February 11.

Authorities believe that Hackman died a week later, on February 18, due to hypertensive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with Alzheimer’s disease as a significant contributing factor.

Hackman’s estate has since reportedly filed a legal petition to keep sensitive images regarding the actor and his wife’s death investigation out of the public eye.

“A preliminary injunction is necessary to protect the estates of Mr. Hackman and Ms. Arakawa-Hackman’s right to privacy,” the document, which was filed on March 11, read.

Hackman was first married to Faye Maltese from 1956 to 1986. The couple shared three children, Christopher, Elizabeth and Leslie. Maltese died in 2017. The Superman actor went […]

Prior to their deaths, Hackman and Arakawa “placed significant value on their privacy and took affirmative, vigilant steps to safeguard their privacy,” the document stated. Their estate is asking the same courtesy be placed on the details regarding their deaths, especially when it comes to photos and video, including body-cam footage.

Amanda Lavin, the legal director at the nonprofit New Mexico Foundation for Open Government, released a statement in the wake of the petition filed by Hackman’s estate. She argued that it could impact public accountability.

“I do think it does infringe on transparency if the court were to prohibit release of all the investigation records, including the autopsies,” she told the Associated Press. “The whole idea of those records being available is to ensure accountability in the way those investigations are done.”",usmagazine

You could go to the movies to see Mickey 17, Robert Pattinson’s wild new sci-fi film from Parasite director Bong Joon-hoo. Or maybe you’re in the mood for a cool, sexy spy thriller like Black Bag starring Michael Fassbender, Cate Blanchett, and Bridgerton‘s Rege-Jean Page?

But who wants to battle all those crowds?

If you feel like staying home this weekend, there are plenty of movies available for you to stream. Netflix has hundreds of them, but the following three stand out from the rest for being overlooked, underrated, and just damn good to watch. These are the Netflix movies you should stream over the weekend; otherwise, you risk being bored, and no one wants that.

Daddio (2023)

A film festival hit in 2023, Daddio was released to crickets last summer. That’s a shame, as the drama, a character study largely set in a taxi as it travels from John F. Kennedy airport to Manhattan, is riveting stuff. It also gave Dakota Johnson another chance to shine after her memorable work in Cha Cha Real Smooth, and the first decent role two-time Oscar winner Sean Penn has had in over a decade.

In addition to his career as an Oscar-winning actor and his relationships with A-listers including Madonna, Robin Wright and Charlize Theron, Penn has made headlines through the years for controversial behavior and comments. Keep scrolling to for a look back at Penn’s […]

While waiting outside the airport, veteran taxi driver Clark (Penn) picks up a young woman known only as Girlie (Johnson). She needs to get to Manhattan, and fast, but as traffic stalls, Clark breaks the awkward silence with some chit chat. What follows is an extended exchange between two strangers who share their most intimate thoughts about love, sex, politics, religion, and everything in between. Even though it’s set largely in a car, Daddio never feels claustrophobic or boring, and Johnson and Penn share an odd chemistry that makes them fascinating to watch.

Daddio is streaming on Netflix.

The Children’s Train (2024)

There’ve been scores of movies about the European experience during World War II, but what about what happened immediately afterward? The Children’s Train is set in Italy around 1946 and focuses on young Amerigo (Christian Cervone), who is sent by his poor mother to travel to Northern Italy to live with a foster family. He’s reluctantly taken in by Derma (Barbara Ronchi), who’s still grieving the loss of her lover during the war, and her brother Alcide (Ivan Zerbinati), who has three young boys of his own. Once settled in, Amerigo undergoes all the highs and lows of growing up, and may discover a way out of his impoverished life once and for all.

Released late last year, The Children’s Train was swallowed by Netflix’s punishing algorithm and hasn’t been talked about much since. But it’s never too late to discover a quality gem, and The Children’s Train, with its sympathetic portrait of post-war youth, qualifies. The movie depicts a time and place rarely seen on screen, and it expertly toes the line between sentimentality and realism. The ending is a heartbreaker, so save some tissues on hand to wipe away those tears.

The Children’s Train is streaming on Netflix.

The Menu (2022)

“Eat the rich” takes on a whole new meaning with The Menu, a deliciously entertaining 2022 social satire that’s only grown in stature with the passing years. Reclusive celebrity chef Julian Slowik (Ralph Fiennes) invites a select few wealthy guests to a secluded island to take part in a once-in-a-lifetime dinner. Among the guests are Tyler Ledford (Nicholas Hoult), a foodie with questionable morals, and his girlfriend Margot Mills (Anya Taylor-Joy), who couldn’t care less about fine dining.

It’s Margot who first realizes that something’s not quite right with the whole setup. Why can’t anyone leave the island once they start the dinner? And what’s with the tortillas that include written messages that reveal the shameful secrets of each guest? The Menu soon becomes a series of WTF moments in the best kind of way, with each scene topping the next. Fiennes has never been better as the bitter chef, while Taylor-Joy shines as an everywoman who just wants to eat a nice, juicy burger.

Some may read a book while others will take advantage of the warming weather to venture outside. You might be bold and check out Meghan Markle’s new lifestyle show on Netflix, With Love, Meghan.

But if you’re like Us and want to watch some quality movies from the comfort of your own home, then you probably want to take advantage of one of the many streaming subscriptions you’re signed up for.

HBO and its streaming platform Max have tons of underrated movies to stream, and the following three are hidden treasures that are worth polishing off and having a look.

A drama set in Hawaii, a thriller about an affair gone wrong, and an inside look at reality TV’s earliest watershed moment are just the ticket for an entertaining weekend that doesn’t involve stepping one foot outside.

Cinema Vérité (2011)

In 1973, PBS aired a groundbreaking documentary that captured America’s attention and forever changed the television landscape. An American Family documented the seemingly ordinary lives of a Southern California family, the Louds, but it also revealed several then-shocking secrets: mom and dad’s decision to divorce and one son’s coming-out as gay.

The story behind the documentary is just as fascinating as the real thing, and Cinema Vérité dramatizes the filming of the show and its aftermath. Diane Lane is fantastic as Pat Loud, the chic matriarch who is fed up with her husband Bill (Tim Robbins), and James Gandolfini has one of his best roles ever as Craig Gilbert, the producer of the show. Cinema Vérité nails its early 1970s aesthetic (Dig those shag carpets!) and presents a fascinating look at the exact moment when reality television was born.

Cinema Vérité is streaming on Max.

Stone (2010)

This underrated movie on Max is perhaps the most obscure one on this list. Jack Mabry (Robert De Niro) is a parole officer on the cusp of retirement. A thorough man, he asks to help one more convict before he leaves his job–Gerald “Stone” Creeson (Edward Norton). Stone insists he’s been reformed and regrets his earlier crimes. When Stone’s wife, Lucetta (Milla Jovovich), enters the picture, things get messy as Jack begins to fall for her while trying to help a man whose past actions have caused numerous deaths.

Stone is a tricky thriller, one that never really reveals all its cards until late in the game. As Jack, De Niro is appropriately shifty and ambiguous; you never quite think he’s as squeaky clean as he would like to be. Taking a break from fighting digital zombies in the Resident Evil franchise, Jovovich is impressive as Lucetta, whose devotion to her husband is both admirable and scary. Stone is better than its largely forgotten status, and is worth a stream for those who want a well-acted thriller with an unsettling ending.

The Descendants (2011)

This year’s Oscars ceremony is over, but that doesn’t mean you have to stop watching award-worthy films. The Descendants was nominated for 5 Academy Awards in 2012, winning Best Adapted Screenplay, and it hasn’t aged a bit. It remains George Clooney’s best dramatic movie, and gave then-teen star Shaliene Woodley an adult role that launched her career.

George Clooney is a cut above the rest when it comes to Hollywood greats — but his success wasn’t overnight. The Oscar winner broke into the entertainment industry in 1978 and was always focused on booking the next gig from the very start. Luckily for him, that included small […]

Clooney stars as Matt King, a Hawaii-based lawyer who is facing one crisis after another. His wife is in an irreversible coma, his extended family wants him to sell his valuable ancestral land to make some fast money, and his two daughters are getting into trouble at school. When Matt discovers a revelation about his wife, he’s forced to re-examine what’s really important to him, and the unavoidable reality of his wife’s condition.

Not a lot of dramas are set in Hawaii, and part of the appeal of The Descendants is watching all the drama play out in gorgeous locations that most people would spend small fortunes to visit. Clooney is surprisingly believable as a man besieged by uncertainty about his own abilities as a husband and father, and Woodley is just terrific as his teenaged daughter Alex, a recovering addict who knows more about her mother than she’d like.

The “Hot to Go” singer opened up about her style inspiration during a June 2024 appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, which itself featured a costume change.

“Well, my stylist, Genesis Webb and I, we pull from drag, we pull from horror movies, we pull from burlesque, we pull from theater,” Roan explained while dressed as a black swan (before changing into a white swan look for her performance). “I love looking pretty and scary, or pretty and tacky, or just not pretty. I love that too. It’s just not serious. I love that fans find such deep meanings to things and I’m just like, ‘I don’t know, I thought I looked hot.’”

That same month, Roan channeled late drag queen Divine from John Waters’ film Pink Flamingos for a set at Kentuckiana Pride. “Filth is my politics! Filth is my life!” she captioned a set of Instagram snaps from the event. “Inspired by Divine the most beautiful woman in the world, almost <3.”

The country star, 30, dropped “East Coast” on Friday, March 14, after teasing clips of the track via social media. “I have realized the more authentic you are and the more you reveal yourself in your songs, the more people will connect — and ‘East Coast’ is a song where I’m doing that,” Wade exclusively told Us Weekly of the new song.

The emotional tune is about the aftermath of a devastating breakup, with lyrics like, “If I’m so selfish / I’ll break my own heart / This pain is relentless / It’ll follow me into the dark.”

Wade’s feelings only get deeper on the chorus: “But I’m gonna drive to the coast / Drown myself in the sea / Hope you know I loved you the most / Yeah, but you took the life outta me.”

The singer-songwriter is on tour right now promoting her fourth studio album, Obsessed, which she released in August 2024. Earlier this year, her famous friend Kyle Richards attended Wade’s concert in Los Angeles, where Wade asked the audience to pray for Teddi Mellencamp. The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum, 43, had just revealed that she needed to undergo emergency surgery to remove tumors on her brain caused by melanoma.

“We’re really blessed to have a bunch of people here with me tonight,” Wade told the crowd. “If you don’t mind, tonight when you leave here, say a prayer for my good friend Teddi Mellencamp. I went to visit her a little bit ago.”

The “Halloween” singer noted that Mellencamp would have been in the audience that night if not for her surgery.

Wade appeared on a few episodes of RHOBH during season 13, which aired from late 2023 through spring 2024. During the current season, however, Richards said she didn’t want to use Wade’s name when she wasn’t there to defend herself.

“I know there’s a lot of curiosity about the person they always talk about,” Richards, 56, said during the November 2024 season 14 premiere. “I’m not using her name intentionally. I don’t want to speak on anyone’s behalf except my own.”

Wade has recently been battling some health issues of her own as she deals with vocal problems. She was forced to cancel her Wednesday, March 12, concert in Cleveland, but she’s set to return to the stage on Friday in New York City.

Who’s the Queen of Country?

“I was really hoping to have some better news today. I was really hoping we were going to be able to play tonight, so much so that we are here in Cleveland, but my voice is just not,” Wade told her Instagram followers in a video shared on Wednesday. “It’s not coming back for some reason. I met with the doctor this morning and it’s just not smart, and there’s absolutely no way I could perform and give you guys 100 percent. But I’m truly sorry. I continue to rest today and tomorrow so I can get back on my feet and we’ll make it up to you guys.”",usmagazine

“My Babydoll’s morning after a 6+ hour surgery,” he wrote. “I mean ain’t God good?”

The video comes after David asked supporters earlier in the week for prayers as Lindsey prepared for the procedure.

After his post, the football and sports media world rallied around the couple, with NFL RedZone host Scott Hanson writing, “Praying for her, you, your family and the health care team. I hope you are heartened by the thousands of responses here. And more so by the character of our great God.”

“We never crossed paths at ESPN, but thinking of your wife and your family,” Former ESPN personality Britt McHenry, added, “We never crossed paths at ESPN, but thinking of your wife and your family. I, too, had brain cancer and surgery for it at Hopkins 5 years ago. If she needs anyone to talk to after it, I’m here. She’s got this. 💪🏼.”

In his playing days, David played four seasons at Georgia, an SEC rival of the LSU Tigers, who Saban coached at the time.

David and Lindsey grew up in Gwinnett County in Georgia, attending rival high schools. He revealed in a 2005 interview with ESPN that his friends at Shiloh High School told him that he couldn’t date a girl from Parkview High. Rather than heeding their advice, he married Lindsey in June 2005.

“There was a sense of warmth on the set,” Macht, 53, told Us Weekly exclusively while promoting his starring role in Bear Fight Whiskey’s first-ever ad campaign. “I grew up in L.A. and there was full circle moments for me, which were really cool.”

Macht is set to return to his iconic role as Harvey Specter (whom he played in the OG Suits from 2011 to 2019) in the Sunday, March 16, episode of Suits LA. He told Us that while the new cast was so “welcoming,” working with some crew members was “nostalgic” — something he felt in more ways than one.

“There’s some scenes where you see me on the baseball field, and we shot at a park that I used to practice [at] in high school. We’re eating at the Factor’s Deli down the street from where I grew up — that’s one of the locations — so that was cool,” Macht said. “One of the camera operators was an old friend who went to high school with a cousin of mine.”

His dad, Stephen Macht (who played Professor Henry Gerard in the OG Suits), even stopped by the Suits LA set.

“Even before he said hello to anybody, here he is sitting in the stands watching the game. I remember being 15 and seeing him in the stands,” Macht added. “There was a nostalgia, a warmth and a real playfulness. We had a really good time.”

Suits LA has been teasing Macht’s return as Harvey since before the show premiered late last month. While the actor couldn’t say much about what fans will see once the episode airs on Sunday, he did tease Harvey’s relationship with Ted Black (Stephen Amell).

“Ted and Harvey were very close pals. They basically come from the same cloth, they really admire each other, respect each other, are able to really get at each other,” he explained. “They came up in the District Attorney’s office together, and we’re going to find out more of his backstory and what makes him tick through seeing his relationship with Harvey.”

Macht has spoken about passing the torch to the “terrific” Amell at length and couldn’t help but continue to give the actor his flowers.

“He’s great,” Macht gushed. “Such a great guy and open and collaborative and awesome.”

Aside from the highly anticipated Suits LA return, Macht also has a new role as the creative director for Bear Fight Whisky. The actor starred in the brand’s first-ever ad campaign (a hilarious commercial, if you ask Us), which featured Macht “getting the crap kicked out of [him]” by a man in a bear costume.

The narrative of the campaign is that “we all have our own little bear fights,” Macht explained. “We all have challenges, whether they’re really big or really small, all of us. It’s just a universal theme in all of our lives.”

He added, “What’s your bear fight and how at the end of the day, can you have a glass of whiskey, or shot, or however you want to enjoy your whiskey and celebrate your engagement with the risks that you take — and do it responsibly. I’m all for that narrative because we’re all going through it.”

Fans might be used to seeing Macht a certain way — dressed up in a full suit, perhaps — but wearing a flannel and drinking Bear Fight Whiskey is the real him.

“When I look at something, I want something that tastes good, that’s bold, that’s taking a risk, but that’s approachable,” he said. “Something that every man and woman and whoever anyone can enjoy. And I think that that’s what this is.”

The Hollywood legend made Betsy his sole beneficiary back in 1995, according to the docs, obtained by TMZ.

What's interesting is that his three children -- son Christopher and two daughters Leslie and Elizabeth -- are not named in the will. It was all supposed to go to Betsy ... but, the timing of their deaths could change where the money goes.

Play video content TMZ.com

As we told you ... early findings indicate Betsy died from hantavirus, a rare disease that can be fatal ... while Gene passed away about a week later due to cardiovascular disease. Officials made it clear Hackman was struggling with Alzheimer's disease -- which would explain why he never called the police about his wife.

Betsy's will leaves most of her assets to Gene, but there's a provision which says if they died within 90 days of each other, it would be considered a simultaneous death, and in that case, her will provides all of her assets would go to charity.

New Mexico is a community property state, so assuming there's no prenup, Betsy's estate could have a lot of money and her share would go to charity.

As for Gene's estate ... despite the fact he did not include his children in his will, they would presumably get his share since they are the most direct living heirs.

Andrew M. Katzenstein -- a prominent California trust and estate attorney -- has reportedly been hired by Gene's son Chris, who's the oldest sibling ... indicating he may challenge the will.

Hackman discussed his difficult relationship with his children over the years ... admitting he wasn't around much during Chris' formative years. He had gotten closer to his kids in more recent years.

Julia Peters, a representative for the estate of Hackman and Arakawa, has also filed paperwork asking the court to grant a preliminary injunction preventing authorities from releasing any photo or video of evidence of the death scene -- officer body cam footage for example -- citing Gene and Betsy's right to privacy.

Once back on land, the 22-year-old student claims he vomited seawater as Sudiksha walked away to get her personal belongings that had been pushed down the beach by waves.

He alleges he asked her if she was OK ... but did not hear her response because he was busy chucking up water. He remembers her being in knee-deep water and walking at an ""angle"" -- and says he never saw her again.

Joshua says he fell asleep on the beach and woke up to being bitten by mosquitoes at sunrise ... prompting him to head back to his hotel and hit the hay again.

Sudiksha and Joshua were reportedly both guests at the Riu Republica hotel resort. The college students were both seen together -- with Joshua's arm around Sudiksha -- heading to the beach around 4:15 AM. Investigators believe she vanished around 4:50 AM.

Though Joshua is confident he saved her life while they were together ... he reportedly refused to answer several key questions from police -- saying his lawyers have advised him to keep quiet -- according to Noticias SIN.

After a highly publicized trial, Majors had just learned that a jury convicted him of one count of misdemeanor third-degree assault and one count of second-degree harassment of his ex-girlfriend, British dancer Grace Jabbari. Inside the hushed car, a member of his legal team turned around from the front seat and delivered the next piece of news. “He goes, ‘I’m just gonna tell you now,’” Majors says. “That way you’re not surprised, and you can start processing it. They fired you. Marvel fired you.’”

Before his arrest that March, Majors was fresh off the Warner Bros. box office hit Creed III, the Marvel movie Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and an Emmy nomination for the HBO series Lovecraft Country. He seemed poised to explode professionally. Cast as the MCU’s new villain, Kang the Conqueror, the heir apparent to Josh Brolin’s franchise staple character Thanos, Majors was on track to make life-changing money and to lead 2026’s Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. He was also set to be the subject of a well-financed Oscar campaign for the indie movie Magazine Dreams, a drama Disney’s specialty studio, Searchlight Pictures, bought after it premiered to critical raves at Sundance, particularly for Majors’ raw performance.

All of that evaporated when a jury determined that Majors was responsible for a cut behind Jabbari’s ear and a fractured finger, and a judge later sentenced him to probation and a 52-week domestic violence intervention program. Majors was also dropped by his manager, Entertainment 360, and publicity firm, The Lede Company. (His agent, WME’s Elan Ruspoli, who testified as a witness in the trial, remained with Majors and still represents him today.)

“There were days when it was like, ‘Is this real?’” says Majors, 35, of the period of time during and immediately after his trial, where he pleaded not guilty. “It’s a heartbreak like I’ve never experienced and it just compounded and compounded.”

Majors’ story provokes a range of reactions — anger from survivors of domestic violence, protectiveness from his friends and colleagues, confusion from fans. The actor’s contested narrative is about to enter its next act, when Magazine Dreams finally comes to theaters on March 21, more than two years after the film’s Sundance premiere, via the small distributor Briarcliff Entertainment.

In a long and emotional interview in February, and a follow-up interview in March, Majors, who had not sat down with a journalist since he was sentenced in April 2024, talked for the first time about the aftermath of the trial, about the childhood sexual abuse that he says led to depression as an adult and about what his life looks like now. Majors says he is unable to comment directly on Jabbari’s allegations of domestic violence (Jabbari also brought a civil suit against Majors, and their settlement presumably limits what either party can say about the case). Still, his position frustrates those who followed his trial and want a full apology, including at least one ex-girlfriend who spoke to THR. Majors says he does feel responsible for the direction of his life.

“At some point there has to be accountability for writing your own story,” Majors says. “Am I going to fall into that narrative of falling apart, of self-destruction? Have a struggle, blame the world. Have a struggle, hate yourself. Have a struggle, deny everything. None of those narratives is beneficial.” Instead, Majors says, his strategy as he builds a new life post-trial is: “Have a struggle, learn, metabolize, grow.”

In addition to Majors, this article is also based on interviews with 19 others, most speaking on the record about their experiences with the actor. Whether Hollywood will take Majors back is an open question, and will depend in part on whether audiences show up for Magazine Dreams. But many high-profile people who have worked with Majors are advocating for him. “You don’t get to say sorry these days,” says Whoopi Goldberg, who appeared with Majors in his first screen role, the 2017 TV miniseries When We Rise, and works with his fiancée, Meagan Good, on the Amazon Prime series Harlem, which just aired its third season. “He was arrested. He went to court. He did what he was supposed to do. I’m not sure what else there is.” Majors’ Creed III director and co-star Michael B. Jordan says he would like to work with Majors again. “I would love to make Creed IV together — among other projects,” Jordan says over email. Matthew McConaughey, who co-starred with Majors in the 2018 Sony crime drama White Boy Rick, writes, “I’ve known and know him as someone who is continuously striving to improve as a human, a man and an actor. I believe in him.”

But Maura Hooper, one of two of Majors’ ex-girlfriends who gave a pretrial statement to prosecutors in the Jabbari case alleging abuse, in her case emotional abuse, isn’t sold on Majors’ comeback. “I don’t really care that his movie is coming out,” Hooper says. “What do you get at the end of a 52-week domestic violence course? Do the victims get a debrief? How could I know if he’s changed? I don’t see redemption happening here.”

Majors grew up outside Dallas, raised by his mother, a pastor, with whom he is still close. His father, a classical pianist who was in the Air Force, left when he was 8, and Majors did not see him again until his dad came with his sister to see him perform in a college play in North Carolina. “My pop is a very beautiful man, very gentle, but had some qualities that were not complementary to family life,” Majors says. “He was the best dad until he wasn’t. And when he wasn’t, he was gone.”

Majors says after his trial, in addition to the domestic violence program, he underwent therapy and reengaged with his pastor, and as a result began to unpack childhood traumas he had not confronted before. “I dealt with sexual abuse from both men and women from the time I was 9,” Majors says. “From people who are supposed to look after you, in the absence of a father. I was fucked up.” In recent months, when Majors told his mother about the abuse, he says she apologized for not being able to protect him. “I’m like, ‘It’s not even an issue, mom. I just want you to know. And now we can all get busy and continue to connect and grow and learn from it, because it’s something that was in our family.’” Processing the abuse, Majors says, has led to more self-knowledge about his behavior in relationships. “There are no excuses, but by getting help, you begin to understand things about yourself.”

As a kid, Majors played sports — basketball, boxing and, with a Texan level of fervor, football. He took advanced placement classes in school and participated in debate and forensics competitions. “I would say, ‘I’m just fooling around,’” Majors says of the oratory competitions. “But I wasn’t.” Money was always an issue, he says, with the family, including his sister, Monica, now a doctor, and brother, Cameron, now a kinesiologist, frequently being evicted and having to move. He describes his mother, who has a masters degree in divinity, selling everything from coffins at a funeral parlor to her own blood plasma to pay the bills.

Majors was kicked out of his high school for fighting — fights that often started, he says, because he or his siblings were being bullied. “We looked poor,” he says. “We were pretty nomadic going from school to school, place to place. I had a big nose. Guys would pick on me. And I was for a long time the outsider.” Thanks to some teachers who were invested in his talent, Majors eventually found his way into theater as a different, healthier channel for his emotions. “I never had a moment where I went, ‘I want to be a movie star,’” Majors says. “But I had the moment that was like, ‘I’m going to act for the rest of my life, and I’m going to be the best I can be at this. I’m going to throw everything into it,’ and I have.”

After getting his bachelor of fine arts at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, and while completing his master of fine arts at Yale Drama, Majors booked his first screen role, as gay activist Ken Jones in When We Rise, the miniseries with Goldberg. For the many strong opinions about Majors’ offscreen life, Hollywood does agree on one thing — the quality of his acting. Majors broke into the industry with a series of emotionally varied performances: a daydreaming playwright in the 2019 A24 drama The Last Black Man in San Francisco, the son of a withholding Vietnam veteran in Spike Lee’s 2020 Netflix war drama Da 5 Bloods, a young man traveling through the Jim Crow South in the Jordan Peele-produced horror series Lovecraft Country, a 19th century gunslinger in the Jay-Z-produced 2021 Netflix Western The Harder They Fall, an aviator opposite Glen Powell in the independently financed 2022 Korean War drama Devotion. “One of my jobs as an actor is to let people see themselves, to give them an opportunity to examine themselves through me,” Majors says, of his craft. “It’s a service job in a way.”

Even in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, one of the worst-reviewed Marvel movies, critics singled out his work. “It’s Majors who brings real gravitas to the proceedings,” wrote THR’s critic, Frank Scheck, of the 2023 sci-fi film. “While it’s not surprising that the actor’s imposing physicality perfectly suits his iconic villainous character, he also invests his performance with such an arrestingly quiet stillness and ambivalence that you’re on edge every moment he’s onscreen.”

“Do I hope to make more movies? Absolutely. That is my intention,” says Majors. “But that’s not my call. I don’t have a studio. And I’ve given up control.” Photographed by Frank Ockenfels 3

In March 2023, after a seeing a play at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and having dinner out, Majors and Jabbari were in the back seat of a chauffeured Escalade, crossing the Manhattan Bridge, when Jabbari saw a text pop up on Majors’ phone that read, “Oh how I wish to be kissing you.” During Jabbari’s testimony at trial, she said that she tried to grab Majors’ phone, and that in response he twisted her right arm. Suddenly, Jabbari testified, she felt “a really hard blow across my head.” After the car finished crossing the bridge and arrived on Canal Street in lower Manhattan, Majors asked the driver to stop. Video that was played in court shows Majors jump out of the Escalade, followed by Jabbari, before he turns around, picks her up, pushes her back inside the car and runs. Jabbari then jumps out of the car and chases him.

The sole witness to the altercation was the car’s driver, who testified at the trial through an Urdu language translator. “The boy wanted to get rid of the girl and he opened the door,” the driver testified. “He was saying, ‘Leave me alone. I have to go.’ He was not doing anything, she was doing it.” That night Majors went to stay at a hotel, Jabbari testified, and Jabbari went to a nightclub, before ultimately going back to the penthouse apartment in Chelsea where they lived. The next morning when Majors came home, he found Jabbari unconscious on the floor of a walk-in closet and called 911. During the call, which was played in court, when the 911 operator asked Majors what happened, he said, “I don’t know. She’s unconscious. She’s naked from the bottom down. She has a sweatshirt on. She’s my ex-partner. We broke up.” When the call is transferred to an EMS worker, Majors tells the emergency responder that Jabbari is not awake, but is breathing. “What should I do?” Majors asks. “What — what should I do?”

Jabbari was taken to Bellevue Hospital to treat the cut behind her ear and the fractured finger and to have a psychological evaluation. Majors was arrested and charged with three counts of third-degree assault, one count of second-degree harassment and one count of aggravated harassment, all misdemeanors. Typically, on such charges, a defendant would settle to prevent going to trial, but Majors insisted on his innocence, and his attorney said Jabbari was the aggressor in the incident, even going so far as to file a cross-complaint against her, which the Manhattan DA’s office declined to prosecute.

During Majors’ two-week trial in late 2023, the actor entered court each day with Good by his side and a Bible under his arm. Jabbari testified that Majors had a violent temper and that he had often slipped into “rage and aggression” during their relationship. Text messages between the two of them that were entered into evidence painted a portrait of a volatile relationship. In a series of messages from September 2022, six months before the car altercation, the couple were communicating about headaches Jabbari said she was having. Majors texted Jabbari, “I fear you have no perspective of what could happen if you go to the hospital. They will ask you questions, and as I don’t think you actually protect us, it could lead to an investigation even if you do lie, and they suspect something.” The facts of that September 2022 incident were not further detailed for the jury. The jury ended up splitting its verdict, convicting Majors of one count of misdemeanor third-degree assault and one count of second-degree harassment, but acquitting him of two other counts of assault and aggravated harassment. Essentially, they seemed to believe that Majors had, in fact, caused Jabbari’s injuries, but that he hadn’t intended to.

In another highly unusual move for a defendant, Majors gave an interview to ABC News before his sentencing, in which he said of Jabbari that he had been “reckless with her heart” but that he had never struck a woman, “ever.”

Asked if he believes that race is a factor in the way his story is unfolding, Majors says, “My journey is my journey, and it doesn’t benefit me to compare.”

Majors’ athletic body has been a key part of his success, allowing him to convincingly control the multiverse in Marvel and to step into the boxing ring opposite Jordan in Creed III. At 6-foot-1 and 200 pounds, Majors, who does this interview wearing a loose-fit sweater with an Aztec print, says he prefers baggy clothing. “I always keep myself covered up,” he says. “If the body was needed [for a role], it was needed. I worked on the body the same way I worked on my lines or the dialect or what have you.” Majors says he is the smallest man in his family and that his ability to build muscle comes significantly from his genetics — his grandfathers, he says, were 6-foot-6 and 6-foot-7 and over 250 pounds. Still, in Magazine Dreams, in which he plays a troubled aspiring bodybuilder named Killian, Majors found a role that pushed him to his limit. He calls it, “A very expensive movie. Not the budget, but the cost of it as an artist physically and emotionally.” For the duration of the 40-day shoot, Majors worked with four trainers to stay at the same level of muscularity that professional bodybuilders attain on the day of a competition, eating 6,000 calories a day along with creatine supplements and lifting weights before walking into a scene. Although the character takes steroids in the movie, Majors says he did not take any performance-enhancing drugs, for health reasons. “I want to have kids,” he says.

Magazine Dreams writer-director Elijah Bynum describes Killian as “someone who moves through the world with the peculiar pain of being both feared and ignored. The more he tries to connect, the further he pushes others away. He’s built up this armor of muscle around him to protect what is a very fragile, very lonely soul.” Watching Majors play Killian’s emotional breakdown and descent into violence in Magazine Dreams “was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced,” says the movie’s producer Jennifer Fox, who also produced Michael Clayton, Nightcrawler and The Bourne Legacy. “The level of commitment was extraordinary. I watched people on set break into applause after a take, some moved to tears, crewmembers exchanging looks, knowing they were witnessing something truly special.”

When he wasn’t on camera, Majors would jog around the soundstage, meditate and listen to music. “An actor needs a protected space to sustain the intensity of a performance like this,” Fox says. “That meant he often had to keep to himself.” Majors gave gifts to the cast and crew during the production, Fox says— a shaved ice truck, pies, a coffee truck. “He understood that he couldn’t always disengage between takes,” Fox says, “but he found meaningful ways to express his gratitude.”

After Majors’ arrest in the Jabbari case, there were news stories about his behavior on set, with allegations that he snapped at crewmembers. On the Magazine Dreams set, someone complained that Majors barked at a crewmember for approaching him as he was walking into a scene in which Killian has to punch himself in the face. Asked about the incident, Majors says he doesn’t remember the specific interaction, but that “it’s a difficult scene and it was a moment of preparation. I was like, ‘OK, I’m ready now.’”

THR reached out to 11 producers, directors and executives who have worked with the actor, three of whom he suggested (including Jordan). All of them, including the ones Majors did not know THR was contacting, praised his acting, his work ethic and his behavior on set. “Every day I saw someone who was incredibly respectful to me,” says Fox. “’Yes ma’am, no ma’am.’” There is always a gulf between the persona people show the world and the human being they are in private, and Majors’ professionalism on sets doesn’t disprove the allegations of his behavior in past romantic relationships. But many who have worked with Majors spoke of their shock when news of his arrest broke, their sense that the allegations didn’t align with their personal experiences of him.

Jabbari’s attorneys did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story. In November, after settling the civil suit she brought against Majors in which she alleged that he had been violent toward her multiple times, her lawyers released a statement saying, “We hope that [Jabbari] can finally put this chapter behind her and move forward with her head held high.”

THR also contacted two ex-girlfriends who had given pretrial statements to prosecutors, including Hooper, who alleged emotional abuse, and one who said that Majors had been physically abusive. Hooper, who dated Majors from 2013 to 2015 when they were students at Yale Drama School, detailed multiple incidents of controlling behavior, including Majors dictating where she could go and who she could socialize with and making threatening statements. The other woman, who was engaged to Majors from 2015 to 2019, did not respond to a request for comment. (The judge in Majors’ trial did not allow either statement, which were both submitted under the legally contentious Molineux rule that allows testimony about past behavior, to be entered into evidence.)

Majors is not the first actor to face allegations of domestic violence, and many before him went on to continued career opportunities. Mel Gibson pleaded no contest to misdemeanor battery of his ex-girlfriend in 2011 and was nominated for an Oscar in 2017; Christian Slater was sentenced to 90 days in jail and a one-year treatment program for battery in 1998 for violence against an ex-girlfriend and went on to win a Golden Globe for Mr. Robot. Josh Brolin was arrested in 2004 and charged with spousal battery against then-wife Diane Lane, who told police he had hit her; police dropped the case after Lane told them she didn’t want to press charges, and Brolin went on to enjoy a career resurgence, collecting an Oscar nomination and eventually, getting the Thanos role that is a kind of precursor to the Marvel role that Majors had.

There are differences between these cases and Majors’, including the pre-#MeToo era in which these arrests took place. There is also the fact that these actors are all white. Asked if he believes that race is a factor in the way his story is unfolding, Majors says, “My journey is my journey, and it doesn’t benefit me to compare.”

During his trial, Majors appeared in court daily with his then girlfriend, now fiancée, actress Meagan Good, whom he had met at the Ebony Power 100 Gala in November 2022, as he was walking out of a unisex bathroom and she was walking in. “I had seen a lot of his work and I was just like, ‘This kid is super talented,’” Good says, recalling the interaction. “I just remember thinking, ‘Hollywood is a strange town, and when you’re new to it, you don’t know who to trust or what’s what. I just want to say something and affirm him.’” As Majors remembers it, “She said to me, ‘I see you. I really love what you’re doing. Keep going.’ I stood up straight and said, ‘Yes, ma’am.’ We just looked at each other and that was that. And I didn’t stop thinking about it.” Majors says he sees pictures of himself sometimes from this era in his life, when his career was exploding, and thinks, “‘Oh, you’ve got a lot of work to do.’ And Meagan’s helped with that.”

They communicated as friends, the relationship turning romantic in the months after Majors’ March 2023 arrest. In May 2023, someone tipped off TMZ that the couple were at a movie theater together in L.A. “We didn’t plan to start dating and we didn’t plan to be seen out together,” Good says. “But once we were in a relationship, it was like, ‘Hey, this is what’s happening.’” Asked why she stayed with Majors and supported him publicly during the trial, Good says, “People tend to move out of the way out of concern for their careers or their reputations. To me, that’s not real love. If you know someone and if you believe in someone, it’s not conditional.”

In the year since Majors’ sentencing, he says he has built a quiet life in the Hollywood Hills with Good, who divorced preacher-turned-producer DeVon Franklin in 2022. They hike with their four Belgian Malinois dogs, work out and watch movies together. Majors has an 11-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, and he says he has continued to pay the same level of child support he paid when his career was booming, thanks to residual checks and help from friends. “When my dad split, we didn’t get anything,” he says. “And in this moment, I was like, ‘My daughter is not going to want for anything. I didn’t want to sacrifice her way of living.’ I didn’t want her to feel a big shift.” Majors lost his penthouse apartment in New York, and, within six months of his arrest, had diminished the nest egg he’d built from six years of continuous work in the entertainment industry by half. “Growing up poor, I had that muscle memory,” he says. “I was used to getting out there, finding a way. But it’s actually harder to find a way when you are trapped in notoriety. You can’t get out there and just work.”

Fitness is a big part of Majors’ life, and he is in the midst of starting an online wellness platform, with Good and four men he trains with daily at a gym in West Hollywood. There are also plans for a clothing line and supplements.

Majors has been reading scripts and taking meetings, including on a superhero film project. “No relation to the big guys, DC or Marvel, but a pretty wicked story,” he says. “I’m glad to be reading.” He is also attached to an independent revenge thriller called Merciless, to be directed by Martin Villeneuve, brother of Denis. “Sometimes it feels like it’s not going to happen,” he says of the resumption of his acting career. “And sometimes it feels like we start next week.”

Magazine Dreams’ distributor, Briarcliff Entertainment, is the same small company that picked up The Apprentice when other companies balked at the Donald Trump origin story, and helped score Oscar nominations for Sebastian Stan and Jeremy Strong. Briarcliff plans to open Magazine Dreams in 800 theaters, and will expand based on how it performs. “Anecdotally, we know that Black audiences — both men and women — are extremely enthused about the film,” says Briarcliff CEO Tom Ortenberg. “There is also pent-up demand from the art house audience, which has been waiting for it since Sundance. And the bodybuilding audience is enormously enthused about this film.” Ortenberg said the feedback he has gotten from entertainment industry colleagues since he picked up Magazine Dreams has been positive. “Based on what I’m seeing, people are rooting for Jonathan,” Ortenberg says.

A prominent casting director for major studio movies says Majors faces an uphill battle rebuilding his acting career. “If [Magazine Dreams] comes out and it’s a giant hit, then everybody reassesses,” she says. “Maybe not at the studios, maybe not at public companies, but independent people. You look at a guy like Jonathan Majors, is he talented? Absolutely. But is there somebody else who can fill the bill? Probably. There are a lot of really talented people out there, and there are fewer and fewer projects, so, with the exception of a very small echelon, people are replaceable.” This casting director believes that historically, Black actors have been held to different standards than white ones in Hollywood. “Like other marginalized people, you know you have to be in better behavior,” she says.

Asked what he thinks his life will look like five years from now, Majors says, “Me and Meagan, maybe a couple kids and my [11-year-old daughter], happy, at ease, not worried about anything.” Professionally, he says, he hopes he will be acting. “Do I hope to make more movies? Absolutely. That is my intention. But that’s not my call. I don’t have a studio. And I’ve given up control.” Asked what he would say to the entertainment industry today, Majors says, “I would tell them I’m still learning, and I would thank them for participating in my growth.”

Diddy was in court Friday for a pretrial hearing in his federal criminal case when his lawyers started sparring with the feds over the Cassie beating video.

A 2016 surveillance video obtained by CNN shows Sean ""Diddy"" Combs violently grab, shove, drag and kick his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura during an altercation in a hotel in California. https://t.co/qgD40mRPtQ pic.twitter.com/1u7qJgn3mC — CNN Breaking News (@cnnbrk) May 17, 2024 @cnnbrk

The judge asked the prosecution if they had the original security video and the Assistant United States Attorneys revealed the feds have the CNN version ... and a recording of the original footage.

Play video content TMZ.com

That's significant because, as we first reported, Diddy's lawyers claimed Thursday CNN altered the video and destroyed the only known version of the tape.

Diddy's lawyers doubled down in court, at least on their claims CNN altered the video, which was recorded in 2016 at the InterContinental Hotel.

The Bad Boy Records founder's lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, claimed a source gave CNN the footage and CNN ran the video through a free editing software. He says CNN altered the video by speeding it up, taking things out of sequence, and removing the time stamps. Diddy's legal team says the video is deceptive.

Diddy's defense signaled they will try to exclude the CNN video from Diddy's upcoming trial. Diddy is not being prosecuted for the beating -- that's a state matter and the statute of limitations has run out -- but prosecutors want to use it to show Diddy's alleged violent propensities.

Play video content TMZ.com

The judge shot back that a possible solution would be to slow down the video or put it in the right sequence ... urging Diddy's attorneys and federal prosecutors to come to a compromise.

Whatever CNN may or may not have done with the Cassie video may be irrelevant now ... 'cause the feds say they have the OG version.",tmz

Lizzo says her new weight loss is gonna have people asking if she got a Brazilian Butt Lift ... and, she's says TMZ had better investigate to put the rumors to bed.

The singer-songwriter posted a clip to Instagram yesterday ... stunning in a red lingerie top and a pair of matching see-through pants -- which did little to hide the underwear underneath.

Lizzo shakes her booty a bit ... and, says the whole look is ""giving BBL"" -- meaning she's looking like she went under the knife to get a backside like that.

She's laughing -- clearly making a joke ... before adding everyone online is going to accuse her of getting the surgery, and she actually shouts us out.

Lizzo says everyone's going to come running to TMZ to find out if she got a BBL ... and, while we don't know for sure, we'd venture a guess and say her behind is sculpted from months of working out and eating right.

Multiple sources tell TMZ Hip Hop that Offset and several other guys popped up at a popular dispensary, MedMen LAX, around 9:30 PM ... and a dispute arose over whether Offset presented ID, prohibiting him by law from buying or even touching any marijuana products.

Reps for Offset call the claims ridiculous ... he had just gotten off a flight at the nearby airport, and identification is an obvious requirement to hop on a commercial plane, and they say ID was in his possession at the shop.

Offset says he was in the process of presenting the ID when the security guard was aggressively rushing him ... hawking spit in his face, causing a fight to break out.

When more of MedMen's security got involved in the altercation, our sources say Offset punched the guard ... and the guard doused Offset and his entourage with mace!!!

Police were then called to the scene, and we're told Offset and his team fled the scene.

Paramedics were also dialed up, and the guard was transported to a local hospital after the attack. It's unclear what the extent of his injuries were.

LAPD sources tell TMZ ... officers were on foot patrol in the area, and requested backup support to handle a large crowd, where Jay Rock was present ... and he was stopped for trespassing. When they tried to detain him, he allegedly tried to take off, but he was stopped and his car was searched ... which is when officers allegedly found the gun -- which he's prohibited from possessing, since Jay is a former felon.

Rock was arrested just before 5:30 PM PT and booked on a charge of felon in possession of a gun, about three hours later. His car was impounded. It's not clear if he's still in police custody or if he's been released.

'cause one passenger claims her brother was fighting off evil demons -- and allegedly ended up whaling on some poor crew members.

Here's the deal ... a 31-year-old man named Delange Augustin boarded a flight in Savannah, Georgia bound for Miami, Florida earlier this week with his sister Medjina -- and, the plane took off without incident carrying the siblings, six other passengers, and five crew members.

According to FBI documents, just a minute after takeoff, one of the flight attendants says they noticed Augustin was stomping, yelling incoherently, and appeared ""to be in a fit of epilepsy.""

Flight attendants ran to his aid ... but, Delange allegedly kicked one of them in the chest, on purpose, sending her across a row of seats and into a window. Delange is said to have continued kicking and punching the seat and the passenger in front of him while the plane returned to the airport gate.

While deboarding, crew members say Augustin -- holding his sister tightly -- rushed at one of them and allegedly started throwing ""haymakers"" at her before other passengers wrestled him to the ground.

Augustin was taken to a hospital for evaluation -- and for swallowing a set of rosary beads ... though he was eventually discharged from the hospital, arrested for interference with flight crew members, and booked at Chatham County Jail.

Officials spoke with Medjina ... who claims she and Delange were traveling to Haiti to ""flee religious attacks of a spiritual nature.""

Medjina -- who says she can ""feel the spiritual fight, but cannot see"" -- says Delange told her to close her eyes and pray because ""Satan's disciple(s) had followed them onto the plane and the legion did not want the Augustins to make it to Haiti.""

As for the rosary beads ... Medjina says they are a source of strength in spiritual warfare -- and, he decided he needed that strength inside him.",tmz
