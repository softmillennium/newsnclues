Bitcoin topped $85,000 at one point during U.S. hours and is now trading at $84,400, up 4.7% over the past 24 hours. All cryptos in the CoinDesk 20 Index were higher during the same period, with Chainlink's LINK, Solana's SOL and SUI leading gains.

The price action happened as risk appetite returned to traditional markets as well. The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq indexes were 1.7% and 2.3 up, respectively. Meanwhile, gold, whose price action trounced that of bitcoin during the selling of the past few weeks, backed down below $3,000 after crossing the level yesterday for the first time in its history.

""To see the market bouncing off these recent lows is most likely a combination of the macro news around risk assets (inflation/tariffs) and a sign that a more stable base for cryptocurrencies is coming into place given the drawdowns from the top just months ago,” Paul Howard, senior director of crypto trading firm Wincent, said in a Telegram note.

Some $2.6 billion in leveraged crypto derivatives positions have been liquidated over the past 7 days, predominantly longs, Howard pointed out, leaving the market on a healthier footing with flushing excessive leverage.

Can BTC bulls reclaim the 200-day moving average?

Today's bounce also propelled BTC back above its 200-day moving average after dipping below that trendline for the first time since last August's crypto correction. The 200-day moving average is a widely-used benchmark for traders and investors to gauge long-term trends for asset prices, often serving as support for prices to bounce in a bull market, while losing the level providing a risk-off or bear market signal.

Closing the day above the moving average, currently at $83,767, would be a win for bulls, fueling hopes that the worst of the correction might be over for now. Otherwise, confirming the moving average as resistance could foreshadow a deeper pullback.

Well-followed cross-asset trader Bob Loukas noted that bitcoin and stocks have more room to run ""at least for a while,"" bouncing from oversold levels. ""Feels like should be close to end of panic, for now at least, and spend at least a few weeks back recovering,"" he said earlier this week. ""Then the market reassess.""

A further 10% drop would signal a bear market. But is it time to panic? Since Bitcoin’s creation in 2009, the S&P 500 has experienced multiple 20% corrections.



Following the 2008 global financial crisis the index had plunged nearly 60%. In 2019, amid bitcoin’s bear market, the S&P 500 declined by 20%, bitcoin fell as much as 85% from its all-time high. The covid-19 crash in March 2020 saw the index drop almost 40% with bitcoin shedding 60% of its value. Most recently in 2022, the index corrected by 25%, bitcoin bottomed out one month later after dropping by a further 25% to a cycle low of $15,000.



Historically, 10% corrections in the S&P 500 have been common. Meanwhile, bitcoin has dropped 30% from its all-time high during this correction. Looking at past bull market corrections, such declines are a normal occurrence, with the most recent 30% correction happening in August 2024 during the yen carry trade unwind.

The project's raise of $590 million would put it in the top-10 list of token raises, according to data curated by ICODrops. To date, the largest token sale is EOS, which raised $4.21 billion.

(ICODrops)

EOS is a blockchain platform developed by Block.one, which later founded Bullish, CoinDesk's owner.

On stage at Consensus 2025 in Hong Kong, WLFI co-founder Zak Folkman credited Tron's Justin Sun with the success of the project's token sale.

After WLFI first launched its sale, its critics called the momentum sluggish. But this changed after Sun invested $30 million into it in November 2024 and later invested more.

""When we were launching this project, it was a very heated time,"" Folkman said during Consensus. ""There was a lot of scrutiny on our project due to who was involved.""

This meant that traditional crypto VCs would not touch the token.

""[Sun] saw that regardless of the outcome, this project is a monumental move forward for the entire crypto community,"" Folkman added during the Consensus panel.

Rules around WLFI's token sale mean that the token was only available to accredited investors and can't be transferred or publicly sold on exchanges. A date has not been set for an exchange listing.",coindesk

Gold breaks $3,000 an ounce (TradingView)

Meanwhile, gold priced in British pounds has yet to reach its all-time high of £2,363, currently sitting around £300 below that level.

Charlie Morris, founder of ByTree and manager of the BOLD ETF, which includes both bitcoin and gold, has observed a divergence between gold and bitcoin ETFs and expects this trend to reverse soon.

“In the last 30 days, gold ETFs have seen $10 billion in inflows, while bitcoin ETFs have experienced $5 billion in outflows,” Morris noted. “Sooner or later, the flows will reverse again—just as they always do.”

So much for the “Trump Bump.” With the new administration on a tariff-tear this week, the markets were spooked about a recession and crypto was not immune.

Still, progress in digital assets was all around, and our reporters reported it all with alacrity. BlackRock’s bellwether BUIDL fund topped $1 billion and tokenized treasuries hit $4.2 billion, Kris Sandor reported. MoonPay, a payments aggregator, made an important stablecoin acquisition, Will Canny wrote. Ripple won a payments license in the UAE (Shaurya Malwa). OKX won a license to operate in Europe, Camomile Shumba reported. Coinbase announced plans to offer 24/7 futures trading in the U.S., Helene Braun reported.

There was also big regulatory news. The U.S. House voted to overturn the IRS’s controversial “broker rule” in a big win for DeFi operators. And a Senate committee voted to send the GENIUS stablecoin bill to the floor, ahead of probable approval there.

The Trump Family continued to be front-and-center in the crypto news. World Liberty Financial completed a $590 million token sale (for accredited investors for now), with an assist from adviser/investor and TRON founder Justin Sun. The Wall Street Journal reported that a Trump family representative also explored buying a stake in Binance.US, through World Liberty Financial.

From our Asia team, Sam Reynolds examined how the latest draft of the GENIUS act aims to split stablecoin regulation between state and federal authorities.

Parikshit Mishra reported on Coinbase returning to India after a two-year hiatus, setting off discussion about the future of crypto in India.

Shaurya Malwa continued his excellent reporting on XRP, pushing out multiple reports on Ripple. Malwa also reported on the implications of over-leveraging in the crypto market, as Hyperliquid lost $4 million due to a massive leveraged trade in ETH.

Market maven, Omkar Godbole, pushed out a timely piece on bitcoin's bullish signal ahead of the U.S. CPI report, and was also early to spot how Eric Trump's tweet on crypto were setting up short-term traders for disappointment.

Meanwhile, Tom Carreras had an excellent feature on how Bitdeer, a Singapore-based miner, hopes to shake up the mining machine market.

Hopefully next week brings better news in the markets. But, either way, our reporters will be there to cover what matters.

The country has been slowly moving deeper into the cryptocurrency space. Just this week, the Bank of Russia submitted proposals to create an experimental legal regime (ELR) lasting three years, allowing a “limited group of Russian investors” to trade cryptocurrencies.

Some Russian oil firms use bitcoin, ether, and stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) to convert payments made in Chinese yuan and Indian rupees into roubles, the Reuters report said. These transactions currently represent a fraction of Russia’s oil trade.

Other sanctioned countries, including Iran and Venezuela, have used crypto to maintain trade while avoiding reliance on the U.S. dollar, the dominant currency in global oil markets.

Russia has developed multiple payment systems to navigate sanctions, and crypto is one of several tools the country uses. Fiat currencies remain the primary method used in Russia’s oil transactions, and other workarounds include using currencies such as the United Arab Emirates dirham, Reuters said.

The report also added that even if sanctions were lifted, Russia would likely keep using crypto in its oil trades as it’s seen as a convenient, flexible tool. The country, meanwhile, is currently looking to get its largest banks to support a digital ruble for retail and commercial use.

The Bank of Russia said that a ruble-backed central bank digital currency could be used as a tool against sanctions back in 2021.

The protocol this week notched new all-time highs in total value locked (TVL) and total borrows – two pivotal metrics of activity for a DeFi lender.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the Crypto for Advisors Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .

Euler's hundreds of millions of crypto-dollars now under management might leave it well short of the Ethereum world's lending powerhouses, like the multibillion dollar Aave. But it's nonetheless notable for a protocol that nearly went kaput following a $200 million hack exactly two years ago.

""A lot of people wrote us off and said it would have been totally normal for us to end the project right there,"" said Michael Bentley, CEO of Euler Labs. But his team decided to stick with it and rebuild Euler – from scratch.

Their new vision was a highly customizable borrowing hub where people could tailor their pools' risk, yields, and asset parameters. This was a big difference from the original Euler, which Bentley described as ""a specific product: one lending market.""

""There just isn't a one-size-fits-all when it comes to lending and borrowing,"" Bentley said.

Comeback was hardly assured: while victims of the hack had gotten their money back, Bentley and his team questioned whether the market had an appetite for a protocol with a tarnished reputation.

It didn't help that Euler basically missed much of 2024's DeFi surge while sitting in pre-launch security reviews. Euler finally debuted its V2 in September 2024, nearly a year and a half after going dark.

The protocol helped juice its return with a relatively modest incentives budget: a ""few million"" dollars-worth of EUL tokens to woo people back, at a time when he claims competitors were offering tens of millions of dollars more., Bentley said, attributing most of the growth to ""product market fit.""

Even now, as ether – a critical collateral asset for lending platforms across Ethereum DeFi – continues spiraling in price, Euler continues to grow. It's one of only two lending protocols in the top 10 to see growth in active loans over the last month.

If this ends up being a bear market I'm still confident, given the success of Euler v2 so far, that Euler will still be growing relative to some of the other opportunities out there,"" Bentley said.",coindesk

STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the State of Crypto Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .

3AC, once a dominant crypto hedge fund with over $3 billion in reported net assets, collapsed in 2022 while it still had deep financial ties to FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried's soon-to-collapse crypto exchange. The hedge fund initially filed a proof of claim worth $120 million against FTX in July 2023 — adding its name to a long list of users and investors in FTX who lost money as a result of its sudden insolvency.

In November 2024, 3AC’s liquidators amended their claim after discovering new evidence suggesting that FTX had liquidated $1.53 billion in 3AC’s assets just two weeks before the hedge fund commenced its own liquidation proceedings two years prior. They argued that FTX's liquidation of 3AC's funds was carried out to satisfy a $1.3 billion liability to FTX, an obligation that 3AC claimed was not sufficiently substantiated.

FTX’s bankruptcy said the $1.3 billion liability represented collateral for a loan FTX made to 3AC, but the court ruled in favor of 3AC, finding insufficient evidence to support FTX’s loan claim.

The ruling allows 3AC to pursue a significantly larger portion of FTX’s remaining assets, potentially reshaping creditor payouts.

FTX, which began distributing funds to creditors in February 2025, said the expanded claim should have come sooner, arguing that it would burden other creditors and complicate its reorganization plan. The court, however, determined that 3AC’s delay was justified, given that the liquidators only uncovered the full extent of their claim in mid-2024 due to missing financial records from FTX and a lack of cooperation from 3AC’s founders, Zhu Su and Kyle Davies.

3AC, founded in 2012, had grown into one of the most influential financial firms in the cryptocurrency industry by 2022. Its collapse was among the first and largest dominoes to fall before the broader crypto market imploded in 2022, which ultimately set off the chain of events that revealed fraud in Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire.

Bankman-Fried is currently pursuing an appeal of his criminal conviction and 25-year prison sentence. Following the collapse of 3AC, Su was detained in Singapore and sentenced to four months in prison for failing to cooperate with 3AC's liquidators. Davies did not face any charges connected to the hedge fund's collapse.

The 3AC founders reunited in 2023 to launch a short-lived crypto exchange called OPNX — designed to allow users to trade bankruptcy claims of failed crypto companies — which shut down in February.

With the court’s decision, 3AC’s liquidators now have a significantly larger position in the FTX. bankruptcy proceedings, raising questions about how the expanded claim will impact distributions to other creditors. The ruling also underscores the lack of transparency at both FTX and 3AC — further complicating efforts to untangle both firms' assets and obligations.",coindesk

Между тем, золото, чье ценовое действие превзошло ценовое действие Bitcoin во время продаж последних нескольких недель, опустилось ниже $3000 после того, как вчера впервые в своей истории пересекло этот уровень.

«То, что рынок отскакивает от недавних минимумов, скорее всего, является результатом сочетания макроэкономических новостей, касающихся рисковых активов (инфляция/тарифы), и признаком того, что для криптовалют формируется более стабильная база, учитывая падение с максимума всего несколько месяцев назад», — написал в Telegram Пол Ховард, старший директор Криптo торговой компании Wincent.

По словам Ховарда, за последние 7 дней было ликвидировано около 2,6 млрд долларов США по кредитным Криптo , в основном длинные позиции, что позволило рынку оздоровиться за счет избавления от чрезмерного кредитного плеча.

Сегодняшний отскок также поднял BTC выше своего 200-дневная скользящая средняя после падения ниже этой линии тренда впервые с момента коррекции Криптo в августе прошлого года. 200-дневная скользящая средняя является широко используемый бенчмаркдля трейдеров и инвесторов, позволяющих оценить долгосрочные тенденции цен на активы, что часто служит поддержкой для отскока цен на бычьем рынке, в то время как снижение уровня является сигналом к отказу от риска или к медвежьему рынку.

Закрытие дня выше скользящей средней, которая сейчас составляет $83 767, стало бы WIN для быков, подпитывая надежды на то, что худшее из коррекции может быть уже позади. В противном случае подтверждение скользящей средней как сопротивления может предвещать более глубокий откат.

Золото превысило 3000 долларов за унцию (TradingView)

Между тем, цена на золото в британских фунтах стерлингов пока не достигла своего исторического максимума в 2363 фунта стерлингов, в настоящее время она примерно на 300 фунтов стерлингов ниже этого уровня.

Чарли Моррис, основатель ByTree и управляющий BOLD ETF, который включает как Bitcoin , так и золото, заметил расхождение между золотыми и Bitcoin ETF и ожидает, что эта тенденция вскоре изменится.

«За последние 30 дней золотые ETF получили приток в размере $10 млрд, тогда как Bitcoin ETF испытали отток в размере $5 млрд», — отметил Моррис. «Рано или поздно потоки снова развернутся — как это всегда и бывает».

Некоторые российские нефтяные компании используют Bitcoin, эфир и стейблкоины, такие как Tether (USDT), для конвертации платежей, сделанных в китайских юанях и индийских рупиях, в рубли, говорится в отчете Reuters. В настоящее время эти транзакции представляют собой часть российской торговли нефтью.

Россия разработала несколько платежных систем для обхода санкций, и Криптo является ONE из нескольких инструментов, которые использует страна. Фиатные валюты остаются основным методом, используемым в нефтяных транзакциях России, а другие обходные пути включают использование таких валют, как дирхам Объединенных Арабских Эмиратов, сообщает Reuters.

Сотни миллионов крипто-долларов Эйлера, которые сейчас находятся под управлением, могут оставить его далеко позади мировых кредитных гигантов Ethereum , таких как многомиллиардный Aave. Но он, тем не менее, примечателен протоколом, который едва не рухнул после Взлом на 200 миллионов долларовровно два года назад.

«Многие списали нас со счетов и сказали, что было бы совершенно нормально, если бы мы завершили проект прямо сейчас», — сказал Майкл Бентли, генеральный директор Euler Labs. Но его команда решила не отступать и перестроить Euler — с нуля.

Их новое видение был высоконастраиваемым центром заимствований, где люди могли настраивать риск, доходность и параметры активов своих пулов. Это было большим отличием от оригинального Euler, который Бентли описал как «конкретный продукт: ONE рынок кредитования».

«Когда речь идет о кредитовании и заимствовании, универсального подхода просто T существует», — сказал Бентли.

Возвращение было едва ли гарантировано: хотя жертвы взлома имеливернули свои деньгиБентли и его команда задались вопросом, нужен ли рынку протокол с подмоченной репутацией.

T помогло и то, что Euler фактически пропустил большую часть всплеска DeFi 2024 года, сидя на предварительных проверках безопасности. Euler наконец дебютировал со своей V2 в сентябре 2024 года, почти через полтора года после того, как ушел в тень.

Протокол помог увеличить прибыль за счет относительно скромного бюджета стимулов: токенов EUL на сумму «несколько миллионов» долларов, чтобы WOO людей, в то время как, по его словам, конкуренты предлагали на десятки миллионов долларов больше, сказал Бентли, приписав большую часть роста «соответствию продукта рынку».

Даже сейчас, когда эфир — критически важный залоговый актив для кредитных платформ в Ethereum DeFi — продолжает расти в цене, Euler продолжает расти. Это ONE из двух кредитных протоколов в топ-10, которые показали рост активных кредитов за последний месяц.

«Если рынок в конечном итоге станет медвежьим, я все равно уверен, учитывая успех Euler v2 на данный момент, что Euler все равно будет расти относительно некоторых других возможностей», — сказал Бентли.",coindesk

3AC, некогда доминирующий Криптo хедж-фонд с более чем $3 млрд в чистых активах, рухнул в 2022 году, все еще имея глубокие финансовые связи с FTX, Криптo биржей Сэма Бэнкмана-Фрида, которая вскоре должна была рухнуть. Первоначально хедж-фонд подал доказательство иска на сумму $120 млн против FTX в июле 2023 года, добавив свое имя в длинный список пользователей и инвесторов FTX, которые потеряли деньги в результате его внезапной неплатежеспособности.

В ноябре 2024 года ликвидаторы 3AC внесли поправки в свое требование после обнаружения новых доказательств, свидетельствующих о том, что FTX ликвидировала активы 3AC на сумму $1,53 млрд всего за две недели до того, как хедж-фонд начал собственную процедуру ликвидации два года назад. Они утверждали, что ликвидация FTX средств 3AC была проведена для удовлетворения обязательства перед FTX в размере $1,3 млрд, обязательства, которое, по утверждению 3AC, не было достаточно обосновано.

В деле о банкротстве FTX говорилось, что обязательство в размере 1,3 млрд долларов представляло собой обеспечение по кредиту, который FTX предоставила 3AC, однако суд вынес решение в пользу 3AC, не найдя достаточных доказательств в поддержку требования FTX о предоставлении кредита.

Постановление позволяет 3AC претендовать на значительно большую часть оставшихся активов FTX, что потенциально может изменить порядок выплат кредиторам.

FTX, которая начала распределять средства среди кредиторов в феврале 2025 года, заявила, что расширенный иск должен был поступить раньше, утверждая, что это обременит других кредиторов и усложнит ее план реорганизации. Однако суд постановил, что задержка 3AC была оправдана, учитывая, что ликвидаторы раскрыли полную сумму своего иска только в середине 2024 года из-за отсутствия финансовых отчетов у FTX и отсутствия сотрудничества со стороны основателей 3AC Чжу Су и Кайла Дэвиса.

Компания 3AC, основанная в 2012 году, к 2022 году превратилась в ONE из самых влиятельных финансовых компаний в Криптовалюта индустрии. Ее крах стал одним из первых и крупнейших крахов по принципу домино, предшествовавших краху всего Криптo рынка в 2022 году, что в конечном итоге положило начало цепочке Мероприятия , раскрывших мошенничество в Криптo Сэма Бэнкмана-Фрида.

В настоящее время Банкман-Фрид подает апелляцию на свое уголовное осуждение и 25-летний тюремный срок. После краха 3AC Су был задержан в Сингапуре и приговорен к четырем месяцам тюрьмы за отказ сотрудничать с ликвидаторами 3AC. Дэвису не были предъявлены никакие обвинения, связанные с крахом хедж-фонда.

С решением суда ликвидаторы 3AC теперь имеют значительно большую позицию в процедуре банкротства FTX., что вызывает вопросы о том, как расширенный иск повлияет на распределения другим кредиторам. Решение также подчеркивает отсутствие прозрачности как в FTX, так и в 3AC, что еще больше усложняет усилия по распутыванию активов и обязательств обеих фирм.",coindesk

The issue comes after over a month of reports from existing owners that their trucks have had issues with loose bodywork, including at least one owner who has footage of a panel flying off of his truck at speed.

Most owners waiting on the delay have not reported any specific reason for the wait, but one user on a Cybertruck owner forum has shared a screenshot from a conversation with a service advisor that suggests ""the cantrail concern"" is the problem being inspected. This is the trim piece that follows along the side of the Cybertruck's roofline, starting at the edge of the truck's A-pillar and continuing to the edge of the bed. It is also the piece of bodywork most frequently mentioned in reports of loose bodywork, including in what are now four different official NHTSA complaints.

Reid Tomasko, the owner who shared footage of his truck shedding this particular piece of bodywork at speed, told Road & Track in February that he had seen the issue on ""five to seven"" different trucks encountered at his wrapping business. This includes his own truck and another truck in his shop when he filmed a YouTube video that dug into the problem. Tomasko has since claimed in another video that Tesla told him the problem was ""glue delamination.""

The First Full F1 Movie Trailer Drops

After giving us teaser trailers and breadcrumbs, Warner Bros. has finally released the first full trailer for the F1 movie starring Brad Pitt. We had a little bit of an idea about the film’s storyline, but the new trailer sheds more light on that and shows the realistic cinematography used to immerse viewers in the racing sequences.

A NASCAR drama filmed using practical effects is also rumored to be in the works.

That’s the part we’re most excited about – the racing scenes. Since they were all filmed using practical effects, not the cheesy CGI we see in movies way too often these days, we’re pumped to see all the action unfold.

The same approach was used in Top Gun: Maverick to great effect. It’s no coincidence F1 has the same director, Joseph Kosinski.

Like Top Gun: Maverick, F1 tells the story of a washed-up old man who’s been pushed out of the limelight, only to be given one more chance to prove himself. Sonny Hayes, played by Brad Pitt, is an older racecar driver who apparently was supposed to be big in Formula One back in the day but flamed out.

Still racing in other series, he’s approached with an opportunity to be the second driver on a fictional APX Mercedes team and mentor a young hotheaded driver, Joshua Pearce, played by Damson Idris.

Of course, the two clash, face adversity, and get zero respect from their competitors. All of this is hinted at in the trailer, which doesn’t completely spoil the plot, instead giving us a good taste of things to come.

We love a good underdog story and this looks like it could be just that.

Adding to the intrigue are comments made by Lewis Hamilton following the trailer’s release. The F1 champion has praised Brad Pitt’s driving in the film.

""Watching Brad drive around at speeds over 180 miles an hour was really impressive to see because it's not something you can just learn overnight,"" said Hamilton, according to ESPN.

Pitt was driving the car at F1 GPs between practice and qualifying sessions right in front of hundreds of thousands of fans. However, he had a helmet on, so they had no idea who was behind the wheel.

Some scenes shot at GPs involved Pitt removing his helmet, and that’s when people started talking about an upcoming movie. We expect that buzz will increase as the June 27 release date here in the US (June 25 internationally) approaches.

Breidinger’s contract with Toyota is not through the manufacturer’s driver development program, but rather its marketing department

Breidinger began racing go-karts at age 9 and instantly discovered her passion for the sport.

Like many of today’s young race car drivers, Toni Breidinger has been competing since childhood, but unlike her fellow competitors in NASCAR’s Craftsman Truck Series the Toyota driver works as a model and a social media influencer when she isn’t competing at the track.

Breidinger is a fixture in Toyota commercials and when this year’s Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue is released, she’ll be featured alongside athletes from a variety of sports. They include three-time team USA Olympic gold medalist sprinter Gabby Thomas, USA Olympic gymnast Jordan Chiles, paralympic swimmer Ali Truwit, track-and-field heptathlon medalist Anna Hall, and the WNBA’s Cameron Brink. The SI issue comes on the heels of Breidinger’s participation in the Victoria’s Secret 2023 Tour.

On social media, the 25-year-old Breidinger has more than 2.5 million followers on Instagram, which she cites as one of her favorite platforms. She also has a large following on TikTok. When the two are combined, her following across both platforms is more than 5 million. Her Facebook followers sit at 180,000, which is more than several NASCAR Cup drivers, and she has more than 44,000 on X (formerly Twitter). She cites authenticity as the key to her large following.

“I think people want to know the real you,” Breidinger says. “People watch me race on TV, (but) they get to know the real me (through social media). Hopefully, I can bring a new demographic to watch the Truck Series and to watch NASCAR. I do feel like my fan base is very international.”

Breidinger’s contract with Toyota is not through the manufacturer’s driver development program, but rather its marketing department where she’s viewed as an “influencer from a driver standpoint.” In fact, Paul Doleshal, group manager, motorsports, Toyota Motor North America, admits it was her large social media following that impacted Toyota’s decision.

“Toni reaches outside that (motorsports) sphere and can bring that … what’s going on over there, let me go check it out kind of aspect …” Doleshal says.

Icon Sportswire - Getty Images

Breidinger had a contract with Venturini Motorsports’ ARCA team before she had one with Toyota. Since she wasn’t involved with another manufacturer in a different series on her off-ARCA weekends, Doleshal said it made it easier for Toyota to decide to lock her into a contract from the marketing side. She still receives all of the benefits the Toyota Performance Center in Cornelius, North Carolina, provides competitors in Toyota’s Driver Development Program. That includes physical and media training, medical services, nutrition plans and sim time.

“We’ve been really searching for the next really elite female driver for a long time,” Doleshal says. “We’ve tested a lot of female drivers. Our program is more about track performance and how do we compete. For us, it’s finding elite level talent, and who do we think has a chance to really evolve and matriculate up into the higher series.”

Breidinger began racing go-karts at age 9 and instantly discovered her passion for the sport. She liked the “sense of independence” it provided her as a child, and she enjoyed racing with her twin sister, Annie. However, the two eventually chose different career paths. Breidinger elected to drive a race car, while Annie became an engineer.

Breidinger was on the eve of her teenage years when stock car racing caught her attention. She saw a Late Model race at Madera (Calif.) Speedway where she raced Midgets and was hooked on the full-bodied cars. The California native eventually made her way into the ARCA Menards Series where she spent five years. In 65 races, she recorded four top-five and 27 top-10 finishes, the most top 10s by a female ARCA competitor. She finished in the top 10 in the point standings three consecutive years with her fourth-place finish last season being her best.

This year, Breidinger moved to a full-time Truck Series ride with TRICON Garage. In the season’s first two races it’s been tough with 28th and 24th place finishes.

“Obviously I want to get results, but I’ve been trying to not judge success solely off of results,” Breidinger says. “It’s very easy to do, especially in sports, but for me, I think as long as I’m improving every race, me and my team are getting along, they’re happy with what I’m doing, Toyota and my partners are happy, I feel like that’s part of success.”

Breidinger would like to be in NASCAR’s Cup Series in five years, but she wants to be successful at each level before advancing.

There was a time, not too long ago, when a car — especially an American car — was likely clapped out after 75,000 miles. A car or truck with over 100,000 miles or more on the clock? Forget about it, send it to the scrapper. Nowadays it seems that a car is just getting broken in at 100,000 miles, and it's not unheard of for a new car to put down 250,000 or 300,000 miles without a major mechanical catastrophe. I've personally owned four cars that easily hit the quarter-million mile mark — a Cadillac, two Mazdas, and a Saturn — and while I know that the plural of anecdote isn't data, that's still a pretty good ratio.

Now, the thing about cars when they get old enough is that their diet changes, so to speak. Much like when you get past a certain age you need more vegetables and vitamins than pizzas and beer, older cars need different kinds of fluids than they needed when they were fresh off the lot. So, what do you feed a car Of A Certain Age? Probably the most important thing you can give your elderly car, aside from regular maintenance, is high-mileage engine oil.

What exactly is high-mileage oil and when should you use it? Do you even need to use it? I'm glad you asked.

Keeping Your Car Regular

High-mileage oil contains a mixture of seal conditioners, additives, and detergents — the actual mixture depends on the manufacturer and product line. The seal conditioners help reduce small leaks inside and outside of the engine by causing old gaskets and o-rings to swell up and seal better. The additives grant protection to things like cylinder walls and cam lobes that do a lot of heavy lifting at high speeds and temperatures. Finally, the detergents work to clear sludge and gunk out of all the engine's nooks and crannies (or, well, they claim to at any rate).

When should you use it? Well, that kinda depends on how and where you drive. Highway driving is a lot easier on an engine's internals than the punishing grind of stop-and-go city driving. An engine with, say, 150,000 highway miles on it may still be in top condition while the same engine only driven in the city might be tired out by 80,000 miles. Depending on the manufacturer, high-mileage oils are recommended when a vehicle has between 75,000 and 100,000 miles on the clock. Your best bet is to ask a trusted mechanic their advice on the subject, especially if they're familiar with your car.

What high-mileage oil is not is a panacea. It will not cure mechanical damage like heavily worn rings, burnt valves, blowby, rod knock, power loss, etc. Nor will it plug up heavy leaks, stop a car from smoking, or fix non-oil-related issues. It is cheap insurance in the form of preventative maintenance, however. Should you use high-mileage oil? Sure, especially if you have a well-maintained, high-mileage engine. Spending a few extra bucks per oil change on high-mileage oil is way cheaper (and, honestly, smarter) than shelling out for a new engine, or god forbid, a whole new car.

https://finance.yahoo.com,"EPA Rollback of Biden Rules Will Alter EV Industry, Emissions Regs",https://autos.yahoo.com/epa-rollback-biden-rules-alter-191400543.html,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 19:14:00 GMT","EPA reveals it will reexamine dozens of past climate-related rules implemented by the agency under prior administrations.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the agency would reconsider rules that had ""hamstrung"" the US auto industry, signaling that a number of key climate provisions, including 2032 CO2 goals, would be reevaluated.

The wave of announcements impacting key climate-related rules prompted a backlash from environmental advocacy groups.

Signaling a wide-scale rollback of emissions regulations, the EPA revealed this week that it would reconsider a number of key targets put into place by the Biden administration to curb greenhouse emissions, citing impediments to the US auto industry.

In a series of moves announced by EPA chief Lee Zeldin, the agency said it would reevaluate a number of key rules implemented during the Biden administration, including the Model Year 2027 and Later Light-Duty and Medium-Duty Vehicles provisions, as well as the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Heavy-Duty Vehicles rules.

The agency also said it would reconsider 2022 Heavy-Duty Nitrous Oxide (NOx) rules, citing high costs of compliance for various industries, part of the Clean Trucks Plan.

""The American auto industry has been hamstrung by the crushing regulatory regime of the last administration,"" said EPA Administrator Zeldin. ""As we reconsider nearly one trillion dollars of regulatory costs, we will abide by the rule of law to protect consumer choice and the environment.""



On the same day, the EPA signaled it would ""modernize"" a set of rules governing wastewater discharges by oil and gas extraction facilities, aiming to lower production costs for gas and oil extraction.

The agency said it would reconsider the current Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which requires over 8,000 facilities to report their annual emissions to the government.

In signaling the reevaluation of this rule, the agency said it currently costs hundreds of millions of dollars for companies to comply with this regulation.

""The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is another example of a bureaucratic government program that does not improve air quality,"" Zeldin added.

In all, the agency said it is studying dozens of past environmental regulations.

Collectively, the agency called these planned actions ""the greatest and most consequential day of deregulation in the history of the United States.""

For EV makers, perhaps the most consequential provision the EPA is expected to reverse is one enacted by the agency under the Biden administration last March that adopted clean air targets that would be achieved if at least 35% of all new cars and light truck sales were battery-electric by model year 2032.

Advertisement Advertisement

This rule has been frequently (and perhaps reductively) cited by its opponents as having mandated that some ""two-thirds"" of all new car and truck sales to be EVs by 2032, though on paper it was far less rigid than that. (A prior rule draft from 2023 had at one point envisioned a 67% BEV mix by 2032 but was ultimately not adopted by the agency).

The adopted 2024 rules did not specifically mandate these percentages, rather reflecting one of the EPA's estimated routes toward what car sales could look like by 2032 to achieve the industry-wide average goal of 85 grams of CO2 per mile emissions targets by that year.

Another pathway, for example, could have seen a heavier mix of PHEVs accounting for 36% of sales, coupled with BEVs adding up to 35% of sales along with a greater proportion of hybrids, while still reaching the same CO2 goals by 2032.

Yet another possible route to the same 2032 goals could have seen PHEV sales of 29% and BEV sales of 43% and still arrive at the same planned CO2 reduction target, with ICE sales still accounting for 21% of the market at that point.

Advertisement Advertisement

Just how realistic any of these scenarios would have been is perhaps moot now, but even the most modest BEV percentage mix would have required year-on-year leaps in EV sales rates by 2032 unlike any that had been seen to date. BEV sales nationwide accounted for 8.1% of the market in 2024, after more than a decade of mass-market EV availability.

News of the reevaluation of these key provisions was expected, as the new administration set the EPA on a path of mass deregulation. And it swiftly drew criticism from top environmental groups.

""With these actions, the Trump EPA is trying to take us back to the days when rivers caught fire, toxic chemicals forced families to abandon their homes, and acid rain ravaged our forests,"" said Alexandra Adams, chief policy advocacy officer at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

FREDERIC J. BROWN - Getty Images

""This won't make America healthier or greater. It takes us backwards to a dirtier and sicker time of at least a generation ago,"" Adams said.

Almost overlooked in this week's whirlwind of deregulation was the worsening industry climate, including one EV maker particularly close to the new administration.

Over the past year a number of automakers with EVs in their lineups have quietly revised their own BEV targets, prioritizing ICE and hybrid powertrains in the coming years while citing a gradually deteriorating momentum for battery-electric models.

Relatively few public comments have been made by auto industry execs in response to the planned rollback of the EPA's emissions targets, with most automakers now busy dealing with the rapidly changing tariff landscape.

Hearst Owned

One simple explanation for automakers is that they had already assumed a long time ago that the 2032 targets would be reversed early in the second Trump administration and had effectively priced in these developments.

Advertisement Advertisement

Another simple explanation is that, given the momentum of EV adoption of the past few years, it had become clear that the planned CO2 targets were too optimistic to begin with. This wave of deregulation gives them an easy out from their own overly ambitious EV plans announced years ago.

Would the 2032 targets have been achieved if they remained in place, or were these scenarios too unrealistic? Let us know what you think in the comments below.",yahoo

However, some used cars aren’t great investments. Purchasing some of these cars means you might be stuck with transmission issues, questionable build quality or experience a higher likelihood of deprecation.

For You: These 10 Used Cars Will Last Longer Than an Average New Vehicle

GOBankingRates spoke to several automotive professionals about used cars that are more of a financial hassle than a deal. Stay away from purchasing these five used cars.

Fiat 500

Used Fiats have become such a regretted purchase among car buyers that the vehicle has its unflattering acronym: Fix It Again Tony. Over the years Fiat has been in the United States, Carl Anthony, managing editor at Automoblog, said reliability and quality ratings from industry sources like Consumer Reports and J.D. Power have been lower than expected.

If you’re shopping for a used Fiat, Leland Jones, founder and CEO of Ceramic King Coatings, said to steer clear of any 2012 through 2016 Fiat 500 cars. Among other issues to anticipate, Jones said buyers may experience clutch failure and high repair costs.

Ford Escape

Buyers who see a used Ford Escape for sale might want to keep looking.

Joe Giranda, director of sales and marketing for CFR Classic, said used Ford Escape cars are plagued with transmission issues like shuddering and jerking. Another major issue with these used cars is the suspension which needs frequent maintenance.

Volkswagen Eos

Even after being discontinued by Volkswagen in 2015, the Volkswagen Eos is among one of the worst used convertibles to purchase.

“It is prone to mechanical problems, particularly with its power windows and convertible top mechanisms, resulting in high repair costs,” Giranda said. “Owners have also reported frequent suspension issues.”

Chrysler 200

According to Cars.com, certain model year 2015 Chrysler 200 vehicles have been recalled by Chrysler. Some of the reasons why this particular model was recalled include electrical system wiring issues and power failures in the electrical system. Jones adds these used vehicles have engine issues and speed control problems.

BMW

You may feel like you can impress everyone with a used or secondhand BMW, but Jones does not recommend purchasing this used car no matter what year it is.

“The cost on those vehicles tends to be insane,” Jones said. “There’s a high cost of maintenance and repair expenses are through the roof. Not to mention if you wanted an extended service contract. In my experience, they just bring issue after issue.”

https://finance.yahoo.com,New Tesla Model Y's Special Headlights Won't Blind Oncoming Drivers,https://autos.yahoo.com/tesla-model-ys-special-headlights-190000650.html,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 19:00:00 GMT","The updated Tesla Model Y joins Rivian's R1S SUV and R1T pickup truck in enabling matrix LED headlight technology in the United States.

The tech allows for pixel-by-pixel control to shape the headlight beam, avoiding blinding oncoming drivers.

Such headlights are already widely available elsewhere, but U.S. regulations present a stumbling block.

Anyone who has driven a car equipped with the old sealed-beam headlights from the 1980s will know that modern LED lighting technology is one of the greatest improvements of the modern automotive age. Sure, the flexibility of LEDs allows car designers to use lighting as a styling element, but the main advantage is that you can better see things when you're driving around in the dark. Who could have guessed that'd be a good idea? One drawback, though, is that poorly aimed LED headlights can temporarily blind oncoming drivers. Now, the solution for this is finally starting to trickle into the U.S. market.

The tech has various names depending on what brand is offering it, but we can start by calling it matrix LED headlights since Audi was among the first to bring it to market (just not in the U.S.—more on that in a bit). Think of an LED headlight working as a constellation of light pixels rather than a single source, so individually controlling those pixels allows you to shape the light beam projected by the headlight.

Audi

In Canada, where Audi's matrix LED headlights are legal, this allows for headlights that will dip to the left so as not to shine through the windshield of fellow drivers when oncoming traffic is detected. At the same time, the headlights can light up more to the right or follow through a corner, allowing the driver to see more of the nighttime world without blinding anyone.

Advertisement Advertisement

Audi launched this technology back in 2014, when U.S. transportation rules only allowed for high-beam, low-beam, and nothing in between. Since then, a 2022 rule change allowed for ""Adaptive Driving Beam"" (ADB) headlights theoretically but adopted a testing method that differed from the SAE-approved regulations used in Europe and Canada. Audi would have had to come up with a completely new solution just for the U.S. market, so it simply delivered vehicles with the tech software disabled. It's much the same case with some recent BMW models.

Rivian

However, the second generation of Rivian's R1S and RIT trucks did come with ADB headlights that meet U.S. regulations. They were enabled back in August 2024, making them the first in America. The refreshed 2025 Tesla Model Y is also now available with this technology, though it should be noted that Canadian and European Model Ys already had a version of it. A Tesla spokesperson told Car and Driver that the ADB headlights are not yet enabled on older versions of the Model Y and Model 3.

Now that matrix LED headlights are available from some manufacturers, it may push others to come up with a solution that will meet U.S. regulations. The sealed-beam era of headlights is best dimly remembered. Brighter headlamps that aren't a hazard to others are the kind of technology that should light the way forward.

Ram discontinued its absolutely bonkers range-topping Ram 1500 model, the TRX, by sending it off with a ""Final Edition"" model, as done with almost all Hellcat-powered Stellantis products. Like with many other ""last Hemi-powered"" Stellantis products, it turns out there might be a few more in the pipeline.

Stellantis

Ram 1500 dropped the V8, but maybe not forever

The Ram 1500 entered a new generation in 2025 but did so without including any option for a V8 engine. Previously, a duo of V8s could power the truck; a 5.7-liter at the entry level or a supercharged 6.2-liter unit plucked from the Hellcat in the top trim TRX. Shoppers were instead stuck with a choice of turbocharged inline-sixes. Dubbed the Hurricane engine, the twin-turbo 3.0-liter makes either 420 or 540 horsepower, depending on trim. That's nice, but it isn't the 702 horsepower TRX buyers enjoy in the top dog, currently defunct truck. The soundtrack isn't quite the same, either. But there's good news on the horizon.

New leaks suggest that the V8 is coming back to the market. An alleged email released on Sportsnaut suggests that not only is the TRX coming back, but it's getting more power, too. Over at Mopar Insiders, their ""reliable sources"" have confirmed that the Ram TRX ""will indeed make a comeback in 2026…it will have HEMI V8 power under the hood."" Mopar Insiders has a few takes on why the next Ram 1500 TRX will make more power. The first—and most optimistic—take is that Ram will rely on the remaining stock of Redeye engines. Those 797-horsepower units have already made their way under the hood of the Durango and its numerous special editions. Alternatively, it could be a retuned Hellcat engine that pushes power up to 717 horsepower. That would still be 15 over the outgoing model. Either works for us.

Hellcat Redeye engineDodge

A CEO change could mean all the difference for the Hemi V8

""Everybody wanted to keep [the Hemi V8],"" said a source in a CNBC interview back in December. In the interview, ousted CEO Carlos Tavares is blamed for nearly every wrong turn Stellantis took in the last 12 months. Including, of course, the decision to pursue greener pastures instead of leaning into the Ram bread and butter—V8-powered trucks. With Tavares out of the picture, Stellantis is apparently free to bring back the V8. The company will look good doing it, too, as they can blame everything on the wayward CEO. The counterpoint is that a new CEO hasn't yet been appointed; in the interim, a committee led by Chairman John Elkann is at the helm. So all of this could change quickly as the organization names a new CEO, which should happen in the next three months.

Final thoughts

Stellantis will likely not make the same mistake twice. A new CEO that's V8-friendly might be just what the brand needs to get some traction. More importantly, a V8 supertruck could be the first brick towards building a lineup of Stellantis vehicles that anyone actually cares about.",yahoo

The Missing McLaren F1: El Chapo’s Lost Supercar and the Mystery That Won’t Die

For decades, Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán built one of the most powerful and feared drug empires in the world. The leader of the Sinaloa Cartel lived a life of unimaginable wealth, hoarding gold-plated firearms, private zoos, and some of the rarest cars on the planet. Among them was one of the most controversial McLaren F1s ever built—chassis #39—a car that disappeared after his lieutenant was gunned down, leaving behind a mystery that has puzzled car collectors and cartel historians alike.

A Car Too Ugly for McLaren’s CEO

The McLaren F1 chassis #39 was completed in late 1995 and is widely considered one of the oddest-looking F1s ever made. Painted in Brazilian Metallic Brown with a red leather interior and gold wheels, it was originally purchased by McLaren CEO Ron Dennis. However, his wife reportedly hated the color scheme so much that she refused to let him keep it. Dennis quickly offloaded the car and ordered another one.

Advertisement Advertisement

By 1997, the McLaren had made its way to Mexico, falling into the hands of Umberto Ojeda, also known as Ricardo Beltran or ""El Robachivas,"" El Chapo’s top lieutenant. For a man who operated in extreme wealth and violence, the rare McLaren F1 fit perfectly into his lifestyle.

Murder, Secrecy, and a Lost Supercar

Ojeda’s time behind the wheel of chassis #39 didn’t last long. In 2000, he was ambushed and gunned down inside his armored car. His family, fearing both the cartel and the authorities, hid the McLaren F1, but there was one major problem—Ojeda never told anyone where the keys were.

For years, rumors spread about the lost McLaren. Some claimed it was hidden under a tarp in rural Culiacán, untouched for years. Others believe it was quietly driven and possibly even made road-legal in Mexico. Unlike many of El Chapo’s other assets, the F1 was never officially seized by the Mexican government.

The Hunt for the El Chapo McLaren

The search for chassis #39 took a new turn when YouTuber and car collector Ed Bolian, best known for his VINWiki channel, set out to track down the missing supercar. His investigations led him to various leads, including individuals who claimed to have seen the car in recent years.

Advertisement Advertisement

Then, a breakthrough—or so it seemed. Bolian was contacted by a man claiming to be Ojeda’s father, who said his granddaughter had access to the F1. The car, he said, was for sale—for $5 million. Bolian, knowing the risks, negotiated the price down to $2.5 million and scrambled to figure out how he could afford it.

But the deeper he dug, the shadier the deal became. The seller refused to provide clear, verifiable photos, sending only blurry or irrelevant images. When pressed for proof, the seller threatened to cut off all communication unless Bolian wired a deposit immediately. In a final attempt to legitimize the deal, the man invited Bolian to come to Sinaloa to see the car in person—on the condition that he bring the full cash payment.

A Scam, a Dead End, and Unfinished Business

Realizing he was dealing with a scam, Bolian played along, mocking the scammer for using Google images and photos of a McLaren F1 kit car in a weak attempt to trick him. Ultimately, the deal fell apart, and the so-called seller disappeared.

But the hunt for the El Chapo McLaren isn’t over. Bolian believes Ojeda’s son, now living in New York City, may have real information about the car’s whereabouts. If true, it could be the key to finally solving the decades-old mystery of the lost F1.

A Legend Still Waiting to be Found

The McLaren F1 is one of the most coveted supercars in history, and chassis #39, with its bizarre backstory, cartel connections, and decades-long disappearance, may be one of the most valuable of them all. If it ever resurfaces, it would be worth well over $20 million, making it one of the most sought-after barn finds of all time.

For now, the car remains a ghost, buried somewhere in the underworld of crime and secrecy. But one thing is certain—whoever finds it won’t just be holding a rare piece of automotive history. They’ll be holding a piece of the cartel’s dark and twisted legacy.

Painful To Watch: Suzuki GSX-R1000 Rider Runs From Texas Trooper

It constantly amazes us how many riders, like the guy on this Suzuki GSX-R1000 running from a Texas trooper, think they know how to handle a motorcycle when they’ve clearly taken zero lessons. What’s even worse is when they’re on a high-powered sportbike and try riding it super aggressive to ditch the cops, the whole thing ending tragically, just like this police chase.

This motorcyclist is lucky to be alive.

A GSX-R1000 is a powerful sportbike that isn’t for amateurs like this guy. With a 1,000cc engine (hence the name) it can blast through the quarter mile in just over 10 seconds and hit a top speed of 173 mph. But with an inexperienced rider in the saddle, the thing is cumbersome and downright dangerous.

Advertisement Advertisement

But that doesn’t keep the guy from running once the trooper catches him speeding along the Dallas North Tollway late one night. The chase quickly turns almost comical as the suspect blasts ahead of the trooper on straightaways, but loses his lead each time there’s a curve in the highway.

Things get even worse once they exit the highway and enter downtown. It immediately becomes obvious the rider doesn’t even know how to manage the gears on the Suzuki motorcycle, let alone how to take 90-degree turns.

In a way, it’s like watching a baby deer try walking for the first time, only not nearly as cute but also even more pathetic. If the guy were to have any sense, he would know ditching the trooper isn’t likely, but injuring himself is.

And that’s exactly what happens. While going through a gentle turn on the road, our inexperienced suspect just falls for no good reason, kissing the pavement. Thankfully for him that didn’t happen on the highway, but it easily could’ve. On the other hand, he’s wearing clothing not made to slide on blacktop, so that’s going to leave a mark.

Maybe he’ll look at his scars and think hard about his life decisions moving forward.

Of course, each one has its pros and cons, which can only mean one thing: The ideal vehicle is some Hegelian synthesis of the two. Something like this Honda N600, perhaps, which eschews its traditional little two-cylinder for an inline-four out of a Fireblade — and swaps its 45 stock horses for 170 horsepower at 13,000 screaming RPM. The build comes from the mad geniuses over at Cars and Cameras, who have really come into their own as our own little domestic Garage54.

Cars and Cameras released part one of the CBR1000RR-powered N600 build, which is nearly 44 minutes of cutting, welding, and making the big four cylinder fit behind the N600's front seats. It's sort of a Renault 5 Turbo layout, which is a far cry from the car's original front-engine, front-wheel-drive design. The first episode covers everything from rolling the N600 into the shop, all the way through to the CBR engine's first start in the new chassis. Any other YouTube channel would take months of slow-drip posts to get to that point, and for that we thank Cars and Cameras.

A Very Fun Build

Despite the increases in displacement and power, the CBR engine is actually lighter than the mill that originally powered the N600 — even with a fuel tank, exhaust manifold, and wiring harness still mounted to the bike engine. All that power with less weight than an already-light stock Honda sounds like a recipe for a car that's an absolute blast to drive. Or a deathtrap. Quite possibly both.

Advertisement Advertisement

The engine isn't really interfacing with the car much in by the end of the video — little things like ""pedals"" are left as an exercise for later in the build, instead relying on the bike's throttle tube — which raises some questions about how exactly the build crew plans to make that all work. Running a chain to a sprocket at the rear is reasonable enough, but converting a throttle with a return cable to a single pedal seems like a much more intricate job. Seems like we'll all have to stay tuned for the next episode to see how they pull it off.

These cars represent ideas for the future of all of BMW's sedan, crossover, and M performance businesses, but they are also representative of specific future products around the size of the current 3-Series and X3. Now, we finally know when one of those actual future products is set to be revealed. BMW Chairman Oliver Zipse has announced at the company's annual conference that the all-new iX3 — effectively the production version of the Vision Neue Klasse X — will debut at Munich's IAA Mobility auto show in early September.

BMW has also shared official images of the production version of the iX3 and a still-unnamed sedan, presumably an electric 3-Series, iun testing. The images of camouflaged cars don't reveal much, but the design does look in line with a previously-leaked patent rendering of a production version of the iX3 crossover.

BMW

Both the sedan and crossover variants of the Vision Neue Klasse had a focus on massive, low-slung side windows that increase natural light within the car's airy cabin. Photos of camouflaged production cars indicate BMW has gone with a more conservative approach on the final cars, but both vehicles still seem to have unusually large side windows. The unique lighting-based interpretations of BMW's famous kidney grilles seen on the concepts are hidden under camouflage, but the shape beneath the camouflage suggests some version of those design elements may have made their way to the production cars.

The two upcoming cars on the Neue Klasse platform are just the beginning of a new product wave; BMW says that 40 new and refreshed models will be revealed between now and the end of 2027. Some of those updates should be major design updates to current cars that bring models like the new M5 in line with Neue Klasse's design direction, a possibility that would be in line with Zipse's claim that all new launches ""will have the DNA of Neue Klasse."" That cycle of updates and unveilings starts with the reveal of iX3 in September.

But they are overall surprisingly faithful to the look of the Neue Klasse and Neue Klasse X concept cars, and we especially like the taut and athletic proportions of the sedan. These vehicles appear to be electric, as we didn't spot any exhaust pipes like we did on a seemingly gas-powered 3-series prototype we spied testing earlier this year.

BMW

Though we don't yet have details on the iX3's electric powertrains, BMW has already discussed the Neue Klasse's mechanicals in the context of the recent Vision Driving Experience concept. The company described a control unit it calls ""Heart of Joy"" that will be installed in every electric Neue Klasse model to handle the drivetrain, braking, charging, regeneration, and steering functions. We're hoping this means that these new BMWs will drive as good as they look.

The Neue Klasse story will go even further in this direction with an upcoming performance M3. BMW has already previewed a prototype of this model, showing an enticing widebody configuration, and has talked about its quad-motor electric powertrain. At the same time, there are hints that the M3 may continue offering an inline-six gasoline engine as well.

Volkswagen has heard the complaints loud and clear. The company’s design chief, Andreas Mindt, confirmed in a recent interview with Autocar that physical buttons will return to VW’s next generation of electric vehicles. The decision marks a shift away from the touch-heavy controls that have frustrated drivers in recent years, with Mindt promising, “We will never, ever make this mistake anymore.”

A win for driving enthusiasts

While touchscreens offer versatility and sleek aesthetics, they have come at the cost of usability. Many drivers have criticized VW’s reliance on touch-sensitive controls, particularly for essential functions like climate control and volume adjustment. Mindt emphasized that Volkswagen is committed to ensuring its cars remain intuitive and easy to operate, stating, “It’s not a phone: it’s a car.”

Volkswagen

This isn’t the first time VW has acknowledged the issue. CEO Thomas Schäfer made a similar promise in 2023, admitting that the company’s earlier approach was difficult to use. However, this time, there’s a concrete timeline: the transition will begin with the launch of the ID.2all, Volkswagen’s upcoming compact EV, which is expected to enter production later this year and go on sale globally in 2026.

What’s changing?

VW won’t be eliminating touchscreens altogether — they remain necessary for navigation, infotainment, and backup camera functions. However, critical controls like volume, temperature adjustments, and hazard lights will have dedicated physical buttons in all future VW models.

Volkswagen

“They will be in every car that we make from now on. We understood this,” Mindt assured. The move is a direct response to customer and critical feedback, acknowledging that the driving experience should prioritize tactile, easy-to-use controls.

The future of VW interiors

The ID.2all — often described as the spiritual successor to the Volkswagen Golf — will be the first model to reflect this philosophy. In the U.S., customers may have to wait until at least 2027 to experience these improvements firsthand. If VW follows through on its promise, it could regain goodwill from drivers frustrated by the industry’s shift toward touch-sensitive everything.

Safety regulations pushing for change

Volkswagen’s decision to reintroduce buttons isn’t happening in isolation. A growing safety movement is pushing automakers to rethink their reliance on touchscreens. Starting in 2026, the European New Car Assessment Program (Euro NCAP) will require physical controls for five critical functions — turn signals, hazard warning lights, horn, windshield wipers and the emergency call (eCall) system — for a vehicle to earn a five-star safety rating.

The move comes in response to studies showing that touchscreens increase driver distraction, forcing motorists to take their eyes off the road for extended periods. “The overuse of touchscreens is an industry-wide problem,” said Matthew Avery, director of strategic development at Euro NCAP. While these regulations don’t yet apply in the U.S., they could influence future safety standards and consumer expectations globally.

Final thoughts

Some automakers, including Mazda and Toyota, have resisted fully touchscreen-based interiors, maintaining physical buttons for key controls. Volkswagen’s decision aligns with this growing shift, potentially positioning the company as a leader in a new wave of driver-friendly car design. For now, driving enthusiasts can celebrate: buttons are back, and hopefully this time, they’re here to stay.",yahoo
https://finance.yahoo.com,This Downhill Karting Spot in Vietnam Brings Mario Kart Dreams to Life,https://autos.yahoo.com/downhill-karting-spot-vietnam-brings-174400977.html,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 17:44:00 GMT","Who doesn’t love some competitive go-karting? Well, this spot in Da Lat, Vietnam isn’t exactly that in the traditional sense — but the beautiful downhill luge course, where drivers chase one another while winding downhill as gravity pulls them along faster and faster, sure does look fun in its own right. And it also gives us serious visions of real-life Mario Kart.

Called Cao Nguyen Hoa, this course is set up in the hills and mountains around Da Lat in the southern region of Vietnam in the opposite direction of a hill climb. Of course, the constant decrease in elevation is necessary, since the karts used in the racetrack are only powered by gravity. They use handlebars for steering, and thankfully, they have brakes to yank on when your speed gets a bit high entering one of the many hairpins on the course.

And the videos posted on various social media platforms depict a Nintendo-esque scene. The waterfalls, beautiful foliage, exotic landscape and vibrant colors everywhere sure do remind us of Mario Kart tracks like DK Jungle, Shy Guy Falls and others. Sadly, there don’t appear to be any power-ups or banana peels you can pick up along the way... though a little bumper-to-bumper racing and crashing definitely looks to be within the realm of possibilities.

Drivers are released from the starting blocks in groups, just like the mad dash that happens at the beginning of every Mario Kart race. And based on the videos, there’s no telling what you’ll find further down the mountain: people who overcooked it into a hairpin; people who found themselves stuck behind one of the many chicane-like obstacles in the course; and of course, all sorts of slower traffic for you to pass. It definitely looks like a situation ripe for channeling your inner Lewis Hamilton (or Toad), so if you find yourself near Da Lat in Vietnam, check out Cao Nguyen Hoa — and let us know your fastest time.

https://finance.yahoo.com,There Are Thousands of Unsold New Chevy Corvettes at Dealers Across the U.S.,https://autos.yahoo.com/thousands-unsold-chevy-corvettes-dealers-173000267.html,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 17:30:00 GMT","The C8 Corvette—the car’s eighth generation and the first rear mid-engine Corvette—was a big deal for Chevy when it debuted in 2019, and the first C8 Corvettes demanded significant markups past its starting price of $58,900. Now that it’s been a few years and the hype has died down, thousands are sitting unsold at dealers, and markups have all but vanished.

Over 5,000 C8 Corvettes are currently in Chevy’s inventory system, the vast majority from the 2025 model year, which means that more than likely you can go to your local dealership at this very moment and drive away with one. You’ll also likely have several to choose from if you don’t mind buying your new car off the lot, as most Americans do.

More from Robb Report

New Corvettes currently start at $68,300 for the base Stingray and in exchange you get 495 horsepower, a zero to 60 time of 2.9 seconds, and a top track speed of 194 mph. An 8-speed dual-clutch transmission comes standard and the C8 Corvette Stingray is the most powerful production Stingray ever; you might even call it a budget supercar if you’re feeling generous.

Corvette C8

The prices in Chevy’s inventory system even start below $68,300, with some as low as $63,185 after various offers and discounts are included. One new Corvette was even recently spotted for $58,280, according to The Drive, or less than the starting price after the C8’s debut. These prices don’t include tax, title, and other fees.

Perhaps Chevy is also starting to feel some of the waning demand, as Chevy has spent the last several months hyping the 1,064 horsepower ZR1 version of the Corvette, which debuted last July and has since set several track records. That car starts at $174,995, and has renewed some interest in the C8 right as it gets past midlife.

That’s because pretty soon, all eyes will be on the C9 Corvette, which is rumored to debut sometime in 2028, and could be the first all-electric Corvette. Or the C9 could be another iteration of the internal combustion engine car that has endured for so long as an American classic, depending on where the EV pendulum is swinging then. Most likely, the C9 Corvette will be a hybrid of some sort, like the Corvette E-Ray. GM might even put in some tech it learned in Formula 1. By then, most of the C8 Corvettes on dealer lots will have moved on, though for now thousands are still there, in plain sight.

https://bitcoinmagazine.com,"Bitcoin Is A Strategic Asset, Not XRP",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/bitcoin-is-a-strategic-asset-not-xrp,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 15:09:00 GMT","A new proposal submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) newly-established Crypto Task Force by a Maximilian Staudinger makes the case for XRP as a “strategic financial asset” for the United States (using some very questionable math and logic).

I’m here to tell you that XRP is not a strategic asset and that the logic in this proposal is dubious at best.

In the proposal, Staudinger states that $5 trillion is locked up in U.S. Nostro accounts (accounts that banks use for cross-border payments). And he claims that if certain regulatory conditions were created — including the SEC classifying XRP as a payment network, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) providing legal clearance for banks to use XRP, and the Federal Reserve mandating that banks use XRP as a liquidity solution — then 30% of this capital ($1.5 trillion) would be freed up for the U.S. government to buy 25 million bitcoin at $60,000 per bitcoin.

So, let’s break down why this makes little sense.

First, Nostro accounts are simply bank accounts that U.S. banks hold in foreign countries. I’m not sure what sort of logic includes these domestic banks turning over the U.S. dollars that XRP would theoretically replace to the Federal government so that these dollars could then be used to acquire bitcoin on behalf of the government.

Second, the proposal doesn’t offer details on how these domestic banks would obtain the XRP that would replace the dollars. It only seems logical that they’d have to purchase the XRP, leading to XRP absorbing this $1.5 trillion, not bitcoin. Even if Ripple, XRP’s issuer, wanted to simply give these banks XRP to use, this still wouldn’t work, as it only holds about $100 billion in XRP — far short of $1.5 trillion.

Third, even if bitcoin’s price were to dip to $60,000, the price would begin increasing immediately as the U.S. government began purchasing the 25 million bitcoin.

Lastly, there’s a hard cap of 21 million bitcoin (and approximately 4 million have been lost), which is a well-known fact in the Bitcoin or crypto space. Therefore, it’s quite silly to suggest that the U.S. government could buy 25 million bitcoin. If the author were even a half-serious person, he might have suggested that the government buy 15 million bitcoin at $100,000 per bitcoin (though the math still wouldn’t work out).

Given how faulty the logic behind this proposal is, it’s difficult to consider XRP a strategic asset. Plus, why would the U.S. government do so when two thirds of the supply is still in the hands of the organization that issued the asset? It doesn’t make much sense.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a globally distributed asset that many around the world use as both money and a store of value. Plus, the Bitcoin network is governed by tens of thousands of nodes and is virtually impenetrable, thanks to the approximately 0.4% of the world’s energy that protects it. (The XRP network is governed by 828 nodes and isn’t protected by any amount of energy.) Theses factors make bitcoin a logical reserve asset, which is how the U.S. government now officially classifies it.

So, hopefully, the SEC already understands what I’ve outlined in this piece and doesn’t spend much time even considering Mr. Staudinger’s proposal.

Sponsored by Representatives Adam Bowling and T.J. Roberts, the bill affirms the right of individuals to self-custody digital assets through self-hosted wallets. Additionally, it prevents local zoning laws from discriminating against digital asset mining businesses, ensuring that Bitcoin miners can operate freely within the state.

The bill outlines several key provisions, including:

Protection for Bitcoin self-custody : Individuals have the legal right to use and store digital assets in self-hosted wallets.

: Individuals have the legal right to use and store digital assets in self-hosted wallets. Prohibition of discriminatory zoning laws : Local governments cannot impose zoning changes that unfairly target digital asset mining businesses.

https://bitcoinmagazine.com,This Rare Bitcoin Buy Signal Could Ignite Next BTC Rally,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/rare-bitcoin-buy-signal-could-ignite-next-btc-rally,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 08:28:12 GMT","Bitcoin has been struggling with lower lows in recent weeks, leaving many investors questioning whether the asset is on the brink of a major bear cycle. However, a rare data point tied to the US Dollar Strength Index (DXY) suggests that a significant shift in market dynamics may be imminent. This bitcoin buy signal, which has only appeared three times in BTC’s history, could point to a bullish reversal despite the current bearish sentiment.

For a more in-depth look into this topic, check out a recent YouTube video here:

Bitcoin: This Had Only Ever Happened 3x Before

BTC vs DXY Inverse Relationship

Bitcoin’s price action has long been inversely correlated with the US Dollar Strength Index (DXY). Historically, when the DXY strengthens, BTC tends to struggle, while a declining DXY often creates favorable macroeconomic conditions for Bitcoin price appreciation.

Figure 1: $BTC & DXY have historically had an inverse correlation. View Live Chart 🔍

Despite this historically bullish influence, Bitcoin’s price has continued to retreat, recently dropping from over $100,000 to below $80,000. However, past occurrences of this rare DXY retracement suggest that a delayed but meaningful BTC rebound could still be in play.

Bitcoin Buy Signal Historic Occurrences

Currently, the DXY has been in a sharp decline, a decrease of over 3.4% within a single week, a rate of change that has only been observed three times in Bitcoin’s entire trading history.

Figure 2: There have only been three previous instances of such rapid DXY decline.

To understand the potential impact of this DXY signal, let’s examine the three prior instances when this sharp decline in the US dollar strength index occurred:

2015 Post-Bear Market Bottom

The first occurrence was after BTC’s price had bottomed out in 2015. Following a period of sideways consolidation, BTC’s price experienced a significant upward surge, gaining over 200% within months.

Post-COVID Market Crash

The second instance occurred in early 2020, following the sharp market collapse triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. Similar to the 2015 case, BTC initially experienced choppy price action before a rapid upward trend emerged, culminating in a multi-month rally.

2022 Bear Market Recovery

The most recent instance happened at the end of the 2022 bear market. After an initial period of price stabilization, BTC followed with a sustained recovery, climbing to substantially higher prices and kicking off the current bull cycle over the following months.

In each case, the sharp decline in the DXY was followed by a consolidation phase before BTC embarked on a significant bullish run. Overlaying the price action of these three instances onto our current price action we get an idea of how things could play out in the near future.

Figure 3: How price action could play out if any of the three previous occurrences are mirrored.

Equity Markets Correlation

Interestingly, this pattern isn’t limited to Bitcoin. A similar relationship can be observed in traditional markets, particularly in the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. When the DXY retraces sharply, equity markets have historically outperformed their baseline returns.

Figure 4: The same outperformance can be observed in equity markets.

The all-time average 30-day return for the Nasdaq following a similar DXY decline stands at 4.29%, well above the standard 30-day return of 1.91%. Extending the window to 60 days, the Nasdaq’s average return increases to nearly 7%, nearly doubling the typical performance of 3.88%. This correlation suggests that Bitcoin’s performance following a sharp DXY retracement aligns with historical broader market trends, reinforcing the argument for a delayed but inevitable positive response.

Conclusion

The current decline in the US Dollar Strength Index represents a rare and historically bullish Bitcoin buy signal. Although BTC’s immediate price action remains weak, historical precedents suggest that a period of consolidation will likely be followed by a significant rally. Especially when reinforced by observing the same response in indexes such as the Nasdaq and S&P 500, the broader macroeconomic environment is setting up favorably for BTC.

According to a Reuters report, Russian oil companies and traders increasingly conduct transactions in bitcoin and crypto, allowing them to circumvent restrictions from Western nations. Sources say monthly trade volumes are already in the tens of millions of dollars.

JUST IN: 🇷🇺 Russia is using #Bitcoin and crypto in its oil trade with China and India to skirt Western sanctions: Reuters pic.twitter.com/Ld99WAQ1WQ — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 14, 2025

The mechanism involves Chinese or Indian buyers purchasing oil and depositing yuan or rupees into an offshore account owned by a middleman company. The middleman then converts the fiat currency into crypto and transfers it to an account in Russia, where it is exchanged into rubles.

While crypto-based oil payments are still a fraction of Russia’s $192 billion total oil trade, the practice is growing as sanctions bite. The trend highlights the utility of bitcoin and crypto in enabling transaction settlement for sanctioned nations. Iran and Venezuela have adopted similar crypto strategies. Bitcoin and crypto’s censorship resistance allows value transfer beyond the reach of sanctions.

In late 2024, Russia’s finance minister publicly endorsed using crypto in foreign trade. The Kremlin sees bitcoin and crypto as one of several effective strategies to overcome financial penalties imposed over the invasion of Ukraine. The Bank of Russia also recently proposed legalizing crypto investments for wealthy citizens.

However, Russia’s oil trade still relies primarily on fiat currencies. President Donald Trump’s administration is debating whether to ease some restrictions to improve relations with Moscow.

With the Ukraine conflict still unresolved, Russia’s pivot toward leveraging bitcoin and decentralized technologies appears to aim to reduce its reliance on traditional finance and dollar settlements. Other countries under U.S. sanctions are likely to be monitored closely.",bitcoinmagazine

Key Takeaways David Sacks sold over $200 million in digital assets including Bitcoin and Ethereum before his White House role.

Share this article

The White House disclosed that David Sacks, Trump’s AI and crypto czar, and his venture firm Craft Ventures divested over $200 million in crypto assets and related holdings before taking on his new role. At least 85% was personally attributed to Sacks.

The revelation came in a memorandum dated March 5, granting Sacks a limited ethics waiver to participate in digital asset policy matters.

“Altogether, you and Craft Ventures have divested over $200 million of positions related to the digital asset industry, of which at least $85 million is directly attributable to you,” the memo states.

Sacks indeed disclosed this information when joining The All-In Podcast last week. The White House crypto tsar faced numerous allegations that he exploited his position for personal gain in crypto.

“We cleared that before day one, paid taxes on it, and basically said there wouldn’t be a conflict,” he said, dismissing allegations of using his government position to benefit personally from crypto market movements.

The divestments, completed before the start of the President’s second term on January 20, 2025, included liquid crypto assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, as well as positions in the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund. Sacks also sold his directly held stock in public companies Coinbase and Robinhood, along with shares in private digital asset companies.

Sacks liquidated his limited partner interests in crypto-focused investment funds, including Multicoin Capital and Blockchain Capital. His firm, Craft Ventures, also sold its stakes in Multicoin Capital and Bitwise Asset Management.

The tech investor still maintains some exposure to the digital asset industry through venture capital funds managed by Craft Ventures, where he serves as both a general and limited partner. These remaining holdings include stakes in BitGo and Lightning Labs representing less than 2.5% and 1.2% of his total investment assets, respectively.

As a special government employee, Sacks was not eligible for tax relief typically available through certificates of divestiture. He also began selling interests in approximately 90 venture capital funds, including Sequoia, which may hold minor digital asset positions.

The White House granted Sacks a limited ethics waiver to participate in digital asset policy matters, despite his retaining minor holdings in private crypto companies through Craft Ventures.

Sacks has agreed not to acquire new digital asset holdings during his tenure, which is limited to 130 days or fewer annually as a special government employee.",cryptobriefing

The recent resurgence of Bitcoin coincides with a rise in the market capitalization of major stablecoins, including USDT, USDC, BUSD, and DAI. Their combined market cap increased from around $204 billion to over $205 billion between March 10 and 14, according to Glassnode data.

Stablecoins serve as a bridge between fiat currencies and crypto markets, comprising the majority of crypto trading pairs and market liquidity. The rising market cap indicates higher stablecoin adoption and their growing role as a preferred medium for crypto transactions.

World Liberty Financial (WLFI), un proyecto DeFi avalado por el presidente Donald Trump y sus hijos, ha completado hoy su venta de tokens, asegurando $550 millones en financiación, según una actualización en el sitio oficial de WLFI website.

Lanzado el pasado septiembre, WLFI se centra en promover las finanzas descentralizadas y las stablecoins vinculadas al dólar estadounidense para mantener la preeminencia del dólar en las finanzas globales. Su característica principal es una plataforma de préstamos DeFi, similar a Aave, que opera sobre la blockchain de Ethereum y soporta Bitcoin, Ethereum y stablecoins.

El token de gobernanza del proyecto, WLFI, comenzó su venta pública el 15 de octubre. Sin embargo, la venta inicial no cumplió con las expectativas, recaudando solo $11 millones de la venta de 766 millones de tokens.

El proyecto es encabezado por los hijos de Donald Trump, Eric Trump y Donald Trump Jr., siendo Barron Trump denominado como el «visionario DeFi.» Sin embargo, el whitepaper del proyecto aclara explícitamente que la familia Trump no posee ni gestiona el proyecto, aunque podrían recibir compensación.

El fundador de Tron, Justin Sun, es uno de los mayores inversionistas en World Liberty Financial.

Sun compró $30 millones en tokens WLFI a finales del pasado noviembre, convirtiéndose en el mayor inversionista del proyecto en ese momento. Más tarde, el 19 de enero, aumentó su inversión en $45 millones adicionales, llevando su participación total a $75 millones.

La plataforma DeFi planea desarrollar un sistema financiero abierto que opera independientemente del control centralizado, ofreciendo diversos productos y servicios basados en blockchain.",cryptobriefing
https://decrypt.co,Public Keys: Coinbase IRL and Gemini Wants Bitcoin Believers to Look Up,https://decrypt.co/310033/public-keys-coinbase-irl-gemini-bitcoin-believers-look-up,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 20:02:29 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Public Keys is a weekly roundup from Decrypt that tracks the key publicly traded crypto companies. This week: It’s spring time for Coinbase and on-chain assets. The company is going after its tokenized security white whale. CEO Brian Armstrong and his founders have been wanting to offer tokenized stocks since before the company even went public in 2021. Will they do it this time? Meanwhile: What’s that in the sky? An IPO, a new ETF? Turns out it’s both.

Real world wins for Coinbase

Things keep falling into place for Coinbase. This week alone, the company saw a lawsuit against it in Vermont dropped and got approval to offer its services in India.

Now, onlookers are watching to see if Coinbase will get the green light to offer tokenized securities. It’s something the company has wanted to do since before it went public in 2021.

If Coinbase got the OK to tokenize securities, it would be a huge boon for the already growing RWA, or real-world asset, segment.

The RWA market aims to bring assets like stocks, bonds, property, or even land on-chain. Sometimes that’s been looked at as gimmicky by traditional finance types. But Wall Street has been working to reduce settlement times for years. What faster way to get there than by bringing some assets on-chain?

Currently, BlackRock has dominated the RWA space. Just yesterday its BUIDL fund topped $1 billion worth of assets under management. The fund holds dollar-equivalent assets like cash, U.S. Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. Next in line is the Hashnote Short Duration Yield Coin, which boasts an AUM of $868 million and grants traders exposure to short duration U.S. Treasuries and reverse repo U.S. Treasuries.

In the past month alone, RWAs grew by 18% to $18.3 billion, according to rwa.xyz.

RWAs are an interesting, but not at all surprising, counterbalance to the global crypto market—which has dropped 16% in the past month, according to CoinGecko data. As more RWA products come on-chain, it would mean investors could flock to the safety of T-bills without having to off-ramp funds into a traditional brokerage account.

But Coinbase doesn’t just want to do this on its home turf. The San Francisco company said in a blog post earlier this week it’s calling for “regulatory frameworks that match the scale of opportunity” in Europe.

Perpetual futures are the vast majority of global crypto trading - but there has been no path to launch them in the US...until now. That’s about to change. https://t.co/WCUfDnu6SP — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) March 10, 2025

This week the crypto exchange also launched 24/7 access to Bitcoin and Ethereum futures.

Adding more trading hours for its products is the kind of news that will likely help pad Coinbase’s bottom line. As the company pointed out in its most recent 10-K filing: “Our largest source of cash provided by operations are revenues generated from transaction fees.”

And as of the end of 2024, cash generated from operations had ballooned to $2.5 billion. That means that revenue stream has more than doubled from $922 million in 2023.

On Friday afternoon, Coinbase, which trades on the Nasdaq under the COIN ticker, closed at 183.12, up 3.17% on the day.

Up, IPO and away!

There’s a growing list of companies rumored to be considering an IPO in 2025, but—look, a flying Bitcoin (and an excuse to talk about this news we missed last week).

Last night, crypto exchange Gemini flew a Guinness World Record-breaking “aerial display of a cryptocurrency logo formed by multirotor/drones” in Austin, Texas.

What do you think we’ll see first: A buzzing horde of drones snatching their record or an IPO?

People familiar with the matter told Bloomberg last week that the company confidentially filed for an IPO with Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. That means Gemini is the first to make the jump from the rumored IPO list—which includes stablecoin issuer Circle, crypto exchanges Bullish, Kraken, and Blockchain.com—into the actual race.

If any of the other crypto companies start filing IPO paperwork, it may be a while before investors hear about it because of relaxed Securities and Exchange Commission rules. But relaxed rules are precisely why this year could see an uptick in public offerings, according to a recent Law360 column.

Wen buy Bitcoin?

It was another bye week for Michael Saylor's Bitcoin amassing Strategy.

The company, which recently changed its name from MicroStrategy and trades on the Nasdaq under the MSTR ticker, has seen its Bitcoin holdings remain unchanged at 499,096 Bitcoin since Feb. 24.

At the time, the company said that it had purchased Bitcoin for an average price of $97,500 per Bitcoin.

And bettors aren't optimistic the company will announce a surprise buy over the weekend. Prediction market traders on MYRIAD doubt that Strategy will confirm a new Bitcoin purchase on Monday, estimating a 76% chance that the firm’s holdings remain unchanged for a third consecutive week. (Disclosure: MYRIAD is owned by Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.)

On Friday afternoon, Strategy, which trades on the Nasdaq under the MSTR ticker, closed at 297.49, up a whopping 13% today.

Other keys

Asset manager Rex Shares is nothing if not creative. On Friday, the company launched an ETF to bring Startegy’s Bitcoin-backed bond offering to the everyman.

“Until now, these bonds have been difficult for individual investors to reach,” REX Financial CEO Greg King said in a statement. “BMAX removes those barriers making it easier to invest in the strategy pioneered by Michael Saylor.”

Earlier in the week, Rex and Osprey Funds applied to offer an ETF that would track the price of MOVE, the Movement Network token that launched in November. It’s also the same firm that filed to offer ETFs linked to Official Trump (TRUMP), BONK, and Dogecoin.

REX Shares debuted an exchange-trade fund on Friday providing exposure to Strategy’s convertible bonds, a form of debt the ETF issuer said was hard to access for most investors.

The REX Bitcoin Corporate Treasury Convertible Bond ETF (BMAX) provides exposure to debt from three U.S. companies. However, REX said in a press release that the fund is “highly concentrated” in products offered by Strategy, the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin.

Since Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, issued its first batch of convertible senior notes in 2020, REX Financial CEO Greg King said in a statement that retail investors and investment advisors have lacked the same opportunities as institutional investors to access these products.

“Until now, these bonds have been difficult for individual investors to reach,” he said. “BMAX removes those barriers making it easier to invest in the strategy pioneered by Michael Saylor.”

The fund debuted on the Nasdaq with $24.8 million in assets, according to REX’s website. Aside from Strategy’s convertible notes, which account for 81% of the fund’s exposure, the fund contains similar products issued by Bitcoin miners Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms.

Convertible senior notes are bonds that can be converted into shares by an investor if the associated company’s stock price rises above a certain market price.

The fund is actively managed, and REX said it may invest up to 20% of its assets in equities issued by companies that leverage Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. Those could be purchased on a secondary market or stem from converting convertible bonds.

REX has issued ETFs centered on Strategy before. The company currently offers leveraged ETFs providing 2x long or short exposure to Strategy’s stock.

It has also filed for several spot crypto ETFs. Most recently the company filed for an ETF that would provide exposure to the price of MOVE, an Ethereum layer-2 scaling network that just launched its mainnet earlier this week.

REX is racing to offer products for meme coins as well, including President Donald Trump’s meme coin on Solana, BONK, and Dogecoin.

https://decrypt.co,Ethereum Flat as Devs Prepare for Hooli Testnet Ahead of Pectra Upgrade,https://decrypt.co/309988/ethereum-flat-devs-prepare-test-pectra-upgrade,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 13:14:14 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Ethereum is preparing for its Pectra upgrade, which aims to boost the network’s scalability and offer better staking flexibility, by launching a testnet on Monday codenamed Hoodi. This comes after two previous testnets, Holesky and Sepolia, encountered technical issues.

If all goes to plan, it could hit mainnet as early as April 25.

The second largest cryptocurrency’s price appears unmoved by this news. Over the past 24 hours, the Ethereum price has gained only 0.5% and is currently trading at just over $1,900, according to CoinGecko data. Zooming out, ETH has lost 13.3% in the past week amid macro pressures from President Trump’s trade war.

The Pectra uprade will be the third upgrade to the network since The Merge in 2022, which saw Ethereum move from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake. Pectra looks to boost Ethereum’s scalability, efficiency, and staking flexibility as it expands storage capacity for layer-2 networks. It’ll reduce fees, too.

Previous tests of the upgrade faced challenges, most notably Holesky saw an uptick in invalid blocks. As a result, devs are launching Hoodi on Monday, March 17 in hopes it’ll address the issues seen with the last testnet.

Ethereum has become the butt of many jokes across the broader crypto community, with fans of other networks mocking the network for its slow development rate and ETH’s poor price action. Over the past year, according to TradingView, Ethereum has lost 52% of its share of market cap dominance. That’s left room for coins like XRP to gain 258.98%.

But slow and steady wins the race—or so Ethereum maxis would have other investors believe.

Pectra aims to allow users to pay gas fees with multiple tokens, including stablecoins like USDC. It’ll also allow for third-party fee sponsorship, which allows an entity to pay gas fees on behalf of the user—something that has become hugely important on layer-2 scaling networks.

On top of this, Ethereum validators will have a significantly increased capacity for how many tokens they can stake—from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH. The uptick will be coupled with more flexibility for when and how the staked Ethereum can be withdrawn.

Pectra will also lay the groundwork for social recovery, which allows users to rely on trusted contacts to help them regain access to a wallet that they’ve forgotten or lost the key to.

With this, many believe that Pectra will be the biggest upgrade to Ethereum since The Merge and one of its largest in its history.

Once Ethereum’s core developers “feel confident” in the state of testing, a mainnet update will be scheduled at least 30 days after the Hoodi fork. This means that the earliest the network could see the Pectra upgrade go live is April 25.

The Ethereum ecosystem is continuously evolving. The latest milestone in its development is the Pectra upgrade.

Set for March 2025, the Pectra upgrade merges the Prague and Electra upgrades, which were originally planned as separate updates but were combined for better integration and to enhance scalability, efficiency, and usability.

The Pectra Upgrade introduces account abstraction for flexible gas payments, enhancements to smart contracts, improved staking options, and technical upgrades like Verkle trees and PeerDAS to optimize data management and layer-2 support. We will explain all of these concepts below.

What is the Ethereum Pectra upgrade?

The Ethereum Pectra upgrade enhances the network's scalability, efficiency, and staking flexibility. Pectra expands storage capacity for layer-2 solutions while reducing fees.

One of Pectra’s most user-friendly improvements is flexible gas payments. In Ethereum, “gas” refers to transaction fees that compensate validators for securing the network. With account abstraction, Pectra allows users to pay these fees using ERC-20 tokens like USDC instead of being restricted to ETH. Account abstraction simplifies Ethereum transactions by making wallets function more like smart contracts, offering more control over how transactions are executed.

The Pectra upgrade also introduces Peer Data Availability Sampling or PeerDAS. PeerDAS improves Ethereum's scalability by allowing nodes to verify transaction data without storing it entirely, making the network more efficient.

Another improvement is Verkle Trees, a new data structure that combines Vector Commitments and Merkle Trees, and provides a more efficient data storage upgrade for Ethereum. Verkle Trees optimize information storage and verification, significantly reducing the amount of data validators need to keep while allowing quick and secure access to network information.

When will Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade happen?

The Ethereum Pectra upgrade is expected to occur in mid-March 2025, and will be implemented in two phases. Phase 1 will introduce key improvements, such as doubling layer-2 blob capacity from three to six to reduce congestion and fees, enabling Account Abstraction to allow gas payments in tokens like the DAI and USDC stablecoins, and increasing the maximum staking limit from 32 to 2,048 ETH to simplify large-scale validator operations.

Phase 2, anticipated in late 2025 or early 2026, will implement advanced optimizations, including PeerDAS and Verkle Trees, to improve data storage and network efficiency.

The last major Ethereum upgrade, Dencun, took place on March 13, 2024. It introduced proto-danksharding, which reduces transaction costs for layer-2 blockchains using temporary data called binary large objects or 'blobs.' Instead of relying on permanent on-chain storage, these blobs minimize network congestion, improving scalability and setting the stage for upgrades like Pectra.

How does the Pectra upgrade work?

What Ethereum Improvement Proposals are part of the Pectra upgrade?

The Pectra upgrade introduces several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) to enhance wallet usability, staking, and scalability.

EIP-7702 temporarily functions as smart contracts for externally owned accounts (EOAs), simplifying transactions and replacing the now-deprecated EIP-3074.

How will the Pectra upgrade affect users?

The Pectra upgrade is expected to benefit Ethereum users in several ways, including transaction batching, new recovery options, and new wallet types.

Once the Pectra upgrade comes online, Ethereum users may see lower or even zero gas fees as third-party services and decentralized applications will have the option to sponsor transaction fees, potentially eliminating transaction fees in some cases.

Pectra also introduces new wallet features to improve Ethereum’s usability and accessibility, including transaction batching, which allows the bundling of multiple transactions into one, reducing costs and improving efficiency.

Social recovery provides a safety net for lost private keys by enabling trusted contacts to help restore access to a wallet, while native multisig (multi-signature) wallets enhance security by requiring multiple approvals before executing a transaction, making funds safer from unauthorized access.

Potential challenges of the Pectra upgrade

Ethereum developers expect a smooth Pectra rollout, but key risks remain. According to a June 2024 report by Obol and Liquid Collective, client diversity is a concern, as a bug in a dominant client could destabilize the network. Operator centralization may also increase slashing risks if staking consolidates under fewer entities. Cloud reliance on providers like AWS and Hetzner also poses outages and security vulnerabilities, impacting validator uptime and network resilience.

Another challenge is that the Pectra upgrade’s wallet verification changes could expose outdated protocols to exploits if they are not updated in time. Meanwhile, raising staking limits may encourage centralization, concentrating power among larger players and attracting regulatory scrutiny. Slow adoption of distributed validator technology, which mitigates single points of failure and reduces the risks of centralized control, could weaken network resilience.

Testnet teething troubles

Those challenges became apparent in February 2025, when the Pectra upgrade was activated on Ethereum's Holesky testnet, but failed to achieve finality—the point when a transaction is confirmed and permanently recorded on the blockchain. While it represents a setback, testnets ""exist to find issues,"" said Georgios Konstantopoulos, general partner and chief technology officer at crypto investment firm Paradigm.

Ethereum devs opted to delay the Pectra launch in order to test the upgrade on a ""shadow fork"" of the Holesky testnet, a stopgap duplicate that enabled testing to continue while waiting for the the Holesky testnet proper to achieve finality—which it ultimately did on March 10, more than two weeks after it was first activated.

This isn't the first time that an Ethereum upgrade has failed to achieve finality on testnet; in March 2024, the network's Dencun upgrade suffered a similar hiccup when it went live on the Goerli testnet.

The next phase of preparations will see the launch of a dedicated testnet for the Pectra upgrade, codenamed Hoodi, on March 17. Developers are eyeing April 25 as the launch date for Pectra on mainnet, if all goes to plan.

The future of Ethereum after Pectra

The Pectra upgrade marks an essential step in Ethereum’s roadmap, and aligns with its long-term vision of scalability, security, and decentralization. As part of Ethereum’s transition toward a more efficient network, Pectra lays the groundwork for future updates.

In January 2025, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin addressed concerns about ETH's price and the impact of layer-2 scaling solutions on the network's economics. Buterin emphasized the need for L2 networks to support ETH's value by burning some of their fees or staking them for the community's benefit.

“We should think explicitly about the economics of ETH,” Buterin wrote. “We need to make sure that ETH continues to accrue value even in an L2-heavy world, ideally solving for a variety of models of how value accrual happens.”

Buterin also called for standardizing cross-chain features, enhancing interoperability, and prioritizing security to prevent censorship on layer-2 chains. Signifying the moment's importance, Buterin likened it to a “wartime mode,” underscoring his commitment to addressing these challenges head-on and driving Ethereum's development forward.

A California man has been sentenced for his role in using Bitcoin to launder the proceeds of an operation selling MDMA on the dark web.

John Khuu, 29, of San Francisco, California, was sentenced to 87 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business.

According to Texas police, Khuu’s operation would import MDMA from Germany and sell it on various dark web markets, accepting payment in Bitcoin. Khuu would allegedly then trade the Bitcoin stored in seller accounts for U.S. currency and launder the dirty money through “hundreds of transactions and dozens of financial accounts."" The man has been indicted separately in the Northern District of California and charged with unlawful importation of a Schedule I controlled substance.

The man’s arrest came as part of Operation Crypto Runner, a joint multiyear investigation by the Department of Justice (DOJ), the U.S. Secret Service (USSS), and the Postal Inspection Service (PIS), announced back in November 2022.

The operation played a part in 21 people being arrested in 2022 for acting as ""money mules"" and helping to launder the proceeds of various crypto scams, including real estate, email, and romance scams. Last month, a Montana man was also convicted for crypto money laundering as part of the federal agency crackdown.

Crypto money laundering crackdown

It’s no surprise that the federal government is taking an all-inclusive approach to fighting Bitcoin money laundering. Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis thinks 2024 was likely the biggest year ever in terms of money laundered through cryptocurrency at over $40 billion, exceeding the previous record set in 2023.

The firm thinks that the number would be higher if this included money from drug operations, but said it is harder to track the proceeds of crimes that occur ""off chain"" and originate in the real world.

A 2024 risk assessment from the U.S. Treasury found that though traditional methods to launder drug money are still dominant, using crypto to launder drug money is rising both in popularity and sophistication.

Many of these crypto drug money laundering operations are increasingly international in scope. The DEA’s most recent National Drug Threat Assessment established how Mexican cartels operating in the U.S. have ""mutually profitable partnerships with China-based money laundering organizations to launder drug proceeds and are increasingly using cryptocurrency.""",decrypt

A UK National Crime Agency officer has been charged with the alleged theft of 50 Bitcoin in 2017, then worth $77,000.

Paul Chowles, 42, from Bristol, stands charged with 15 counts of criminal offences in relation to the theft, which he is accused of having committed while working as an operational officer at the NCA.

The alleged theft took place during an ongoing investigation into online organized crime, according to the investigating Merseyside Police.

At the time, in 2017, the haul of 50 BTC was worth around $77,000 (£60,000) but by today's measure the value stands closer to $4 million.

In a statement, Malcolm McHaffie, Head of the Crown Prosecution Service Special Crime Division, said: ""Mr Chowles, 42, is due to be charged with 11 offences of concealing, disguising, or converting criminal property, three offences of acquiring, using or possessing converting criminal property and a single count of theft.""

Mr Chowles is due to appear at the Liverpool Magistrates' Court on 25 April 2025.

Mr McHaffie added that, ""The Crown Prosecution Service reminds all concerned that criminal proceedings against this defendant are now active and that he has the right to a fair trial.

“It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.”

https://decrypt.co,Vermont Drops Crypto Staking Case Against Coinbase,https://decrypt.co/309978/vermont-drops-crypto-staking-case-against-coinbase,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 04:29:06 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Crypto exchange Coinbase has scored another major victory in its legal battles, as U.S. state Vermont dropped its case against the exchange over its staking services.

Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, celebrated Vermont’s decision, calling it a sign of ""progress.""

“As we have always said: staking services are not securities,” he wrote on X. “We applaud Vermont for embracing progress and providing clarity for its citizens who own digital assets.”

Grewal went on to urge other states still pursuing similar actions to “take a page from Vermont’s playbook.”

The decision follows the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) decision to dismiss its own case against Coinbase just weeks earlier, pointing to a shift in the regulatory aspects for the crypto industry under President Donald Trump’s administration.

The formation of the new SEC task force to “provide guidance for the promulgation of rules regarding the regulation of crypto products and services” was cited as a pivotal factor in Vermont’s decision to rescind its case against Coinbase.

“In light of the dismissal of the Federal Action and likelihood of new federal regulatory guidance, the Division believes it would be most efficient and in the best interests of justice to rescind the pending Show Cause Order, without prejudice,” a Thursday filing reads.

The legal troubles between Coinbase and state regulators date back to June 2023, when Vermont, along with 10 other states, issued a ""show cause order"" accusing the exchange of violating securities laws by offering staking services without proper registration.

The 11 states argued that Coinbase's staking services qualified as unregistered securities, prompting legal action to halt the practice in certain jurisdictions.

A ""show cause order"" is a legal directive requiring a party to explain why a court should not take a specific action, in this case, halting Coinbase's staking services.

The legal actions were launched shortly after the SEC filed its own case against Coinbase, accusing the exchange of operating as an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency.

The SEC, under its new acting chair, Mark Uyeda, has adopted a more lenient stance on enforcement compared to its previous leadership under Gary Gensler.

Following the change, the SEC has dropped multiple lawsuits against crypto companies, notably Binance, Kraken, and OpenSea, among others.

Bitcoin’s sharp pullback is deepening as risk aversion grips global markets, yet a surprising policy shift from Washington could inject fresh momentum into the digital asset.

The U.S. government is reportedly seeking to expand its Bitcoin holdings, a move that—if executed—could alter the supply dynamics of an already tightening market.

The crypto is now trading near $81,600, down 25% from its January peak of $109,000, with selling pressure intensifying as liquidity conditions tighten, according to CoinGecko.

“Daily tariff swings and ongoing ETF outflows are keeping risk assets under pressure,” Vincent Liu, Chief Investment Officer at Kronos Research, told Decrypt. “Crypto investors need a real shift in macro conditions to turn sentiment around.”

Data from Glassnode shows that Bitcoin’s recent slide below $92,000 marked a key inflection point. The level corresponds with the Short-Term Holder cost basis—a critical support line that, when breached, often signals a shift in market sentiment.

Traders have taken note of what is missing from this drawdown: aggressive dip-buying. Unlike previous pullbacks that sparked renewed accumulation, this time, investors have largely stepped aside.

According to Glassnode’s Crypto Balance Distribution heatmap, demand has softened as external risks—including the Bybit hack and escalating U.S. tariff disputes—have driven capital preservation over opportunistic buying.

The broader macro backdrop isn’t helping risk sentiment either.

The ASX 200 has slipped into correction territory, now 10% off its February peak, while inflation concerns and U.S. Federal Reserve hawkishness have kept traditional markets under pressure.

Investors are also contending with fresh trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Still, headlines stemming from the White House are offering crypto investors some hope.

At a closed-door roundtable earlier this week, White House official Bo Hines told crypto industry leaders that the Trump administration intends to accumulate as much Bitcoin as possible, reinforcing the government’s commitment to its recent Bitcoin reserve announcement.

It also comes as Senator Cynthia Lummis reintroduces the Bitcoin Act, a bill that would require the U.S. government to acquire up to one million BTC—worth roughly $80 billion at current prices.

The White House has signaled support for enshrining the reserve into law, though it remains unclear how the purchases would be executed beyond what’s already been announced.

Administration officials insist acquisitions will be ""budget neutral,"" potentially relying on revalued gold certificates at the Federal Reserve to finance the plan.

If Washington moves forward with large-scale purchases, supply constraints may emerge, adding a fundamental catalyst for future price appreciation.

“Bitcoin’s futures remain in contango, suggesting relative strength in Bitcoin amid broader market uncertainty,” Alexia Theodorou, Kraken’s head of derivatives, told Decrypt in an emailed statement.

“The rising Bitcoin dominance ratio further indicates that some investors may be rotating capital out of altcoins and into Bitcoin as a safe haven,” he added.

Still, without renewed buying interest, Bitcoin could enter a prolonged consolidation or deeper correction before stabilizing, Glassnode wrote.

“Whether the two priced-in potential rate cuts will happen this year is a major macro concern,” Marco Lim, managing director at Solowin Holdings and founding partner of MaiCapital, told Decrypt.

“Although CPI came in better than expected, leading to a bounce in crypto and U.S. equities, most of Trump's impact on crypto seems to have already been priced in,” he added.",decrypt

A U.S. bankruptcy court has granted liquidators of defunct hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) permission to expand their claim against FTX to $1.53 billion, rejecting objections from FTX’s debtors that the move was untimely and unfair.

Judge John T. Dorsey of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware ruled on Thursday that 3AC’s liquidators had provided sufficient notice of their claim and were hampered in their investigation by FTX’s failure to share relevant records in a timely manner.

“The evidence suggests that the delay in filing the Amended Proof of Claim was, in large part, caused by the Debtors themselves,” Dorsey wrote in the decision.

FTX’s debtors, led by CEO John Ray III, meanwhile, objected to the amendment, arguing that it introduced new legal theories and significantly increased the claim’s size.

However, the court found that 3AC’s original filing had put FTX “on notice of the possibility of the later asserted claims,” dismissing the debtors’ objections.

Legal representatives for FTX debtors did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment.

3AC, once one of the most significant crypto hedge funds with over $3 billion in assets, collapsed in June 2022 following a sharp downturn in crypto markets.

The fund, founded by Kyle Davies and Su Zhu, had placed heavily leveraged bets on digital assets, including the TerraUSD stablecoin, which lost nearly all its value in May 2022.

The collapse of 3AC triggered a wave of liquidations across the crypto industry, affecting lenders such as Voyager Digital and BlockFi.

The fund entered court-ordered liquidation in the British Virgin Islands in late June 2022.

According to court filings, 3AC held $1.53 billion in assets on FTX as of June 12, 2022. Over the next two days, those assets were liquidated to cover a $1.3 billion debt owed to FTX, court documents show.

3AC’s liquidators initially filed a $120 million claim in FTX’s bankruptcy case in June 2023, but later expanded it, alleging claims including breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and breach of fiduciary duty.

The ruling comes 15 months after 3AC’s liquidators also secured a worldwide freeze on $1.4 billion in assets tied to the fund’s co-founders.

The December 2023 order, issued by a British Virgin Islands court, blocks Zhu, Davies, and Davies’ wife, Kelly Chen, from accessing funds while claims against them are pursued.

Liquidators argue the founders should be held accountable for allegedly deepening 3AC’s financial woes in the weeks before its collapse.",decrypt

Google has joined OpenAI in urging President Donald Trump’s administration to ease restrictions on AI training, particularly around the use of copyrighted materials.

Both tech giants submitted policy proposals on Thursday, advocating for a more flexible approach to artificial intelligence regulations as the U.S. government prepares its ""AI Action Plan"" by mid-2025.

The proposals submitted by Google and OpenAI are in response to President Trump’s new focus on artificial intelligence regulation, following his revocation of the previous administration's AI executive order in January 2025.

OpenAI and Google argue that loosening intellectual property barriers is essential to fostering innovation and maintaining U.S. leadership in AI development.

“Fair use and text-and-data mining exceptions” are critical for continued AI research, Google said, noting how strict copyright policies could hinder progress in artificial intelligence fields, including healthcare, scientific discovery, and economic development.

In its proposal, Google welcomed the Trump administration’s focus on artificial intelligence, saying the goal of developing a plan to “sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance” is crucial for U.S. leadership.

In January, Trump unveiled a $500 billion Stargate Project, aimed at strengthening U.S. AI infrastructure, which includes OpenAI among major contributors, alongside other tech giants like Microsoft and Oracle.

The call for relaxed copyright laws comes as both Google and OpenAI face numerous lawsuits over the use of copyrighted material in training their artificial intelligence models.

OpenAI, for example, is currently embroiled in several high-profile lawsuits filed by authors and publishers accusing the company of using their copyrighted works without permission.

Authors like Sarah Silverman and George R. R. Martin, along with other well-known figures, have joined forces to challenge OpenAI’s use of their writings in training models like ChatGPT.

Similarly, Google has faced accusations of using copyrighted content to train its AI models, including its AI-powered tools like YouTube's music recommendation system, which was shelved due to copyright concerns.

Apart from copyright issues, both companies raised concerns about the fragmented state-level regulations that currently govern AI in the U.S.

With more than 780 AI-related bills being considered at the state level, Google warned that the lack of a unified federal approach could create compliance chaos and stifle innovation.

Google has called for a cohesive federal policy that sets a clear framework for artificial intelligence development, so that companies can operate across state lines without facing conflicting regulations.

“While America currently leads the world in AI—and is home to the most capable and widely adopted artificial intelligence models and tools—our lead is not assured,” Google warned, quoting Vice President Vance’s remarks at the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit in Paris, France.

Trump’s new executive order prioritizes maintaining U.S. global dominance in artificial intelligence and mandates that a comprehensive “AI Action Plan” be presented to the president within 180 days.

As someone who plays Apex Legends religiously, the idea of an AI-powered coach is tempting—especially when coaching services can be costly.

If a free chatbot can help me rack up more wins, I’m all in. For me and millions of other gamers on Xbox, a new Copilot feature is promising to lift our game.

During an episode of the Official Xbox Podcast, Xbox Corporate Vice President of Gaming AI Fatima Kardar revealed that Microsoft’s AI assistant Copilot would be coming to the platform.

The move is intended to save players time downloading and updating games and help them improve at the games they play, she said.

“Gaming is the only form of entertainment where you can get stuck,” Kardar said in a podcast. “It’s not just about AI showing up to help you, it’s about AI showing up at the right moment.”

Xbox parent company Microsoft has incorporated artificial intelligence into many of its products through its Copilot AI.

In April 2024, Microsoft began testing AI as a virtual assistant for customer support. Microsoft has also leveraged AI to give game developers the tools to craft in-game dialogue and quests.

Though, not all gamers are excited about Microsoft bringing generative AI to Xbox.

Forced and nobody wants this sir. Had the pleasure of meeting you in 2015, you are a brilliant man. I just think you don’t understand gamers, what they want, or where the industry is going. Good luck — Timdog (@SuperTimdog) March 13, 2025

No thanks. I don't want or need AI to do something I can do very easily and quickly myself. — Matt 🎮 (@Mattsmash_) March 13, 2025

While a specific date has not been set, the Xbox copilot feature will first become available on mobile devices, Kardar said.

“You're having a companion experience, even if you're playing on your console or if you're playing somewhere else,” she said.

Your experience shows up on mobile, and people are starting to get used to two devices or two screens at the same time,” she said. “The Xbox is not about a device. An Xbox is about me, the person, and my companion should go everywhere with me.”

Kardar added that Xbox is looking to enhance player engagement through AI-driven features and more immersive experiences.

“Copilot in the context of Xbox has to be about gameplay. It must be personalized to how you like to play—helping you progress in gaming, be your companion, and connect you with families and communities,” she said.

“AI will be there—you can chat with it, and it can trash talk you if that’s what you need. But really, AI could bring people together and tell you when your friends are active,” Kardar added.

Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Decrypt.

US Bankruptcy Court allowed Three Arrows Capital’s liquidators to increase their FTX claim from $120 million to $1.53 billion

The expanded claim includes allegations of breach of contract, fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment

Judge Dorsey ruled in favor of 3AC, attributing delays to FTX’s failure to provide necessary documents promptly

3AC, once a major crypto hedge fund with over $3 billion in assets, collapsed in June 2022 after the crypto market downturn

This ruling adds to the ongoing saga involving Sam Bankman-Fried, who is currently seeking a pardon from President Trump

The US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware has granted a game-changing motion in the crypto world.

Three Arrows Capital (3AC) liquidators can now expand their claim against FTX from $120 million to $1.53 billion.

This ruling marks a key development in the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings. Judge John T. Dorsey approved the motion filed by 3AC’s joint liquidators, Russell Crumpler and Christopher Farmer.

The liquidators originally filed their proof of claim in June 2023. At that time, they sought to recover funds related to a $120 million loan allegedly owed by 3AC to FTX.

Further investigation revealed much more extensive dealings between the companies. The liquidators discovered that just two weeks before 3AC entered liquidation, about $1.53 billion of 3AC’s assets on the FTX platform were liquidated.

These assets were used to satisfy $1.3 billion in liabilities to FTX. This finding led the liquidators to expand their claim against the bankrupt crypto exchange.

The amended filing includes several new allegations against FTX. These include breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment.

The court documents highlight the many challenges faced by the liquidators. They struggled with a lack of proper records from 3AC and minimal cooperation from founders Kyle Davies and Su Zhu.

Getting key documents was also a problem. Much of the important information only became available in late 2023 and early 2024, after FTX had filed for bankruptcy in November 2022.

FTX Objections

FTX objected to the motion to amend the claim. They argued it was filed too late and expanded the scope beyond what was allowed in the bankruptcy process.

The exchange claimed the original proof of claim did not give enough notice about the nature or amount of the new claims. However, Judge Dorsey dismissed these objections.

The court sided with 3AC’s liquidators and approved the expanded claim. Judge Dorsey found that much of the delay in filing was due to FTX not providing necessary documents promptly.

“Having considered all the evidence presented, I find that the balance of the equities is in favor of allowing the Amended POC,” wrote Judge Dorsey in his decision. He also noted that “the delay in filing the Amended Proof of Claim was, in large part, caused by the Debtors themselves.”

Three Arrows Capital was once one of the biggest crypto hedge funds. It managed over $3 billion in assets before its collapse in June 2022.

The fund’s downfall came after a sharp crypto market drop. 3AC had placed heavily leveraged bets on digital assets, including the TerraUSD stablecoin, which crashed in May 2022.

3AC Collapse

The collapse of 3AC sent shockwaves through the crypto industry. It triggered a wave of liquidations affecting lenders such as Voyager Digital and BlockFi.

According to court filings, 3AC held $1.53 billion in assets on FTX as of June 12, 2022. Over the next two days, those assets were liquidated to cover a $1.3 billion debt to FTX.

This latest ruling adds another layer to the complex FTX bankruptcy saga. The exchange collapsed amid allegations of fraud and mismanagement under former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.

Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried is pursuing a different path. He’s reportedly trying to secure a pardon from President Donald Trump.

To boost his chances, Bankman-Fried has been aligning himself with right-wing figures. He recently appeared on Tucker Carlson’s show and has consulted with a lawyer linked to Trump.

Despite Trump’s history of granting pardons, many remain doubtful. Bankman-Fried’s lack of support within the crypto community could hurt his chances of receiving presidential clemency.

The ruling on 3AC’s expanded claim comes 15 months after another key development. In December 2023, 3AC’s liquidators secured a worldwide freeze on $1.4 billion in assets tied to the fund’s co-founders.

This order, issued by a British Virgin Islands court, blocks Zhu, Davies, and Davies’ wife, Kelly Chen, from accessing funds. The freeze remains in place while claims against them are pursued.

The liquidators argue that the founders should be held accountable. They claim the founders made decisions that worsened 3AC’s financial troubles in the weeks before its collapse.

Su Zhu, one of 3AC’s co-founders, was arrested in Singapore in September 2023. The arrest occurred at Changi Airport as Zhu attempted to leave the country following a committal order by Singapore courts.",blockonomi

XRP has been trading below EMA ribbons for 37 days, a pattern that historically precedes price rallies

Analyst Steph predicts a potential price reversal soon, with a key breakout level at $2.35

Negative funding rates and many traders shorting XRP could lead to a “short squeeze” and accelerate price growth

XRP is currently trading at $2.25, up by more than one percent in the last 24 hours

The cryptocurrency is stuck in a sideways range between support and resistance zones of $2.25-$2.30

XRP is showing signs of a potential price reversal according to market analyst Steph. In a recent X post, the analyst shared detailed insights about XRP’s current market position and its possible price movement in the coming weeks.

THE FINAL COUNTDOWN HAS STARTED FOR #XRP.. pic.twitter.com/ndaIDpb995 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) March 12, 2025

XRP has been trading below the exponential moving average (EMA) ribbons for 37 days since early February. This technical indicator is important for traders who use EMA ribbons to spot market trends.

When a cryptocurrency trades below these ribbons, it shows bearish momentum. This is the case with XRP right now.

Steph pointed out that the last time XRP traded below the ribbons was in October 2024. During that period, XRP stayed in the bearish zone for 35 days before breaking through.

That breakthrough led to a major price rally. XRP jumped from around $0.50 to over $3 before the current correction began.

The analyst looked at other times when XRP dipped below the EMA ribbons. In April 2024, XRP spent 90 days below the ribbons before seeing a 43% price rally.

Another example happened in August 2023. XRP stayed below the ribbons for 64 days, then rose by 47% after breaking through.

Based on these patterns, Steph believes XRP might be close to a similar breakout. The worst-case scenario would be spending 90 days below the EMA ribbons.

A more moderate case would be 64 days. With XRP already at 37 days below the ribbons, Steph sees reason for optimism about a possible price reversal soon.

The analyst identified $2.35 as a key price level to watch. If XRP breaks above this mark with a daily close, it could trigger a major rally.

Based on previous movements, Steph expects at least a 40% rally, with potential for even higher gains.

Another factor that could boost XRP’s price is the current funding rates. Steph noted that these rates are very negative, with many traders shorting XRP.

“This creates a lot of liquidity above us with very little below. Price typically targets the highest liquidity, so a massive short squeeze is likely to occur soon,” Steph explained.

A short squeeze happens when traders who bet against an asset are forced to buy it back at higher prices. This could accelerate XRP’s price increase.

In the shorter term, XRP recently bounced from a support area to a resistance zone between $2.25 and $2.30. The price is now struggling at this level.

If XRP breaks above $2.30 and closes above this mark, it could move toward $2.50-$2.60. The next major resistance area is between $2.65 and $2.80.

Currently, XRP is trading sideways, creating opportunities for traders to buy at support and sell at resistance. A confirmed breakout above resistance could lead to short-term gains.

At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.25, up by more than one percent in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is down by more than two percent, trading at $81,000.",blockonomi

World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a project backed by Donald Trump, completed its token sale, raising between $550-590 million

Initial fundraising fell short at $11 million against a $300 million target, but demand later surged

All purchased WLFI tokens remain locked for 12 months and serve only as governance tokens

The project’s portfolio has already suffered market-related losses of $110 million as of March 10

Tron founder Justin Sun was credited as a major investor who helped drive the project’s success

World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto project associated with President Donald Trump’s family, has successfully completed its token sale.

The fundraising effort concluded with approximately $550 million raised according to the project’s official website, though some reports place the final figure closer to $590 million.

The public sale of WLFI’s governance token began in October 2024. The project initially set an ambitious target of $300 million. This would be raised by offering 20 billion tokens priced at $0.015 each.

Only whitelisted investors who completed Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) verifications could participate in the sale. This restriction limited the pool of potential buyers to accredited investors.

The initial phase of the token sale fell well short of expectations. It generated only $11 million through the distribution of 766 million tokens. The team responded by lowering their funding goal to $30 million to better match market interest.

The first phase concluded on January 20, with 20% of the total token supply distributed. During this period, Tron founder Justin Sun emerged as one of the largest investors in the project. Sun reportedly invested $30 million in November 2024 and later increased his investment.

Interest in the project surged after the initial phase. The team made an additional 5 billion WLFI tokens available on January 20. These were priced higher at $0.05 per token.

By March 13, approximately 99% of these additional tokens had been sold. This reflected a major increase in demand for the project’s tokens over the course of the sale.

Speaking at Consensus 2025 in Hong Kong, WLFI co-founder Zak Folkman credited Justin Sun with the project’s ultimate success.

“When we were launching this project, it was a very heated time,” Folkman said during the event. “There was a lot of scrutiny on our project due to who was involved.”

Folkman noted that traditional crypto venture capital firms would not invest in the token. “[Sun] saw that regardless of the outcome, this project is a monumental move forward for the entire crypto community,” he added during the Consensus panel.

All purchased WLFI tokens will remain locked for 12 months following the sale. This restriction prevents any immediate trading activity on the tokens.

WLFI serves exclusively as a governance token within the World Liberty Financial Protocol. It grants holders the ability to submit and vote on proposals. The token does not confer ownership, financial returns, or economic benefits.

The project has made it clear that the token is neither a security nor a digital currency. It cannot be used for transactions or services. Its value remains independent of WLFI’s operational success.

The token cannot currently be transferred or publicly sold on exchanges. No date has been set for an exchange listing, leaving investors without a clear timeline for liquidity.

Despite the successful fundraising, the project has already experienced financial setbacks. As of March 10, total losses linked to the Trump-backed initiative had reached $110 million.

The project had allocated $336 million to acquire nine different cryptocurrency assets. Market downturns reduced the portfolio’s value to $226 million. Ethereum (ETH) represented 65% of the holdings and recorded the largest decline.

WLFI purchased ETH at an average price of $3,240 per token. With the price around $1,896 at the time of reporting, the portfolio suffered major devaluation. Other digital assets within the portfolio also incurred losses.

According to data from ICODrops, WLFI’s raise of $550-590 million would place it among the top ten largest token sales of all time. The current record holder is EOS, which raised $4.21 billion.",blockonomi

Dogecoin price is testing the 100-week Simple Moving Average (SMA), historically a critical level for trend reversals

New Dogecoin wallet addresses have doubled from 16,400 to 34,600 in the past month despite price declines

Analyst Ali Martinez predicts a potential 11,811% surge to $20 if key support at $0.16 holds

Technical analysis shows Dogecoin has been trending in an ascending channel since 2015

The cryptocurrency is up 1.3% over the past year despite recent volatility and monthly losses of 33.8%

Dogecoin has been on a roller coaster ride in recent weeks. The popular meme cryptocurrency has shown mixed performance with a slight uptick of 1% in the last 24 hours but remains down 17.2% for the week and 33.8% over the past month.

Despite this recent volatility, DOGE has managed to maintain a 1.3% increase over the past year. This resilience has caught the attention of several analysts who are now studying technical indicators to predict future price movements.

The 100-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) has emerged as a critical level for Dogecoin. According to Trader Tardigrade, a well-known analyst on X, DOGE has historically entered strong bullish phases after breaking above this long-term resistance level.

Looking at past market cycles, a clear pattern emerges. During the 2017-2018 bull run, Dogecoin remained below the 100-week SMA before breaking out and triggering a rally.

A similar pattern occurred during the 2020-2021 bull market. Dogecoin surged after crossing above the 100-week SMA and later used this level as support during retracements.

Currently, DOGE is once again testing this key level. If history repeats itself, a successful breakout could push Dogecoin toward $2.80, according to Trader Tardigrade’s analysis.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is providing additional bullish signals. Charts show that DOGE has entered the oversold zone, a condition that has marked price bottoms before past uptrends.

This technical setup follows a pattern where DOGE forms a low before creating a lower low while the RSI remains oversold. Historically, this pattern has preceded bullish reversals in the Dogecoin price.

Another analyst, CryptoElites, points to a symmetrical triangle breakout pattern in Dogecoin’s price action. Based on this formation, DOGE could potentially reach $5 if market momentum remains strong and macroeconomic conditions stay favorable.

On-chain data reveals growing adoption despite recent price declines. Glassnode data shows that new DOGE wallet addresses have more than doubled in just one month, rising from 16,400 on February 8 to 34,600 by March 10.

This surge in network activity suggests increasing interest in Dogecoin even as prices have dropped. Historically, rising adoption has preceded bullish price action for the meme cryptocurrency.

Ali Martinez, another market analyst, has made an even more bullish prediction. He suggests that Dogecoin could surge by 11,811% to reach $20 if it maintains support at the crucial $0.16 level.

Martinez notes that Dogecoin has been trending within an ascending channel since 2015. The current price is near the lower boundary of this channel, which has served as support during past downturns.

If this support holds, Martinez believes DOGE could bounce to the mid or upper boundary of the ascending channel. These targets correspond to the 1.272 and 1.618 Fibonacci extension levels at $2.77 and $20, respectively.

The $20 prediction aligns with an earlier call from analyst Javon Marks, who insisted this target is realistic for the meme coin given the right market conditions.

As of March 13, 2025, Dogecoin is trading at around $0.17, up 2% since the start of the day. The cryptocurrency continues to hold above the critical $0.16 support level identified by analysts.

The doubling of new wallet addresses over the past month supports the case for growing adoption. This metric moved from 16,400 to 34,600 new wallets amid renewed interest in the Dogecoin ecosystem.

Technical indicators, network growth, and historical patterns all suggest Dogecoin may be positioning for a potential rally. However, the cryptocurrency must first overcome immediate resistance levels to confirm this bullish outlook.",blockonomi

US Bitcoin ETFs saw a $13.3 million inflow on March 12, breaking a seven-day outflow streak

Over $1.67 billion exited US spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in March overall

Despite a 25% BTC price drop in 2025, 95% of Bitcoin ETF investors continue to hold their investments

Total US Bitcoin ETF assets under management stand at $115 billion

Long-term Bitcoin holders added over 131,000 BTC to their wallets in the past month despite ETF outflows

US Bitcoin ETFs have broken their streak of outflows with a modest $13.3 million inflow on March 12. This comes as Bitcoin’s price inches closer to the $85,000 mark despite ongoing market uncertainties.

The inflow marks the end of a seven-day period of money leaving these investment vehicles. According to data from Farside Investors, spot Bitcoin ETFs had attracted $35.4 million worth of inflows spread across two days as of March 12.

March has been a challenging month for crypto ETFs overall. More than $1.67 billion exited US spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds during this period. The majority of this money came from Bitcoin ETFs, which saw $1.33 billion in outflows.

The recent $13.3 million inflow was contributed by three Bitcoin funds. These include BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), and the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF (BTC).

Trading volume for Bitcoin ETFs on March 12 reached $2.01 billion. This represents the lowest daily value since February 20, suggesting a possible slowdown in trading activity.

Ethereum ETFs have seen less investor interest during this period. They recorded inflows on just one occasion, bringing in $14.6 million on March 4. The funds that saw positive flows include the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH), Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW), Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH).

Market experts point to several factors behind the recent ETF outflows. These include broader market downturns, macroeconomic uncertainties, geopolitical tensions, and trade wars. Bearish investor sentiment has also played a role in the exodus of funds.

Some analysts believe that unmet expectations regarding President Donald Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve plan have added to the selling pressure. This lack of concrete implementation has left some investors disappointed.

Despite the recent outflows, the overall picture for Bitcoin ETF investors remains strong. Data from Bloomberg shows that a massive 95% of investors continue to hold their ETF investments despite the strong Bitcoin price correction of 25% since the start of 2025.

The Bloomberg data shows that BTC ETF inflows have declined slightly to $35 billion. This is down from the peak of $40 billion, but still represents over 95% of investor cash holding firm through the downturn.

Currently, US Bitcoin ETFs manage a total of $115 billion in assets under management. This highlights the resilience of both retail investors and institutional players who have invested in these products.

Big institutional players maintain substantial exposure to these investment vehicles. For example, Goldman Sachs reportedly has more than $1.5 billion invested in Bitcoin ETFs.

Since mid-February, there have been massive outflows in Bitcoin ETFs. Nearly $5 billion has left these funds from their peak value. Recent data shows total outflows on March 13 were $135 million, with only BlackRock’s IBIT seeing net inflows of $45.7 million.

While ETF investors show mixed sentiment, long-term Bitcoin holders appear to be taking advantage of the market dip. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, these investors have added over 131,000 BTC to their wallets in the past month alone.

Ki Young Ju, CEO of on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, commented on the current state of Bitcoin demand, noting that it appears “stuck” at present. Despite this sluggish activity, Ju emphasized that it is “too early to call it a bear market.”

Bitcoin was trading at $81,953 as of the most recent data, down 1.56% with daily trading volume dropping by 22% to under $30 billion. The Coinglass data shows that 24-hour liquidations have reached $75 million, of which $52 million comes from long positions being closed.",blockonomi

World Liberty Financial (WLFI), Donald Trump’s DeFi venture, purchased 541,242 SEI tokens for $100,000 USDC, pushing SEI’s price up by 7.3%.

WLFI has invested $21.6 million in various cryptocurrencies since late February, including Ethereum, Wrapped Bitcoin, Move, and SEI.

SEI hit its lowest price point since November 2023, reaching around $0.18 before showing signs of recovery.

Technical analysis shows SEI in a descending triangle pattern with potential for a breakout above the $0.20-$0.22 range.

WLFI has also partnered with Sui to explore development opportunities and build a strategic SUI reserve.

The price of SEI cryptocurrency has jumped 7.3% following news that World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi venture backed by Donald Trump, purchased 541,242 SEI tokens. The acquisition, valued at $100,000 USDC, came at an average price of $0.185 per token and has helped push SEI closer to the $0.20 mark.

This purchase occurs as SEI was testing a key demand zone around $0.18, which marked its lowest level since November 2023. The token had been trading in a descending structure for several months before this recent uptick in buying interest.

The investment has sparked fresh market activity for SEI. Daily trading volume increased by 17% to more than $127 million, showing renewed interest in the token. This surge in trading happened during a week when much of the broader crypto market faced corrections.

WLFI now holds approximately 1.089 million SEI tokens in total. The project has spent a combined $225,000 on these acquisitions. However, due to recent market movements, the current value of their SEI holdings has dipped slightly to $207,000.

Technical analysis of SEI shows the token positioning for a potential short-term breakout from its descending triangle pattern on hourly charts. If SEI can close above the $0.20-$0.22 range, this could confirm the start of a recovery wave.

The Elliott Wave count suggests SEI may be completing a corrective phase. The structure aligns with an extended W-X-Y-Z pattern, with wave Z potentially marking the cycle low at around $0.18. This region also corresponds with a key horizontal demand zone.

Key resistance levels to watch include $0.2035 as immediate resistance, $0.22 as a wave target, and $0.25 as a structural breakout level. Support remains at $0.175, with $0.15 serving as a critical level that could invalidate the bullish outlook if broken.

WLFI Buying Spree

Despite the Trump portfolio sitting on overall losses, WLFI has been on a crypto buying spree. The project has invested $21.6 million in various cryptocurrencies since late February. These investments include major assets such as Ethereum, Wrapped Bitcoin, and Move, in addition to SEI.

Just last week, the DeFi project invested $10 million each in Ethereum and Wrapped Bitcoin. These moves come as part of a broader strategy to build a diverse crypto portfolio.

In February, WLFI unveiled its new Macro Strategy Reserve initiative. This strategic move aims to strengthen its position in the cryptocurrency sector by diversifying holdings across various digital assets.

The reserve’s focus is on spreading investments to reduce the impact of market volatility. This approach seeks to ensure long-term stability and sustainability for the platform as the crypto landscape continues to evolve.

Beyond its SEI acquisition, WLFI has also formed a partnership with Sui to explore development opportunities. As part of this collaboration, the project will build a strategic SUI reserve.

Evang Cheng, a founding contributor to Sui, expressed optimism about the partnership. Cheng stated that combining Sui’s advanced technology with WLFI’s vision could transform how assets are stored and used globally.

The Fibonacci retracement analysis for SEI shows $0.32 as a major resistance level, which represents the 0.786 retracement level. This will likely serve as the ceiling for any relief rally in the near term.

Technical indicators show the RSI has been in oversold territory, suggesting selling exhaustion. A bullish divergence on the RSI could signal a shift in the prevailing trend.

For SEI to confirm a trend reversal, breaking above the descending trendline that has controlled price action for months will be crucial. In the one-hour timeframe, the structure suggests the early stages of an impulsive recovery may be forming.

This investment comes at a time when the Trump portfolio, which holds nine different crypto tokens valued at around $340 million, is currently sitting on a cumulative loss of approximately $124 million due to recent market fluctuations.",blockonomi

Cardano (ADA) has dropped over 40% in a week, stabilizing around $0.70 after a 5% decline on Thursday

Technical indicators show a bearish trend with a death cross formation as moving averages signal weakening momentum

Despite positive U.S. inflation data, fears of prolonged trade wars are putting pressure on crypto markets

ADA faces resistance at $0.7050 and $0.7750, with support at $0.65 and potential to test $0.50 if selling continues

Cardano underperformed other top cryptocurrencies like BNB and XRP, which have found support from positive news

Cardano’s price has been on a downward spiral in recent days. The cryptocurrency is now trading below the $0.72 mark after experiencing three consecutive days of losses.

The digital asset has faced strong selling pressure. This has resulted in a weekly decline of over 40%, making it one of the worst-performing cryptocurrencies among the top ten.

On Thursday, ADA dropped by another 5% before finding some stability around the $0.70 level. This price point is now serving as temporary support for the struggling cryptocurrency.

Technical indicators are painting a bearish picture for Cardano. The price is trading below key moving averages, signaling that downward momentum remains strong.

A concerning development is the formation of a bearish death cross pattern. This occurs when short-term moving averages cross below longer-term ones, typically suggesting continued downward pressure.

The MACD indicator further confirms this negative outlook. The MACD line has crossed below the signal line, indicating increasing bearish momentum in the market.

Cardano’s troubles come despite positive inflation data from the United States. Both Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) readings have been favorable this week.

These inflation numbers have increased expectations for a delayed Federal Reserve rate hike. According to CME Group’s FedWatch tool, there’s now a 99% probability that the Fed will leave rates unchanged at its upcoming meeting on March 21.

However, rather than boosting crypto markets, these economic indicators have raised other concerns. Many traders fear that lower inflation could encourage the Trump administration to maintain or even increase tariffs on neighboring countries.

This trade war anxiety is reflected in prediction markets. Data from Polymarket shows that the odds of Trump lifting tariffs on Canada before May 2025 dropped by 18% on Thursday alone.

The broader market sentiment has turned cautious as a result. Many investors are reducing their exposure to risk assets like Cardano in anticipation of prolonged economic tensions.

Technical Analysis

Looking at price levels, Cardano faces immediate resistance around $0.7050. There is also a bearish trend line forming at this level on the hourly chart, adding to the challenge for bulls.

If ADA manages to break above this zone, the next key resistance would be at $0.7520. This represents the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent downward move from $0.8170 to $0.6495.

A more substantial barrier exists at $0.7750. Only a decisive close above this level could open the door for a stronger recovery toward the $0.80 region or potentially $0.85.

On the downside, immediate support rests at $0.6880. If this level fails to hold, ADA could retest the recent low around $0.65, with further support at $0.635 and $0.62.

In a worst-case scenario, analysts suggest Cardano could test the $0.50 level. This price point was last seen in late 2023 and would represent a major setback for the cryptocurrency.

Cardano’s performance stands in contrast to some other major cryptocurrencies. Binance Coin (BNB) has maintained stability above $573, even gaining slightly on rumors that the Trump family is considering acquiring Binance.

Similarly, XRP has found support above $2.20. It received a boost from news about securing a regulatory license to offer crypto payment services for businesses in Dubai.

Without such positive catalysts, Cardano has struggled to attract buyers. The lack of project-specific good news has left ADA vulnerable to broader market pressures and technical selling.

There is also concern about potential funding issues for crypto initiatives. Speculation suggests that Trump might face challenges obtaining congressional approval for the proposed crypto strategic reserve, adding another layer of uncertainty for Cardano investors.",blockonomi

Ethereum has lost major support levels ($3,200 and $2,200), dropping over 33% in three weeks to trade around $1,891

ETH spot ETFs are experiencing cash outflows, with approximately $73 million withdrawn on Thursday alone

Despite price struggles, Ethereum remains the leading blockchain in DeFi with $45 billion TVL

Developers are working on the upcoming Pectra upgrade with a testnet launch planned for mid-April 2025

ETH currently faces resistance at $1,900-1,950 levels but found support above $1,760

Ethereum has experienced a steep decline in recent weeks, diverging from Bitcoin’s upward trajectory as the second-largest cryptocurrency continues to face downward pressure. While Bitcoin follows gold’s rise, Ethereum has been caught in a persistent downtrend, breaking key support levels and concerning investors.

The price drop began following Donald Trump’s second inauguration. Ethereum has lost two crucial support levels at $3,200 and $2,200. Over the past three weeks, ETH has plummeted more than 33%, trading near $1,891 as of Friday, March 14.

This decline comes amid broader financial market pressure. Major stock indexes including the S&P 500 have been sliding due to uncertainty from U.S. tariff wars. These conditions have pushed long-term investors toward safer assets like gold and stablecoins.

On-chain data from Glassnode points to growing fear among long-term Ethereum holders. This sentiment is reflected in the consistent cash outflows from U.S. spot Ether ETFs, which have seen withdrawals for three straight weeks. Thursday alone saw net outflows of approximately $73 million.

From a technical standpoint, ETH appears oversold compared to Bitcoin. Ethereum has struggled to break the $4,000 resistance level over the past year and now faces critical support tests. To avoid further decline toward $1,500, ETH must hold its current support level.

The ETH/BTC pair is testing a crucial support level around 0.023. If this level holds, it could help restore bullish sentiment in the near future. Technical indicators suggest the possibility of a recovery if key levels can be maintained.

Recent price action shows Ethereum forming a base above $1,760 and starting a recovery wave. The price managed to clear several resistance levels including $1,820 and $1,850. Bulls pushed the price above $1,920 temporarily, surpassing the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the downward movement from $2,150 to $1,752.

However, selling pressure remains strong near the $1,950 resistance zone. Ethereum currently trades below $1,920 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. A short-term bearish trend line has formed with resistance at $1,900 on the hourly chart.

The next key resistance sits near $1,950, which coincides with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. If Ethereum can break above this, the next targets would be $1,990 and potentially $2,050. Clearing these levels could open the path toward $2,120 or even $2,250.

On the downside, Ethereum faces initial support near $1,845. The first major support level sits at $1,800, with additional support at $1,750. A break below these levels could push the price toward $1,720 or even $1,650 in the near term.

Fundamentals still Strong

Despite price struggles, Ethereum’s fundamentals remain strong. It continues to dominate the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector with approximately $45 billion in total value locked (TVL). The Ethereum ecosystem also supports a stablecoin market cap exceeding $123 billion.

Competition from other layer-one blockchains like Solana is growing. To maintain its edge, Ethereum developers are actively working on the upcoming Pectra upgrade. Ethereum Foundation core developer Tim Beiko announced that the third testnet, Hoodi, will launch by mid-April 2025 to finalize preparations for this upgrade.

For Ethereum to reverse its downward trend, it must overcome resistance at $1,900 and $1,950. A clear move above these levels could trigger a decent increase and restore market confidence in ETH’s price trajectory.",blockonomi

Democrat lawmaker Gerald Connolly calls on Treasury to stop Trump’s crypto reserve plans

Connolly cites conflict of interest with Trump’s crypto holdings and World Liberty Financial stake

White House claims Digital Asset Stockpile will only use forfeited cryptocurrency

Trump’s $TRUMP memecoin has reportedly generated $100 million in trading fees

Critics, including a Federal Reserve official, have called the reserve plan “the dumbest idea ever”

A Democrat lawmaker has demanded the US Treasury prevent the Trump administration from pursuing plans to create a strategic cryptocurrency reserve.

Representative Gerald E. Connolly of Virginia has sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urging him to “cease all attempts” to create the reserve.

In his March 13 letter, Connolly expressed concerns about President Trump’s potential conflicts of interest. He cited the president’s connections to crypto ventures and alleged that the reserve would enrich Trump and his donors rather than benefit the American people.

“Such a reserve provides no discernible benefit to the American people but would enrich the President and his donors,” wrote Connolly in the letter.

The Trump administration has announced two separate cryptocurrency initiatives. The Digital Asset Stockpile will hold cryptocurrency that has been seized from criminal enterprises. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will make acquisitions through methods the White House claims are budget-neutral.

President Trump announced on March 2 via Truth Social that the cryptocurrency reserve would include five digital assets: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). This announcement was part of his January 23 Executive Order titled “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology.”

Reserve Called “Dumbest Idea Ever”

Connolly referenced a Federal Reserve official who described the plan as “the dumbest idea ever.” The lawmaker argued that no strategic need exists for investing in what he called “the volatile and speculative cryptocurrency market.”

“A digital currency reserve would be nothing more than a highly speculative taxpayer-backed hedge to provide bitcoin speculators the assurance that when the crash comes, the State will deploy this fund to rescue it,”

Connolly stated in his letter.

The congressman noted that the United States has historically created reserves of certain commodities of strategic value, such as petroleum, through acts of Congress and usually during times of economic crisis.

Trump’s Crypto Connections Questioned

In his letter, Connolly highlighted several connections between Trump and cryptocurrency ventures. He pointed to the Trump Organization’s ownership in World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture that “aspires to be a sort of digital asset bank.”

The lawmaker also mentioned that both Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. have promoted cryptocurrencies. Donald Trump Jr. has described World Liberty Financial as “the future of finance.”

Connolly also raised concerns about the $TRUMP memecoin launched on January 17. He called it a “money grab” that has allowed Trump-linked entities to cash in on over $100 million worth of trading fees.

“In a set up that one cryptocurrency expert called ‘completely abnormal,’ two LLCs affiliated with the Trump organization own the vast majority of the coins,” Connolly wrote.

Administration Officials’ Crypto Ties

The letter also mentioned cryptocurrency connections of Trump administration officials. This includes David Sacks, the administration’s artificial intelligence and crypto czar, who remains a partner at Craft Ventures, which invests in a cryptocurrency index fund manager.

Elon Musk, Trump’s largest campaign donor, was also mentioned as holding crypto assets. Connolly noted that Musk named the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) after Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency Musk has promoted.

“The activities of DOGE throughout the federal government give Mr. Musk influence over the agencies that regulate the cryptocurrency industry,” Connolly wrote.

Request for Documents and Information

Connolly has requested a briefing for the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. He also asked for several documents by March 27, including:

Communications regarding the creation of a strategic cryptocurrency reserve A list of steps taken to address conflicts of interest A list of companies connected to the cryptocurrency industry in which Treasury officials have interests Information on safeguards against government officials benefiting from the reserve Documents related to the selection criteria for digital assets in the reserve

Similar Criticisms from Other Democrats

Connolly is not the first Democrat to criticize Trump’s cryptocurrency endeavors. Representative Maxine Waters, a Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, previously criticized Trump’s memecoin on January 20, comparing it to a “rug pull” and claiming the launch represented the “worst of crypto.”

The White House has defended its plans, stating that the Digital Asset Stockpile will only hold cryptocurrency already forfeited from criminal enterprises, while the Bitcoin reserve will only make acquisitions through budget-neutral strategies that won’t impact taxpayers.

Trump had not yet responded directly to Connolly’s letter as of the time of publication.",blockonomi

Bitcoin fell below $82,000, dropping nearly 5% this week amid Trump’s tariff decisions

Trade war escalation has created a risk-off sentiment with investors moving to safer assets like gold

Russia reportedly using crypto in oil trades with China and India to bypass Western sanctions

Technical analysis shows Bitcoin found support at $78,000 and started a recovery above $80,500

Upcoming Federal Reserve meeting on March 18-19 adding to market caution

Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced more downward trend this week, falling below the $82,000 mark as global economic tensions rise due to President Trump’s recent tariff decisions.

The cryptocurrency market is feeling the pressure from broader economic concerns, though technical indicators suggest potential recovery.

Bitcoin extended its losses on Friday, trading at $81,914.20 as of 03:08 ET (07:08 GMT), representing a 1.6% decline. The world’s largest cryptocurrency is set to register a weekly loss of nearly 5%.

The drop comes as President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 200% tariff on European alcohol imports. This move was in response to the European Union’s planned levies on American whiskey.

Trump is also expected to implement worldwide reciprocal tariffs starting April 2. These developments have raised fears about a potential U.S. recession, causing investors to pull back from speculative assets like cryptocurrencies.

The market sentiment has shifted toward safer investments during this period of uncertainty. Gold prices reached record highs on Friday, highlighting the current risk-averse mood among investors.

Fed Meeting

Adding to market caution is the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting scheduled for March 18-19. The Fed is widely expected to maintain current interest rates as it adopts a wait-and-see approach amid economic uncertainties.

The central bank faces a complex situation as ongoing trade disputes could potentially increase inflationary pressures. This complicates the economic outlook and monetary policy decisions.

Meanwhile, according to a Reuters report published Friday, Russia is increasingly turning to cryptocurrencies for oil transactions with China and India. This strategy aims to bypass Western sanctions.

Russian oil companies are reportedly using Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether (USDT) to convert yuan and rupees into rubles. While traditional currencies still dominate these trades, crypto transactions have grown to tens of millions of dollars monthly.

Technical Analysis

On the technical front, Bitcoin has shown some resilience by maintaining support above the $78,000 level. The cryptocurrency has started a recovery wave above the $80,500 resistance level.

Bulls pushed the price above $82,000 briefly, but faced resistance near the $84,000 mark. Bitcoin reached a high of $84,200 before correcting some gains.

The price is currently trading above $81,200 and the 100-hour Simple Moving Average. Immediate resistance is near $82,450, with key resistance levels at $84,000 and $85,000.

If Bitcoin closes above the $85,000 resistance, it could climb further to test $86,500 or even reach the $88,000 level. More gains might push the price toward $96,200.

However, if Bitcoin fails to rise above $82,450, it could face another decline. Immediate support lies near $80,500, with major support at $79,600.

Additional support levels include $78,500 and $77,000, with the main support positioned at $76,500. The cryptocurrency’s price action in the coming days will likely be influenced by both technical factors and broader economic developments.",blockonomi

Solana’s price dropped below $125 amid FTX and Alameda Research liquidating assets worth millions

Over 8 million SOL tokens (~$1 billion) have been unstaked since November 2023

A major governance proposal to cut SOL inflation by up to 80% failed to pass

Technical analysis shows SOL facing resistance at $131 with support potentially around $112

5.5 million SOL tokens (~$693 million) remain under FTX/Alameda control, posing continued sell pressure

Solana’s price has fallen below the $125 mark as FTX and Alameda Research continue liquidating assets to repay creditors. The recent price drop coincides with large transactions from wallets linked to these entities.

On March 13, SOL experienced a 5% pullback following a major transfer from Alameda Research. According to Arkham Intelligence, Alameda unstaked over $23 million worth of SOL tokens, distributing them across 38 different addresses.

ARKHAM ALERT: ALAMEDA ADDRESS JUST UNSTAKED $23M SOL TO 38 NEW ADDRESSES An FTX/Alameda Staking address received $22.9M SOL from a staking address unlock and has just distributed these funds to 37 addresses that have previously received SOL from this address. These addresses… pic.twitter.com/9eWuKAY4na — Arkham (@arkham) March 12, 2025

This action has added to the selling pressure on SOL. Market participants have grown cautious as they watch these funds potentially entering exchanges.

The distribution of tokens to multiple addresses suggests preparations for market sales. This pattern has created hesitation among buyers who fear further price drops.

Ongoing Liquidation History

This isn’t the first time FTX liquidations have affected Solana’s price. Since November 2023, FTX and Alameda Research have unstaked approximately 8 million SOL tokens valued at nearly $1 billion.

Many of these tokens have already been sold through major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. These sales have put steady downward pressure on Solana’s price over recent months.

A key unstaking event happened in early March. FTX unlocked over 3 million SOL tokens worth approximately $432 million at that time.

While other cryptocurrencies showed positive momentum, Solana’s price remained subdued. This lag compared to other altcoins like XRP and ADA highlights the impact of FTX’s continuous liquidations.

Future Outlook Remains Bearish

The market remains concerned about the 5.5 million SOL tokens (valued around $693 million) still under FTX and Alameda control. These assets could be unstaked or sold at any time.

This overhanging supply creates a cloud over Solana’s price recovery chances. Even with improving broader market conditions, Solana may struggle to gain upward momentum.

Recent positive economic indicators like cooling U.S. inflation data have failed to lift SOL prices. The shadow of potential further selling continues to dampen buyer enthusiasm.

Traders appear unwilling to accumulate Solana while this risk remains. Many are waiting for clarity on when the FTX liquidation process might conclude.

Technical Signals Point to Weakness

From a technical perspective, Solana’s price action shows weakness. After briefly reclaiming the $131 level, SOL quickly reversed as bears took control.

The fall below the $125 support level is a concerning signal for traders. This price point is now viewed as a critical level for SOL’s future direction.

Some analysts point to an Elliott Wave pattern suggesting a potential reversal around $112. This technical formation could provide temporary support if reached.

According to crypto analyst CryptoUB, the $127 level has seen multiple rejections. This level now serves as a key decision point for trading strategies.

Another market observer, CW8900, noted a strong sell wall around $180. However, a buy wall at current prices may provide some support and prevent further sharp declines.

Governance Proposal Rejection

Separate from the price action, a major governance proposal for Solana recently failed to pass. The proposal, known as SIMD-228, aimed to change Solana’s inflation system.

The proposal would have reduced inflation by up to 80% according to some estimates. It would have replaced the fixed inflation schedule with a dynamic model based on staking participation.

Despite gathering the largest voter turnout in crypto governance history, the proposal fell short. It received 43.6% votes in favor, below the required 66.67% threshold.

Solana’s current inflation rate stands at 4.66%. The existing model starts at 8% annually and decreases by 15% each year until reaching 1.5%.

The high inflation rate can increase selling pressure on SOL tokens. This adds another factor beyond FTX liquidations that may affect price performance.

Despite the proposal’s failure, Multicoin Capital co-founder Tushar Jain called it a victory for Solana’s governance process. The vote demonstrated high community engagement with around 74% of the staked supply participating.

Market Response

The price of SOL showed limited reaction to the governance vote results. The token dipped just 1.5% following the announcement of the proposal’s failure.

However, Solana has seen a steep decline of nearly 60% over the past two months. This drop coincided with the end of the memecoin trading boom on the network.

Network revenue has also dropped by over 90% as memecoin activity has slowed. This reduction in network activity adds another headwind to Solana’s price recovery.

Given the mix of factors affecting SOL, market participants remain cautious. The combination of FTX liquidations, high inflation, and decreased network activity creates challenging conditions for price growth.",blockonomi

Ark Invest purchased 997 Bitcoin worth $80 million from Coinbase on March 13, 2025

The transaction was split into two parts: 498 BTC first, followed by 499 BTC four hours later

Ark also bought additional Coinbase shares worth $5.2 million for its ARK Innovation ETF

Coinbase stock has dropped 31% year-to-date, closing at $177.49 after a 7.43% dip

Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest has made major moves in the crypto market, purchasing 997 Bitcoin worth $80 million and adding $5.2 million in Coinbase shares to its portfolio. The transactions highlight the investment firm’s ongoing commitment to digital assets despite market volatility.

Ark Invest acquired the Bitcoin through Coinbase on March 13, 2025, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. The purchase was executed in two separate transactions. The first brought in 498 BTC, followed by a second transfer of 499 BTC approximately four hours later.

This Bitcoin acquisition comes at a time when institutional investors remain active in the cryptocurrency space. Many large investors are maintaining positions in Bitcoin ETFs despite recent market fluctuations.

In addition to the Bitcoin purchase, Ark Invest bought 29,353 Coinbase shares for its ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK). These shares were worth about $5.2 million based on Thursday’s closing price.

The firm also purchased 143,855 Robinhood shares worth $5.18 million for the same fund. Both Coinbase and Robinhood have seen their stock prices decline this year.

Coinbase’s stock closed down 7.43% at $177.49 on Thursday. The crypto exchange’s stock has dropped 31% year-to-date according to Google Finance data.

Robinhood’s stock fell 7.45% to close at $36.02 on Thursday. This marks an 8.6% decline since the beginning of 2025.

The latest Coinbase share purchase follows earlier acquisitions by Ark Invest. On Monday, the firm bought 52,753 Coinbase shares worth about $9.4 million for the ARKK ETF.

Ark also acquired 11,605 Coinbase shares worth approximately $2.1 million for its Ark Fintech Innovation ETF. These purchases reflect Ark’s strategy of adjusting its portfolio.

Cathie Wood stated last year that Ark aims to keep individual stock holdings below 10% of a fund’s portfolio. As of Thursday, Coinbase stock made up 7.14% of the ARKK fund.

This makes Coinbase the third-largest holding within the ETF. The position shows Ark’s continued confidence in the crypto exchange despite the recent downturn in its stock price.

The Bitcoin purchase is aligned with Wood’s bullish outlook on the cryptocurrency. She has previously predicted that Bitcoin could reach $1 million per coin by 2030.

Bitcoin Pressure

Despite this optimistic forecast, Bitcoin has faced pressure recently. The cryptocurrency has struggled to break the $83,700 resistance level.

Some analysts suggest Bitcoin could fall to the $75,000 support level if selling pressure continues. The recent price movements have been influenced by trading war impacts and other market factors.

Bitcoin traded in the $79,000 range before rising back to $81,000. However, it continues to face resistance at higher levels.

Ark’s investment approach seems to involve direct Bitcoin purchases while simultaneously expanding its positions in crypto-related companies. The firm previously sold approximately $9 million of its Bitcoin ETF holdings.

This sale occurred as part of a broader trend, with about $1.1 billion exiting spot Bitcoin ETFs. The outflows may be related to declining performance in the US stock market, inflation concerns, and uncertainties in trade policies.

Despite these market challenges, Ark Invest appears committed to its long-term strategy in the digital asset sector. The firm continues to balance its portfolio between direct cryptocurrency holdings and investments in companies operating within the crypto ecosystem.",blockonomi
https://blockonomi.com,Binance Research: Bitcoin’s Expanding Role in Decentralized Finance,https://blockonomi.com/binance-research-bitcoins-expanding-role-in-decentralized-finance/,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 08:27:02 GMT","TLDR

Bitcoin is evolving beyond a store of value into a broader decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem

Only about 0.8% of Bitcoin is currently being used in DeFi, presenting a large untapped opportunity

Bitcoin needs Layer 2 solutions to overcome its lack of native programmability unlike smart contract platforms

BTCFi could help sustain miner incentives by generating higher transaction fees

The long-term success of Bitcoin DeFi depends on execution, Layer 2 development, and alignment with Bitcoin’s value proposition

Bitcoin is going through a major transformation. What started as a simple store of value is now becoming a complete financial system.

According to a new report by Binance Research, Bitcoin is evolving into a broader decentralized finance ecosystem.

The report, published on March 13, 2025, highlights how Bitcoin DeFi (BTCFi) is unlocking new ways to use Bitcoin. This emerging sector focuses on lending, staking, stablecoins, and decentralized exchanges.

Moulik Nagesh, an analyst at Binance Research, wrote about this shift in the report. He points out that Bitcoin’s role in DeFi is growing beyond its traditional use as digital gold.

DeFi refers to financial activities carried out on blockchains without traditional middlemen. These activities include lending, trading, and other financial services that normally require banks.

The potential market for Bitcoin in DeFi is huge. Currently, only about 0.8% of all Bitcoin is being used in DeFi applications. This low usage rate presents what Binance calls a “large untapped opportunity.”

This opportunity could be worth up to $1 trillion, according to Julian Love, a deal analyst at Franklin Templeton Digital Assets. The estimate was mentioned in the Binance report.

One key challenge for Bitcoin DeFi is technical limitations. Unlike Ethereum and other smart contract platforms, Bitcoin lacks “native programmability.” This means it can’t easily run complex financial applications.

Bitcoin Layer 2s

To overcome this limitation, Bitcoin needs Layer 2 networks. These are systems built on top of the main Bitcoin blockchain that extend its capabilities.

While development of Bitcoin Layer 2 networks is progressing, these platforms still need wider adoption. They also need better incentives to attract liquidity and scale effectively.

Bitcoin’s security model faces long-term challenges. As block rewards continue to halve, miners receive less Bitcoin for their work. This reduction could weaken the network’s security.

Bitcoin DeFi could help solve this problem. By generating more transaction fees, it could provide miners with additional income. This would help maintain the security of the network over time.

For Bitcoin DeFi to succeed, it must align with Bitcoin’s core principles. It needs to develop in ways that complement Bitcoin’s unique value proposition.

Developers can’t simply copy what worked for Ethereum. They need to create solutions tailored to Bitcoin’s specific strengths and user base.

The report notes Bitcoin DeFi is still in early stages. The total value locked in these platforms has grown dramatically, surging by 2,767% since the start of 2024. It has risen from $0.3 billion to $8.6 billion.

This growth has positioned Bitcoin among the top three DeFi ecosystems. It creates new opportunities for using BTC in financial applications.

Institutional investors are showing interest in Bitcoin DeFi. However, their adoption will depend on regulatory clarity and user-friendly solutions.

Cross-chain compatibility is another important factor. Most Bitcoin currently used in DeFi exists as wrapped tokens on other blockchains like Ethereum.

Bitcoin DeFi needs to develop secure cross-chain solutions. These will help bridge liquidity and attract users from existing DeFi ecosystems.

Looking ahead, Bitcoin DeFi will need to focus on specific use cases. Yield generation, payments, and institutional-grade products are promising areas for development.

The success of Bitcoin DeFi will depend on several factors. These include execution quality, continued Layer 2 development, and alignment with Bitcoin’s core values.",blockonomi
https://blockonomi.com,"Analyst Highlights Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and This Trending $0.02 Altcoin",https://blockonomi.com/analyst-highlights-solana-sol-cardano-ada-and-this-trending-0-02-altcoin/,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 20:00:35 GMT","A respected crypto market commentator has provided an overview of Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and the emerging DeFi-focused Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Solana is currently trading around $125, solidifying its long-standing reputation, while Cardano hovers near $0.72, maintaining investor attention through its rigorous research-based initiatives.

In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking center stage among decentralized finance projects. Now in the third round of its presale at $0.02, it has attracted close to $3.3 million from more than 5,600 investors. With Phase 4 set to push the price to $0.025—a 25% uplift—buyers at the current stage are positioned for a 200% gain when the token debuts at $0.06. Many analysts predict prices beyond $5 for MUTM (an 84x increase), and the team is currently completing a smart contract audit through CertiK, with the final results to be published on their social media channels.

A Rising DeFi Contender

Mutuum Finance is quickly making waves with a novel dual-lending system, enabling the platform to attract over $3.3 million in backing from more than 5,600 early investors. The token has already reached $0.02 in Phase 3, with Phase 4 bringing a further 25% price jump. Given its unique DeFi features, market watchers project the token could top $5 once it launches at $0.06, underscoring Mutuum Finance’s strong growth prospects.

Mutuum Finance stands out for blending Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. The P2C approach leverages liquidity pools—primarily funded in USDT—where smart contracts automatically manage lending and borrowing. Meanwhile, the P2P model removes intermediaries, letting users negotiate loan terms directly while retaining full ownership of their digital assets. By combining these strategies, Mutuum Finance provides a more secure, efficient, and decentralized alternative for yield-seeking DeFi investors.

Creating a Secure and Trustworthy Ecosystem

Reinforcing its infrastructure, Mutuum Finance plans to introduce a fully collateralized stablecoin on Ethereum. Unlike algorithmic versions, this USD-pegged token will be overcollateralized to lower user risk and maintain long-term stability. Supported by an open financial framework and verified smart contracts, Mutuum Finance reduces the vulnerabilities that can befall less-robust DeFi efforts.

In an effort to expand its user base, Mutuum Finance offers generous rewards. A notable giveaway will split $100,000 worth of MUTM tokens among ten fortunate winners, while a referral system encourages existing members to bring on additional investors. Early adopters gain access to exclusive staking pools, governance privileges, and VIP alerts, fostering lasting ties to the platform.

Sustainable Tokenomics for Growth

The Mutuum Finance tokenomics structure aims to manage supply effectively, creating a deflationary trend that supports consistent price escalation. Limiting the token allocation during the presale further preserves scarcity. Additionally, the platform’s staking mechanism provides attractive incentives to token holders, promoting active participation and establishing a robust, self-sustaining ecosystem for long-term success.

With Mutuum Finance evolving into a premier DeFi player—alongside Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA)—its presale has so far raised $3.3 million from over 5,600 investors. A 25% price increase is imminent, and analysts see room for the token to jump 84x beyond $5 after launch. With a CertiK audit in progress, now may be the ideal time to join the Mutuum Finance presale.

https://blockonomi.com,Can Cardano (ADA) Keep Up? BinoFi (BINO)’s $0.02 Presale Targets a 150x Return Before Year-End,https://blockonomi.com/can-cardano-ada-keep-up-binofi-binos-0-02-presale-targets-a-150x-return-before-year-end/,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 18:00:33 GMT","Cardano (ADA) is known for its robust blockchain and commitment to scalability, but recent developments in the crypto space suggest it may face tough competition. BinoFi (BINO), an emerging blockchain project, has caught the attention of investors with its $0.02 presale and a bold target of 150x returns by year-end. By incorporating cutting-edge technologies and innovative solutions, BinoFi offers features that could redefine crypto investing. Here’s how it stacks up to Cardano and why serious investors are taking notice.

Cardano’s Stalling Momentum

Cardano has long been seen as one of the top-tier projects in the market, thanks to its focus on scalability and sustainability. However, its growth has slowed as it faces delays in delivering advanced functionalities like smart contract scaling and interoperability. While Cardano remains a solid choice for many, its conservative pace leaves room for projects like BinoFi to outshine it with agile innovation and feature-packed ecosystems.

BinoFi Leverages AI-Driven Trading & Automation

BinoFi embraces AI-driven trading and automation, giving users an edge in executing trades. With its machine-learning algorithms, the system can analyze market data, predict trends, and execute trades with precision, helping traders maximize their returns while reducing manual effort.

Cardano, in contrast, doesn’t currently offer automated trading tools or AI capabilities tailored for its users. This gap makes BinoFi particularly attractive for investors with a focus on efficiency and profitability in dynamic markets.

Proof-of-Reserves & On-Chain Transparency

Trust in crypto platforms has become a critical issue after high-profile collapses and rug pulls in recent years. To address investor concerns, BinoFi incorporates Proof-of-Reserves (PoR), which allows users to verify asset reserves in real-time via its on-chain transparency module. This feature builds trust by ensuring the platform’s solvency and reliability.

While Cardano emphasizes decentralization and a secure consensus mechanism, it hasn’t introduced measures like PoR that provide ongoing reassurance for users. This level of transparency gives BinoFi a distinct advantage in fostering investor confidence.

Zero-Knowledge (ZK) KYC & Regulatory Compliance

Navigating regulatory frameworks is increasingly important as governments crack down on crypto projects. BinoFi sets itself apart with Zero-Knowledge (ZK) KYC technology, allowing users to fulfill regulatory obligations while maintaining their privacy. These cryptographic methods enable identity verification without exposing sensitive information, balancing security with compliance.

Cardano’s focus on infrastructure development hasn’t included innovative compliance solutions like ZK KYC. While Cardano’s progress has been steady, it lacks these forward-thinking features that position BinoFi as a leading-edge platform ready to meet modern regulatory demands.

Investment Potential Beyond the Hype

The crypto world has seen countless projects rise and fall, but BinoFi is generating buzz for all the right reasons. With a presale price of just $0.02 that already sold more than 11 million tokens and projections suggesting up to 150x returns before the year ends, the opportunity for early investors is extraordinary. Unlike Cardano, which offers long-term potential but has shown slower growth recently, BinoFi delivers immediate innovation and wide-ranging solutions.

Why Investors Are Turning to BinoFi

Cardano has proven its place as a blockchain pioneer, but BinoFi’s commitment to innovation is hard to overlook. With features like AI-driven trading, Proof-of-Reserves for unparalleled transparency, and privacy-enhancing ZK KYC technology, BinoFi addresses the emerging needs of crypto investors. Compared to Cardano’s methodical approach, BinoFi’s focus on providing industry-leading tools looks increasingly appealing.

The crypto market moves fast, and projects that innovate quickly often capture market share before competitors catch up. For those looking at BinoFi, the presale represents not just an investment in a coin but an opportunity to support a vision that aligns technology, security, and usability.

A Future Defined By Utility

The real question isn’t whether Cardano can keep up, but whether you’re ready to consider a project that’s shaping what’s next. BinoFi combines innovative technology with ambitious growth potential. For investors seeking a platform that steps beyond the familiar and into true innovation, BinoFi is one to watch closely in the months to come.

However, the trader has chosen Rexas Finance (RXS) ERC-20 token as his primary choice because he believes it will drive up investor gains and attract institutional investments alongside whale interest to the market.

Ethereum Targets $3,500 and $5,400 in 2025 as Bullish Momentum Builds

The analyst predicts two crucial price targets of $3,500 and $5,400 by employing Fibonacci retracement analysis to verify Ethereum’s upward movement trend. Market ups and downs have not impacted Ethereum’s support structure, as the token continues to present higher low prints, demonstrating a persistently optimistic trend. However, while Ethereum remains a solid investment, the trader believes an ERC-20 token could deliver even higher returns in 2025—Rexas Finance (RXS).

Ethereum’s Bullish Targets for 2025

According to the trader’s analysis, Ethereum’s price could follow these key levels:

Target 1: $3,500 – The 100% Fibonacci retracement level, marking a strong resistance zone.

Target 2: $4,500 – Aligns with the 161.8% Fibonacci extension, indicating a breakout potential.

Target 3: $5,400 – Based on the 200% Fibonacci extension, signaling a possible long-term peak.

Ethereum has proven itself resilient at its crucial support points which reinforces the scenario of a substantial price surge in 2025. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance (RXS) provides investors an option for extraordinary opportunities as Ethereum continues its strong momentum.

Why This Trader Is Betting on Rexas Finance (RXS)

With whales and institutional investors accumulating RXS, the project has gained serious traction. The trader highlights key reasons why RXS is catching the attention of high-net-worth investors:

Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization – RXS allows fractional ownership of real estate, commodities, and collectibles, unlocking new investment possibilities.

Deflationary Supply Model – A built-in burn mechanism ensures decreasing token supply, increasing long-term value.

Massive Investor Demand – The final presale stage is already 90% complete, with over $46.7 million raised.

Final Opportunity Before the Price Skyrockets

Currently priced at $0.20, RXS is set to launch at $0.25 on June 19, 2025. With analysts predicting a potential 10x surge post-listing, investors are racing to secure their tokens before the presale ends.

How This Impacts the Crypto Market

Ethereum’s bullish momentum suggests major growth in 2025, but RXS presents a unique opportunity for those seeking even higher returns. With strong institutional backing, real-world use cases, and massive market demand, Rexas Finance is positioning itself as one of the top ERC-20 projects of the year. With presale slots rapidly selling out, the question remains—will you act now or watch from the sidelines?

With whale dominance at 58.37%, SHIB’s price remains heavily manipulated, making it one of the most volatile meme tokens on the market.

Meanwhile, a new rival is stealing the show Remittix (RTX), a meme coin with real utility and a potential 25,445% ROI. As SHIB holders brace for impact, RTX is shaping up as the next big winner. So what differentiates this project from its competitors?

Whale Dominance Makes Shiba Inu Even More Volatile

And now Shiba Inu (SHIB) may not survive the next meme coin crash.

The concentration of SHIB tokens among a few large holders is one such vulnerability.

Notably, the top ten whales control around 61% of SHIB supply, which only serves to exacerbate price volatility and increase the risk of market manipulation.

While Shiba Inu navigates these challenges, the developers are frantically working on updates that might boost the network’s utility and general appeal. One of the biggest updates on the cards for 2025 is the introduction of the Shiba Hub.

This upcoming platform aims to centralize various services, including asset management, staking and decentralized application (dApp) creation, thereby enhancing user engagement and utility within the community. ​

While Shiba Hub offers a promising avenue for growth, the overarching concern remains the token’s whale-dominated distribution.

This imbalance could undermine the platform’s success if not addressed, as large-scale sell-offs by major holders can lead to abrupt price declines, eroding investor confidence.

Remittix Redefines The Game For Global Payments

While cryptocurrency was designed to make transactions faster, cheaper and more accessible, the reality is that spending digital assets in everyday life is still far too complicated.

Slow exchange withdrawals, excessive fees and banking restrictions have prevented crypto from reaching its full potential as a real-world payment solution.

That’s where Remittix (RTX) is stepping in to make a difference. The platform facilitates the conversion of more than 40 cryptocurrencies into FIAT instantly, with funds sent directly to bank accounts all across the globe.

For Leon, a Nigerian freelance writer, this means stablecoin payments from overseas clients take too long to convert to Naira. With Remittix, he can transfer his earnings straight to his bank account without any fees or delays.

Remittix is also turning heads for its stern focus on privacy. Traditional banking systems track every transaction, limit transfers and can freeze accounts without warning, leaving users with little control over their own funds.

Remittix provides a privacy-focused alternative, ensuring that transactions are processed without unnecessary scrutiny. When users send funds through Remittix, the recipient receives a standard bank deposit with no visible connection to cryptocurrency.

Investors Race To Grab RTX Tokens

Investors are racing to grab their share of RTX tokens. These powerful things are currently on offer for just $0.0734, giving investors a chance to share in the bright future of Remittix.

As it gears up to take a large slice of the $190 trillion global payments industry, Remittix is poised to disrupt the market in 2025.

Analysts expect a steep 800% price rise before the presale’s end and for those serious about staying ahead of the curve this year, this project is certainly not one to overlook.

In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining significant traction in decentralized finance (DeFi), thanks to its pioneering dual-lending model.

During Phase 3 of its presale, MUTM is priced at $0.02, having already raised $3.3 million and drawn in over 5,600 backers. As the presale moves into its next stage, the price will climb to $0.025, while Phase 3 participants expect a 200% return at the $0.06 launch price. Looking beyond, some forecasts suggest Mutuum Finance could surpass $2.40—representing a remarkable 4,050% upswing.

Notably, the team behind Mutuum Finance is completing a CertiK audit of its smart contracts, a pivotal step to bolster security and investor confidence. The finalized audit results will be shared on the project’s social media channels.

An Emerging DeFi Heavyweight

Mutuum Finance aims to revolutionize decentralized lending through its dual-lending approach, fueling widespread industry interest. With more than 5,500 investors on board and $3.3 million raised, the token is currently offered at $0.02 in Phase 3—soon to climb by 25% in the upcoming Phase 4. Thanks to its unique lending solution and an official launch price of $0.06, analysts predict MUTM might surge beyond $5 in the months to come, making it a high-value, though under-the-radar, DeFi token.

Raising the Bar for DeFi Lending

At the core of Mutuum Finance’s value proposition is its two-pronged lending system:

Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Investors earn passive income by supplying assets (like USDT) to liquidity pools that are managed automatically by smart contracts.

Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Users have direct control over their holdings and can establish lending deals on a one-on-one basis without intermediaries.

By intertwining these two models, Mutuum Finance ensures a decentralized, secure, and streamlined experience for those seeking to maximize DeFi yields.

Building a Stable Ecosystem

Mutuum Finance plans to introduce a fully collateralized stablecoin on the Ethereum network, shoring up stability and mitigating insolvency risks typically associated with algorithmic stablecoins. In addition, audited smart contracts and transparent financial structures provide added reassurance for investors and help the project steer clear of pitfalls commonly found in DeFi startups.

Mutuum Finance is aggressively expanding its user base through lucrative incentives. A $1 million program will distribute $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens to 10 lucky participants, while a referral system rewards current users for onboarding new investors. Early adopters benefit from exclusive perks such as staking pools, governance rights, and VIP notifications that deepen their involvement in the platform.

Tokenomics for Sustainable Growth

The project’s careful tokenomics strategy aims to maintain a controlled supply and foster continual value appreciation. By capping token distribution in the presale and implementing anti-inflationary measures, Mutuum Finance curbs supply and paves the way for price growth. Staking rewards encourage active participation, contributing to a stable, vibrant ecosystem for the project’s native token.

With SHIB in decline, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is eyeing a potential 4,050% increase in value. Priced at $0.02, MUTM has already secured $3.3 million and over 5,600 investors, with a 25% price jump expected shortly. Boasting a dual-lending framework, a USD-backed stablecoin, and an ongoing CertiK audit, this fast-rising DeFi contender is quickly attracting attention. Seize the presale opportunity before the next price hike.

https://blockonomi.com,Pepe Coin (PEPE) Price: $5 Million Whale Shopping Spree Triggers Double-Digit Gains,https://blockonomi.com/pepe-coin-pepe-price-5-million-whale-shopping-spree-triggers-double-digit-gains/,"Fri, 14 Mar 2025 08:24:10 GMT","TLDR

PEPE coin surged 11% in a day to reach $0.000006370

Three major whales purchased 689.79 billion PEPE tokens worth approximately $4.3-5 million

Technical patterns suggest a potential 60% price surge with resistance at $0.0000075 and $0.000010

PEPE futures open interest climbed to $198-214 million, indicating growing trader interest

Elder-Ray Index turned positive for the first time since January, signaling bullish momentum

Pepe Coin has increased in price 11.27% in 24 hours, reaching $0.000006370. This sudden uptick comes after a prolonged bearish trend that saw PEPE lose over 80% of its value from its all-time high of $0.00002833 recorded in December 2024.

Market analysts have spotted key technical patterns forming on PEPE’s daily chart. These patterns suggest a major price movement could be imminent. Some experts predict this tightening price action may result in a surge exceeding 60% in a short timeframe.

The current price charts show several optimistic indicators. Buy volume is rising while sell pressure appears to be weakening. Though price action continues to print lower lows, it seems to be running out of momentum. This combination of factors suggests PEPE might be preparing for a sharp upward move.

If a breakout occurs, traders should watch for immediate resistance at $0.0000075 and $0.000010. A successful push above these levels could open the path toward $0.00002095, representing a potential 220% increase from current values. However, caution remains warranted.

In a bearish scenario, PEPE could face trouble if it fails to hold above the crucial support level at $0.00000298. This could trigger another sell-off, sending prices lower. The $0.0000062 level represents another key support area to monitor.

The recent price spike coincides with increased whale accumulation. On-chain data shows three major investors purchased a combined 689.79 billion PEPE tokens. These purchases amount to approximately $4.3-5 million in value, showcasing renewed confidence from larger market players.

The largest buyer was wallet 0x7A7D, which purchased 437.7 billion PEPE for 1,413.4 ETH (about $2.72 million). Two other wallets, 0x9212 and 0x7779, acquired 158.58 billion PEPE ($1 million) and 93.51 billion PEPE ($574,000) respectively.

These large-scale acquisitions often precede price rallies. They typically lead to higher liquidity and stronger market confidence in the asset. Though some analysts have questioned the origin of these funds, as they reportedly came from Tornado Cash.

Beyond technical indicators and whale activity, broader economic factors have supported PEPE’s recovery. U.S. inflation data released this week showed a decline in the Consumer Price Index from 3.0% to 2.8%. This reduced concerns about aggressive Federal Reserve policies.

As a result of improved economic outlook, risk assets including cryptocurrencies experienced renewed interest from investors. This macro trend has provided additional tailwinds for PEPE’s price movement.

Open Interest

PEPE’s futures open interest has climbed to between $198-214 million, its highest level since early March. This increase indicates that traders are positioning for a potential breakout, further reinforcing the bullish sentiment around the coin.

Daily trading volume has also surged, exceeding $1.11 billion and jumping by 18% over the past 24 hours. The 24-hour liquidations have passed $2.58 million, highlighting increased market activity around the token.

Technical indicators provide additional insights into PEPE’s potential future performance. The Elder-Ray Index has turned positive for the first time since January 19. This signals a bullish shift in investor sentiment toward the altcoin.

The Elder-Ray Index assesses market strength by comparing an asset’s price to its moving average. It highlights whether bulls or bears are dominant in the market. A positive value suggests bulls are in control, indicating upward momentum.

Despite these positive signals, PEPE continues to trade below its 200-day Exponential Moving Average. This means a confirmed uptrend has not yet been established. Experts suggest that if the token can maintain its position above $0.0000062, it may gain the momentum needed to push toward higher targets.

If current trends continue, some analysts project PEPE could see short-term appreciation of 60%, with potential targets of $0.000012 (a 90% increase) and $0.000020 (a 215% increase). The immediate resistance level to watch is $0.0000083.",blockonomi

While Cardano remains a promising choice for many, savvy investors are also turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in pursuit of even higher potential gains.

The project has seen a rapid sell-out of its second presale stage and has now entered Phase 3. With over $3.2 million raised and more than 5,400 holders on board, demand is surging. At this point, investors can buy MUTM at $0.02, set to increase to $0.025 during this phase. As the launch price will be $0.06, early backers could potentially double their investment. Moreover, some estimates suggest MUTM may reach $6 post-launch, implying a chance for $500 to become $500,000.

Growing Momentum for MUTM Presale

Mutuum Finance has drawn considerable interest during its third presale phase. Over 5,400 investors have collectively contributed $3.2 million, making the token’s opening days a strong success. Purchasing MUTM at $0.02 before the token’s launch on exchanges (where it’ll initially list at $0.06) provides a clear upside for early participants. Experts foresee a possible $6 price per MUTM shortly after listing, with upcoming exchange deals poised to increase the token’s value even further.

Mutuum Finance aims for secure, scalable growth through features that combine innovative architecture and consistent development. By using predictive smart contracts, the platform efficiently manages lending operations across multiple networks. Stakers earn passive income via periodic rewards, and the planned release of a USD-pegged stablecoin is intended to provide stability within the platform’s ecosystem. These steps collectively reinforce Mutuum Finance’s stature as a premier DeFi investment option ahead of its formal listing.

Exclusive Advantages for Early Adopters

To reward early supporters, Mutuum Finance is running a $100,000 token giveaway, awarding $10,000 in MUTM to each of 10 selected participants. Additionally, the platform offers a referral program that grants newcomers extra perks for joining through existing community members, further boosting user engagement.

Mutuum Finance’s dual-lending system distinguishes it from other DeFi projects. Using both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) functionality and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) structures, the platform delivers optimal efficiency:

P2C: Automated smart contracts improve capital availability and dynamically manage interest rates for both lenders and borrowers.

P2P: Users establish individualized loan terms directly, giving them greater control over their lending arrangements.

This flexible approach underpins Mutuum Finance’s reputation as a competitive DeFi lending service.

Takeaways

Cardano (ADA) is garnering optimism, with analysts predicting it could climb from $0.72 to $5, thanks to ongoing network developments and growing institutional adoption. However, those eyeing a potentially more dramatic return are turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). In Phase 3 of its presale, investors have already committed $3.2 million to buy MUTM at the initial $0.02 rate.

Price increments will move it to $0.025 before it ultimately lists at $0.06—offering significant gains right from the start. Forecasts suggest MUTM could hit $6 post-launch, representing a remarkable profit opportunity. Anyone looking to seize these gains should consider acquiring MUTM before the next price increase.
