Canada's new prime minister: 'We will never' be part of the US

Edited by Brandon Livesay, Caitlin Wilson and Alys Davies

Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre starts off by wishing farewell to former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He says it is time to take back control of the economy, strengthen the country's border and the military.

He says it's time to become a stronger, more independent and sovereign country, while accusing new Prime Minister Mark Carney of doing ""exactly what [President] Trump wants"". 

Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre is now speaking, in response to Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech earlier today.

Stick with us, we'll bring the latest as it happens.

Yves-Francois Blanchet, the leader of Bloc Québecois, is now speaking to reporters. 

He says the new set of ministers are there to ""send a message"" to Canadians, and collaborating with them will be important. 

But Blanchet says he has ""the right to wonder who exactly will be speaking for Quebec"". 

Reacting to the new cabinet, leader of the left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) Jagmeet Singh says Mark Carney is sending a message to progressive Liberals that there is no room for them in the party under his leadership. 

He criticises Carney for not creating separate cabinet portfolios for minister of women, youth, or people with disabilities. 

Singh also criticised him for not having a minister of labour (there is, however, a Minister of Jobs and Families). 

""He might say it's just the name, well the name means something,"" Singh says, calling it a ""problematic"" omission. 

Singh also criticised Carney as someone who has made billionaires ""very rich at the cost of workers"".

Jessica MurphyReporting from Toronto

In his first media appearance as prime minister, Mark Carney sought to paint his government as one of action - ready to hit the ground running as Canada faces an escalating trade war with the US, its closest ally and largest trade partner. 

He said he would be heading in the coming days to the UK and France as the country seeks to deepen ties with ""reliable"" - a word he underscored - trade partners. 

But it's clear Canada will soon head into a general election. Carney took a few open jabs at the Conservatives, who are currently polling slightly ahead, or even, with the Liberals. 

Asked directly about election plans, Carney was more coy. He gave a nod to the fact that, by law, there must be an election by October, but added that in the coming days he would have more to say about getting ""as strong a mandate that is needed for the time"". 

This was a get to know you news conference - generally friendly as reporters queried Carney on major issues, like how he would handle Trump. 

But the job will only get more challenging from here. 

Soon, we'll be hearing from Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, who is expected to respond to Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech. 

Stick with us, we'll bring the latest as it happens.

As Canada's new prime minister, Mark Carney will inherit the country's response on a number of key global and domestic issues. 

Here is where he stands on some of them:

And with that, we've finished the news conference with Canada's new
Prime Minister Mark Carney.

Stick with us for more updates, including from Conservative
Party leader Pierre Poilivre. 

Carney is asked again about US-Canada relations.

Carney says he ""looks forward"" to speaking with
President Trump.

The prime minister says he understands Trump's agenda and the
goal of getting rid of the ""scourge"" of fentanyl, which affects
Canada as well.

But he wants Trump to understand the importance the country puts
on Canadian jobs and workers.

Carney says his cabinet has many familiar faces from the previous
government, but it is smaller.

He says the smaller team is more focussed and everybody in it is
""senior"".

One of the top issues is the trade war ""crisis"" with
the US, he says, and so keeping some continuity from the previous government is
very important.

Carney delivers his first barb as prime minister towards his
political opponent, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre.

Asked about the value of his assets that were recently placed in
a blind trust, Carney notes that ""by definition, you don't know the assets
because the trustees take over that responsibility.""

But he adds: ""I'd like to assure you that the assets I have
were earned through employment income.""

""Employment in the private sector is something the leader
of the opposition has never experienced,"" he remarks - a dig at Poilievre,
who has been a member of Parliament since the age of 25.

A French-speaking reporter asks Carney about the change of the
ministerial portfolio of Canadian Heritage to Canadian Culture and Identity.

The new PM says the change is about strengthening Canadian identity,
with language at the centre of it.

He adds that the question of the country's identity is much
broader than just official languages - it also includes nature, oceans and
biodiversity.

""To ensure those things are protected and promoted.""

Back to the election Canada has to hold before November and Carney
is asked where in the country will he choose to run. 

He is the first prime minister to never serve as a member of
Parliament, and must run for a seat once the election is called.

""Today is not the day to announce where I will run,""
Carney says.

Canada's new prime minister: 'We will never' be part of the US

Carney is now asked if he will be seeking reassurances in Europe
that Canada will never become the ""51st state"" of the US, as President
Trump has claimed recently.

""We will never, in any shape or form, be part of the
US,"" he tells the crowd, echoing similar remarks he has made previously.  

Carney says a ceremony like the swearing in today, and the group
of ministers behind him, are nothing like America's system of government.

""We are very fundamentally a different country,""
Carney says, adding that the country ""expects respect"" from America
and Trump.

Carney is now asked about when Canadians can expect to go to an
election.

He responds by joking they can expect to vote “before November”. The federal election must be held before October.

The news today, he adds, is the new Cabinet that stands behind
him.

""There will be other news in the coming days with respect
to ensuring that we have a stronger mandate,” he tells reporters. 

Staying on a US theme and Carney is asked about Secretary of
State Marco Rubio's comments this morning saying that ""economically
speaking Canada would be better as the 51st state of the United States.""

Rubio said this during a G7 foreign ministers' meeting that is
being held in Quebec.

""It's crazy,"" Prime Minister Carney says in response.
""That's all you can say.""

Canada's new prime minister is now taking questions from
reporters. He is asked first if he has plans to go meet with President Donald
Trump in the US.

Carney replies saying he has plans to go to France and the UK to
meet with leaders there, and adds that reinforcing security and diversifying
trade partners is important.

Right now, he says, he has no plans to meet with Trump, but will
do so ""at the appropriate moment"".

Carney now says that protecting Canadian workers and their families ""in the face of unjustified foreign trade actions"" is one of two priorities his new government will focus on.

It's an apparent reference to US tariffs recently imposed by President Trump.

He then declares that ""negativity wont win a trade war,"" or bring down the price of groceries, adding that the Canadian government is united and strong.

He says they will get to work immediately with a cabinet meeting to be held soon after this news conference.

Carney then moves on to take questions from the media.

Carney is talking about how the new government will approach its
leadership.

He says new ministers have new ideas and are ready to respond to
new threats and new opportunities.

Some of the economic goals, Carney says, are to grow more higher
paying jobs and improve affordability.

The new smaller team of ministers, Carney says, is ""made to
meet the moment we are in"".

Carney says the swearing in ceremony is a reflection of Canada
as a country that is ""built on the bedrock of three peoples: Indigenous,
French and British.""

""On these foundations, Canadians have built a dynamic
nation that celebrates its diversity, that cares for the vulnerable in society
and that always strives for a better tomorrow,"" he says.

He adds that his new cabinet is fully confident in its
responsibility to strengthen the foundation of Canada in the midst of the
crisis it faces, and to build a country that is ""even better.""

US Vice President J.D. Vance has said he would be “shocked” if President Donald Trump supported the idea of American nuclear weapons being based in Poland.

In an interview with Fox News on Thursday, Vance was asked about Warsaw's proposal to host US strategic missiles on its territory as a “deterrent against future Russian aggression.”

“I haven't talked to the president about that particular issue, but I would be shocked if he was supportive of nuclear weapons extending further east into Europe,” Vance said.

Polish President Andrzej Duda has called on Washington to move some of its nuclear arsenal stored in Western Europe or the US to Poland, claiming on Thursday that he had discussed the idea with Keith Kellogg, the US special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, according to the Financial Times.

The Polish president reportedly made a similar request to the Joe Biden administration in 2022, but it was never approved.

Vance argued that while “people like Joe Biden” are “sleepily walking us into the nuclear conflict,” allowing Russians and Ukrainians to “bleed out,” Trump has engaged in “tough diplomacy,” enlisting his entire administration to settle the Ukraine conflict.

Polish officials are reportedly calling for militarization to address the alleged threat posed by Moscow. Prime Minister Donald Tusk claimed earlier this month that Russia could launch a “full-scale operation” against a “larger” target than Ukraine within three to four years – which Moscow has repeatedly dismissed. Tusk argued that Poland must serve as a “bastion” to protect NATO's eastern flank and should expand its military capabilities and double the size of its army to 500,000.

Russia has consistently denied allegations that it poses a military threat to European NATO nations. President Vladimir Putin has dismissed such claims as “nonsense,” accusing EU leaders of using them to instill fear among their populations and justify increased military spending.

Calls for higher defense budgets within the EU, however, align with Trump's push for European NATO members to take greater responsibility for their own security. At the same time, the US president has criticized the idea of an arms race and suggested that nuclear powers should get rid of their atomic arsenals.

The Southern African regional bloc has announced a “phased withdrawal” of its troops from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), where they have been deployed to help fight armed groups in a country that has endured decades of violence.

The decision comes amid heavy fighting in DR Congo's eastern provinces between the Congolese Army and militants from the M23 group, who have seized major towns in their latest offensive since the beginning of the year.

More than 8,500 fatalities have been recorded in the hostilities, according to official figures. At least 20 peacekeepers from the Southern African Development Community (SADC), including Malawian, Tanzanian, and South African soldiers, have also been killed.

On Thursday, leaders from the 16-nation SADC held a virtual summit and expressed “grave concern” about the “continued deterioration” of the neighboring country's security situation, including the blockage of main humanitarian aid supply routes.

In an official statement after the meeting, the regional authority said it has “terminated the mandate of SAMIDRC [Southern African Development Community Mission in the DRC] and directed the commencement of a phased withdrawal” of troops.

The group, however, pledged to continue to “support interventions aimed at bringing lasting peace” and the DR Congo's “pursuit of safeguarding its independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.”

The SADC force was deployed in 2023 to replace the East African Community (EAC) regional mission, which was withdrawn from the DR Congo after Kinshasa deemed it ineffective.

While the current size of the deployment in the troubled Central African country is unknown, UN estimates suggest that about 1,300 SAMIDRC troops were dispatched out of the 5,000 approved. South Africa, which leads the mission, announced early last year that it would contribute 2,900 soldiers.

DR Congo's mineral-rich eastern region has experienced decades of violence, driven by the M23 and other armed groups fighting the authorities for power and minerals such as gold and diamonds. The Congolese government has repeatedly accused neighboring Rwanda of backing the militants – claims the neighboring state denies.

Angola announced on Wednesday that it will mediate direct ceasefire talks between the rebels and officials from Kinshasa on March 18. The Congolese authorities previously refused to hold talks with the rebels, insisting they would only negotiate with Rwanda, the “aggressor.”

Moscow and Washington are currently in talks over the possibility of future cooperation with Gazprom on international projects, including in the Arctic region, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing Russian and European officials. The news comes as the US seeks to normalize relations with Russia and gain access to the economically important region.

The Arctic has drawn increasing global attention due to its vast untapped energy and mineral resources, as well as its strategic trade routes. Russia has been developing its Northern Sea Route, the shortest shipping route between Western Eurasia and the Asia-Pacific, running through its Arctic and Far East regions. The route has been extensively modernized over the past years, with investment from India and China, which hold stakes in several Arctic energy projects.

One of the sources told Bloomberg that Russian state-run energy giant Gazprom could offer the US involvement in ventures in the Arctic region and some offshore projects such as the Sakhalin liquefied natural gas project if sanctions restricting foreign investment are overturned.

Unnamed sources familiar with the matter told the news agency that talks between US and Russian representatives on potential collaboration with Gazprom are at the stage of “preliminary contacts.” It is reportedly unclear who is leading the reported discussions or whether officials from the administration of US President Donald Trump are directly involved.

US-Gazprom cooperation could involve joint projects in Europe and Asia, several sources said, adding that it could be part of Washington's broader push to weaken Russia's ties to China and Iran. Bloomberg noted that the step could also promote business opportunities following a peace deal to end the Ukraine conflict, which Trump sees as a top priority.

Earlier this week, German news outlet Correctiv reported, citing its own investigation, that Russia and the US were negotiating a major deal that would allow the resumption of Russian energy exports. The months-long discussions could reportedly involve US companies buying parts of the Nord Stream pipeline infrastructure and stakes in three German refineries owned by a subsidiary of Russian energy giant Rosneft.

Neither the Kremlin nor the White House has officially commented on the reports. President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia could resume gas exports to Europe through the undersea pipeline once Moscow and Washington reach an agreement on energy cooperation.

The Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, built to deliver Russian gas to Germany and the rest of Western Europe, were destroyed by blasts at the bottom of the Baltic Sea in September 2022.

LA MALBAIE, Quebec (AP) — Top diplomats from the Group of 7 industrialized democracies agreed Friday on a joint statement expressing support for Ukraine and a U.S. ceasefire proposal in the three-year-old war even as President Donald Trump's trade policies and taunts toward host Canada overshadowed the talks. 

Despite the tensions, diplomats from the U.S., Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan signed off on a final communique after hours of late-night negotiations. There were concerns that the bloc's once solid unity had been thrown into irreversible disarray by Trump's whopping tariffs on steel and aluminum and threats for additional levies if there is any retaliation. 

Although the trade war and Trump's repeated comments about turning Canada into the 51st state distracted from the discussions, diplomats were able to rally around his Ukraine peace plan.




“G7 members reaffirmed their unwavering support for Ukraine in defending its territorial integrity and right to exist, and its freedom, sovereignty and independence,” the communique said. “G7 members called for Russia to reciprocate by agreeing to a ceasefire on equal terms and implementing it fully.”

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio denied after the meeting that the G7 support for Ukraine's territorial sovereignty strayed from the Trump administration's position, including its insistence that Ukraine must be open to ceding control of some land to Russia to get a peace deal.

“I've never heard President Trump say that Russia has a right to take all of Ukraine and do whatever they want there,” Rubio told reporters. “So that's not inconsistent.”

In addition, the G7 diplomats discussed, but did not detail, imposing further sanctions on Russia — including the possibility of selling seized Russian assets to fund Ukraine's defense — should Russia not accept and respect a ceasefire and providing additional support for Ukraine in that event.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said he agrees in principle with the ceasefire plan but set out a host of details that need to be clarified before it is accepted.

The G7 statement “emphasized that any ceasefire must be respected and underscored the need for robust and credible security arrangements to ensure that Ukraine can deter and defend against any renewed acts of aggression.”

Still, Trump's apparent desire to draw Putin back into the fold — including saying he would like to see Russia rejoin the group to restore it to the G8 — continues to alarm G7 members. Russia was thrown out of the G8 after it seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. 

Despite the agreement on key points, Trump's policies were front and center as the allies gathered for two days of talks at a snowy resort in La Malbaie, Quebec.

All G7 members are affected by the tariffs but perhaps none more so than Canada, the only one that borders the United States and the only one that Trump has personally antagonized with repeated derogatory comments about it becoming the 51st state.

Rubio, on his first official trip to Canada and his first to a G7 event, heard a litany of complaints as he met with his counterparts. 

Many of them, notably the Japanese, appealed to Rubio to use what influence he might have with Trump to spare their country from harsh trade treatment. But Trump has said he will not relent.

“We will put maximum pressure on the Americans and, meanwhile, will work on looking for off-ramps,” Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly told reporters Friday. “The Trump tariffs are going to hurt Americans. That's our message, that's our approach.”

Rubio, who called Joly a friend, said the tariffs are not meant to be a “hostile move” against allies but are about making trade fair. Those benefiting from previous arrangements likely do “feel it is hostile to change the status quo because it's to your benefit,” he told reporters.

Joly said her discussion with Rubio had been “frank” — diplomatic code for “blunt.”

“I wanted to be able to have a frank conversation,” Joly said. “Of course, Canada's sovereignty is not up for debate and we had a long conversation on tariffs and trade.”

After Trump reiterated in the Oval Office on Thursday that “Canada only works as a state,” Joly stood firm. 

“What I said to the secretary is that Canada's sovereignty is not up for debate. Period,” she said Friday. “There is no argument. There is no conversation about it.” She added, as if addressing him, “You are here, you respect us, you respect our sovereignty, you respect our people. Period.”

Rubio told reporters Friday that Trump “loves Canada” and has simply “made an argument for why Canada would be better off joining the United States from an economic perspective and the like. He's made that argument repeatedly, and I think it stands for itself.”

Joly noted that many of the allies thought Trump's comments were a joke.

“I said to them this is not a joke — Canadians are anxious, Canadians are proud people, and you are here in a sovereign country, and so therefore, we don't expect this to be even discussed, clearly not laughed at,” she said.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said G7 nations should avoid panic and posted a message of support for Canada on X, featuring a photo of her and EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas. “We've got your back, @melaniejoly,” she wrote. “#Canada #Solidarity.”

Friday's sessions were shortened due to Joly's need to depart earlier than planned to attend Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's swearing-in ceremony and first Cabinet meeting. 

The final communique presented common positions not only on Ukraine but on the Middle East, wars in Africa and Chinese activity in the South China Sea.

On the Middle East, the communique did not, as it has in previous years, express support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But it did recognize the need for the Palestinians to have a “political horizon” to reach their aspirations.

“All of that has united us,” British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said. “So this has been a unified conference in which we have found common ground. And I'm pleased at the effort and the sense of warmth that exists across the partners in the G7.”

JERUSALEM (AP) — Palestinian militant group Hamas said Friday that it has accepted a proposal from mediators to release one living American-Israeli hostage and the bodies of four dual nationals who had died in captivity. The Israeli prime minister's office cast doubt on the offer, accusing Hamas of trying to manipulate talks underway in Qatar on the next stage of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. 

Hamas, which rules over what remains of the Gaza Strip, didn't immediately specify when the release of soldier Edan Alexander and the four bodies would take place — or what it expected to get in return.

Alexander was 19 when he was abducted from his base on the border with Gaza in southern Israel during Hamas' attack on Oct. 7, 2023 that sparked the war, which has been the deadliest and most destructive fighting ever between Israel and Hamas.

It wasn't clear which mediators proposed what Hamas was discussing. Egypt, Qatar and the U.S. have been guiding negotiations, and none had confirmed making the suggestion as of Friday night. 

U.S. officials, including envoy Steve Witkoff, said Friday that they had presented a proposal Wednesday to extend the ceasefire a few more weeks as the sides negotiate a permanent truce. The officials said in a statement that Hamas was claiming flexibility in public while privately making “entirely impractical” demands.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that Israel had “accepted the Witkoff outline and showed flexibility,” but that Hamas was refusing to do so.

“At the same time, it continues to use manipulation and psychological warfare — the reports about Hamas' willingness to release American hostages are intended to sabotage the negotiations,” read a letter from the government to hostage families.

It added that Israel's negotiating team would return Friday from Qatar's capital, Doha. Netanyahu said that he plans to convene his ministerial team Saturday night to hear from the negotiators and decide on the next steps. 

Hamas, meanwhile, sent a delegation to Cairo to discuss the ceasefire negotiations with Egyptian officials. 

Hamas official Husam Badran reaffirmed Friday what he said was the group's commitment to fully implementing the ceasefire agreement in all its phases. He warned that any Israeli deviation from the terms would return negotiations to square one.

The White House announced last week that American officials had engaged in “ongoing talks and discussions” with Hamas, stepping away from a long-held U.S. policy of not directly engaging with the militant group. That prompted a terse response from Netanyahu's office.

The U.S. said Friday that under its proposal, Hamas would release Alexander and other living hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and increased humanitarian aid to Gaza. The militants were told that the proposal would have to be accepted soon, the U.S. statement said, adding that delay would not pay off for Hamas. 

The first phase of the ceasefire ended two weeks ago, but the pause in fighting has held — if tensely — for now. The initial phase allowed the return of 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.

Israeli forces have withdrawn to buffer zones inside Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza and hundreds of trucks of aid entered daily until Israel cut off supplies to the territory's 2 million people two weeks ago. 

Hamas is believed to be holding 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others.

The Hostage Families Forum, which represents most captives' families, said Friday it welcomed plans for any releases, but “without a comprehensive deal, we risk sealing the fate of all remaining hostages.” 

Israel has been urging Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for an extension of the first phase, and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. The supply cutoff came as Israel pressed the militants to agree. About 80% of Gaza's residents have lost access to food sources, and 90% can't access clean drinking water, according to the Hamas-run government media office in Gaza.

Hamas wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire's more difficult second phase, which would entail the release of the remaining hostages, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and a lasting peace.

The developments came as Jews began celebrating the Purim holiday, and Muslims continued marking the holy month of Ramadan. Around 80,000 Muslim worshippers prayed Friday at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque compound, according to the Islamic Trust, which monitors the site. Israel is allowing only men over age 55 and women over 50 to enter from the occupied territory.

“The conditions are extremely difficult,” said Yousef Badreen, a Palestinian who left the southern West Bank city of Hebron at dawn to make it to Jerusalem. “We wish they will open it for good.”

Hamas accused Israel of escalating a “religious war” against Palestinians, casting the Al-Aqsa restrictions as “systematic targeting of Muslim religious practices.” The Israeli government didn't immediately respond.

BAGHDAD (AP) — The head of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has been killed in Iraq in an operation by members of the Iraqi national intelligence service along with U.S.-led coalition forces, the Iraqi prime minister announced Friday.

“The Iraqis continue their impressive victories over the forces of darkness and terrorism,” Prime Minister Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said in a statement posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Abdallah Maki Mosleh al-Rifai, or “Abu Khadija,” was “deputy caliph” of the militant group and as “one of the most dangerous terrorists in Iraq and the world,” the statement said.

A security official said the operation was carried out by an airstrike in Anbar province, in western Iraq. A second official said the operation took place Thursday night but that al-Rifai's death was confirmed Friday. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.

The announcement came on the same day as the first visit by Syria's top diplomat to Iraq, during which the two countries pledged to work together to combat IS.

Iraqi Foreign Minister Fouad Hussein said at a news conference that “there are common challenges facing Syrian and Iraqi society, and especially the terrorists of IS.” He said the officials had spoken “in detail about the movements of ISIS, whether on the Syrian-Iraqi border, inside Syria or inside Iraq” during the visit.

Hussein referred to an operations room formed by Syria, Iraq, Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon at a recent meeting in Amman to confront IS, and said it would soon begin work.




The relationship between Iraq and Syria is somewhat fraught after the fall of former Syrian President Bashar Assad. Al-Sudani came to power with the support of a coalition of Iran-backed factions, and Tehran was a major backer of Assad. The current interim president of Syria, Ahmad al-Sharaa, was previously known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani and fought as an al-Qaida militant in Iraq after the U.S. invasion of 2003, and later fought against Assad's government in Syria. 

But Syrian interim Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shibani focused on the historic ties between the two countries.

“Throughout history, Baghdad and Damascus have been the capitals of the Arab and Islamic world, sharing knowledge, culture and economy,” he said.

Strengthening the partnership between the two countries “will not only benefit our peoples, but will also contribute to the stability of the region, making us less dependent on external powers and better able to determine our own destiny,” he said.

The operation and the visit come at a time when Iraqi officials are anxious about an IS resurgence in the wake of the fall of Assad in Syria.

While Syria's new rulers - led by the Islamist former insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham - have pursued IS cells since taking power, some fear a breakdown in overall security that could allow the group to stage a resurgence.

The U.S. and Iraq announced an agreement last year to wind down the military mission in Iraq of an American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group by September 2025, with U.S. forces departing some bases where they have stationed troops during a two-decade-long military presence in the country.

When the agreement was reached to end the coalition's mission in Iraq, Iraqi political leaders said the threat of IS was under control and they no longer needed Washington's help to beat back the remaining cells.

But the fall of Assad in December led some to reassess that stance, including members of the Coordination Framework, a coalition of mainly Shiite, Iran-allied political parties that brought current Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammad Shia al-Sudani to power in late 2022.

NEW DELHI (AP) — Millions of people in South Asia celebrated Holi, the Hindu festival of colors, on Friday by smearing each other with brightly colored powder, dancing to festive music and feasting on traditional sweets prepared for the occasion.

The raucous spring festival sees Hindus take part in a kaleidoscopic celebration of the end of winter and the triumph of good over evil. The festival is a national holiday in India, while in Nepal it's a two-day event that began Thursday. It's also observed in other South Asian countries as well as among the Indian diaspora.

Holi has its origins in Hindu mythology and lore and celebrates the divine love between the Hindu god Krishna and his consort Radha, and signifies a time of rebirth and rejuvenation.

Across the country, people, mostly dressed in all white clothes, celebrated the festival by hurling colored powder at each other. Children, perched on rooftops and balconies, flung water balloons filled with colored pigments at passers by.

Groups of young men also used water guns to chase people down in public parks and on the roads, while others danced on the streets to music blaring from speakers.

In New Delhi, a rainbow haze hung in the air around a park where the group of friends splashed one another with pigmented powder and colored water. 

“It's time for fun and frolic,” said Krisha Bedi, a lawyer, whose face was covered with red, green and blue colors.




In some places, people hurled marigolds, roses and jasmine petals instead of colored powder.

Amid massive celebrations in the west Indian city of Ahmedabad, thousands of people gathered at temple were sprayed with colored water from huge pipes as they swayed to traditional Gujarati music, clapping over their heads.

Food and drink are a big part of the festivities. Vendors in parts of India sold thandai, a traditional light green beverage prepared with milk, cardamom and dried fruit, and gujia, a flaky, deep-fried sweet pastry stuffed with milk curds, nuts and dried fruit.

Another tradition that marks Holi is bhang, a local drink prepared with cannabis and consumed with milk or water. The drink is connected to Hinduism, particularly to Lord Shiva, and is also enjoyed during other religious festivals in the region. Its consumption is permissible under Indian law and it is also sold at government licensed shops.

In many parts of India, people also light large bonfires the night before the festival to signify the destruction of evil and victory of good. Families gather around the flames to sing, dance and pray to Hindu gods.

In two northern towns, hundreds of women celebrated last week by playfully hitting men who teased them as a part of ritual with wooden sticks. The festival is called “Lathmar Hol,” or Stick Holi.

BRUSSELS (AP) — In the year after Russia launched outright war on Ukraine, NATO leaders approved a set of military plans designed to repel an invasion of Europe. It was the biggest shake-up of the alliance's defense readiness preparations since the Cold War.

The secret plans set out how Western allies would defend NATO territory from the Atlantic to the Arctic, through the Baltic region and Central Europe, down to the Mediterranean Sea. Up to 300,000 troops would move to its eastern flank within 30 days, many of them American. That would climb to 800,000 within six months.

But the Trump administration warned last month that U.S. priorities lie elsewhere. Europe must take care of its own security, and those goals now seem questionable. Mustering just 30,000 European troops to police any future peace in Ukraine is proving a challenge.

Billions of euros are being shifted to military budgets, but only slowly, and the Europeans are struggling to fire up production in their defense industries.

Beyond funding, tens of thousands more European citizens might have to complete military service, and time is of the essence. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has warned that Russian forces could be capable of launching an attack on European territory in 2030.

Concerned about Russia's intentions, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk wants to introduce large-scale military training for every adult male, and double the size of Poland's army to around 500,000 soldiers.

“If Ukraine loses the war or if it accepts the terms of peace, armistice or capitulation … then, without a doubt — and we can all agree on that — Poland will find itself in a much more difficult geopolitical situation,” Tusk warned lawmakers last week.

The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimates that Europe, including the U.K., has almost 1.5 million active duty personnel. But many can't be deployed on a battlefield, and those who can are hard to use effectively without a centralized command system.

The number of Russian troops in Ukraine at the end of 2024 was estimated to be around 700,000.

NATO troops are controlled by a U.S. general, using American air transport and logistics.

Analysts say that in the event of a Russian attack, NATO's top military officer would probably dispatch around 200,000 U.S. troops to Europe to build on the 100,000 U.S. military personnel already based there.

With the Americans out of the picture, “a realistic estimate may therefore be that an increase in European capacities equivalent to the fighting capacity of 300,000 U.S. troops is needed,” the Brussels-based Bruegel think tank estimates.

“Europe faces a choice: either increase troop numbers significantly by more than 300,000 to make up for the fragmented nature of national militaries, or find ways to rapidly enhance military coordination,” Bruegel said. 

The question is how.

NATO is encouraging countries to build up personnel numbers, but the trans-Atlantic alliance isn't telling them how to do it. Maintaining public support for the armed forces and for Ukraine is too important to risk by dictating choices.

“The way they go about it is intensely political, so we wouldn't prescribe any way of changing this — whether to go for conscription, elective conscription, bigger reserves,” a senior NATO official said on the condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to brief journalists unless he remained unnamed.

“We do stress the point that fighting with those regional plans means that we are in collective defense and likely in an attrition war that requires way more manpower than we currently have, or we designed our force models to deliver,” he added.

Eleven European countries have compulsory military service: Austria, Cyprus, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden, and non-European Union nation Norway. The length of service ranges from as little as two months in Croatia to 19 months in Norway.

Poland isn't considering a return to universal military service, but rather a reserve system based on the model in Switzerland, where every man is obliged to serve in the armed forces or an alternative civilian service. Women can volunteer.

Belgium's new defense minister plans to write a letter in November to around 120,000 citizens who are age 18 to try to persuade at least 500 of them to sign up for voluntary military service. Debate about the issue goes on in the U.K. and Germany.

Germany's professional armed forces had 181,174 active service personnel at the end of last year — slightly lower than in 2023, according to a parliamentary report released Tuesday. That means it's no closer to reaching a Defense Ministry target of 203,000 by 2031.

Last year, 20,290 people started serving in the German military, or Bundeswehr, an 8% increase, the report said. But of the 18,810 who joined in 2023, more than a quarter — 5,100 or 27% of the total — left again, most at their own request during the six-month trial period.

The German parliament's commissioner for the armed forces, Eva Högl, said that army life is a hard sell.

“The biggest problem is boredom,” Högl said. “If young people have nothing to do, if there isn't enough equipment and there aren't enough trainers, if the rooms aren't reasonably clean and orderly, that deters people and it makes the Bundeswehr unattractive.”

At the other end of the scale, tiny Luxembourg has unique demographic challenges. Of its roughly 630,000 passport holders, only 315,000 are Luxembourgers. The number of people of military service age — 18 to 40 — is smaller still.

Around 1,000 people are enlisted. That's small compared to some European powers, but bigger per capita than the U.K. armed forces. Recently, Luxembourg — where unemployment is low and salaries are high — has struggled to find just 200-300 military personnel.

Military service comes with many challenges too, not least convincing someone to sign up when they might be sent to the front, and hastily trained conscripts can't replace a professional army. The draft also costs money. Extra staff, accommodation and trainers are needed throughout a conscript's term.

MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — An American influencer left Australia on Friday after the government announced it was reviewing her visa over a video she posted of her snatching a baby wombat from its mother.

Sam Jones, who describes herself as an “outdoor enthusiast & hunter,” made her Instagram account private Thursday after she was widely condemned for the video.

“There's never been a better day to be a baby wombat in Australia,” Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said in a statement after a government official confirmed Jones had flown from the country voluntarily.

In the video, Montana-based Jones lifts the wombat joey by its front legs in darkness from a roadside then runs away from its mother. “I caught a baby wombat,” she said as a man filming her laughs. She returns the wombat to the roadside after several seconds.

Burke had said earlier Friday the conditions of her visa were being reviewed to determine whether immigration law has been breached. “I can't wait for Australia to see the back of this individual, I don't expect she will return,” he said in the statement received by The Associated Press.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese added his voice to the criticism. “To take a baby wombat from its mother, and clearly causing distress from the mother, is just an outrage,” Albanese said.

“I suggest to this so-called influencer, maybe she might try some other Australian animals. Take a baby crocodile from its mother and see how you go there. Take another animal that can actually fight back rather than stealing a baby wombat from its mother,” Albanese added.




Jones, who also uses the name Samantha Strable, closed her social media channels to messages and couldn't be reached for comment Friday.

The wombat appears to be common wombat, also known as a bare-nosed wombat. It is a protected marsupial found only in Australia.

Yolandi Vermaak, founder of the animal care charity Wombat Rescue, said separating the young wombat from its mother created a risk that the mother would reject her offspring.

“My biggest concern is that we didn't actually see mom and baby getting reunited. When she put it down, it looked disoriented. It was turned away from where the mother was last seen. So we don't know if mom and baby actually found each other again,” Vermaak said.

Vermaak also called on Jones to say where the wombat was after the video showed the joey had a skin disease. “The baby has mange and it's a matter of time before it dies of mange, so it's important for us to find where this happened and to get this baby and its mom treated as soon as possible,” Vermaak said.

OCOS, Guatemala (AP) — As the United States government works to effectively extend its border security objectives south into Central America, countries like Guatemala have come under renewed scrutiny and pressure to step up their own border enforcement.

On Thursday, a Guatemalan army unit patrolled the Suchiate river that forms the western end of the Guatemala-Mexico border. The patrol was part of stepped up border operations since January, said Col. Juan Ernesto Celis.

President Bernardo Arévalo has said migration is a right, but in a regulated fashion.

The soldiers on patrol are looking to stop illegal arms, drug and human trafficking across Guatemala's borders. At this border, they frequently coordinate with their Mexican counterparts.

Ann Marie Argueta, spokeswoman for Guatemala's defense department, said Thursday that the military wants to not only protect against crimes that threaten the population, but also prevent “incursions into national territory by transnational organized crime.”

When U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Guatemala in February, Arévalo announced that Guatemala would form a new border security force to patrol its borders with Honduras and El Salvador as well.

Last July, nearly 600 Mexicans fled fighting between cartels in their border communities and sought refuge in Guatemala. Mexico's two most powerful cartels from the northern states of Sinaloa and Jalisco have been battling for control of lucrative smuggling routes in southern Mexico.

TEUCHITLAN, Mexico (AP) — When a group of citizens searching for missing relatives in the western state of Jalisco arrived at a remote ranch outside Mexico's second-largest city last week on an anonymous tip, all they had to do was push open the unlocked gate.

Inside they went to work with simple tools — picks, shovels and metal bars — doing the work that state investigators supposedly had done six months earlier.

What they found embarrassed state authorities and shook Mexico: dozens of shoes, heaps of clothing and what appeared to be human bone fragments. Distraught families from across the country have already started reaching out about clothing items they say they recognize.

It was a shocking reminder of Mexico's more than 120,000 disappeared and enough to push the federal government to take over the troubled investigation.

The ranch in Teuchitlan, about 37 miles (60 kilometers) west of Guadalajara was allegedly being used as a training base for cartel recruits when National Guard troops found it last September.

Authorities then said 10 people were arrested, two hostages were freed and a body was found wrapped in plastic. The state prosecutor's office went in with a backhoe, dogs and devices to find inconsistencies in the ground.

But then the investigation went quiet until members of the Jalisco Search Warriors, one of dozens of search collectives that dot Mexico, visited the site last week on a tip.




They found the shoes, as well as heaps of other clothing and what appeared to be burned bone fragments.

Members of the search collective were back at the site Thursday, invited to observe authorities as they worked to register evidence and search the property.

“A lot of families have stepped forward to identify items of clothing,” said Maribel, a member of the search collective, who spoke to the press outside the ranch and asked to only be identified by her first name for safety.

“What we want is to stop all of this, the disappearances,” she said. “We hope that this time they'll do the work as they should.”

There are more than 120,000 disappeared people in Mexico, according to the government's tally. Search collectives like the Jalisco Search Warriors have had to organize to do the work that authorities often will not do. They search for sites like the one in Teuchitlan, sometimes with government protection, but more often without, then make their discoveries known to pressure authorities into doing their jobs.

This time it worked.

Jalisco State Prosecutor Salvador González de los Santos visited the ranch personally Tuesday. He said that investigators had found six groups of bones, but it was unclear how many victims they could belong to. He did not provide details on why investigators had previously failed to find what the untrained private citizens did, but said the previous efforts “were insufficient.”

His office posted photos of all of the evidence located hoping that relatives might identify an item of clothing.

Jalisco Gov. Pablo Lemus announced Wednesday that the federal Attorney General's Office would take over the investigation as requested by Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum. The Jalisco New Generation cartel is the dominant criminal organization in the state.

On Thursday, white government vehicles ringed the isolated ranch of squat buildings enclosed by a tall wall and fields.

“This ranch served as a training site and even though it sounds awful, really harsh, for extermination,” said collective leader Indira Navarro, earlier this week.

She blamed the state's previous Gov. Enrique Alfaro for “trying to hide this kind of situation or discovery.” And she asked aloud how state investigators with technology and training could have failed to find what her group did “with pick, shovel and metal bar.”

On Wednesday, the Mexican Episcopal Conference said in a statement that it was troubled by the discovery of the site, which points to an “irresponsible omission” on the part of authorities at all three levels of government and another sign of the larger problem of Mexico's disappeared.

GENEVA (AP) — United Nations-backed human rights experts on Thursday accused Israel of “the systematic use of sexual, reproductive and other gender-based violence” in its war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

The allegations came in one of the most extensive reports of its kind on the issue since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel ignited the war.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out at the Human Rights Council, a U.N.-backed body that commissioned the team of independent experts, as an “anti-Israel circus” that “has long been exposed as an antisemitic, rotten, terrorist-supporting, and irrelevant body.” His statement did not address the findings themselves.

The findings by the Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which seeks to document in minute detail the allegations and evidence of crimes to bolster accountability for perpetrators, could be used by prosecutors at the International Criminal Court or in other jurisdictions to try to bring justice to victims and their relatives. 

In its report released Thursday, the commission examined the widespread destruction of Gaza, the use of heavy explosives in civilian areas and Israeli attacks on hospitals and health facilities. It said all three led to “disproportionate violence against women and children.”

The commission documented a range of violations perpetrated against Palestinian women, men, girls and boys and accused Israeli security forces of rape and sexual violence against Palestinian detainees. Israel denies any systematic abuse of prisoners and says it takes action when there are violations.




“Our report finds that Israel has increasingly employed sexual, reproductive, and other forms of gender-based violence against Palestinians as part of a broader effort to undermine their right to self-determination,” Chris Sidoti, a member of the commission, told reporters in Geneva.

Israel's mission in Geneva rejected the allegations and accused the commission of relying on “second-hand, single, uncorroborated sources.” Since the commission was set up in 2021 — long before the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel — Israel has refused to cooperate with it, accusing the investigative team and the council of bias.

Commission member Sidoti said the report “also concludes that Israel has carried out genocidal acts through the systematic destruction of sexual and reproductive health care facilities.” 

The commission stopped short of accusing Israel of genocide, as some advocacy groups and other rights experts have. Israel, which was established in the wake of the Nazi Holocaust and is home to many survivors and their families, has vigorously denied such allegations. 

Israel says it took extraordinary measures to avoid harming civilians in the 15-month war, which has been paused by a fragile ceasefire. It blames civilian deaths and destruction on Hamas because the militants operate in residential areas. Israeli forces carried out a number of raids on hospitals, accusing Hamas of using them for military purposes, allegations denied by Palestinian health officials.

Pointing to the report, a Hamas statement urged international courts to prosecute Israel's leaders.

The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his former defense minister, accusing them of war crimes, which they deny. The court also issued a warrant in November for Hamas' military leader, but the militants have since confirmed that he was killed.

The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages.

Israeli authorities, citing eyewitness accounts and other evidence, have accused Hamas-led militants of widespread rape and sexual violence. Israeli experts who have treated former hostages say some were subjected to physical and sexual abuse in captivity. 

A U.N. envoy last year reported “reasonable grounds” to believe such allegations. 

Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, the commission held public hearings with victims, lawyers, advocacy groups and others whose accounts were included in the report.

The commission was not considering allegations of sexual, gender-based and other violence committed against Israelis during the Oct. 7 attack or against hostages in Gaza, but reported on the issue last year.

Speaking to students in Tehran in a televised address Wednesday, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged that the U.S. is ready for talks, but said Iran is “not ready” to negotiate.

A letter U.S. President Donald Trump wrote to Iran's supreme leader in an attempt to jump-start talks over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program has arrived in the Iranian capital. While the text of the letter hasn't been published, its arrival comes as Trump levied new sanctions on Iran as part of his “maximum pressure” campaign targeting the country.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A letter U.S. President Donald Trump wrote to Iran's supreme leader in an attempt to jump-start talks over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program has arrived in the Iranian capital. 

While the text of the letter hasn't been published, its arrival comes as Trump levied new sanctions on Iran as part of his “maximum pressure” campaign targeting the country. He also suggested military action against Iran remained a possibility, while emphasizing he still believed a new deal could be reached. 

Iran's 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has mocked Trump, but officials in his country also have offered conflicting signals over whether negotiations could take place. 

Here's what to know about the letter, Iran's nuclear program and the overall tensions that have stalked relations between Tehran and Washington since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. 

Trump dispatched the letter to Khamenei on March 5, then gave a television interview the next day in which he acknowledged sending it. He said: “I've written them a letter saying, ‘I hope you're going to negotiate because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing.'” Since returning to the White House, the president has been pushing for talks while simultaneously ratcheting up sanctions and suggesting a military strike by Israel or the U.S. could target Iranian nuclear sites. 

A previous letter from Trump during his first term drew an angry retort from the supreme leader.

But Trump's letters to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in his first term led to face-to-face meetings, though no deals to limit Pyongyang's atomic bombs and a missile program capable of reaching the continental U.S.




Iran has offered a series of seemingly contradictory responses. Khamenei himself said he wasn't interested in talks with a “bullying government.” 

But Iranian diplomats including Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi earlier suggested that talks over guarantees that Tehran wouldn't seek a nuclear weapon could be possible. Araghchi, who took part in negotiations for Iran's 2015 nuclear deal, later toughened his tone and said talks couldn't happen under U.S. pressure, following Khamenei's lead. 

However, Araghchi still met with the Emirati diplomat carrying Trump's letter. 

Meanwhile, Iran's Foreign Ministry on Thursday summoned ambassadors from France and Germany, as well as the British chargé d'affaires, to complain about them backing a closed-door Security Council meeting Wednesday at the United Nations. 

Iran has insisted for decades that its nuclear program is peaceful. However, its officials increasingly threaten to pursue a nuclear weapon. Iran now enriches uranium to near weapons-grade levels of 60%, the only country in the world without a nuclear weapons program to do so. 

Under the original 2015 nuclear deal, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity and to maintain a uranium stockpile of 300 kilograms (661 pounds). The last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency on Iran's program put its stockpile at 8,294.4 kilograms (18,286 pounds) as it enriches a fraction of it to 60% purity.

U.S. intelligence agencies assess that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program, but has “undertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so.”

Iran was once one of the U.S.'s top allies in the Mideast under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who purchased American military weapons and allowed CIA technicians to run secret listening posts monitoring the neighboring Soviet Union. The CIA had fomented a 1953 coup that cemented the shah's rule. 

But in January 1979, the shah, fatally ill with cancer, fled Iran as mass demonstrations swelled against his rule. The Islamic Revolution followed, led by Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and created Iran's theocratic government. 

Later that year, university students overran the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, seeking the shah's extradition and sparking the 444-day hostage crisis that saw diplomatic relations between Iran and the U.S. severed. The Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s saw the U.S. back Saddam Hussein. The “Tanker War” during that conflict saw the U.S. launch a one-day assault that crippled Iran at sea, while the U.S. later shot down an Iranian commercial airliner. 

Iran and the U.S. have see-sawed between enmity and grudging diplomacy in the years since, with relations peaking when Tehran made a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. But Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the accord, sparking years of tensions in the Mideast that persist today.

The 79-year-old Duterte, the first Asian former leader arrested on an ICC warrant, was read his rights and formally informed of the charges of crimes against humanity that the court's prosecutors filed against him after a lengthy investigation.

Harry Roque, also a lawyer seeking to represent him in the ICC case, said the question of jurisdiction over the Philippines, which withdrew from the global court when Duterte was president, should be addressed before any further proceedings.

Sara Duterte spoke outside the court, telling reporters she expected the ICC to “give us permission” to visit her father and hoped the court would “allow our request to move the initial appearance.” The 79-year-old Duterte, the first Asian former leader arrested on an ICC warrant, will be read his rights and formally informed of the crimes against humanity charge that the court's prosecutors filed against him after a lengthy investigation.

Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was being flown to the Netherlands on Wednesday to face an International Criminal Court charge of crimes against humanity linked to the deadly crackdown on drugs he oversaw while in office.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Jailed former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte appeared Friday by videoconference before judges at the International Criminal Court, days after his arrest in Manila on murder charges linked to the deadly “ war on drugs ” that he oversaw while in office.

The 79-year-old Duterte didn't show up at the court in The Hague, but appeared on a video screen from the detention center where he is being held, about a mile (1½ kilometers) away.

For families of victims of the drugs crackdown, Duterte's appearance in court was a long-awaited sign of hope. Duterte's vocal supporters call the arrest illegal. 

His lawyer, Salvador Medialdea, used the hearing to slam his arrest in Manila as a “pure and simple kidnapping.” He said Duterte “was denied all access to the legal recourse in the country of his citizenship, and this all in the nature of political score-settling.”

Presiding Judge Iulia Antoanella Motoc set a pretrial hearing date of Sept. 23 to establish if prosecution evidence is strong enough to merit sending the case to trial. If a trial does go ahead, it could take years, and if Duterte is convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

Estimates of the death toll during Duterte's presidential term vary, from the more than 6,000 that the national police have reported and up to 30,000, according to numbers from human rights groups.




The ICC judge said that Duterte had been allowed to participate in his first hearing by videoconference because he had just come off a long flight.

AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is scheduled to stand before judges today at the International Criminal Court, days after his stunning arrest in Manila on murder charges.

Duterte, wearing a jacket and tie, listened to the hearing through headphones, often with his eyes closed. He spoke in English to confirm his name, and his date and place of birth. He was not required to enter a plea. The hearing, which started about a half-hour late, lasted around 30 minutes.

Medialdea said that Duterte had been under observation at a hospital because of health issues. 

The judge, addressing Duterte, said: “The court doctor was of the opinion that you were fully mentally aware and fit.”

Duterte was arrested Tuesday amid chaotic scenes in the Philippine capital after returning from a visit to Hong Kong. He was swiftly put on a chartered jet and flown to the Netherlands.

His daughter, Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte, visited him in the court's detention center Friday and met with supporters outside the court. Duterte is a political rival of the current president.

She said her father is ″in good spirits″ and ″well taken care of,″ and his only complaint about his conditions is that he misses Filipino food. 

She too decried what she called a political arrest. ″There will be a day of reckoning for all,″ she said, as excited crowds around her chanted ″Duterte!″ and ″yes, yes!″

Meanwhile, activists marched in the Philippine capital region, demanding justice for the thousands of suspects killed in Duterte's brutal crackdowns. Families of those killed watched the ICC proceedings on screens set up around the country, some holding portraits of their slain loved ones, as they listened to charges read out against Duterte in a courtroom across the world.

Prosecutors accuse Duterte of involvement as an “indirect co-perpetrator” in multiple murders, amounting to a crime against humanity for allegedly overseeing killings from November 2011 until March 2019, first while he was mayor of the southern city of Davao and later as president of the Philippines.

According to the prosecution request for his arrest, Duterte, as Davao mayor, issued orders to police and other “hitmen” who formed so-called Davao Death Squads, or DDS.

He told them “that their mission was to kill criminals, including drug dealers, and provided clearance for specific DDS killings,” prosecutors allege, adding that he recruited, paid and rewarded the killers and “provided them with the necessary weapons and resources, and promised to shield them from prosecution.”

The document seeking an ICC warrant for Duterte said that prosecutors built their case using evidence including witness testimony, speeches by Duterte himself, government documents and video footage.

Human rights groups and victims' families have hailed Duterte's arrest as a historic triumph against state impunity, while the former president's supporters have slammed what they call the government's surrender of a political rival to a court whose jurisdiction they dispute.

“We are happy and we feel relieved,” said 55-year-old Melinda Abion Lafuente, mother of 22-year-old Angelo Lafuente, who she said was tortured and killed in 2016.

“Duterte's appearance before the ICC is a testament to the courage and determination of the victims, their families, and Filipino activists and journalists to pursue justice no matter how long it takes,” said Bryony Lau, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Other leaders facing ICC arrest warrants, like (Russian President) Vladimir Putin and (Israeli Prime Minister) Benjamin Netanyahu, should take note that even those who seem untouchable today can end up in The Hague.”

Duterte's legal team said that Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s administration shouldn't have allowed the global court to take custody of the former leader because the Philippines is no longer a party to the ICC.

Medialdea said that “two troubled entities struck an unlikely alliance. An incumbent president who wishes to neutralize and choke the legacy of my client and his daughter,” and “a troubled legal institution subject to delegitimization.”

Judges who approved Duterte's arrest warrant said that the court has jurisdiction because the crimes alleged in the warrant were committed before Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the court in 2019.

ISTANBUL (AP) — Turkey's top diplomat, defense minister and intelligence chief paid a sudden visit to Damascus on Thursday, days after Syria's interim government reached a deal to integrate a U.S backed Kurdish-led armed group into the country's army.

The agreement to integrate the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, into the Syrian government followed fierce clashes that erupted last week between government security forces and gunmen loyal to ousted leader Bashar Assad.

Monitoring groups said hundreds of civilians were killed in the violence in Syria's coastal communities, primarily targeting members of the Alawite religious minority to which Assad belongs.

Ahmad al-Sharaa, Syria's interim president and a former rebel, met with Hakan Fidan, Turkey's foreign minister; Yasar Guler, defense minister, and Ibrahim Kalin, head of national intelligence. They were accompanied by Turkey's ambassador to Syria, Burhan Koroglu.

According to local news agency DHA, an official from the Turkish Defense Ministry, speaking on the customary condition of anonymity, said earlier Thursday that Ankara intends to examine “how the agreement reached will be implemented and its reflections on the field.”

The official added that Turkey's expectations on Syria have not changed.

“There is no change in our expectations for the termination of terrorist activities in Syria, the disarmament of terrorists and the expulsion of foreign terrorists from Syria,” the official said.




Turkey designates the SDF and its military arm, People's Protection Units, as terrorist organizations because of their links to the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party.

As the Turkish delegation was flying unannounced to Damascus, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan presented awards for “benevolence and kindness” to a former Syrian fighter pilot imprisoned for 43 years.

The ceremony, hosted by a foundation linked to Turkey's religious authority, honored Ragheed al-Tatari. Erdogan praised al-Tatari for his perseverance and gave him an award for his “benevolence.”

Al-Tatari was imprisoned under the rule of Syrian presidents Hafez al-Assad and later Bashar al-Assad. He had been detained since 1981. There are conflicting accounts for his imprisonment including refusing to bomb the city of Hama and failing to report a pilot desertion attempt.

Over four decades, al-Tatari was moved among prisons notorious for housing political inmates, including Palmyra prison and Sednaya. His imprisonment, described by human rights groups as one of the longest in Syria for a political prisoner, ended in December when opposition forces freed him.

In a speech on stage, Erdogan lauded al-Tatari, calling him “the brave Syrian pilot who listened to his conscience.”

BANGKOK (AP) — The United Nations food agency said on Friday that more than 1 million people in the war-torn nation of Myanmar will be cut off from food assistance due to critical funding shortfalls.

A statement released by the World Food Program said that most food rations currently distributed in Myanmar will be cut off in April, even as the country faces a desperate humanitarian crisis caused by bitter fighting between the military government and powerful militias opposed to its rule. The WFP said it would need $60 million to continue food assistance in Myanmar and called on its partners to identify additional funding.

It was not immediately clear if the WFP's decision was directly related to the Trump administration's recent moves to stop most foreign aid and dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, which have had wide-ranging effects on humanitarian efforts around the globe. 

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric, asked whether the Myanmar funding cuts were a result of the U.S. cuts, told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York: “It's all co-mingled,” stressing that the U.S. is a big funder of WFP. 

He said all U.N. agencies are actively engaging with U.S. authorities “to explain to them the damage — the immediate damage that's been done.”

A 90-day freeze on foreign assistance programs announced by U.S. President Donald Trump has led to other cuts in services for refugees from Myanmar, including the shutdown of hospital care in camps in neighboring Thailand where more than 100,000 are living, according to activists and Thai officials.




The U.S. has been a “core contributor in the food security and livelihood sector in Myanmar,” and there was already a shortfall last year with humanitarian needs only about 40% funded, said a senior leader in the aid sector based in Asia, who spoke on condition of anonymity to freely discuss the issue.

The new cuts, she said, have created a “devastating situation,” forcing NGOs to abandon many programs, hitting vulnerable populations like people with disabilities, women and children the hardest, she said. 

“The lifesaving work must continue,” she said. “It's just not possible for us to stop that because if we stop it means people will not survive. But the funding gap we're facing has forced us to close programs that are the lifeline, I think, for many people, in Myanmar.”

The nationwide armed conflict in Myanmar began after the army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021 and suppressed widespread nonviolent protests that sought a return to democratic rule.

In Friday's statement, the WFP said 15.2 million people, nearly one-third of the total population, are unable to meet their minimum daily food needs, and some 2.3 million face emergency levels of hunger.

The WFP said it will only be able to assist 35,000 of the most vulnerable people, including children under the age of 5, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and people living with disabilities.

“The impending cuts will have a devastating impact on the most vulnerable communities across the country, many of whom depend entirely on WFP's support to survive,” said Michael Dunford, WFP's Representative and Country Director in Myanmar. “WFP remains steadfast in its commitment to support the people of Myanmar, but more immediate funding is crucial to continue reaching those in need.”

The WFP said the cuts will also impact almost 100,000 internally displaced people, including Rohingya communities in camps in Myanmar's western state of Rakhine, who will have no access to food without WFP assistance.

The Rohingya, a Muslim minority, have long been persecuted in Buddhist-majority Myanmar. More than 700,000 have fled from Myanmar to refugee camps in Bangladesh since August 2017, when the military launched a clearance operation against the minority in response to attacks by a rebel group.

More than 600,000 Rohingya remain in Myanmar, confined to squalid displacement camps, in addition to those living in crowded refugee camps in Bangladesh. Still, more have fled toward Bangladesh and elsewhere in recent months as violence surged again when a group called the Arakan Army started fighting against Myanmar's security forces.

The southern Italian city of Naples was struck by a 4.4-magnitude quake early Thursday that caused only minor damage and sent 11 people to hospital, officials said.

ROME (AP) — The southern Italian city of Naples was struck by a 4.4-magnitude quake early Thursday that caused only minor damage and sent 11 people to the hospital, the most serious suffering contusions after part of a ceiling collapsed, officials said.

The quake was the strongest in recorded history around the Phlegrean Fields, a sprawling area of ancient volcanoes that covers a broad swath of the Naples metropolitan area. It matched the magnitude of another quake in the same area last May that has put the population on alert.

Residents shaken awake by the early-morning quake sought safety in the streets, as they did in May.

The temblor, which loosened stone and cement from some facades, was centered just offshore from Pozzuoli, a seaside suburb bordering Naples. Mayor Gaetano Manfredi told reporters that one church, a seven-story residential building and another building were declared off-limits due to damage, and some schools were closed as a precaution.

Inspectors were checking buildings for further damage, Manfredi said. “We are following with the greatest attention all of our structures, and are monitoring all events in real time,'' the mayor said.

In all, 11 people sought hospital treatment. One woman was injured after part of a ceiling fell, and several others suffered cuts from glass that broke in the quake, Manfredi said. 

Seismologists have reported a fresh increase in activity around the Phlegrean Fields over recent weeks. Authorities last summer conducted drills in preparation for a major emergency as the frequency of temblors increased.

The area around the Phlegrean Fields, which encompasses western neighborhoods of Naples and its suburbs, is both seismically and volcanically active. The surface has been pushed up 1.3 meters (4.3 feet) since 2006, which is higher than prior to the last major event in 1984, but seismologists have emphasized it is impossible to predict when an eruption or stronger quake might occur.

At least 500,000 people live in the zone most at risk should the volcano erupt. Italy's national institute for geophysics and vulcanology has called for a governmental plan to ensure that structures can withstand a quake of at least a magnitude 5.0.

During the 1984 event, 40,000 residents were evacuated during a period of intense seismic activity as a precaution against a feared eruption that did not occur.

        The trilateral meeting in Beijing came after Donald Trump wrote to Iran's supreme leader aiming to restart negotiations over the nuclear issue.
    

China, Russia and Iran have jointly called on the US and the West to lift sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear enrichment programme.

At a meeting in Beijing on Friday, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu held talks with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov and Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Kazoo Gharibabadi. 

The three called for a termination of US sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program in a joint statement read by China's Ma. 

The talks came after Trump wrote a letter to Iran's supreme leader in an attempt to restart discussions of how to limit Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear programme.

While Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has openly mocked Trump's diplomatic outreach, saying he isn't interested in talks with a ""bullying government"". 

However, Iran's participation in talks with China and Russia to urge the US to lift sanctions seems to contradict his stance.

China and Russia have particularly close relations with Iran thanks to various energy supply deals, while Iran has provided Russia with so-called kamikaze drones in its war against Ukraine. All three countries are members of the BRICS alliance.

China and Russia were also both parties to the original 2015 deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, to limit Iran's nuclear enrichment programme in exchange for sanctions relief.

Trump withdrew the US from the arrangement during his first term in office, complaining it was a ""bad deal"".

        Next week, the EU Commission will present the White Paper on the Future of European Defence, with guidelines on how to boost production and defence readiness in the face of possible Russian military aggression.
    

Member states must spend more, better and European, EU Commissioner for Defence Andrius Kubilius and the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas urge in a draft of the upcoming White Paper on the Future of European Defence, seen by Euronews. 

“Rebuilding European defence requires a massive investment over a sustained period,” the Commissioners argue, adding that only through joint initiatives and coordination will EU countries be able to make a difference. 

In 2024, member states reached a record investment of €326 billion, but the latest estimates indicate that at least €500 billion will be needed to plug the bloc's critical capability gaps over the next decade. 

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen presented a five-point plan last week to rearm the continent, detailing how to mobilise up to €800 billion over the coming years. This includes a new instrument of €150 billion in loans for member states to spend on joint procurement for defence and security. 

Now, the EU executive will also consider reviewing the bloc's Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation (SFDR) to assess whether defence can be considered “an investment goal in the sustainability framework.” 

Creating a single market for defence, simplifying rules, and benefiting from economies of scale by working together are additional ways the Commission proposes to make more efficient use of the available funds. 

“Coordinating spending boosts member states' bargaining power, lowers prices per unit, and strengthens industrial consolidation,” the 20-page document says. 

Kallas and Kubilius advocate for collaborative procurement and large-scale pan-European defence projects to go hand in hand in the coming years, leaving member states the power to decide on the format and purpose – i.e., to address which critical capability shortfalls. 

The Commission has identified seven key critical capability projects, covering areas such as military mobility, drones and counter-drone systems, AI, quantum, cyber and electronic warfare, and air and missile defence. 

The EU executive will also consider introducing a European preference into public procurement rules for strategic defence-related sectors and technologies, likely to be reviewed in 2026. 

The ultimate goal of simplifying rules, cutting red tape, and promoting more joint purchases and production is to create a true European single market for defence, addressing the long-standing fragmentation of a predominantly national-focused market. 

Von der Leyen's second-mandate aspirations include creating “one of the largest domestic defence markets in the world,” aimed at boosting competitiveness, defence readiness, and industrial scale to help the bloc compete with global players such as China and the US. 

The white paper – still subject to change – also asserts that Europe must urgently rearm itself, as it faces medium-term challenges beyond Russia's potential military aggression, particularly in the unstable greater Middle East. 

As the new US administration increasingly shifts its attention towards the Indo-Pacific, “Europe cannot take the US security guarantee for granted and must substantially step up its contribution to preserve NATO strong,” the paper reads. 

Reducing dependencies on third countries, especially in the global technology race, is another priority highlighted by the EU Commissioners. 

Disruptive technologies such as AI, cloud and quantum computing, and autonomous systems are already shaping the battlefield, the paper warns, adding that the EU's strategic competitors are heavily investing in these areas. 

“While dependencies from Russia have been significantly reduced, many member states still heavily depend on technologies from third countries, including China and the US,” the paper says.

        A raft of new national security measures was needed in response to China's increased efforts to undermine the island's security, says Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te.
    

Taiwan's leader William Lai Ching-te has called China a ""hostile foreign force"" while setting out a raft of new national security measures.

In a speech on Thursday, the island's president said he would reinstate a military court system for crimes such as spying, and tighten residency criteria for those from China, Hong Kong and Macau.

His speech drew an immediate reaction from Beijing, who called Lai a ""destroyer of cross-Straits peace"" and a ""creator of crisis"". 

China views self-ruled Taiwan as its own territory, while Taiwan sees itself as a separate entity from the Chinese mainland. 

Lai explained that his measures came in response to a recent string of spying incidents involving China. 

""We need to step up our legal safeguards to prevent and detect such incidents,"" he said.

Beijing had tried to ""subvert, obtain secrets, lure members of the armed forces and influence public opinion"", Lai added.

A re-established military court system would see the prosecution of crimes including sedition, aiding the enemy, leaking confidential information, dereliction of duty and disobedience. 

On Wednesday, Taiwan's Defence Ministry confirmed that a retired air force major had leaked classified military intelligence to China in exchange for payment. 

Taiwan's government expelled the Chinese wife of a Taiwanese citizen this week, after the woman repeatedly posted short clips on social media praising Beijing's leadership and claiming China could conquer Taiwan in half an hour. 

The island has been bulking up its defences in response to Chinese expansionist rhetoric, including adding new missiles and US tanks and planes, along with self-made submarines. 

It also recently extended the length of mandatory national military service for all men from four months to one year.

        Russia is stalling on agreeing to a US-Ukraine backed interim ceasefire, a move Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called ""deliberate"".
    

US President Donald Trump on Friday said he had ""good, productive"" talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, amid a push to get Russia to sign on to a US-backed ceasefire proposal in Ukraine.

""There is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end,"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. 

Trump's comments come after the Kremlin confirmed US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff left Moscow without an immediate agreement to cease fighting.

Putin publicly stalled on Thursday in agreeing to an interim 30-day ceasefire proposal brokered by the US, which would see a ceasefire and a pause in combat in Russia's ongoing all-out invasion of Ukraine, including in the Black Sea and across the frontline.

Putin said that although the ""idea"" of a ceasefire was correct, there were many unanswered questions — highlighting the Russian region of Kursk, where Ukrainian troops launched a surprise incursion last year. 

""Will all those (Ukrainian troops) who are there come out without a fight? Or will the Ukrainian leadership order them to lay down arms and surrender?"" Putin asked on Thursday. 

For his part, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Putin of ""deliberately"" dragging out the peace process on Friday, reiterating several key elements of the deal set out by Ukraine and the US — including the return of prisoners and Ukrainian children forcibly transferred to Russia. 

""Ukraine seeks peace and spares no effort to achieve it as soon as possible,"" Zelenskyy said. 

Trump also claimed in the same post on Truth Social that thousands of Ukrainian troops are ""completely surrounded"" by the Russian military, without providing evidence.

""I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared,"" Trump said, apparently referring to Russia's Kursk.

Ukraine's General Staff pushed back on claims that troops were ""encircled"", saying that reports of encirclement were ""fabricated ... for political manipulation and to exert pressure on Ukraine and its partners.""

Ukraine's troops had successfully regrouped, and the situation remained largely unchanged over the past few days, Ukraine's General Staff said.

        Chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz wants to alter Germany's strict fiscal rules to massively boost defence spending, the Greens are standing in his way.
    

Germany's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leader Friedrich Merz on Thursday made concessions to the Green Party in the hopes it would lend critically important votes to his multi-billion-euro spending spree.

Merz and the CDU, alongside would-be coalition partners, the Social Democratic Party (SPD), unveiled their plans last week to lift Germany's ""debt brake"", which was written into Germany's constitution in 2009 at the height of the global financial crisis. It tightly restricts the government's ability to borrow new money. 

Over the years, the country's strict fiscal rules have created headaches for successive governments as they tried to raise funds to respond to crises. It was suspended in 2020 as the state tried to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, and in 2024, a spat over its reform led to the breakdown of the country's three-party ruling coalition. 

Last week, the CDU and the SPD proposed exempting defence spending that exceeds 1% of Germany's GDP from the debt brake, which currently sets the structural deficit at a maximum of 0.35% of the country's GDP. 

The proposal would also set up a €500 billion fund to invest in Germany's creaking infrastructure over the next decade, as well as loosen borrowing rules for Germany's sixteen states. 

But the Greens, who have long argued for reform of the debt brake, are now standing in Merz's way. Although the party supports changing the debt brake, it argues the proposals on the table do not address the need to invest in Germany's clean energy transition. 

The Greens have offered their own draft law, one which expands the definition of ""defence"" and draws more on funds from within the government's current budget. 

On Thursday, Merz and the SPD attempted to appease the Greens by offering to divert €50 billion of the special funds into the Climate Transformation Fund, a multi-year federal budget set up to finance climate and energy transition policy measures. 

Merz also conceded that the scope of defence spending would be expanded to include civil defence and intelligence spending. 

“What more do you want from us in so short a time?” Merz demanded. 

The Greens, however, stuck to their criticism, with party parliamentary group leader Katharina Dröge arguing on Thursday that ""shifting of billions"" from one fund to another should not be the purpose of the draft law, arguing that the word ""additional"" be added to the proposal.

The party say they fear that without safeguards such as the word ""additional"" added, the money kicked up through the proposal will simply be used to fulfil the campaign promises of the CDU and the SPD.

Merz and the SPD are deeply dependent on votes from the Greens to pass the proposal through the country's old parliament as adjusting the debt brake requires a majority vote of two-thirds of the parliament. 

The new makeup of the Bundestag — which is set to convene 25 March — would mean that without the Greens on board, Merz would need votes from the Alternative for Germany (AfD) and The Left to push forward the measure.

But both of these parties were so opposed to the debt brake proposal that they filed urgent lawsuits to the country's Constitutional Court to prevent the debate from taking place. 

Adjusting the debt brake has general approval from the country's economists, with disagreement primarily lying in the wording of the government's proposals. 

Jens Südekum, who alongside three other economists brainstormed the proposal upon which the CDU and SPD's plans are based, said that the word ""additionality"" is missing to make the proposals more robust. 

""We really need to make sure if we have this debt break reform that the additional money only flows to military and infrastructure,"" Südekum told Euronews. ""We need to make a very strong commitment to say: OK, all of the money goes additionally into infrastructure, investment and military.""

Influential economist Veronika Grimm of the German Council of Economic Experts has also expressed concern over the proposals, telling domestic media that the problem with the measures is in their ""design"".

""There is a risk that their negative effects will outweigh the positive ones, thus counteracting the intended effect,"" Grimm wrote in an open letter to the Bundestag budget committee. 

Südekum told Euronews that while the Greens are making trouble for Merz and the SPD, the biggest catastrophe would still be if no package and adjustment is agreed at all. 

""We (Germany) have been stagnating for five years. We are entering dirty tariff wars with the US, geopolitical tensions, and Donald Trump doesn't negotiate with losers. So, we only can basically push through our interest if we bargain from a position of economic strength,"" Südekum said. 

Merz himself has framed the multi-million-euro package as vital ""in light of the threats to our freedom and peace on the continent.""

""The world is watching,"" Merz said on Thursday, as the clock ticked down and the Greens showed no sign of falling in line with the bill. 

He faces several days of negotiating with the Greens in order to get the party on board with his proposals ahead of a vote on the 18 March. 

The bill must also pass through the Bundesrat, or Germany's upper house, which represents the governments of the country's 16 states. There, the CDU, SPD and Greens would need the backing of one more party for the bill to pass.

Gaza's children lost over a year of education due to war damage, with many struggling to resume learning through rebuilt schools and online platforms.

For 15 months, Gaza's children were unable to attend school as the ongoing conflict left schools destroyed or repurposed as shelters for displaced families. 

The Israel-Hamas war has resulted in hundreds of thousands of children losing at least one academic year. 

Despite the devastating impact, efforts to rehabilitate schools began after the January ceasefire. 

""We're trying to salvage what we can of the educational process,"" said Mohamed al-Asouli, head of the education department in Gaza's southern city of Khan Younis.

With 95% of schools damaged, 785,000 students have been affected, many struggling with online learning due to electricity and internet shortages.","{'href': 'https://www.euronews.com', 'title': 'Euronews'}"

        Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev told Euronews that global stability is unlikely in the coming months or even years, stressing the need for realistic expectations about resolving major conflicts.
    

In today's fast-changing world, global stability won't be achieved in the coming months, or even years, Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev told Euronews.

Addressing what he called the ""global transformations of the moment"" at the Global Baku Forum in the Azerbaijani capital on Thursday, Aliyev said that the world has entered ""a phase of elaboration of new rules and regulations"". 

""The old world order seems to no longer be here. So what will be the new configuration of the international community's interaction, nobody knows. There are different opinions.""

""But what is absolutely clear is that every country should be more concentrated on its own capability, not to rely on any kind of assistance or even not to rely on international law,"" the Azerbaijani leader explained.

Furthermore, Aliyev said he preferred to be “realistic, not optimistic” about the ability of key world actors to find solutions to major conflicts, particularly when it comes to Russia's war in Ukraine.

“Even if the war stops, there's no guarantee it will not erupt again,” the Azerbaijani leader explained.

“We had a time for almost 30 years when we had a ceasefire agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia, which was achieved in spring 1994, but that did not mean that the war ended. It just transformed. And the war only ends when you have a peace agreement,” Aliyev said.

The region of South Caucasus has experienced “confrontation and hostility” for decades, he pointed out. Today, “it's important to protect the region from any crises around us,” Aliyev added.

“Now we have relatively quiet periods, so we need to concentrate on that to build security mechanisms that will be inclusive, to eliminate any threat of another military confrontation and to try to live in the neighbourhood, as we used to in the times of the Soviet Union.”

Azerbaijan, together with other countries of the region, was one of the USSR's 15 socialist republics when it declared independence in October 1991. While Aliyev acknowledged that not being independent meant none of the countries of the region could plan their future, he highlighted that the republics did maintain “active interaction”.

Speaking on Baku's current state of relations with neighbouring Armenia, the Azerbaijani president said that “a big advantage of today's situation” can be seen in the quiet period of the past five years.

However, stability only comes through agreement, he pointed out.

“Until a peace agreement is signed the stability is not here,” Aliyev concluded.

        The announcement comes as talks continue in Doha to try to broker the second stage of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, the first phase of which ended two weeks ago.
    

The militant group Hamas has said it has accepted a proposal from mediators to release one living American-Israeli hostage and the bodies of four dual-national hostages who died in captivity.

Hamas did not immediately specify when it would release the bodies and the hostage soldier, identified as Edan Alexander. Other countries party to the agreement did not immediately confirm the Hamas statement.

The announcement comes as talks continue in Doha to try to broker the second stage of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, the first phase of which ended two weeks ago.

In a separate statement, Hamas official Husam Badran reaffirmed what he said was Hamas' commitment to fully implementing the ceasefire agreement in all its phases, warning that any Israeli deviation from the terms would return negotiations to square one.

Israel is pressing the militant group to accept an extension of the first phase of the ceasefire.

Hamas wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire's more difficult second phase, which would see the release of remaining hostages from Gaza and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the strip.

The war in Gaza broke out on 7 October 2023, following a surprise Hamas-led attack on southern Israel which left more than 1,100 people dead and around 250 others taken hostage back to Gaza.

The subsequent Israeli military operation has devastated much of the coastal enclave. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry puts the Palestinian death toll at more than 48,000, a figure that does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.

The United Nations estimates that around 69% of all structures in Gaza have been destroyed, including at least 245,000 homes.

After weeks of faltering negotiations mediated by the US, Egypt and Qatar, Israel and Hamas agreed to a three-phase ceasefire deal, the first six-week stage of which started on 19 January.

Phase one saw Hamas release 33 Israeli hostages, plus five Thai nationals outside the deal. In exchange, Israel released almost 2,000 Palestinians from prisons across Israel.

The negotiations for phase two, which was also due to run for six weeks, were supposed to start two weeks into phase one, but they remain in limbo.

China and Russia stood by Iran on Friday after the United States demanded nuclear talks with Tehran, with senior Chinese and Russian diplomats saying dialog should only resume based on ""mutual respect"" and all sanctions ought to be lifted.In a joint statement issued after talks with Iran in Beijing, China and Russia also said they welcomed Iran's reiteration that its nuclear program was exclusively for peaceful purposes, and that Tehran's right to peaceful uses of nuclear energy should be ""fully"" respected.  In 2015, Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions in a deal with the US, Russia, China, Britain, France, and Germany. However, in 2018, Donald Trump, a year into his first term as US president, pulled out of the pact.""(China, Russia and Iran) emphasized that the relevant parties should be committed to addressing the root cause of the current situation and abandoning sanction, pressure or threat of force,"" China's Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu told reporters after the meeting. AdvertisementChina, Russia, and Iran also emphasized the necessity of terminating all ""unlawful"" unilateral sanctions, Ma said. Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baqaee speaks during a press conference in Tehran, Iran, October 21, 2024. (credit: MAJID ASGARIPOUR/WANA (WEST ASIA NEWS AGENCY) VIA REUTERS)Ma's meeting with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi came days after Tehran spurned US ""orders"" to resume dialogue over the nuclear program. 'Two ways Iran can be handled'Last week, Trump said he had sent a letter to Iran's Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei proposing nuclear talks, adding that ""there are two ways Iran can be handled: militarily, or you make a deal.""Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian responded that he would not negotiate with the US while being ""threatened,"" and Iran would not bow to U.S. ""orders"" to talk.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Iran was further enraged after six of the United Nations Security Council's 15 members - the US, France, Greece, Panama, South Korea, and Britain - held a closed-door meeting this week to discuss its nuclear program. Tehran said the meeting was a ""misuse"" of the U.N. Security Council. AdvertisementThat meeting was also criticized by China, with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi saying on Friday that the ""hasty"" intervention by the Council was not helpful in building trust.Despite Tehran's defiant rhetoric, engaging with the US to hammer out a nuclear deal may be the more pragmatic option, with crippling sanctions weighing on the Iranian economy and stoking public unrest, according to Iranian officials.Nuclear programIran has long denied that it is working on developing a nuclear weapon. But the International Atomic Energy Agency said last month that Iran was ""dramatically"" accelerating enrichment of uranium to near the roughly 90% weapons-grade level.  In February, Trump restored his ""maximum pressure"" campaign on Iran that includes efforts to drive its oil exports down to zero in order to stop it from obtaining a nuclear weapon.""The Iranian nuclear program is peaceful in nature,"" said Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Gharibabadi on Friday.""It is under the surveillance of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Iran is receiving huge inspections from the IAEA, and our nuclear program has never been diverted to non-peaceful purposes.""The main root cause of the current situation is the unilateral US withdrawal from the 2015 pact, Gharibabadi said.China hopes all parties will meet each other halfway and resume dialog and negotiations as soon as possible, Wang told the Iranian and Russian ministers separately after the trilateral meeting.The United States should show ""sincerity"" and return to talks with Iran as soon as possible, said Wang.

Steve Witkoff, the special envoy of US President Donald Trump, landed on Friday morning in the capital of Azerbaijan after an overnight visit to Moscow, in what appears to be a well-coordinated diplomatic move between Israel, the US, and Azerbaijan.According to a report by the official Russian news agency RIA, Witkoff's plane departed from Vnukovo Airport in Moscow around 2:00 a.m. and arrived in Baku within a few hours. Although the Kremlin has not officially confirmed it, various sources claim that a closed meeting took place between Witkoff and Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Sources involved in Israeli-Azeri relations reveal that coordination for the visit became particularly intensive after March 5, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized his commitment to the trilateral partnership between the countries in the Knesset.Meanwhile, a significant letter from senior rabbis to President Trump, calling for the expansion of the Abraham Accords and strengthening the strategic alliance between Israel, the US, and Azerbaijan, led to considerable resonance in political and diplomatic corridors. The letter directly influenced the preparations for the visit to Baku.

The diplomatic community is closely monitoring developments in Baku, waiting to see how the trilateral relations between the countries will evolve and whether Azerbaijan will indeed fulfill the central mediating role expected of it.

Former colleagues in Counter Terrorism and analysts at the CIA and Mossad understand that, with 12 years of field research in the Middle East and counterterrorism analysis focused on the Islamic Republic, I grasp the essence and the meaning of an 'urgent briefing.' Today, I direct my public opinion to these two prominent global political figures.I hope they recognize that diplomatic efforts with Tehran's criminal ayatollahs are ineffective and illusory and pursuing them is merely fanciful and futile. It's time for America and Israel to decisively act and surgically remove this malignancy and infectious tumor, allowing the modern world to see the fall of the most dangerous terrorist regime. in fact, the globe may witness the collapse of the world's most dangerous terrorist regime and the Islamic caliphate of Shiite mullahs in Tehran.  Today, Tehran's dictator, once again at the podium, rambled and spouted nonsensically. Khamenei asserted, 'we will not negotiate, we will retaliate if attacked, though we do not seek war.' Despite his absurd claims, it's evident from his speech that the Islamic Republic is progressing towards developing a nuclear weapon. The delusional and arrogant dictator has hijacked diplomacy, yet his words betray fear and a display of foolishness.Who doesn't know that this rogue terrorist regime perpetually sows chaos and stands ready to launch global terrorist operations through its sleeper cells? AdvertisementIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks with defense industry experts in Tehran, Iran, February 12, 2025 (credit: Office of the Iranian Supreme Leader/WANA (West Asia News Agency)/Handout via REUTERS)Khamenei threatens the US, IsraelIn his speech today, Khamenei threatened America and likened himself to Muhammad bin Abdullah at the Battle of Uhud (23 March 625 AD)—a same myths and superstitions used by Islamic caliphates for 1400 years to mask their crimes and barbarism. These tales, both meaningless and valueless to the public, lack any credibility on the global stage.The dictator of Iran will not change his aggressive and sham behavior; he persists in sophistry and fallacies. He refuses to abandon the instruments of evil and barbarism—missiles, nuclear bomb, and a terrorism network. Deluded, he views the Islamic Republic as formidable, yet in reality, this despised regime is weak and isolated. Khamenei plays the threat card while covertly signaling flexibility to the White House. Yet, his deep-seated sadism and animosity towards America and Israel are beyond cure. He is a psychotic dictator, detached from the realities of Israel and America, lacking the capability for war and relying solely on threats, empty bluffs, and hostilities as his only leverage. Khamenei perceives himself at war with the world, considering himself wise and knowledgeable, while viewing the rest of humanity as foolish. He consistently believes in his righteousness, deeming the entire world dishonest and deceptive. His remarks today served as a ludicrous show of power to a select few regime loyalists and were meant for domestic consumption, aiming to galvanize support from regime adherents.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Indeed, Khamenei disregards the fate of Iran's great and oppressed nation. He has sacrificed an entire nation with a civilization of 5,000 years to his reckless games, wickedness, inanity, destructive ideology, and display of barbarism, all while claiming to represent the Iranian people.  AdvertisementToday, Iran is impoverished, bankrupt, fragile, and lawless country. The Iranian people wishes for Khamenei's demise, hoping and praying he meets a fate worse than Gaddafi or Saddam, and they even openly predict a similar downfall for the IRGC commanders and Khamenei's loyalists. However, among the Iranian people, Khamenei is not taken seriously and remains the most despised figure, having occupied his position for 36 years.In truth, Khamenei is an ignorant, biased, and cowardly dictator who has hijacked Iran, cloaking his actions with the nation's name. Yet, Iran and its brave people are not defined by the Islamic Republic; they are victims of this rogue regime's occupation. Khamenei's greatest fears—sorrow, terror, and nightmares—are driven by the potential of internal crises and the ignition of anti-regime public uprisings. These, fueled by economic collapse and national ruin, could finally consign the decrepit 46-year-old regime to the grave.  It might be argued that CIA Director Ratcliffe, National Security Advisor Waltz, and Director of American Intelligence Community Gabbard face a more substantial burden: engaging in an intelligence war and conducting targeted infiltration operations. These efforts could include exposing the inefficiencies of Iran's occupying regime, penetrating its intelligence and military establishments, and laying the necessary groundwork for maximum economic pressure and sanctions while blocking financial channels that support Iran's network of Islamic terrorism and its global isolation.However, these measures and clandestine operations alone are not highly effective. If a war breaks out and Iran's nuclear and missile facilities, along with its terrorist training centers, are militarily destroyed, both from the perspective of the Iranian people and internationally, Khamenei will be viewed as the primary suspect and the main instigator or culprit.Khamenei is in a crisis, and merely isolating him offers no benefits. He must be decisively removed from the stage. Khamenei will persist in his hostility toward America until his demise. Therefore, it is imperative that he be removed before the Islamic Republic can leverage its nuclear capabilities further. Naturally, his removal will not be mourned, as he is the supreme leader of the world's Islamic terrorists.Removing him, akin to figures like Sinwar, bin Laden, Baghdadi, Nasrallah, and Soleimani, won't have significant immediate consequences. It will, however, send a clear message to the networks of Middle Eastern Islamic terrorism, shaking the foundations of their regime. This act will demonstrate to the people of Iran that the resolve of America's global power and Israel's regional dominance is not to be underestimated. Faced with this formidable pressure, the collapse of the regime becomes both conceivable and achievable.Furthermore, it is crucial to also target key military and intelligence figures within the regime to preempt any potential backlash or sabotage following the dismantlement of Iran's nuclear and missile capabilities.The coward officials of the Islamic Republic, despite their threats to ignite the region, merely engage in bluster, rhetoric, posturing, and media sensationalism. Khamenei thinks that by projecting a facade of toughness and issuing empty threats and bluffs, he creates deterrence—but it's futile. He shies away from negotiation, fearful of making concessions or retreating. Khamenei's tactics involve internal repression, anti-American propaganda, hostility towards Israel, delusional threats and baseless bluffs.In his speech today, his primary concern was signaling to the White House and Israel, emphasizing the regime's need for survival as a precaution for future challenges. Khamenei wanted to tell Trump that the regime's survival is important for the rainy day. I hope Trump and Netanyahu realize that the mullahs, rather than mastering chemistry, physics, or mathematics, have honed their skills in trickery, charlatanism, lying, and deception within Shiite educational institutions. He serves as a useful agent for the Russians but is not a reliable ally or a trustworthy person.Khamenei's goal is to ensure his regime's survival with the acquiescence of America and Israel. He is aware that should hostilities commence, the Iranian populace will consign this warmongering dictator to the trash heap of history, where he belongs. Indeed, a tumultuous spring and summer loom ahead... ""Strike the snake's head, or it will bite...""

However, among the Iranian people, Khamenei is not taken seriously and remains the most despised figure, having occupied his position for 36 years.In truth, Khamenei is an ignorant, biased, and cowardly dictator who has hijacked Iran, cloaking his actions with the nation's name. Yet, Iran and its brave people are not defined by the Islamic Republic; they are victims of this rogue regime's occupation. Khamenei's greatest fears—sorrow, terror, and nightmares—are driven by the potential of internal crises and the ignition of anti-regime public uprisings. These, fueled by economic collapse and national ruin, could finally consign the decrepit 46-year-old regime to the grave.  It might be argued that CIA Director Ratcliffe, National Security Advisor Waltz, and Director of American Intelligence Community Gabbard face a more substantial burden: engaging in an intelligence war and conducting targeted infiltration operations. These efforts could include exposing the inefficiencies of Iran's occupying regime, penetrating its intelligence and military establishments, and laying the necessary groundwork for maximum economic pressure and sanctions while blocking financial channels that support Iran's network of Islamic terrorism and its global isolation.However, these measures and clandestine operations alone are not highly effective. If a war breaks out and Iran's nuclear and missile facilities, along with its terrorist training centers, are militarily destroyed, both from the perspective of the Iranian people and internationally, Khamenei will be viewed as the primary suspect and the main instigator or culprit.Khamenei is in a crisis, and merely isolating him offers no benefits. He must be decisively removed from the stage. Khamenei will persist in his hostility toward America until his demise. Therefore, it is imperative that he be removed before the Islamic Republic can leverage its nuclear capabilities further. Naturally, his removal will not be mourned, as he is the supreme leader of the world's Islamic terrorists.Removing him, akin to figures like Sinwar, bin Laden, Baghdadi, Nasrallah, and Soleimani, won't have significant immediate consequences. It will, however, send a clear message to the networks of Middle Eastern Islamic terrorism, shaking the foundations of their regime. This act will demonstrate to the people of Iran that the resolve of America's global power and Israel's regional dominance is not to be underestimated. Faced with this formidable pressure, the collapse of the regime becomes both conceivable and achievable.Furthermore, it is crucial to also target key military and intelligence figures within the regime to preempt any potential backlash or sabotage following the dismantlement of Iran's nuclear and missile capabilities.The coward officials of the Islamic Republic, despite their threats to ignite the region, merely engage in bluster, rhetoric, posturing, and media sensationalism. Khamenei thinks that by projecting a facade of toughness and issuing empty threats and bluffs, he creates deterrence—but it's futile. He shies away from negotiation, fearful of making concessions or retreating. Khamenei's tactics involve internal repression, anti-American propaganda, hostility towards Israel, delusional threats and baseless bluffs.In his speech today, his primary concern was signaling to the White House and Israel, emphasizing the regime's need for survival as a precaution for future challenges. Khamenei wanted to tell Trump that the regime's survival is important for the rainy day. I hope Trump and Netanyahu realize that the mullahs, rather than mastering chemistry, physics, or mathematics, have honed their skills in trickery, charlatanism, lying, and deception within Shiite educational institutions. He serves as a useful agent for the Russians but is not a reliable ally or a trustworthy person.Khamenei's goal is to ensure his regime's survival with the acquiescence of America and Israel. He is aware that should hostilities commence, the Iranian populace will consign this warmongering dictator to the trash heap of history, where he belongs. Indeed, a tumultuous spring and summer loom ahead... ""Strike the snake's head, or it will bite...""
            



In his speech today, Khamenei threatened America and likened himself to Muhammad bin Abdullah at the Battle of Uhud (23 March 625 AD)—a same myths and superstitions used by Islamic caliphates for 1400 years to mask their crimes and barbarism. These tales, both meaningless and valueless to the public, lack any credibility on the global stage.The dictator of Iran will not change his aggressive and sham behavior; he persists in sophistry and fallacies. He refuses to abandon the instruments of evil and barbarism—missiles, nuclear bomb, and a terrorism network. Deluded, he views the Islamic Republic as formidable, yet in reality, this despised regime is weak and isolated. Khamenei plays the threat card while covertly signaling flexibility to the White House. Yet, his deep-seated sadism and animosity towards America and Israel are beyond cure. He is a psychotic dictator, detached from the realities of Israel and America, lacking the capability for war and relying solely on threats, empty bluffs, and hostilities as his only leverage. Khamenei perceives himself at war with the world, considering himself wise and knowledgeable, while viewing the rest of humanity as foolish. He consistently believes in his righteousness, deeming the entire world dishonest and deceptive. His remarks today served as a ludicrous show of power to a select few regime loyalists and were meant for domestic consumption, aiming to galvanize support from regime adherents.

He has sacrificed an entire nation with a civilization of 5,000 years to his reckless games, wickedness, inanity, destructive ideology, and display of barbarism, all while claiming to represent the Iranian people.

Khamenei's greatest fears—sorrow, terror, and nightmares—are driven by the potential of internal crises and the ignition of anti-regime public uprisings.

Despite the growing criticism, Israel is standing firm in its attempt to banish the United Nations Relief and Works Agency from operating in its territory.Since its ban came into effect on January 30, Israeli authorities have severed coordination ties with the agency, shut down schools in east Jerusalem, and effectively forced international staff to leave.  The government's decision was largely driven by its expanding allegations that UNRWA employees hold links to terrorist organizations.The fallout has been swift. Countries such as the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and the European Union have suspended or withdrawn funding, citing concerns over neutrality. AdvertisementBeyond the political maneuvering and aid cuts, the issue has added fresh scrutiny to a decades-old debate that remains unresolved: Who qualifies as a Palestinian refugee? And should this status be inherited indefinitely – even by millionaires? UNDER UNRWA's unique framework, all descendants of Palestinian refugees “who lost both their home and means of livelihood... are eligible for refugee status,” regardless of wealth or nationality. Here, billionaire Zahwa Arafat poses in front of a portrait of her late father Yasser Arafat in 2011. (credit: MATTHEW MIRABELLI/AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES)A refugee definition unlike any otherUNRWA was created shortly after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war to assist 750,000 Palestinians displaced by the conflict. Today, its registry lists over six million refugees. Critics argue that no other refugee group in the world operates with this mandate.“Unlike every other refugee crisis in history, Palestinian refugees don't decrease in number – they increase. UNRWA doesn't resettle, it perpetuates,” says Dina Rovner, legal adviser for UN Watch.​ “The result? A crisis that has lasted decades longer than any other.”   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Among those classified as Palestinian refugees is Jordanian-American real estate mogul Mohamed Hadid and his five millionaire children, including supermodels Bella and Gigi Hadid. Twenty-nine-year-old Zahwa Arafat, the billionaire daughter of former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, also retains this status. AdvertisementUnder UNRWA's unique framework, all descendants of Palestinian refugees “who lost both their home and means of livelihood in Mandate Palestine between 1946-1948 are eligible for refugee status,” regardless of wealth or nationality – a stark contrast to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which removes individuals from its registries once they are resettled or naturalized.UNRWA, though, asserts that Palestinian refugee status is determined by the UN General Assembly, not the agency itself.“Palestinian refugees were recognized under Resolution 194 before UNRWA existed, where human rights were not subjected to economic status,” says Jonathan Fowler, UNRWA's senior communications manager. “In mass displacements, refugee status applies collectively and passes through generations, as seen with Afghan, Sudanese, and Sahrawi refugees”  Yet, the difference is striking. After WWII, millions were displaced, primarily in Europe, but around 1.5 million were resettled by temporary UN agencies before UNHCR took over in 1952. In contrast, 77 years later, UNRWA remains a permanent institution, even as many, like the 2.4 million in Jordan who hold citizenship, continue receiving its assistance.This raises a pivotal question: Does UNRWA's approach maintain statelessness rather than resolving it?The debate over disparitiesThe controversy extends beyond definitions. Critics hold that UNRWA's budget and staff allocation raise questions about its efficiency compared to other refugee agencies.When first established, UNRWA's annual budget was 110 times greater than UNHCRs. Today, it employs 30,000 staff for nearly six million refugees – a 1:200 ratio. In contrast, UNHCR, which serves around 32 million refugees globally, operates with 20,000 staff, translating to one staff member per 1,600 refugees.“There is a clear inconsistency in how the world treats the Palestinians compared to other refugees,” says Rovner. “If they were under the UNHCR, the majority would not be considered eligible.”Fowler counters the criticism, explaining that UNRWA's economic and service model is fundamentally different and of significant value. “It was designed as a sustained relief and works program until a viable solution is achieved, much like the 1930s US Tennessee Valley Authority.” Moreover, he adds, “the value for money is extraordinary – hiring locals not only brings local benefits but also costs 40%-50% less than employing internationals.”UNRWA under fireAs the debate over refugee classification rages on, Israel's reports of UNRWA's connections to terrorism have also dominated recent discussions. Citing its intelligence findings, Israeli authorities maintain that 10% of the agency's senior educators in Gaza have ties to Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad.“UNRWA's response is always the same – to deflect, deny, and cover up. They never take responsibility. They claim to be a ‘humanitarian backbone' in Gaza but promote Hamas propaganda, like it did with the Gaza famine narrative, which has been totally debunked,” charges Rovner.However, there are also claims that UNRWA is being targeted politically, as Fowler indicates: “There's a barrage of misinformation about who we are and who we're not. We share all our staff lists with regional authorities, including Israel, and have never received pushback about specific employees before.”Despite Israel's push to dismantle UNRWA, many European nations have since reinstated funding after reviewing oversight measures and accounting for its critical humanitarian role. Fowler points to the recently commissioned and independent Colonna Report, which found UNRWA to have more robust neutrality standards than any other UN agency. Still, critics like Rovner, remain unconvinced, contending that the problem is systemic.What happens if UNRWA does disappear?With increasing calls within Israel and the United States to abolish UNRWA, the question arises: If UNRWA disappears, what happens next?Fowler says that the organization has no intention of existing indefinitely, but it continues so far as the situation remains unresolved.“Abolishing UNRWA ignores reality,” observes Fowler. “We are often thanked by Israeli authorities, albeit at the moment not so openly, for the work we do, because without us, the responsibility will fall on them.”The topic of reform has come up quite a lot where UNRWA and the UN at large are concerned. Some believe that redefining Palestinian refugees under UNHCR rules could force a shift in the political deadlock. Others, though, insist not only is it too little, too late for reforms, but that they are insufficient in addressing the deeper issues.""As long as UNRWA exists, there will always be a Palestinian right-of-return narrative that keeps the conflict alive. Palestinians have to step up to the plate and take responsibility for their own future,” says Rovner.Questions without answersWith funding cuts, Israeli bans, and growing global pressure, UNRWA finds itself at a crossroads. Today, it is continuing to operate, even on a limited scale – holding that as long as millions remain classified as refugees, it has a job to do.Still, fundamental questions continue to go unanswered: Who should be classified a Palestinian refugee? Should refugee status be hereditary forever – even for those who live in luxury? Who should be responsible for the Palestinians? And what is Israel's role?With neither Israel disappearing nor the Palestinian refugee issue nearing resolution, UNRWA persists as a central fault line in one of the world's most protracted conflicts. Whether the agency serves as a crucial humanitarian lifeline or a political roadblock to lasting peace depends entirely on whom you ask.

AdvertisementUnder UNRWA's unique framework, all descendants of Palestinian refugees “who lost both their home and means of livelihood in Mandate Palestine between 1946-1948 are eligible for refugee status,” regardless of wealth or nationality – a stark contrast to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which removes individuals from its registries once they are resettled or naturalized.UNRWA, though, asserts that Palestinian refugee status is determined by the UN General Assembly, not the agency itself.“Palestinian refugees were recognized under Resolution 194 before UNRWA existed, where human rights were not subjected to economic status,” says Jonathan Fowler, UNRWA's senior communications manager. “In mass displacements, refugee status applies collectively and passes through generations, as seen with Afghan, Sudanese, and Sahrawi refugees”  Yet, the difference is striking. After WWII, millions were displaced, primarily in Europe, but around 1.5 million were resettled by temporary UN agencies before UNHCR took over in 1952. In contrast, 77 years later, UNRWA remains a permanent institution, even as many, like the 2.4 million in Jordan who hold citizenship, continue receiving its assistance.This raises a pivotal question: Does UNRWA's approach maintain statelessness rather than resolving it?The debate over disparitiesThe controversy extends beyond definitions. Critics hold that UNRWA's budget and staff allocation raise questions about its efficiency compared to other refugee agencies.When first established, UNRWA's annual budget was 110 times greater than UNHCRs. Today, it employs 30,000 staff for nearly six million refugees – a 1:200 ratio. In contrast, UNHCR, which serves around 32 million refugees globally, operates with 20,000 staff, translating to one staff member per 1,600 refugees.“There is a clear inconsistency in how the world treats the Palestinians compared to other refugees,” says Rovner. “If they were under the UNHCR, the majority would not be considered eligible.”Fowler counters the criticism, explaining that UNRWA's economic and service model is fundamentally different and of significant value. “It was designed as a sustained relief and works program until a viable solution is achieved, much like the 1930s US Tennessee Valley Authority.” Moreover, he adds, “the value for money is extraordinary – hiring locals not only brings local benefits but also costs 40%-50% less than employing internationals.”UNRWA under fireAs the debate over refugee classification rages on, Israel's reports of UNRWA's connections to terrorism have also dominated recent discussions. Citing its intelligence findings, Israeli authorities maintain that 10% of the agency's senior educators in Gaza have ties to Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad.“UNRWA's response is always the same – to deflect, deny, and cover up.

“Unlike every other refugee crisis in history, Palestinian refugees don't decrease in number – they increase.

The controversy extends beyond definitions. Critics hold that UNRWA's budget and staff allocation raise questions about its efficiency compared to other refugee agencies.When first established, UNRWA's annual budget was 110 times greater than UNHCRs. Today, it employs 30,000 staff for nearly six million refugees – a 1:200 ratio. In contrast, UNHCR, which serves around 32 million refugees globally, operates with 20,000 staff, translating to one staff member per 1,600 refugees.“There is a clear inconsistency in how the world treats the Palestinians compared to other refugees,” says Rovner. “If they were under the UNHCR, the majority would not be considered eligible.”Fowler counters the criticism, explaining that UNRWA's economic and service model is fundamentally different and of significant value. “It was designed as a sustained relief and works program until a viable solution is achieved, much like the 1930s US Tennessee Valley Authority.” Moreover, he adds, “the value for money is extraordinary – hiring locals not only brings local benefits but also costs 40%-50% less than employing internationals.”UNRWA under fireAs the debate over refugee classification rages on, Israel's reports of UNRWA's connections to terrorism have also dominated recent discussions. Citing its intelligence findings, Israeli authorities maintain that 10% of the agency's senior educators in Gaza have ties to Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad.“UNRWA's response is always the same – to deflect, deny, and cover up. They never take responsibility. They claim to be a ‘humanitarian backbone' in Gaza but promote Hamas propaganda, like it did with the Gaza famine narrative, which has been totally debunked,” charges Rovner.However, there are also claims that UNRWA is being targeted politically, as Fowler indicates: “There's a barrage of misinformation about who we are and who we're not. We share all our staff lists with regional authorities, including Israel, and have never received pushback about specific employees before.”Despite Israel's push to dismantle UNRWA, many European nations have since reinstated funding after reviewing oversight measures and accounting for its critical humanitarian role. Fowler points to the recently commissioned and independent Colonna Report, which found UNRWA to have more robust neutrality standards than any other UN agency. Still, critics like Rovner, remain unconvinced, contending that the problem is systemic.What happens if UNRWA does disappear?With increasing calls within Israel and the United States to abolish UNRWA, the question arises: If UNRWA disappears, what happens next?Fowler says that the organization has no intention of existing indefinitely, but it continues so far as the situation remains unresolved.“Abolishing UNRWA ignores reality,” observes Fowler. “We are often thanked by Israeli authorities, albeit at the moment not so openly, for the work we do, because without us, the responsibility will fall on them.”The topic of reform has come up quite a lot where UNRWA and the UN at large are concerned.

Near the beginning of his first radio show in more than a decade, Anthony Cumia complained about how he can no longer say offensive things on air.“It's the angry mob of people with phones, with the ability to email your boss and the board of directors and everyone else that you said something that offended them,” he said about 14 minutes into his two-hour slot last Sunday on New York's conservative talk radio station 77 WABC. “Now you have all those complaints sitting out there, on your ass, so it got very hard to be a shock jock at that point.”  Cumia has direct experience with being canceled. He was fired from his last show, Opie & Anthony on Sirius XM, in 2014 after he went on a profane social media tirade against a black woman he called an “animal.” That was his last major radio gig before the 77 WABC show, which first aired on Sunday.

(credit: Cindy Ord/Getty Images for SiriusXM)Over the past couple of years, including in the months leading up to his new job, Cumia has published a stream of antisemitic, racist, and pro-Hitler posts which, as of this week, are still up for all to see. He is a fan of Sid Rosenberg, the Jewish right-wing broadcaster who also hosts a show on WABC. And he is a fan of Nick Fuentes, the white supremacist influencer and Holocaust denier.Cumia's posts Last March 30, above a post about Transgender Day of Visibility, he posted, “It is hereby proclaimed that Monday, April 22nd, 2024, is Adolf Hitler Visibility Day.” The following month, he wrote, “White people all over the world really need to get 1930's Germany kinda pissed at this point”   Stay updated with the latest news!

Chuck Schumer, who is Jewish, grilling beef patties, he wrote, “Rumor has it 6,000,000 burgers were cooked that day.” AdvertisementOn Dec. 20, he posted, “Germany had a real leader once.” Five days later, above a picture of President Joe Biden lighting a wooden menorah for Hanukkah, he wrote, “Made from the same wood used on those chamber doors?”He also admires contemporary antisemites, including Fuentes, who posted a smiling photo with him last June and invited him to his podcast in 2022.“I started watching your show maybe a year ago, or so, and I f—ing love it, dude,” Cumia told Fuentes as they sat at a table, recording the 2022 podcast episode on video. “It's funny, and informative, and pertinent to what's going on, and courageous — I'll say that too.”   In June 2024, he made a post directed at Fuentes: “Hey! Leave the blacks to me, Nick. You have your hands full with the jews.”Indeed, his anti-Black animus is a theme of his social media posts. “In Beaufort, South Carolina. A lot of history here. I look at every old tree branch and wonder if any of them ‘helped out' with the cause back in the old days,” he posted in November, referring to lynching. Then, using a term for the Civil War popular among those who sympathize with the Confederacy, he added, “Here's a cannon that I hope ripped up some Yankees during the war of northern aggression.”As American media has fragmented and seismically transformed in recent decades, AM radio has retained its longtime role as a bastion of conservative discourse — an airwaves version of the streaming shows that have become a mainstay of far-right commentary. WABC has leveraged the trend to great effect, with owner and former New York City mayoral candidate John Catsimatidis amassing a lineup that audience data shows draws listeners for more than six hours a week on average.Neither 77WABC nor its parent company, Red Apple Media, responded to requests for comment prior to this article's publication. Following publication, Catsimatidis told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, regarding Cumia, that “WABC will not allow him to say anything antisemitic.”Catsimatidis said he believed Cumia's contract prohibited antisemitic speech on WABC, which the owner called “the most pro-Jewish station in America.” He said WABC was aware of Cumia's posts prior to making the hire and had discussed them with him.“He says anything antisemitic, he's off the network,” Catsimatidis said. “We're not going to put on somebody that's bad for our people.”Cumia is open about his penchant to offend, attributing it to his line of work. He described being a shock jock as being “the worst possible human being you could find.”He went on, “Just irritating, obnoxious. All they talked about was sexual innuendo and body functions… racial jokes, misogynistic jokes. It was supposed to be — here comes the name — shocking.”Sunday's showThere was no overt antisemitism on his show Sunday, though it included passing references to “globalists” and to the way Tony Soprano treated a Jewish associate on “The Sopranos.” He also went on an extended riff about sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and how celebrities in Hollywood wield outsize political influence, all in the context of why he thinks the Justice Department's recent focus on Epstein was a waste of time.And Cumia's posts do not appear to have dampened his friendship with Rosenberg, a fellow shock jock who spoke at President Donald Trump's Madison Square Garden rally last year and who has himself been fired for racist comments. He thanked and complimented Rosenberg repeatedly on his show on Sunday.At one point, jokingly speaking in the voice of the station owners, he quipped, “Wait, what are we worried about, we've got this piece of garbage Sid Rosenberg working for us. How bad could Anthony be? He's a saint in comparison to Sid.”He continued, “Sid knows I love him. I adore the guy.”The feeling is mutual. Last week, ahead of his first show, Cumia went on Rosenberg's program, where Rosenberg touted Cumia's “brilliant stylings” and said, “We're very, very lucky to have you.”There's every indication the station is happy with Cumia. On Tuesday, its parent company announced that his show would be syndicated nationally.Chad Lopez, president of Red Apple and WABC, said in a statement, “Radio clearly wants Anthony Cumia.”

He thanked and complimented Rosenberg repeatedly on his show on Sunday.At one point, jokingly speaking in the voice of the station owners, he quipped, “Wait, what are we worried about, we've got this piece of garbage Sid Rosenberg working for us. How bad could Anthony be? He's a saint in comparison to Sid.”He continued, “Sid knows I love him. I adore the guy.”The feeling is mutual. Last week, ahead of his first show, Cumia went on Rosenberg's program, where Rosenberg touted Cumia's “brilliant stylings” and said, “We're very, very lucky to have you.”There's every indication the station is happy with Cumia. On Tuesday, its parent company announced that his show would be syndicated nationally.Chad Lopez, president of Red Apple and WABC, said in a statement, “Radio clearly wants Anthony Cumia.”

US President Donald Trump said on Friday that he held a “very good and productive discussion” with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday and urged him to spare Ukrainian soldiers' lives.

Writing on his Truth Social platform, Trump said, “We had very good and productive discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia yesterday, and there is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end — BUT, AT THIS VERY MOMENT, THOUSANDS OF UKRAINIAN TROOPS ARE COMPLETELY SURROUNDED BY THE RUSSIAN MILITARY, AND IN A VERY BAD AND VULNERABLE POSITION. I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared. This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II. God bless them all!!!.”

The US president's statement comes after the Kremlin said that Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, was carrying President Putin's message after a ‘secret' meeting with Russian officials in Moscow. His visit was part of accelerated efforts by the US to bring an end to the three-year-long war.

“Additional information was provided to the Russian side. Putin asked Witkoff to convey information and additional messages to President Trump,” the Kremlin said in a statement.

Witkoff reportedly held talks with Russian officials after President Putin laid out his conditional agreement on Ukraine's proposed 30-day ceasefire. The Russian leader stopped short of backing Kyiv's proposals completely but said he wanted to discuss “issues” with Trump.

On Friday, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of deliberately setting conditions for a ceasefire to “complicate and drag out” the process.

Kyiv proposed the idea during high-stakes talks with US officials in Saudi Arabia. The meeting came after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky's disastrous clash with Trump and vice-president JD Vance in the White House. Zelensky reiterated his desire for peace after the US paused military aid and intelligence sharing after the Oval Office clash.

Trump's talks with Putin also gained significance, as the Russian president's foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, said there were no plans for a phone conversation between Putin and President Donald Trump on Thursday.

The Kremlin had also said that a decision on a phone call between Trump and Putin will be made once Witkoff conveys the ‘information' from the talks and both sides understand the need for a discussion.

Putin had stopped short of backing Kyiv's proposals for a 30-day ceasefire completely but said he wanted to discuss “issues” with Trump. “We agree with the proposals to stop hostilities, but we start from the position that this cessation should lead to long-term peace and eliminate the causes of this crisis. Then there arise questions over monitoring and verification” of any truce along an almost 2,000 kilometre-long front line,” said the former KGB officer.

The 22-year-old man has been identified as the ‘person of interest' in the case of missing Indian-American student Sudiksha Konkani, who was enjoying her spring vacation in the Dominican town of Punta Cana before she went missing.

The Riu Republica Hotel has said in a statement that multiple guests were headed to the beach on March 6 after a power outage. According to authorities, the group was partying at a disco around 3 am before heading to the beach.

Konanki was seen swimming with a “young man” before she disappeared. She was believed to have drowned in the sea, but CCTV visuals from the resorts showed that she was last seen with Ribe, who was trying to click their selfies.

Ribe informed the investigators that he had ventured into the sea with Konkani and had been hit by rough waves. He claimed to have saved her from the rough seas but lost her in the darkness of the night, the New York Post reported.

“A big wave came and hit us both and as the water returned, it came back and swept us out to sea,” the report quoted Riibe saying.

The 24-year-old Iowa man claimed that their calls for help went unanswered as the beach was empty. He also claimed that he tried swimming back to the shore with Konkani but faced difficulties.

“It took me a long time to get her out; it was difficult. I was a lifeguard in the pool, not in the sea. I could have lost consciousness several times,” Ribe added.

Explaining further, Ribe said he thought Konkani went back to the sea to fetch her belongings and left. He also claimed not to have noticed her actions as he threw up after reaching the shores.

Investigators have sought finer details from Ribe as he reportedly failed to answer crucial questions due to his lawyer's advice. The probe is now led by a “high-level commission” of local and US agencies, including the FBI.

Dominican President Luis Abinader had said Ribe's accounts have been worrying. “We are concerned. All government agencies are searching because the latest information we have from one of them, from the last person who was with the young woman, what he says, according to the reports, is that a wave, while on the beach, crashed into them,” he said on Monday, March 10, during his weekly meeting with the press.

Vice President JD Vance stirred fresh debate on Thursday by saying that a green card doesn't guarantee immigrants the right to stay in the US forever.

A green card, officially called a Permanent Resident Card, lets foreign nationals, including Indians, live and work in the country. But despite the name, ""permanent residency"" doesn't necessarily mean lifelong security.

""A green card holder doesn't have an indefinite right to be in the United States,"" JD Vance said in an interview with 'The Ingraham Angle' host Laura Ingraham on Fox News.

“This is not fundamentally about free speech, and to me, yes, it's about national security, but it's also more importantly about who do we as an American public decide gets to join our national community,” Vance said.

“And if the secretary of state and the president decide this person shouldn't be in America, and they have no legal right to stay here, it's as simple as that,"" he added.

Vance's statement comes in response to the arrest of Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, a green card holder, who was detained on Saturday for his role in protests against the Israel-Hamas war at Columbia University last spring.

The Donald Trump administration has moved to revoke Mahmoud Khalil's green card, accusing him of leading ""activities aligned with Hamas,"" the militant group whose October 7, 2023 attack triggered the war.

His arrest has triggered outrage from critics of the Trump administration as well as free speech advocates, including some on the political right, who say such a move has a chilling effect on freedom of expression.

Khalil, who has not been charged with a crime, is being held in immigration custody in Louisiana after being arrested in New York City on Saturday. Khalil's lawyers have said Trump's administration targeted him for arrest and deportation because of his advocacy in violation of the US Constitution's First Amendment protections for freedom of speech.

Under a provision of the US Immigration and Nationality Act, a law passed in 1952, any immigrants may be deported if the secretary of state deems their presence in the country potentially adverse to American foreign policy. Legal experts have said that provision is rarely invoked, and Khalil's lawyers have said it was not intended to silence dissent.

The Justice Department did not elaborate in its filing on how Khalil could harm US foreign policy objectives. Trump and officials in his administration have, without presenting evidence, accused Khalil of supporting Hamas.

In a breakthrough, Italian scientists have successfully ""frozen"" light, demonstrating that it can behave as a supersolid - a rare state of matter that exhibits both solid-like structure and frictionless flow. The discovery, recently published in 'Nature', marks a significant milestone in quantum physics and could revolutionize future applications in quantum computing and optical technologies.

A supersolid is an exotic phase of matter that simultaneously possesses the rigidity of a solid and the ability to flow like a superfluid. Until now, supersolidity had only been observed in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), a state of matter formed when a group of bosons is cooled to near absolute zero, causing them to occupy the same quantum state.

However, a team led by Antonio Gianfate from CNR Nanotec and Davide Nigro from the University of Pavia has now demonstrated that light itself can exhibit this peculiar behavior.

Instead of traditional freezing - lowering temperature to turn a liquid into a solid - the researchers used quantum techniques to create a supersolid state in light. They worked with a semiconductor platform designed to manipulate photons in a manner similar to how electrons behave in conductors.

Using a gallium arsenide structure embedded with microscopic ridges, the team fired a laser to produce hybrid light-matter particles known as polaritons.

As the number of photons increased, the researchers observed the formation of satellite condensates, a pattern indicative of supersolidity. These condensates shared the same energy but opposite wavenumbers, forming a unique spatial structure that confirmed the presence of a supersolid state.

“At temperatures near absolute zero, quantum effects emerge,” the researchers explained. “This is just the beginning of understanding supersolidity in light.”

This discovery has far-reaching implications for quantum technology. Supersolid light could play a crucial role in developing more stable quantum bits (qubits), which are essential for the advancement of quantum computing.

Beyond computing, the ability to manipulate light in this way could revolutionize optical devices, photonic circuits, and even fundamental quantum mechanics research. Scientists anticipate that future research will refine these techniques, enabling more stable and controlled formations of supersolid light.

Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha Vance, were met with loud boos as they arrived at the Kennedy Center on Thursday night for a concert performance.

The Viral X (formerly Twitter) video shows the couple entering their balcony seating, and the crowd's reaction grows louder as more attendees recognize them. 

The Vances were in attendance for a performance by folk musicians Nora Brown and Stephanie Coleman.

The reception they received comes amid heightened tensions between the Trump-Vance administration and the Kennedy Center following President Donald Trump's controversial decision to overhaul its leadership.

Earlier this year, Trump dismissed the centre's Board of Trustees and appointed himself as chairman, vowing to reshape the institution's artistic direction. “At my direction, we are going to make the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., GREAT AGAIN. I have decided to immediately terminate multiple individuals from the Board of Trustees, including the Chairman, who do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture,” Trump announced on his social media platform.

One of the most awful reactions came from the producers of Hamilton, the critically acclaimed musical about Alexander Hamilton, which has won numerous awards, including a Tony, a Grammy, and a Pulitzer Prize.

Producer Jeffrey Seller announced, “Our show simply cannot, in good conscience, participate and be a part of this new culture that is being imposed on the Kennedy Center.”

Trump recently appointed Fox News anchors Laura Ingraham and Maria Bartiromo to the Kennedy Center's 33-member board of trustees. “I am thrilled to announce that Laura Ingraham and Maria Bartiromo will be joining our Kennedy Center Board – This completes our selection,” Trump posted on TruthSocial.

“We look forward to restoring the Center to Greatness and ushering in America's Golden Age. Together we will Make the Arts Great Again!”

A blast targeting a mosque in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's South Waziristan during Friday prayers injured an Islamist party leader and three others, including children, police said.

The attack occurred at 1:45 pm (local time) at Maulana Abdul Aziz Mosque on Azam Warsak Bypass Road, with the device planted in the mosque's pulpit. No group has claimed responsibility for the explosion so far. 

The IED blast appeared to target Abdullah Nadeem, a local leader of the Jamiat Ulema Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) political party, Reuters reported.

Asif Bahadar, a district police chief in South Waziristan, said Nadeem was hospitalised with serious injuries. Two children were also among the injured.

District Police Officer Asif Bahader told Dawn that all injured individuals had been taken to the District Headquarters Hospital for immediate medical assistance and an investigation is underway.

Attacks have been escalating in Pakistan's border regions with Afghanistan in recent months, the report said.

In February, a suicide attacker triggered a blast at Darul Uloom Haqqania seminary in KP's Nowshera district, killing six worshippers during Friday prayers. The institution has served as a historic training ground for the Afghan Taliban.

Earlier this week, on Tuesday, the Jaffar Express train was attacked in the Bolan district and over 300 passengers were hijacked and held hostage by militants from the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), who demanded the release of their jailed members.

A video of the attack showed the train getting hit by an explosion and coming to a halt as armed militants positioned in the surrounding mountains aimed at the train. Moments later, passengers are seen getting paraded by the militants who take them under their custody.

Pakistani security forces launched a full-scale operation despite threats to assassinate the passengers. Rescue efforts were also complicated as armed militants wearing vests loaded with explosives were also stationed near the captives.

Security forces rescued all 346 hostages as over 30 militants and 28 soldiers were killed during the operation. The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) militants said that they killed 50 more hostages who were hijacked from the Peshawar-bound train.

Russian President Vladimir Putin thanked world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, for their efforts in addressing the Ukraine-Russia war while making his first public remarks on Kyiv's ceasefire proposal, reported news agency ANI.

Speaking at a joint press conference with Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko on Thursday, Vladimir Putin said Russia agrees with the proposals to cease hostilities but “proceeds from the assumption that this cessation should lead to long-term peace and eliminate the root causes of the crisis”.

When asked about Ukraine's readiness for a ceasefire, Putin, as quoted by ANI, said, ""As for Ukraine's readiness for a ceasefire, I will tell you how I view it, of course. But I would like to start by thanking the President of the United States, Mr Trump, for paying so much attention to the Ukraine settlement. We all have enough of our own domestic affairs to attend to. But many leaders of states, among them the President of the People's Republic of China, the Prime Minister of India, the Presidents of Brazil and the Republic of South Africa are addressing this issue and give it a lot of their time. We are grateful to all of them for that because this activity is aimed at achieving a noble mission - the mission of ending hostilities and loss of life.""

Putin further said, ""We agree with the proposals to cease hostilities but proceed from the assumption that this cessation should lead to long-term peace and eliminate the root causes of this crisis.""

He also referred to the recent US-Ukraine discussions in Saudi Arabia, suggesting that Ukraine's willingness for a ceasefire was likely influenced by American pressure.

""Now, on Ukraine's readiness to cease the hostilities. You know, on the face of it, the US-Ukraine meeting in Saudi Arabia may look like the Ukrainian side made this decision under pressure from the United States. In fact, I am absolutely convinced that the Ukrainian side should have asked the Americans for this decision most emphatically, in view of the situation evolving on the ground, as has just been mentioned here,"" Putin said.

On March 11, Ukraine expressed readiness to accept the US proposal to enact an ""immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire,"" which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties and is subject to Russia's acceptance and concurrent implementation.

US President Donald Trump welcomed Ukraine's agreement to the ceasefire after the peace talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and further affirmed hope that Russia will also agree to it. Stating that soldiers of both Russia and Ukraine are being killed in this ""horrible war"", Trump said reaching a ceasefire is ""very important"".

Earlier in February, PM Narendra Modi welcomed Donald Trump's efforts to resolve the Russia-Ukraine conflict and reiterated India's position that the conflict should be resolved on the negotiating table.

He also reiterated that India's stance in the conflict is not neutral, but rather it is on the side of peace. The Prime Minister emphasised that he has himself met leaders of both Russia and Ukraine and also pointed to his 'this is not an era of war' remark that he made in the presence of Russian President Putin.

""I have always been in close contact with Russia and Ukraine. I have met the leaders of both countries. Many people are in a misconception that India is neutral, but I want to reiterate that India is not neutral; we are on a side, and that is peace,"" Modi said in a joint presser at the White House.

He further reiterated India's position that a solution to the conflict can't be found on the battlefield and appreciated President Donald Trump's efforts in this direction.

In July last year, Modi travelled to Russia to participate in the 22nd India-Russia Bilateral Summit. He also travelled to Ukraine in August last year.

During the bilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Modi emphasised India's position of peaceful resolution of the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy.

A Canadian entrepreneur and actress, best known for her role in the American Pie franchise, has reportedly revealed a harrowing experience at the U.S. southern border. According to reports, she was detained and shackled by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) while attempting to secure a new visa.

Jasmine Moore shared that after being detained By ICE on March 3, 2025, at the San Ysidro border between Mexico and San Diego was kept in “inhumane” conditions, as reported by KGTV. She told the media outlet inside the Arizona detention centre, "" Every single guard that sees me is like ‘What are you doing here? I don't understand — you're Canadian. How are you here?” She continued, “I have never in my life seen anything so inhumane.”

Mooney made the trip to the San Ysidro border crossing earlier this month after learning in November that her three-year TN work visa had been revoked while she was attempting to board a flight from Vancouver to Los Angeles. The actress, known for her role in American Pie Presents: The Book of Love (2009), hoped to resolve the issue by presenting a new job offer and her visa paperwork, following the advice of her lawyer, who had previously helped her secure her first work visa, as reported by New York Post.

Mooney recounted being held in a freezing room for three days at the world's busiest land border before being arrested by ICE and transferred to the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego. She told the outlet, ‘I was put in a cell, and I had to sleep on a mat with no blanket, no pillow, with an aluminum foil wrapped over my body like a dead body for two and a half days.”

However, Brian Todd, a spokesperson for the private company operating the Otay Mesa Detention Center, rejected Mooney's allegations regarding the food, asserting that the facility serves ""nutritious"" meals to inmates on a daily basis. Meanwhile, the 35-year-old stated that she, along with 30 other women, was abruptly gathered in the dead of night and transported to Arizona. She added, “We were up for 24 hours wrapped in chains.”

Mooney who was not charged with a crime is expected to be released by Friday after being kept behind bars for 11 days, as told by her father, Stephen to CBC on Thursday night. According to the outlet, she will be transported to a detention centre located in Tijuana, Mexico and then flown back to Vancouver on Friday. Mooney's father told the outlet, “Jasmine's a strong girl, but what she has gone through is … no one should do that,” adding that he feels “a lot of relief” after the knowledge that his daughter was “in shackles and handcuffs” for most of the time she was detained.

He continued, “Just the lack of due process and the lack of communication that we've had through that detention centre, I feel for, of course, not only Jasmine, but the many other people that are in there. There were conversations at the highest level, and I would like to think that helped get her released earlier.”

After the occurrence of events with her daughter, Stephem warned other Canadians who have similar work visa situations to avoid travelling to the US. He told CBC, “That process down there is terrible, and I believe it's worse because of the new administration, because of Trump … I would be cautious for anyone to go into the States.”

Meanwhile, Mooney's mother, Alexis Eagles told Vancouver Sun, “I haven't been able to sleep thinking about what my daughter is being put through. We treat cattle better than this in Canada. We have no issue with her being denied entry, we have no issue with her initially being detained. But we have a huge issue with the inhumane treatment she is receiving and that she knows nothing, has not been charged and has not been able to speak with us directly.”

ICE officials informed The Post on Thursday that Mooney's detention was carried out in accordance with an executive order signed by President Trump on his first day back in the White House, which grants immigration authorities the power to detain individuals suspected of being in the country illegally. The statement said, “Jasmine Mooney was detained March 3 by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for not having legal documentation to be in the United States.”

Pakistani Army spokesperson on Friday confirmed that the number of fatalities in the train hijack in the mountainous southwestern region of Balochistan had risen to 31.

The separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for hijacking the Jaffar Express on Tuesday, an attack during which they blew up train tracks and held passengers hostage in a tense day-long standoff with security forces in a remote mountain pass in Balochistan province.

“We have evidence that all the links to terrorism in Pakistan are traced back to Afghanistan,” Reuters quoted Army spokesperson Major General Ahmad Sharif Chaudhry telling a press conference in Islamabad.

General Chaudhry presented the complete figure of casualties, comprising 18 soldiers, three railway workers, and five civilians among the hostages, plus another five soldiers who were killed during the rescue operation whereby 33 insurgents died. A total of 354 hostages were freed, he confirmed.

Chaudhry dismissed reports in the BLA that they were still holding on to some hostages, noting there was no evidence to support this and said the military had successfully terminated the siege.

The BLA is by far the strongest and the most influential among the several Baloch separatist groups that have been fighting for decades for the independence of Balochistan, an area rich in natural resources, where there are major Chinese-led projects, including a deep-water port and large mining operations.

The group hijacked the Jaffar Express with 440 passengers onboard in the Bolan area of the province on Tuesday.

Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday visited Balochistan to review the law and order situation and expressed solidarity with the people following the Jaffar Express hijacking incident.

""Pakistan's peace and prosperity are linked with it (terrorism). There will be no prosperity without peace,” Sharif said while speaking at a high-level meeting.

PM Sharif also said that terrorism posed a threat to Pakistan's existence and the menace should be wiped out from the country and called for national unity to deal with it.

Iraq's Prime Minister announced that the leader of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has been killed, calling him as ""one of the most dangerous terrorists in Iraq and the world.""

Abdallah Makki Muslih al-Rufayi, also known as Abu Khadija was killed by Iraqi security forces, with the support of the US-led coalition, Iraq Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani informed on Friday.

Abdallah Makki Muslih al-Rufayi ""was considered one of the most dangerous terrorists in Iraq and the world"", Sudani said in a post on X.

The Islamic State ruled with a hardline Islamist approach over millions of people in Syria and Iraq for several years and is now attempting to make a comeback in the Middle East, the West, and Asia.

In 2014, former ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared a caliphate over at least a quarter of Iraq and Syria, before he was killed in a raid by US special forces in northwest Syria in 2019, which led to the group's collapse.

The US Central Command reported last July that the group has been attempting to rebuild itself after several years of diminished capabilities.

The command based its assessment on ISIS's claim of launching 153 attacks in Iraq and Syria during the first half of 2024, suggesting a trend that could see the group ""more than double"" its attacks compared to the previous year.

Over the years the terrorist organisation has faced a number of challenges in leadership and recently the death of their leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2019.

Since then, the leadership of ISIS has been in a state of disorder with several of his successors being killed shortly after ascending to the position.

Nonetheless, ISIS still presents a significant security risk through its branches and connections in the Middle East and other regions.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin for allegedly manipulating a ceasefire deal between the two countries by proposing conditions that will delay its progress.

In a post on X, Zelensky claimed, “Right now, we have all heard from Russia Putin's highly predictable and manipulative words in response to the idea of a ceasefire on the front lines—at this moment he is, in fact, preparing to reject it.”

Putin had released a statement earlier, where he said that he was willing to commit to the ceasefire proposal suggested by the US but required certain changes to be made.

In his statement, he had thanked key allies such US President Donald Trump and India's prime minister Narendra Modi for their support.

However, he said, “The idea itself is the right one, and we certainly support it. But there are questions that we have to discuss. I think we need to work with our American partners. Maybe I will speak to President Trump. But we support the idea of ending this conflict with peaceful means.”

The Ukrainian President alleged that Putin was “afraid” to tell US President Donald Trump that he wanted to continue the war and “keep killing Ukrainians.”

“That's why, in Moscow, they are surrounding the ceasefire idea with such preconditions that it either fails or gets dragged out for as long as possible. Putin does this often—he doesn't say ‘no' outright, but he drags things out and makes reasonable solutions impossible. We see this as yet another round of Russian manipulation,” said Zelensky.

Zelensky stated that the US proposal called for an unconditional ceasefire in the air, at sea and on the front lines, which Ukraine had accepted. He also said the US, as well as European allies, were willing to organise and monitor the deal to ensure long-term security and lasting peace.

“Ukraine is ready to work as quickly and constructively as possible. We have discussed this with U.S. representatives, and our European partners, as well as all our allies worldwide, are aware of it,” he said.

Zelensky added, “We are not setting conditions that complicate the process—Russia is. As we have always said, the only one stalling, the only one being unconstructive, is Russia. They need this war. Putin has stolen years of peace and continues this war day after day.”

He also stressed that now was the time to put pressure on Putin through sanctions. Zelensky said that Ukraine would continue working with America and European allies to bring an end to the war.

On March 11, Ukraine officially agreed to an ""immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire,"" which could be extended if Russia agreed to it as well. The ceasefire would bring an end to a three-year-long war between the two countries.

Denver airport fire: An American Airlines plane caught fire at Denver International Airport on Thursday evening, prompting passengers to evacuate the aircraft. The blaze began on the plane, which was parked at Gate C38, and thick black smoke rose above the tarmac, according to airport officials.

There was an aircraft fire ""to an American Airlines plane"" that was sitting at gate C38 on Thursday evening, producing “visible smoke”, the airport was quoted as saying in the media report.

The airport said the fire was extinguished, and no injuries had been reported as of 6:15pm.

Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration said American Airlines Flight 1006 was diverted and safely landed at Denver International Airport on Thursday evening.

“After landing safely and taxiing to the gate at Denver International Airport (DEN), American Airlines Flight 1006 experienced an engine-related issue. The 172 customers and six crew members deplaned and are being relocated to the terminal. We thank our crew members, DEN team and first responders for their quick and decisive action with the safety of everyone on board and on the ground as the priority,” FOX31 quoted the American Airlines as saying in a statement.

The flight took off from the Colorado Springs Airport and was headed to Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, but was diverted to DIA. The plane used for the flight was a Boeing 737-800, the American Airlines added.

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on Friday that Russia would ensure the safety of Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region if they choose to surrender.

In a statement to the Russian Security Council, Putin called on Ukrainian authorities to direct their soldiers to lay down their weapons.

The statement comes shortly after US President Donald Trump requested Putin to spare Ukrainian forces retreating from the Kursk area, expressing hope that the conflict could end soon.

US President Donald Trump requested Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday to ‘spare' Ukrainian troops being pushed back from Russia's Kursk region, expressing hope that the war could soon end.

Donald Trump's comments followed a meeting between Putin and his envoy, Steve Witkoff, in Moscow on Thursday night, which Trump described as “very good and productive.” Trump was optimistic, stating, “There is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end.”

The US president warned that thousands of Ukrainian troops were “completely surrounded” by Russian forces, in a “very bad and vulnerable position.” He said, “I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared. This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II. God bless them all!”

Taking to his Truth Social platform, Donald Trump said, “We had very good and productive discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia yesterday, and there is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end — BUT, AT THIS VERY MOMENT, THOUSANDS OF UKRAINIAN TROOPS ARE COMPLETELY SURROUNDED BY THE RUSSIAN MILITARY, AND IN A VERY BAD AND VULNERABLE POSITION. I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared. This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II. God bless them all!!!.”

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday that Ukrainian troops were under mounting pressure in the western Russian region of Kursk but that the operation had eased pressure on Ukrainian troops elsewhere.

""The situation in the Kursk region is obviously very difficult,"" news agency AFP quoted Zelensky as saying at a briefing in Kyiv, adding that fighting in the eastern Donetsk region had stabilised.

Sudiksha Konanki, the University of Pittsburgh student who went missing nearly a week ago while on spring break in the Dominican Republic, made two Venmo payments the afternoon before her disappearance.

According to a New York Post report, the 20-year-old student made the transactions 40 minutes apart. Her first payment was made to an unspecified user at 2:54 pm. The transaction's description also mentioned an emoji of a sailboat. 

The report claimed that Sudiksha Konangi made a second Venmo transaction for “coco bongo,” seemingly referencing the popular Punta Cana nightclub.

The US authorities identified 24-year-old Joshua Riibe as a “person of interest” in the case of Sudiksha Konanki's disappearance.

Konanki, an Indian citizen and permanent resident of the United States, was last seen on March 6 at the Riu Republic Resort in Punta Cana.

She had gone missing while on vacation in the Dominican Republic and US federal law enforcement agencies are working with authorities in the Caribbean country in the probe into her disappearance.

The Loudoun County Sheriff's Office, Konanki's hometown in Virginia, said Riibe was seen with her at a resort before she went missing, spokesperson Chad Quinn told USA TODAY.

According to a PTI report, Konanki's father asked local authorities to broaden the investigation. Quinn said the case is not a criminal investigation, so Riibe is not considered a suspect in Konanki's disappearance.

University of Pittsburgh officials told AP that they have been in contact with the Konanki family and authorities in Virginia, and have offered their support in the search.

Dominican president Luis Abinader said on Monday that the last person known to be with her says a wave crashed into them while they were on the beach.

Civil Defense Director Juan Salas said that the investigators haven't found her clothing, AP reported.

Aravindh Chithambaram has become the most recent Indian Grandmaster put in the spotlight, after his sensational victory at the Prague Chess Masters 2025. Chithambaram is currently in third position at the FIDE Circuit 2025, behind leader Ding Liren and second-placed R Praggnanandhaa. The winner of the FIDE Circuit 2025 becomes a direct qualifier for the Candidates in 2026.

Chithambaram has also had a massive leap in the live chess rankings, climbing eight positions higher to World No. 14, ahead of India legend Viswanathan Anand, who is 15th.

Recently, his long-time coach Ramachandran Ramesh labelled him as the most talented chess player in India, after Anand and totally snubbed the likes of D Gukesh, who is also the current India No. 1 and reigning World Chess Champion. Ramesh, who is also a GM known for winning the 2002 British C'ship and 2007 Commonwealth Championship, runs a chess academy in Chennai, which has included plenty of chess champions like R Praggnanandhaa, Vaishali Rameshbabu. His latest to receive international recognition is Chithambaram, and the 25-year-old has long been considered by Indian chess fans as an extremely talented player, who has been lacking the confidence until now.

Speaking to Sportstar, Ramesh also pointed out that self-doubt was a big hurdle for his student, but he has crossed it now. He said, “He is very talented, in fact the most talented after five-time world champion Anand. But he was not believing in himself. Self-doubt was his main stumbling block. Now he is sure about himself.”

Aravind came second in the World U14 Chess C'ship, and also won the Indian U19 Chess Championship at the tender age of 12. He bagged his first IM title in 2014 and GM title in 2015.

He won the Chennai Grand Masters Tournament in 2024, beating Levon Aronian on blitz tie-breaks. During that campaign, he also bagged a win against Arjun Erigaisi. He won in Prague by a full point, and was undefeated with a 6/9 score, consisting of three wins. He has also won the Indian Chess championships twice (2018 and 2019).

Liberal party leader Mark Carney was sworn in as Canada's new prime minister on Friday amid a raging trade dispute with neighbouring United States triggered by President Donald Trump.

Carney (59) replaced Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January and remained the caretaker prime minister until the Liberal Party elected a new leader.

The former head of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England was officially sworn in during a ceremony in Ottawa on Friday. Francois-Philippe Champagne will be his finance minister as Dominic LeBlanc was shifted to manage international trade amid a raging tariff dispute with Trump. Melanie Joly will continue as foreign minister, and David McGuinty will remain the public safety minister.

Carey was chosen overwhelmingly by the Liberal Party as the prime minister without a single term at the House of Commons or Senate. The former banker is widely expected to trigger a general election in the coming days or weeks.

The opinion polls have indicated a slide in the popularity of the Conservative Party, led by Pierre Poilievre, which lost its early lead in recent weeks. The ruling party's rebound was attributed to Trudeau's resignation in January. Carey hopes to ride the momentum and secure a stable term amid threats of further tariffs and annexation from Donald Trump.

The US president has vowed to use “economic force” to make Canada a US state and has slapped steep tariffs, which drew immediate and proportional retaliation from Trudeau's government. Economic uncertainty triggered by tariffs has hampered businesses and spending plans, Bloomberg reported.

Carney has expressed willingness to meet Trump if he shows “respect for Canadian sovereignty″ and is willing to take a common approach over trade disputes. 

He has also touted achievements in his banking career to establish himself as a leader in uncertain times. During his first year as Bank of Canada governor, he slashed interest rates to almost zero to deal with the 2008 global financial crisis. As Bank of England governor, he also helped steer the UK economy during the turmoil of Brexit.

Columbia University on Thursday expelled or suspended some students who took over a campus building during pro-Palestinian protests last year, reported news agency Associated Press.

The institution has also revoked the diplomas of students who graduated for participating in the student protests.

In a campus-wide email, the university stated that a judicial board had ordered action against students who occupied Hamilton Hall in 2024 to protest the war in Gaza.

The decision to suspend, expel or revoke degrees was based on an “evaluation of the severity of behaviour.”

On April 30, 2024, a group of university students had barricaded themselves inside Columbia's Hamilton Hall, after forming tent encampments on campus in protest.

The Manhattan district attorney's office said it would not pursue criminal charges for 31 of the 46 people initially arrested on trespassing charges. However, the other students, are likely to face charges even beyond their suspension, expulsion or revocation of degrees.

The suspensions and expulsions come amidst a government crackdown on student activists, who they have deemed liable for arrest and deportation, for allegedly supporting antisemitic sentiment towards Israel.

A student at Columbia University, Mahmoud Khalil, was the first of several detentions targeting student activists, President Donald Trump stated.

Columbia University has also been stripped of over $400 million in federal funds for its failure to manage the antisemitic behaviours allegedly displayed during campus protests.

House Republicans have also criticised the university and called for the release of the disciplinary records of the students involved in the protests.

Mahmoud Khalil and seven other students have filed a lawsuit seeking to block a Congressional committee from obtaining these records.

The passengers of an American Airlines plane that caught fire Thursday night had to stand on the locked wing to escape after the plane made its emergency landing at Denver International Airport.

The incident happened after the flight took off from Colorado Springs airport and was flying to Dallas Fort Worth International Airport but made an emergency landing in Denver due to reported “engine vibrations,” the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said in a statement.

“After landing and while taxiing to the gate an engine caught fire,” the statement read.

Fowl American star, social media personality, and political commentator Ed Krassenstein raised concerns about airline safety, suggesting that recent safety lapses could be linked to policy decisions made under former President Donald Trump.

“An American Airlines plane caught fire at Denver International Airport forcing passengers running. Why does it seem like airline safety is plummeting under Trump? Maybe it's because he's making cuts to airline safety?” Krassenstein questioned.

He also questioned the Trump administration in a minutes earlier post, “I'm sorry, but these incidents certainly seem to be happening more following the government shakeups at the FAA and TSA. Coincidence or irresponsible government?”

Footage from the scene showed passengers huddled on the wing of the Boeing 737-800, with some clutching their belongings while flames burned near the lower part of the plane. Emergency slides were deployed to help passengers reach the ground safely.

American Airlines confirmed “The 172 customers and six crew members deplaned and are being relocated to the terminal” without any injury. They said the fire was due to an “engine-related issue.”

“We thank our crew members, DEN team and first responders for their quick and decisive action with the safety of everyone on board and on the ground as the priority,” the airline said, per ABC News.

The United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is facing a funding shortfall of $2 billion for this year, Axios reported on Friday, citing two people familiar with the matter. The report states that the agency's expenses have shot up amid President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.

ICE has struggled with budget shortfalls in recent years, but the financial strain has worsened as the agency attempts to meet Trump's directive to deport ""millions"" of unauthorized immigrants. This effort requires extensive resources, including increased staffing, additional detention facilities, and more transportation for deportations.

While Congress has approved an additional $500 million for ICE as part of a stop-gap spending bill currently being debated in the Senate, this amount is only a fraction of what the agency says it needs to maintain its current operations through the end of September, according to the Axios report.

The costs of Trump's immigration crackdown are staggering. The administration's plans include:

- Hiring hundreds of additional enforcement personnel.

- More than doubling ICE's detention capacity to 100,000 beds.

- Expanding the use of deportation flights, requiring a larger fleet of planes and more logistical support.

Not all of these expenses are covered in the current funding bill before Congress, meaning ICE is unlikely to receive the additional funding it seeks in the immediate future.

If ICE does not receive the additional funding from Congress, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may have to shift money from other agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the Coast Guard to cover ICE's shortfall. This pattern is not new—an analysis by the Government Accountability Office of ICE's budgets from 2014 to 2023 found that the agency has regularly overspent and had to rely on funds from other DHS departments.

After US President Donald Trump's proposed 'gold card' initiative, which would create a new immigration pathway for wealthy foreigners, Vice President JD Vance's latest remarks on the rights of green card holders have triggered a fresh debate. 

Green cards, officially known as Permanent Resident Cards, grant foreign nationals the right to live and work in the United States. However, despite the name, ""permanent residency"" is not an absolute guarantee of an indefinite stay.

""A green card holder doesn't have an indefinite right to be in the United States,"" Mr Vance said. ""This is not about 'free speech.' Yes, it's about national security-but more importantly, it's about who we, as American citizens, decide gets to join our national community.""

US law allows for the revocation of a green card under certain circumstances, including criminal activity, prolonged absence from the country, or failure to comply with immigration regulations. 



The proposed 'gold card' program would allow foreign nationals to purchase the right to live and work in the US for a $5 million fee.

""We're going to be selling a gold card,"" Mr Trump said from the Oval Office recently. ""You have a green card. This is a gold card. We're going to be putting a price on that card of about USD 5 million, and that's going to give you green card privileges, plus it's going to be a route to citizenship.""

The US President argued that the existing immigration system has hindered top international talent - especially from India - from staying in the US after completing their education at elite universities.

""A person comes from India, China, Japan, and other countries, attends Harvard or the Wharton School of Finance... they receive job offers, but the offer is immediately revoked because there's no certainty about whether that person can stay in the country,"" he said.

Under the 'gold card' initiative, companies could also purchase the cards to facilitate hiring foreign talent. Trump suggested that the program could generate billions in revenue and help pay down national debt.

The proposed program is expected to replace the existing EB-5 immigrant investor visa, which requires foreign investors to create jobs in the US to qualify for a green card.

Recent data from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) shows that Indian nationals have been major beneficiaries of US work visas. According to official figures, 72.3 per cent of all H1B visas issued between October 2022 and September 2023 went to Indian applicants.

Sam Jones, who describes herself as an ""outdoor enthusiast and hunter"", shared a video from an unknown location in Australia on Instagram earlier this week.

In a now-deleted video, Ms Jones can be seen picking up the baby wombat, a protected species of marsupial found only in Australia, that is seen struggling and heard hissing as its mother follows on the road behind. The woman looks into the camera and says, ""I caught a baby wombat"" before placing the wombat back on the road.

""There's never been a better day to be a wombat in Australia,"" Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said of the influencer's departure, as reported by news agency AFP.

The minister earlier revealed that the woman's tourist visa was under review and his department was reviewing whether immigration law had been breached.

""Given the level of scrutiny that will happen if she ever applies for a visa again, I'll be surprised if she even bothers,"" he said on Thursday.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned the influencer for pestering animal.

""To take a baby wombat from its mother, and clearly causing distress from the mother, is just an outrage,"" he told reporters Thursday.

""I suggest to this so-called influencer, maybe she might try some other Australian animals. Take a baby crocodile from its mother and see how you go there.""

The video left internet users in a rage. There are several online petitions condemning Jones' ""irresponsible and gruesome action."" One of the petitions demand Jones' to be deported from the country.

Following the outrage, Ms Jones deleted the video and made her account private. According to the Instagram bio, Ms Jones is a wildlife biologist and environmental scientist who holds an MSc degree and is based in Montana, US.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Elon Musk's Tesla has seen major drops around the globe and a significant $120 billion drop in net worth since his foray into politics. But much more awaits him and the EV sector. President Donald Trump's tariffs are set to make an impact in the EV sector as well, so warns Tesla.

In an unsigned letter to Jamieson Greer, the US trade representative, Tesla has said that although it ""supports fair trade"", the US administration should ensure that it did not ""inadvertently harm US companies"".

Trump has imposed tariffs that will impact vehicles and parts made around the world. 

Tesla said in the letter: ""As a US manufacturer and exporter, Tesla encourages the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to consider the downstream impacts of certain proposed actions taken to address unfair trade practices.""

""US exporters are inherently exposed to disproportionate impacts when other countries respond to US trade actions. The assessment undertaken by USTR of potential actions to rectify unfair trade should also take into account exports from the United States"", Tesla said.

""For example, past trade actions by the United States have resulted in immediate reactions by the targeted countries, including increased tariffs on electric vehicles imported into those countries.""

In Germany where Musk is supporting a far-right political party, sales fell almost 70% compared to January last year. Per Time magazine, Tesla sold 7,517 vehicles in Europe in January, half of what it sold in January the year prior. Tesla saw a 50% drop in sales in Portugal and 45% in France according to Reuters, while sales fell 42% in Sweden and 48% in Norway.

Trump also said on Truth Social this week ""Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla.""

On Tuesday, Trump bought a brand new red Tesla with the company's CEO by his side. ""Wow, that's beautiful,"" Trump said as he eased his way into the driver's seat of a Model X.

Recently anti-DOGE protesters gathered near Tesla stores to protest against his push to cut government funding with many holding banners that said, ""Elon must go away"" and ""honk if Elon Musk should be fired"".

""As USTR continues to evaluate possible trade actions to rectify unfair trade practices, consideration should also be given to the timeline of implementation. US companies will benefit from a phased approach that enables them to prepare accordingly and ensure appropriate supply chain and compliance measures are taken"", Tesla said.

Some hostages crouched on the floor for as long as 27 hours, remaining motionless, while some could only gasp in shock as armed rebels entered the train and began executing passengers. The freed hostages of Jaffar Express, which was hijacked by members of the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), have described the terrifying ordeal of the attack and what they went through before being rescued by Pakistani security forces. 

On Tuesday, the Jaffar Express, traveling from Quetta to Peshawar with 440 passengers, was ambushed by armed rebels. The 30-hour siege ended in a deadly confrontation that left 21 civilians and four security personnel dead, while all 33 militants were killed in a final military operation.

Speaking after the attack, train driver Amjad recounted that the militants detonated an explosive under the train's engine, causing the bogies to derail.

""As soon as the train stopped, Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) terrorists launched an attack,"" he said. ""The terrorists breached the train by smashing windows, but they mistakenly believed we were dead."" 

For the hundreds trapped inside, the ordeal was relentless. Survivors also said that the attackers separated passengers based on their region of origin.

Rescued passenger Arslan Yousaf recounted the militants' methodical violence. ""Sometimes, they took soldiers... and executed them,"" he was quoted as saying by news agency Reuters, referring to passengers from the Pakistan Army and security forces who were traveling on leave.

""Other times, they targeted specific individuals. If they had a grudge against someone, they shot him on the spot,"" he added. 

Freed hostage Mehboob Ahmed, 31, suffered multiple gunshot wounds and described how some captives tried to escape.

""We made two attempts. Some succeeded, but many were shot dead as the armed men opened fire,"" he said. ""We had nearly lost hope for survival.""

Another freed hostage, Muhammad Tanveer, said they were given only water to survive.

Balochistan, a resource-rich but insurgency-hit province, hosts major China-led infrastructure projects, including the Gwadar Port and gold and copper mines.

While Baloch rebels have long targeted security forces, installations, and foreign projects, this is the first recorded hijacking of a passenger train.

The attack on the Jaffar Express began Tuesday morning, when BLA rebels blew up a section of railway track, forcing the train to stop in the rugged Bolan region of Balochistan. Armed with rocket launchers, automatic weapons, and grenades, the militants barged into the train. In the remote mountain pass, they took passengers hostage and engaged in a prolonged firefight with Pakistani security forces.

By Wednesday, Pakistan's military had launched a full-scale operation to retake the train. Pakistani military confirmed that 21 civilians died during the siege.

""The security forces cleared the train bogey to bogey,"" a Pakistani army statement read. The Army, Air Force, and Frontier Corps (FC) coordinated the counter-attack, with Pakistan's elite Special Services Group (SSG) commandos leading the assault.

After hours of intense fighting, all 33 militants were killed, and more than 300 passengers were successfully rescued.

While Pakistan's military declared a complete victory, the BLA disputed the official account, claiming that they still held hostages and that the battle was ongoing.

The group's spokesperson, Jeeyand Baloch, alleged that the people Pakistan claimed to have rescued were actually released by the militants themselves.

""Now that the state has abandoned its hostages to die, it will also bear responsibility for their deaths,"" he said in a statement on Thursday.

In the wake of the attack, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif traveled to Quetta on Thursday for a security briefing.

Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration said the Boeing 737-800, flying from Colorado to Dallas-Fort Worth, diverted to Denver International Airport after the crew reported experiencing ""engine vibrations.""

""After landing and while taxiing to the gate an engine caught fire and passengers evacuated the aircraft using the slides,"" the FAA said in a statement. 

The latest incident comes amid safety concerns after a series of incidents and attempts by US President Donald Trump's administration to cut costs at US aviation agencies.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Two Japanese tourists in their 20s were detained for two weeks in China then deported for taking photos showing exposed buttocks at the Great Wall, local media reported. The incident at the World Heritage site near Beijing concerned a man who showed his bottom and a woman who took photos, NTV and other Japanese media outlets reported on Thursday.

Tokyo's foreign ministry said Friday that ""the Embassy of Japan in China confirmed on January 3 that two Japanese nationals were detained by local authorities at the Great Wall.""

They ""were subsequently released and returned to Japan during January"", it said in a statement.

The Japanese embassy in Beijing did not reply to requests for comment.

The tourists were detained on the spot by security guards and held for around two weeks, the reports said, citing sources.

Exposing the lower half of the body in a public place is against the law in China, according to the reports.

The tourists reportedly told the Japanese embassy they did it as a prank.

The reports sparked outrage in China, where memories of atrocities committed during Japan's colonial occupation of the country in the 1930s and 40s still inspire strong feelings.

A hashtag translating to ""Japanese man and woman detained for indecent behaviour at the Great Wall"" had been viewed over 60 million times on social media platform Weibo by Friday morning.

Many top-liked comments blasted the tourists for the act, with some using hateful language toward Japanese people.

One comment by Chinese actor Chen Yitian, who has over 7 million followers on the platform, condemned them for doing ""shameful things on my Great Wall"".

Others suggested China ban all Japanese visitors.

US, Israel Turn To Africa For Gaza Relocation","https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/sudan-somalia-or-somaliland-us-israel-turn-to-africa-for-gaza-relocation-7922896","Fri, 14 Mar 2025 11:06:31 GMT","

The US and Israel have reached out to officials of three East African governments to discuss using their territories as potential destinations for resettling Palestinians uprooted from the Gaza Strip under President Donald Trump's proposed postwar plan, American and Israeli officials told The Associated Press.

The contacts with Sudan, Somalia and the breakaway region of Somalia known as Somaliland reflect the determination by the US and Israel to press ahead with a plan that has been widely condemned and raised serious legal and moral issues. Because all three places are poor, and in some cases wracked by violence, the proposal also casts doubt on Trump's stated goal of resettling Gaza's Palestinians in a ""beautiful area.""

Officials from Sudan said they have rejected overtures from the US, while officials from Somalia and Somaliland told The Associated Press that they were not aware of any contacts.

Under Trump's plan, Gaza's more than 2 million people would be permanently sent elsewhere. He has proposed the US would take ownership of the territory, oversee a lengthy cleanup process and develop it as a real estate project.

The idea of a mass transfer of Palestinians was once considered a fantasy of Israel's ultranationalist fringe. But since Trump presented the idea at a White House meeting last month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has hailed it as a "" bold vision.""

Palestinians in Gaza have rejected the proposal and dismiss Israeli claims that the departures would be voluntary. Arab nations have expressed vehement opposition and offered an alternative reconstruction plan that would leave the Palestinians in place. Rights groups have said forcing or pressuring the Palestinians to leave could be a potential war crime.

Still, the White House says Trump ""stands by his vision.""

Speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a secret diplomatic initiative, US and Israeli officials confirmed the contacts with Somalia and Somaliland, while the Americans confirmed Sudan as well. They said it was unclear how much progress the efforts made or at what level the discussions took place.

Separate outreach from the US and Israel to the three potential destinations began last month, days after Trump floated the Gaza plan alongside Netanyahu, according to the US officials, who said that Israel was taking the lead in the discussions.

Israel and the US have a variety of incentives - financial, diplomatic and security - to offer these potential partners. It is a formula that Trump used five years ago when he brokered the Abraham Accords - a series of mutually beneficial diplomatic accords between Israel and four Arab countries.

The White House declined to comment on the outreach efforts.

The offices of Netanyahu and Ron Dermer, the Israeli Cabinet minister and Netanyahu confidant who has been leading Israel's postwar planning, also had no comment.

But Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a longtime advocate of what he calls ""voluntary"" emigration of Palestinians, said this week that Israel is working to identify countries to take in Palestinians. He also said Israel is preparing a ""very large emigration department"" within its Defense Ministry.

Here is a closer look at the places the officials say have been approached.

Sudan

The North African country was among the four Abraham Accord nations that agreed to normalize diplomatic relations with Israel in 2020.

As part of the deal, the US removed Sudan from its list of state supporters of terrorism, a move that gave the country access to international loans and global legitimacy. But relations with Israel never took off as Sudan plunged into civil war between government forces and the RSF paramilitary group.

The conflict has been marked by atrocities, including ethnically motivated killing and rape, according to the UN and rights groups. The International Criminal Court is investigating alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, and then-President Joe Biden's administration in January said the RSF and its proxies were committing genocide.

The US and Israel would be hard-pressed to persuade Palestinians to leave Gaza, particularly to such a troubled country. But they could offer incentives to the Khartoum government, including debt relief, weapons, technology and diplomatic support.

Two Sudanese officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive diplomatic matter, confirmed that the Trump administration has approached the military-led government about accepting Palestinians.

One of them said the contacts began even before Trump's inauguration with offers of military assistance against the RSF, assistance with postwar reconstruction and other incentives.

Both officials said the Sudanese government rejected the idea. ""This suggestion was immediately rebuffed,"" said one official. ""No one opened this matter again.""

Military chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan told an Arab leaders' summit last week in Cairo that his country ""categorically rejects"" any plan that aims to transfer ""the brotherly Palestinians from their land under whatever justification or name.""

Somaliland

Somaliland, a territory of over 3 million people in the Horn of Africa, seceded from Somalia over 30 years ago, but it is not internationally recognized as an independent state. Somalia considers Somaliland part of its territory.

Somaliland's new president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, has made international recognition a priority.

An American official involved in the efforts confirmed that the US was ""having a quiet conversation with Somaliland about a range of areas where they can be helpful to the US in exchange for recognition.""

The possibility of US recognition could provide an incentive for Abdullahi to back away from the territory's solidarity with the Palestinians.

The United Arab Emirates, another Abraham Accord country that has developed strong ties with Israel, once had a military base in Somaliland and maintains commercial interests there, including a port. The territory's strategic location, in the Gulf of Aden waterway near Yemen, home to the Houthi rebel group, could also make it a valuable ally.

Over the years, Somaliland has been lauded for its relatively stable political environment, contrasting sharply with Somalia's ongoing struggles amid deadly attacks by al-Qaida-linked operator group al-Shabab. Since 1991, Somaliland has maintained its own government, currency and security structures. Still, it has one of the lowest income levels in the world.

An official in Somaliland, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said his government has not been approached and is not in talks about taking in Palestinians.

Somalia

Somalia has been a vocal supporter of the Palestinians, often hosting peaceful protests on its streets in support of them. The country joined the recent Arab summit that rejected Trump's plan and seems like an unlikely destination for Palestinians, even if they did agree to move.

Sambu Chepkorir, a lawyer and conflict researcher in Nairobi, Kenya, said it is difficult to understand why Somalia would want to host Palestinians given the country's strong support for Palestinian self-rule.

""The realignments keep changing, and so maybe there is a hidden agenda,"" Chepkorir said.

A Somali official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said the country had not been approached about taking in Palestinians from Gaza and there had been no discussions about it.

US President Donald Trump said on Friday there is a ""very good chance"" the war between Russia and Ukraine can end after ""productive"" discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday.

""We had very good and productive discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia yesterday, and there is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end,"" Trump said in a Truth Social post, adding that he had requested that Putin spare the lives of ""completely surrounded"" Ukrainian troops.

US envoy Steve Witkoff had a long meeting with Putin in Moscow on Thursday night, a source briefed on the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.

The Truth Social post did not say whether Trump and Putin had spoken to each other.

However, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin had used the meeting to convey ""signals"" to Trump through Witkoff. He said Russia and the US would work out the timing of a phone call between their presidents once Witkoff had briefed Trump.

The US president has said he wants Moscow and Kyiv to agree a swift ceasefire to pause fighting in a conflict which he has warned has the potential to spiral into World War Three and has already cost many lives on both sides.

Putin raised concerns that Ukraine would use a ceasefire to its military benefit.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin's ambivalent response to a proposed ceasefire as ""very manipulative"".

""We now have all heard from Russia Putin's very predictable, very manipulative words in response to the idea of a ceasefire,"" Zelensky said in his nightly address.

Putin said Thursday in his first public comments on a 30-day ceasefire proposed by the United States and backed by Ukraine that he was in favour but had ""serious questions"" about how it would work.

Washington has called for Russia to accept a ceasefire without preconditions but Putin listed a number of obstacles in the way.

""We do not set conditions that complicate anything. Russia does that,"" Zelensky said.

""As we have always said, the only one who will drag things out, the only one who will be unconstructive, is Russia.""

Zelensky accused Putin of ""actually preparing a refusal"" but claimed he was ""afraid to say directly to President Trump that he wants to continue this war"". He also said Putin was ""framing the idea of a ceasefire with such preconditions that nothing will work out at all, or for as long as possible"".

In his comments Thursday, Putin raised concerns that Ukraine would use a ceasefire to its military benefit, and said Russia wanted to press ahead as its forces made advances.

He also questioned how the ceasefire would be monitored across a front line thousands of kilometres long.

""Putin often does this -- he doesn't say 'no' directly, but he does it in such a way that he practically only delays everything and makes normal solutions impossible. We think that this is all just another Russian manipulation,"" Zelensky said.

He added that the American side said they were ""ready to organise control and verification"" of the ceasefire.

""It is feasible to ensure this with American capabilities, European capabilities. And to prepare answers to all the questions about long-term security and real, reliable peace during the ceasefire and put a plan to end the war on the table,"" Zelensky said.

The White House is urging federal agencies to refrain from laying off their cybersecurity teams, as they scramble to comply with a Thursday deadline to submit mass layoff plans to slash their budgets, according to an email seen by Reuters.

Greg Barbaccia, the United States federal chief information officer, sent the message on Wednesday, in response to questions about whether cybersecurity employees' work is national security-related, and therefore exempt from layoffs.

""We believe cybersecurity is national security and we encourage Department-level Chief Information Officers to consider this when reviewing their organizations,"" he wrote in the email to information technology employees across the federal government which has not been previously reported.

Describing ""skilled cyber security professionals"" as playing ""a vital role in mission delivery and information assurance,"" he said, ""We are confident federal agencies will be able to identify efficiencies across their non-cyber mission areas without negatively affecting their agency's cyber posture,"" he added.

The Office of Management and Budget, which is part of the White House, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

But the email reflects growing concern that the deep cuts mandated by President Donald Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk could harm the United States' ability to combat cybersecurity threats.    

In testimony earlier this month, a former cybersecurity director at the National Security Agency,  Rob Joyce, said the mass culling of workers from federal payrolls would have a ""devastating"" impact on cybersecurity and national security.

The approach by the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency has raised extraordinary concerns of its own, with cybersecurity experts and former government officials alleging that unrestricted access to government systems could open the door to hackers and leaks.

At the Social Security Administration, for instance, DOGE was awarded unusually broad access to some of the agency's most sensitive data over the objections of senior officials. In a declaration submitted earlier this month in a lawsuit against the agency by a group of unions, a department staffer who recently exited said she did not  believe that DOGE associates were up to the task of protecting the data they won access to and that, ""in such a chaotic environment, the risk of data leaking into the wrong hands is significant.""

The US military must work to provide options to ensure the United States has full access to the Panama Canal, two US officials told Reuters on Thursday.

President Donald Trump has said repeatedly he wants to ""take back"" the Panama Canal, which is located at the narrowest part of the isthmus between North and South America and is considered one of the world's most strategically important waterways, but he has not offered specifics about how he would do so, or if military action might be required.

One US official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said a document, described as an interim national security guidance by the new administration, called on the military to look at military options to safeguard access to the Panama Canal.

A second official said the US military had a wide array of potential options to safeguard access, including ensuring a close partnership with Panama's military.

The Pentagon last published a National Defense Strategy in 2022, a document which lays out the priorities for the military. An interim document sets out broad policy guidance, much like Trump's executive orders and public remarks have done, ahead of a more considered policy document like a formal NDS.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The interim document was first reported by CNN. NBC News earlier on Thursday reported that the White House had ordered the Pentagon to create options for the Panama Canal.

Trump has asserted that the U.S. needs to take back the canal because China controls it and could use the waterway to undermine American interests. In his inaugural speech in January, Trump repeated accusations that Panama has broken the promises it made for the final transfer of the canal in 1999.

Any move by a foreign power to take the canal by force would almost certainly violate international law.

The US and Panama are treaty-bound to defend the canal against any threat to its neutrality and are permitted to take unilateral action to do so.

The US acquired the rights to build and operate the canal in the early 20th century. In a treaty signed in 1979, during the administration of Democratic President Jimmy Carter, the US agreed to turn over control of the canal to Panama at the close of 1999.

Mark Carney was sworn in as Canada's prime minister on Friday in Ottawa. Carney took oath in the office in the presence of General Mary Simon, the personal representative of King Charles.

In light of the deteriorating relations with the US under President Donald Trump's administration, his leadership marks a significant change in the country's political landscape. Carney, a 59-year-old former governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, took the oath in both English and French, pledging allegiance to King Charles III and vowing to serve as a ""faithful and true servant to his majesty"".

Carney's defeated his rivals on Sunday in a race to become leader of the ruling Liberal Party, despite lacking prior political experience. This unprecedented move has sparked interest, especially given Carney's background in navigating complex economic crises. His first major challenge will be addressing the strained US-Canada relations, which have hit an all-time low.

To tackle this, Carney plans to reshape his cabinet, with Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc shifting to the international trade portfolio and Innovation Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne taking over as finance minister. This strategic move aims to bolster Canada's alliances in Europe, particularly in London and Paris, where Carney is scheduled to visit next week.

Carney replaces Justin Trudeau, who served as prime minister for over nine years. Carney's outsider status, combined with his experience in managing crises, was seen as a major factor in his victory.

In a statement, Carney emphasised his commitment to defending Canadian sovereignty, saying he would only meet with Trump ""when there is respect for Canadian sovereignty."" He also reiterated his intention to maintain retaliatory tariffs on US goods until the US demonstrates respect for Canada.

Efforts are currently underway to arrange a call between Trump and Carney, according to Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly. ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Tesco is set to begin a trial where customers will be given expiring food for free at the end of the day as the British supermarket chain attempts to cut food wastage. The company will be giving away its already discounted ""yellow sticker"" items after 9:30 pm local time at some of its smaller Express stores in the coming months, according to a report in BBC.

Tesco is Britain's largest supermarket chain, with a 27.8 per cent market share, having 3,700 domestic stores and 750 more abroad. The supermarket giant, alongside other chains, has pledged to halve food waste by 2030.

""This trial will allow customers to take any remaining yellow-stickered items for free at the end of the day, after they have first been offered to charities and colleagues,"" a company spokesperson said.

Tesco already donates expiring food to charities and foodbanks. It added that the charities and shop workers will get the first priority over expiring food before it is offered to the customers. Previously food items bearing a yellow sticker had a maximum of 90 percent price reduction.

""We are constantly looking for innovative new ways to reduce food waste. In all our stores we offer unsold surplus food to charities and community groups, donating millions of meals each month.""

In 2023/24, the supermarket achieved a 61 percent reduction of absolute emissions from its operations compared to 2015, which exceeded its 2025 target of 60 percent.

""We've done this by using energy and refrigeration more efficiently, and by adopting 100 percent renewable electricity across the Group.""

Amid the cost-of-living crisis, a boom in demand for discounted food across supermarkets has been observed in Britain with sales of yellow sticker items soaring. An analysis by Barclays revealed that almost two-thirds of households were buying discounted products in 2023.

Additionally, more people have been heading towards the food banks for survival. Over 1.4 million new users have visited the food banks in the last two years, according to the Trussell Trust food bank.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

The 79-year-old Duterte, the first Asian former leader arrested on an ICC warrant, was read his rights and formally informed of the charges of crimes against humanity that the court's prosecutors filed against him after a lengthy investigation.

Harry Roque, also a lawyer seeking to represent him in the ICC case, said the question of jurisdiction over the Philippines, which withdrew from the global court when Duterte was president, should be addressed before any further proceedings.

Sara Duterte spoke outside the court, telling reporters she expected the ICC to “give us permission” to visit her father and hoped the court would “allow our request to move the initial appearance.” The 79-year-old Duterte, the first Asian former leader arrested on an ICC warrant, will be read his rights and formally informed of the crimes against humanity charge that the court's prosecutors filed against him after a lengthy investigation.

Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was being flown to the Netherlands on Wednesday to face an International Criminal Court charge of crimes against humanity linked to the deadly crackdown on drugs he oversaw while in office.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Jailed former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte appeared Friday by videoconference before judges at the International Criminal Court, days after his arrest in Manila on murder charges linked to the deadly “ war on drugs ” that he oversaw while in office.

The 79-year-old Duterte didn't show up at the court in The Hague, but appeared on a video screen from the detention center where he is being held, about a mile (1½ kilometers) away.

For families of victims of the drugs crackdown, Duterte's appearance in court was a long-awaited sign of hope. Duterte's vocal supporters call the arrest illegal. 

His lawyer, Salvador Medialdea, used the hearing to slam his arrest in Manila as a “pure and simple kidnapping.” He said Duterte “was denied all access to the legal recourse in the country of his citizenship, and this all in the nature of political score-settling.”

Presiding Judge Iulia Antoanella Motoc set a pretrial hearing date of Sept. 23 to establish if prosecution evidence is strong enough to merit sending the case to trial. If a trial does go ahead, it could take years, and if Duterte is convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

Estimates of the death toll during Duterte's presidential term vary, from the more than 6,000 that the national police have reported and up to 30,000, according to numbers from human rights groups.




The ICC judge said that Duterte had been allowed to participate in his first hearing by videoconference because he had just come off a long flight.

AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is scheduled to stand before judges today at the International Criminal Court, days after his stunning arrest in Manila on murder charges.

Duterte, wearing a jacket and tie, listened to the hearing through headphones, often with his eyes closed. He spoke in English to confirm his name, and his date and place of birth. He was not required to enter a plea. The hearing, which started about a half-hour late, lasted around 30 minutes.

Medialdea said that Duterte had been under observation at a hospital because of health issues. 

The judge, addressing Duterte, said: “The court doctor was of the opinion that you were fully mentally aware and fit.”

Duterte was arrested Tuesday amid chaotic scenes in the Philippine capital after returning from a visit to Hong Kong. He was swiftly put on a chartered jet and flown to the Netherlands.

His daughter, Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte, visited him in the court's detention center Friday and met with supporters outside the court. Duterte is a political rival of the current president.

She said her father is ″in good spirits″ and ″well taken care of,″ and his only complaint about his conditions is that he misses Filipino food. 

She too decried what she called a political arrest. ″There will be a day of reckoning for all,″ she said, as excited crowds around her chanted ″Duterte!″ and ″yes, yes!″

Meanwhile, activists marched in the Philippine capital region, demanding justice for the thousands of suspects killed in Duterte's brutal crackdowns. Families of those killed watched the ICC proceedings on screens set up around the country, some holding portraits of their slain loved ones, as they listened to charges read out against Duterte in a courtroom across the world.

Prosecutors accuse Duterte of involvement as an “indirect co-perpetrator” in multiple murders, amounting to a crime against humanity for allegedly overseeing killings from November 2011 until March 2019, first while he was mayor of the southern city of Davao and later as president of the Philippines.

According to the prosecution request for his arrest, Duterte, as Davao mayor, issued orders to police and other “hitmen” who formed so-called Davao Death Squads, or DDS.

He told them “that their mission was to kill criminals, including drug dealers, and provided clearance for specific DDS killings,” prosecutors allege, adding that he recruited, paid and rewarded the killers and “provided them with the necessary weapons and resources, and promised to shield them from prosecution.”

The document seeking an ICC warrant for Duterte said that prosecutors built their case using evidence including witness testimony, speeches by Duterte himself, government documents and video footage.

Human rights groups and victims' families have hailed Duterte's arrest as a historic triumph against state impunity, while the former president's supporters have slammed what they call the government's surrender of a political rival to a court whose jurisdiction they dispute.

“We are happy and we feel relieved,” said 55-year-old Melinda Abion Lafuente, mother of 22-year-old Angelo Lafuente, who she said was tortured and killed in 2016.

“Duterte's appearance before the ICC is a testament to the courage and determination of the victims, their families, and Filipino activists and journalists to pursue justice no matter how long it takes,” said Bryony Lau, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Other leaders facing ICC arrest warrants, like (Russian President) Vladimir Putin and (Israeli Prime Minister) Benjamin Netanyahu, should take note that even those who seem untouchable today can end up in The Hague.”

Duterte's legal team said that Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s administration shouldn't have allowed the global court to take custody of the former leader because the Philippines is no longer a party to the ICC.

Medialdea said that “two troubled entities struck an unlikely alliance. An incumbent president who wishes to neutralize and choke the legacy of my client and his daughter,” and “a troubled legal institution subject to delegitimization.”

Judges who approved Duterte's arrest warrant said that the court has jurisdiction because the crimes alleged in the warrant were committed before Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the court in 2019.

Chuck Schumer supports bill, but AOC and Nancy Pelosi warn against Republican legislation as shutdown looms

Prominent Democrats are at odds over whether to support a bill to fund the government, with the Senate set to vote on the legislation on Friday as a government shutdown looms at midnight.

The California Democratic representative and former House speaker Nancy Pelosi came out against the continuing resolution (CR) on Friday after the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, announced on Thursday he would urge Senate Democrats to advance the bill. Schumer argued that allowing a government shutdown would be “a far worse option” than passing the “deeply partisan” Republican legislation, but Pelosi called the bill a “devastating assault on the wellbeing of working-class families”.

“Democratic senators should listen to the women,” she said in a statement. “Appropriations leaders Rosa DeLauro and Patty Murray have eloquently presented the case that we must have a better choice: a four-week funding extension to keep government open and negotiate a bipartisan agreement. America has experienced a Trump shutdown before – but this damaging legislation only makes matters worse.”

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also condemned Schumer for caving to Republican demands on a government funding bill, saying the move had created a “deep sense of outrage and betrayal” among Democrats.

Speaking to reporters in Leesburg, Virginia, where House Democrats were gathered for their annual policy retreat, Ocasio-Cortez said she was mobilizing Democratic supporters to push Schumer to oppose what she characterized as an “acquiesce” to the GOP bill.

“We have time to correct course on this decision. Senate Democrats can vote no,” the New York Democrat said.

The rift has reportedly sparked such anger among House Democrats that some are encouraging Ocasio-Cortez to challenge Schumer in a primary election, according to CNN. When asked about these suggestions, she declined to comment.

On Thursday, Schumer said on the Senate floor: “The Republican bill is a terrible option. But I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option.”

Trump praised Schumer on Truth Social, writing: “Congratulations to Chuck Schumer for doing the right thing – Took ‘guts' and courage!”

Schumer reiterated his support for the spending bill on the Senate floor on Friday, warning that a government shutdown would mean that Trump, Elon Musk and the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) would be free to make even more disruptive cuts to federal agencies.

“If government were to shut down, Doge has a plan in place to exploit the crisis for maximum destruction,” Schumer said. “A shutdown will allow Doge to shift into overdrive. It would give Donald Trump and Doge the keys to the city, state and country. Donald Trump and Elon Musk would be free to destroy vital government services at a much faster rate than they can right now and over a much broader field of destruction that they would render.”

But the Federal Unionists Network, a group of federal employees that opposes the administration's campaign to dramatically downsize government, disagreed, saying the funding bill under consideration would make the situation worse.

“Once again, Congress is failing in its responsibility to the American people,” spokesperson Chris Dols said in a statement. “If passed, this CR will give Trump and Musk the power to complete their assault on federal workers.”

The Senate majority leader, John Thune, a Republican, told reporters on Friday that he may allow some amendment votes on the spending bill, which could potentially offer a way to assuage Democrats' concerns.

The funding bill represents the first major leverage point in Trump's second term, with House Democrats urging the Senate to instead consider a 30-day funding stopgap to allow more time for negotiations.

Unlike the House vote, where all but one Democrat voted against the government funding bill, the response in the Senate is fractured. Republicans hold a 53-47 majority, and the Kentucky senator Rand Paul is expected to vote against the bill. If that is the case, eight Democratic votes will be needed to send the bill to Trump's desk.

While facing intense pressure from within their party to resist Trump and his billionaire ally Musk, the Senate Democrats who are leaning yes are worried about the impacts of a government shutdown, and what bill they could get passed from their minority position anyway.

The yes crowd includes the Pennsylvania senator John Fetterman, who told MSNBC on Tuesday: “We don't agree with what's been sent to us but, you know, if we withhold our votes, that is going to shut the government down.”

Still, Ocasio-Cortez particularly criticized Senate Democrats for even considering withdrawing support from a vote that nearly all battleground House Democrats were willing to take.

“There are members of Congress who have won Trump-held districts in some of the most difficult territory in the United States who walked the plank and took innumerable risks in order to defend the American people,” she said. “Just to see Senate Democrats even consider acquiescing to Elon Musk, I think, is a huge slap in the face.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

President's changes to student loan programs leave millions facing higher payments and uncertainty over relief options

Many of the nearly 43 million Americans who have federal student loan debt are seeing their carefully budgeted monthly payments soar amid Donald Trump's overhaul of education in the United States.

In the last few weeks, the Trump administration closed applications for all income-driven repayment plans (even ones not blocked by courts) and limited those eligible for public service loan forgiveness (PSLF). That program forgives the loans of government and select nonprofit workers after completing 10 years of service and making 10 years of minimum payments.

“The student loan system was broken when President Biden was responsible for it. All we've seen since President Trump has come in as an effort to provide fewer rights and fewer resources for working people that have student debt, making the cost of living go up,” said Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center.

“Things are worse now than they've ever been, and nothing is on the table that will make life better for people with student loans.”

Jordan, a public high-school English teacher in Redding, California, and his wife, who also works in public education, have student loans totaling $200,000. The couple, who recently welcomed a second child, just bought a house to accommodate their growing family. An even higher student loan payment each month wasn't a consideration when they took out a mortgage, he said.

“We're going from making $600 in payments – that's what Save (saving on a valuable education) is supposed to do, which we can absorb to an extent. But if we go off of income-based payments, I don't know what's going to happen,” Jordan, 37, said.

“Today I tried to calculate what's going to happen, and the calculators don't work on the webpage. I couldn't even tell you real numbers if I wanted.”

With a new mortgage and childcare exceeding $15,000 on a teacher's salary, Jordan and his family are stretched thin.

He said: “It's been alarming, but I've tried to enter into zen mode. I'll just move my money and I guess wait until they figure out how to garnish my wages, if I even have money. I don't know. What am I supposed to do?”

Aaron, a pharmacist in Ohio, started looking for a second job when Trump got elected in preparation for higher monthly payments.

“I'm nervous about it. I basically knew on election night what was going to happen to the Save Plan. It was going to go away. I did a second pharmacist job filling in some [pro re nata] hours,” Aaron, 47, said. “I'm still looking for additional hours to try to pick up.”

Aaron took out around $180,000 in loans to cover pharmacy school tuition and living expenses for him and his family. With the Save plan and PSLF, he expected to pay $700 a month and have his loan forgiven after 10 years since he works for the state. Without an income driven repayment plan as an option, he fears a possible monthly payment of $1,800 for the next 30 years on a standard extended repayment plan with no chance of forgiveness.

“The more that you go to school, have an advanced degree, you earn more over your lifetime. You pay more in taxes. Not just income taxes, but property taxes, sales taxes, everything else. So it's actually a pretty good deal to invest in somebody to go to school,” he said. “I don't see [loan forgiveness] as a handout, which is what people try to say ‘well, you know, I didn't go to school, so I shouldn't pay for anything.' Yeah, but if I told you about all the stuff that I shouldn't be paying for, you could play that game all day.”

Reina Chilton-Mayer is a homemaker and caregiver for her disabled teenage son. Despite her husband having a master's degree and stable income for many years, the unstable rental market alongside the cost of caretaking has left them with few choices, she said. She and her husband's combined $140,000 worth of student loans has left them so burdened that they are considering defaulting on their debt for the first time.

“I hate defaulting on something. It could have career impacts for my husband,” Chilton-Mayer, 44, said. “If you wanted to change jobs, of course there are going to be financial background checks. So we're not 100% on whether or not we're going to do that, but at the end of the day, it just comes down to making ends meet every month.”

Ebrahim Ghazali, the chief of pediatrics at a clinic in Springfield, Massachusetts, has just one year left of payments until the rest of his loans would be forgiven under PSLF. The recent changes to federal student loans have paused his payments and left him unsure about the future of his debt.

“With these giant student loans, my payments were initially close to $2,000 a month. When I got on the Save plan, it brought it down to between $600 and $700 a month, which I can budget a lot better,” Ghazali, 41, said.

But now, with the application websites down, he said he is “unable to progress towards forgiveness and with the application site down. I can't restart them on a different repayment plan. I'm not even sure if my current employment is going to count towards repayment at this point.”

As the potential shuttering of the department of education looms, Pierce noted that “the worst things that could happen are already happening right now, and we don't need to wait for the education department to shuffle the deck chairs around on the Titanic”.

“Borrowers have a right to make payments based on their income,” he said. “They have a right to have their debt canceled that they work in public service, and those rights have been shut down by President Trump.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Betar US is among far-right groups supporting Trump effort to deport students involved in pro-Palestinian protests

A far-right group that claimed credit for the arrest of a Palestinian activist and permanent US resident who the Trump administration is seeking to deport claims it has submitted “thousands of names” for similar treatment.

Betar US is one of a number of rightwing, pro-Israel groups that are supporting the administration's efforts to deport international students involved in university pro-Palestinian protests, an effort that escalated this week with the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, an activist who recently completed his graduate studies at Columbia University.

This week, Donald Trump said Khalil's arrest was just “the first of many to come”. Betar US quickly claimed credit on social media for providing Khalil's name to the government.

Betar, which has been labelled an extremist group by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a Jewish advocacy group, said on Monday that it had “been working on deportations and will continue to do so”, and warned that the effort would extend beyond immigrants. “Expect naturalized citizens to start being picked up within the month,” the group's post on X read. (It is very difficult to revoke US citizenship, though Trump has indicated an intention to try.)

The group has compiled a so-called “deportation list” naming individuals it believes are in the US on visas and have participated in pro-Palestinian protests, claiming these individuals “terrorize America”.

A Betar spokesperson, Daniel Levy, said in a statement to the Guardian that Betar submitted “thousands of names” of students and faculty they believe to be on visas from institutions like Columbia, the University of Pennsylvania, UCLA, Syracuse University and others to representatives of the Trump administration.

The group claims to have “documentation, including tapes, social media and more” to support their actions. It claims to be sharing names with several high-ranking officials, including the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; the White House homeland security adviser, Stephen Miller; and the attorney general, Pam Bondi, among others.

The White House and state department did not respond to questions about whether they are working with Betar or other groups to identify students for deportation.

Ross Glick, who was the executive director of the US chapter of Betar until last month, told the Guardian that the list began forming last fall. He noted that when they started compiling names, it was unclear who the next president would be, but that the change in administrations had been beneficial to their initiative.

During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly vowed to deport foreign students involved in pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses and frequently framed demonstrations against Israel's actions in Gaza as expressions of support for Hamas. Last week, it was reported that the US state department plans to use AI to identify foreign students for deportation.

The arrest of Khalil last week, who served as a lead negotiator for the Gaza solidarity encampment at Columbia University, aligned with Trump's executive order aimed at combatting antisemitism. An accompanying fact sheet pledged the administration would cancel the student visas of those identified as “Hamas sympathizers” and deport those who participated in “pro-jihadist protests”.

After the election, Glick said he met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill, including the Democratic senator John Fetterman and aides to the Republican senators Ted Cruz and James Lankford, all of whom, he said, supported the efforts.

In a phone call this week, Glick said he discussed Khalil with Cruz in Washington DC just days before he was arrested.

Cruz's office did not respond to a request for comment on the meeting with Glick.

Glick said that the individuals on Betar's list were identified through tips from students, faculty and staff on these campuses, along with social media research. He also claimed he had received support from “collaborators” who use “facial recognition AI-based technology” to help identify protesters that can even identify people wearing face coverings. He declined to elaborate on the specific technology used.

Glick mentioned that in recent months he had been inundated with messages from students, professors and university administrators across the country, all providing him with information on protesters' identities. He said that he vetted the legitimacy of those tips and that he believed Khalil and other pro-Palestinian protesters were “promoting the eradication, the destruction and the devolution of western civilization”.

Glick described Khalil as an “operative”. When asked who he was an operative for, he responded: “Well, that has to be determined.”

Khalil is being held in a Louisiana detention center after being moved from New York. His detention is being challenged in a Manhattan federal court.

The arrest has sparked outrage and alarm from free-speech advocates who see the move to deport Khalil as a flagrant violation of his free speech rights and on Wednesday, protests erupted outside the Manhattan courthouse, where hundreds gathered demanding his freedom.

Betar is not alone in its efforts to support Trump's deportation campaign, an effort that has divided American Jews in whose name the administration is purporting to act.

In the days leading up to his arrest, videos featuring Khalil and others at a sit-in at Barnard against the expulsion of two students who disrupted a class on Israel began circulating on social media.

Pro-Israel social-media accounts, including that of Shai Davidai, a vocal assistant professor at Columbia's business school who was temporarily barred from campus last year after the school said he repeatedly intimidated and harassed university employees, identified Khalil and tagged Rubio in posts urging him to revoke his visa and deport him.

The video of Khalil that was circulating was first posted by Canary Mission, an online database that publishes the names and personal information of people that it considers to be anti-Israel or antisemitic, focusing mainly on those at universities across the US.

When Khalil was arrested, Canary Mission said that it was “delighted that our exposure of Mahmoud Khalil's hatred has led to such deserved consequences”, adding that it had “more Columbia news on its way”.

On Monday afternoon, Canary Mission released a video naming five other students and faculty it believes should be deported.

It was revealed this week by Zeteo that Khalil had emailed Columbia University the day before his arrest, appealing for protection and telling the university's interim president that he was being subjected to a “dehumanizing doxxing campaign” that week led by Davidai and David Lederer, a Columbia student.

“Their attacks have incited a wave of hate, including calls for my deportation and death threats,” Khalil said.

He added: “I haven't been able to sleep, fearing that Ice or a dangerous individual might come to my home. I urgently need legal support, and I urge you to intervene and provide the necessary protections to prevent further harm.”

In another email, Khalil reportedly cited a threatening post by Betar, in which the group claimed he said: “Zionists don't deserve to live.” Khalil “unequivocally” denied ever saying that.

In that post, Betar wrote that Ice⁩ was “aware of his home address and whereabouts” and said it had “provided all his information to multiple contacts”.

After the arrest, Karoline Leavitt, the spokesperson for the White House, said that Columbia University had been given the “names of other individuals who have engaged in pro-Hamas activity” but said that the school was “refusing to help DHS identify those individuals on campus”.

Khalil's arrest has divided American Jews, many of whom have harshly condemned the activist's arrest.

The ADL, a group that describes its focus as fighting antisemitism and all forms of hate and that is also known to view campus protests as antisemitic, welcomed the escalation and said it appreciated “the Trump administration's broad, bold set of efforts to counter campus antisemitism.

“Obviously, any deportation action or revocation of a Green Card or visa must be undertaken in alignment with required due process protections,” the group said. It added: “We also hope that this action serves as a deterrent to others who might consider breaking the law on college campuses or anywhere.”

But many mainstream, progressive and leftwing Jewish groups have condemned the administration's actions as a dangerous violation of free speech.

“It is both possible and necessary to directly confront and address the crisis of antisemitism, on campus and across our communities, without abandoning the fundamental democratic values that have allowed Jews, and so many others, to thrive here,” said Amy Spitalnick, head of the liberal Jewish Council for Public Affairs.

In a letter on Thursday to the US Department of Homeland Security, several groups including the New York Jewish Agenda, Aleph: Alliance for Jewish Renewal, Habonim Dror North America and others, said that they were “deeply disturbed by the circumstances surrounding the apprehension and detention of Mahmoud Khalil”.

“Irrespective of the content of Mr Khalil's speech, we firmly believe that his arrest does nothing to make Jews safer,” the groups said. “In the past, laws and policies that limit the right to free speech have often been wielded against the Jewish community, and we are worried that we are seeing signs that they are being wielded against Muslim, Arab, and other minority communities now.”

David Myers, a distinguished professor and the Sady and Ludwig Kahn chair in Jewish history at the University of California Los Angeles, told the Guardian he believed the Trump administration was instrumentalizing and weaponizing “antisemitism for political gain”.

“I think ultimately, [the administration] is interested in something larger than defending Jewish students, it's really interested in bringing the university to its knees as a way of removing a key liberal, progressive actor from the American political game,” he said.

Myers described Betar's decision to compile a list of people to be deported as “horrifying” but “not a total surprise”, he said, given what Betar has historically represented, which he called an “embrace of Jewish fascism”.

“I find it distasteful, un-Jewish and collaborationist to forge together lists of people who fail to meet a political litmus test,” Myers said.

He believes universities should resist pressure from the government and uphold the principles of fairness and democracy.

“It's a moment of reckoning about where one's values really lie,” he said.

“If universities submit, that's removing an extraordinarily important site of free and open thinking from the American political conversation. I think that would be very ominous for this country, a further step in the move towards a fully authoritarian regime.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

US and Israel reportedly contacted officials in Sudan, Somalia and Somaliland 

Sudanese officials say they have rejected a request from the US to discuss taking in Palestinians displaced from Gaza under Donald Trump's plan to turn the territory into a “Riviera on the Mediterranean”.

According to an Associated Press report, the US and Israel contacted officials in Sudan, Somalia and Somaliland about resettling uprooted Palestinians. The contacts suggested both countries are determined to press ahead with Trump's proposal despite international outrage and massive practical difficulties – or at least use the plan to force other actors in the region to come up with their own ideas for Gaza when hostilities finally end.

Two officials from war-torn Sudan confirmed to the Associated Press that the Trump administration had approached the military-led government about accepting Palestinians.

One said the contacts began even before Trump's inauguration with offers of military assistance in the army's fight against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, assistance with postwar reconstruction and other incentives. Both officials said the Sudanese government rejected the idea. “This suggestion was immediately rebuffed,” said one official. “No one opened this matter again.”

Ahmed Moalim Fiqi, Somalia's foreign minister, did not confirm or deny any requests from Israel or the US but said Somalia rejected any plan that would involve the use of its territory for the resettlement of other populations or would undermine the Palestinian people's right to live peacefully on their ancestral land.

Under Trump's plan, Gaza's more than 2 million residents would be permanently displaced to allow massive reconstruction as a high-end “international” leisure and business destination. Experts said any forced resettlement was illegal under international law.

Initially, Egypt and Jordan were suggested as destinations for displaced Palestinians, but both strenuously opposed the plan. 
 Palestinians in Gaza have also rejected the proposal and dismiss Israeli claims that the departures would be voluntary. Arab nations have offered an alternative multibillion-dollar reconstruction plan that would leave the Palestinians in place.

The White House says Trump “stands by his vision”.

Speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a secret diplomatic initiative, US and Israeli officials also described to the Associated Press news agency contacts with Somalia and the breakaway Somaliland region. They said it was unclear how much progress the efforts made or at what level the discussions took place.

Outreach from the US and Israel to the three potential destinations began last month, days after Trump floated the Gaza plan, according to the US officials, who said that Israel was taking the lead in the discussions.
 Israeli officials and the White House have declined to comment on the efforts. The offices of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, and Ron Dermer, the Israeli minister who has been leading Israel's postwar planning, also had no comment.
 Netanyahu has hailed Trump's proposal as a “bold vision”, while Bezalel Smotrich, Israel's far-right finance minister and a longtime advocate of what he calls “voluntary” emigration of Palestinians, has recently said that Israel was working to identify countries to take in Palestinians.

International legal experts have told the Guardian that, given the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, any such emigration could be unlawful and potentially constitute a war crime.

Sudan was among the four Abraham accord nations that agreed to normalise diplomatic relations with Israel in 2020 but was plunged almost immediately into a civil war marked by widespread atrocities, including ethnically motivated killing and rape, according to the UN and rights groups.

US officials, seemingly aware that few Palestinians would be keen to relocate to such a precarious state, attempted to sweeten any deal by offering a range of incentives to Sudan's government, including an offer of assistance to the army in its fight against the RSF which, in turn, is backed by the United Arab Emirates, a significant US ally.

The proposal, if accepted, would have meant the US backing a side it has accused of war crimes and joining the same side in the conflict as Russia, at a time when Vladimir Putin is contemplating the American proposal for a ceasefire in Ukraine.

Before the revelations, Sudan had already indicated it would not entertain any attempt to resettle Palestinians in a country coping with the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The head of Sudan's army and de facto president, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan – subject of the US sanctions – last week told a summit in Cairo that his country “categorically rejects” any plan that aims to transfer “the brotherly Palestinians from their land under whatever justification or name”.

The Guardian has contacted Sudan's ministry of foreign affairs for comment.

Somaliland, a territory of more than 3 million people in the Horn of Africa, seceded from Somalia more than 30 years ago, but it is not internationally recognised as an independent state.

An American official involved in the efforts confirmed to the Associated Press that the US was “having a quiet conversation with Somaliland about a range of areas where they can be helpful to the US in exchange for recognition”.
 An official in Somaliland, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to the media, said his government had not been approached and was not in talks about taking in Palestinians.
 Somalia is an even more unlikely destination. Mogadishu has been a vocal supporter of the Palestinians, and joined the recent Arab summit that rejected Trump's plan. A Somali official told the Associated Press the country had not been approached about taking in Palestinians from Gaza and there had been no discussions about it.

In recent years, Somalia has developed strong ties with Arab states and with Turkey. Much of the country is ruled by al-Shabaab, an extremist Islamist militia allied with al-Qaida.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Scott Anthony Gastal, who at age 11 had testified in court in the 1980s that his priest had raped him, was beaten to death

The clergy abuse survivor who effectively ignited the US Catholic church's reckoning with clerical molestation when – at age 11 – he testified in the 1980s that his priest had raped him was recently beaten to death in south-west Louisiana.

Scott Anthony Gastal, whose later life was marked by legal struggles after enduring child sexual abuse at the hands of notorious clergy predator Gilbert Gauthe, was 50.

“Like all other sexual abuse victims, Scott surely lived a tortured, troubled and difficult life, having been robbed of his youthful innocence,” said a statement from attorney Cle Simon, whose late father, J Minos Simon, represented Gastal's family in civil litigation involving Gauthe.

Simon said that his own involvement in other Catholic church-related sexual abuse cases has convinced him “that there is probably no end in sight to the number of innocent children that were subjected to clergy sexual abuse and horrible consequences resulting therefrom”.

When Gastal first publicly shared his abuse, the Catholic diocese of Lafayette, Louisiana, had already paid more than $4m in confidential settlements to nine families whose children who were molested by Gauthe. Gastal's family, however, declined to settle and sued the diocese, alleging that the church so badly failed to protect the boy from Gauthe that the abuse inflicted on the child sent him to the hospital with rectal bleeding at one point.

The family alleged that Gauthe tried to ingratiate himself with them by bringing their child a toy truck during his hospitalization, as Minnesota Public Radio once reported. Yet the gesture did not dissuade Gastal from taking the witness stand at a civil trial in 1986 and – not yet 12 – describing his being raped by Gauthe.

Gastal's family ultimately won $1m from the diocese. His case added to revelations that Gauthe had abused children for years before he pleaded guilty in criminal court in 1985 to molesting several boys. Both the civil and criminal cases against Gauthe – who once reportedly told a psychologist that he had molested more than 300 children – made international headlines after being covered extensively by regular Guardian contributor Jason Berry.

Though Gauthe served only 10 years in prison and now lives in Texas, the scandal surrounding his downfall metastasized across the US. Numerous priests nationwide have been accused of child molestation in the decades since, including in cases that occurred well before Gastal's abuse. Some have been convicted in criminal court and imprisoned.

Survivors and their families have pursued so many lawsuits seeking damages over Catholic clergy abuse that about 40 of the church's US institutions – including dioceses – have filed for federal bankruptcy protection. Most of those bankruptcy cases had settled, but many remained pending at the time of Gastal's death.

Gauthe's defense attorney, Ray Mouton, later helped draft a 92-page manual aiming to detail how widespread Catholic clergy abuse was and to advise the church's bishops on how to address the issue. Mouton then published a novelized version of the Gauthe case and its fallout: 2012's In God's House, dedicating it in part to Gastal, whom the author said “changed the course of history when he became the first child to face a bishop in a court of law, testifying bravely before a judge and jury”.

Meanwhile, after a Pulitzer prize-winning Boston Globe investigation in 2002 exposed its local Catholic archdiocese for having covered up the widespread sexual abuse of children by its clerics, Gastal told CBS that he struggled to hold down work because of the extreme post-traumatic stress and insomnia with which he had grappled after surviving Gauthe's abuse.

“I don't like to be around people,” Gastal, working at the time at a horse ranch, said to the news network. “I just try not to feel at all. For the longest time, I just tried to black all this out so it wouldn't hurt me no more.”

Information online shows Gastal more recently had a couple of relatively minor brushes with the law. Then, on 2 March, police said he was found on the ground and badly beaten in a motel parking lot near a convention center in Lake Charles, Louisiana.

He died nine days later at a hospital in Lafayette, where he was being treated for head injuries, as the Louisiana news station KPLC reported.

Police arrested a 28-year-old man named Reese Iles Chaumont in connection with Gastal's slaying and he faces a count of second-degree murder. Chaumont would receive mandatory life imprisonment if eventually convicted of murdering Gastal.

Gastal's death prompted intense condolences from his state's tightly knit community of clergy abuse survivors and advocates.

Among them was Scott “Alex” Peyton, whose brother was sexually molested by another priest of the Lafayette diocese and who helps his parents lead TentMakers of Louisiana, a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting clergy abuse survivors.

“Some lives are shaped by battles they never chose, defined by resilience in the face of darkness – to endure the storm and rise, only to be struck down by senseless violence, is a tragedy beyond words,” Peyton said in a statement. Peyton's statement also said that Gastal's killing was “a cruel reminder that fate is often indifferent to justice”.

A statement from Peyton's mother, TentMakers executive director Letitia Peyton, said Gastal's murder was “a sad end to a life that was riddled with early childhood trauma”. Letitia Peyton, who is also the leader of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (Snap) chapter in Louisiana, credited Gastal with “preventing so many other children from suffering the horrific abuse that he suffered” – and hailed him as “a truly brave little boy”.

The president of Survivors of Childhood Sex Abuse, Richard Windmann, added in his own statement that he believed both Gauthe and the Lafayette diocese “have blood on their hands” after Gastal's death – despite the role that police attribute to Chaumont.

“If he had not been raped by Gilbert Gauthe, Scott Gastal would not have been there,” Windmann contended.

Neither Gauthe nor the Lafayette diocese immediately responded to requests for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Putin responds to Trump's appeal to save ‘surrounded' Ukrainian soldiers in Kursk though there is no evidence of encirclement

Vladimir Putin has praised Donald Trump for “doing everything” to improve relations between Moscow and Washington, after Trump said the US has had “very good and productive discussions” with Putin in recent days.

Putin told a meeting of his security chiefs that improved relations with the US were now on the agenda. “We know that the new administration headed by President Trump is doing everything to restore at least something of what was basically destroyed by the previous US administration,” he said.

Putin also responded to an appeal by Trump to save the lives of “thousands” of surrounded Ukrainian soldiers, and said he would heed it as long as the soldiers surrendered. But no evidence has emerged to back up Putin and Trump's claims that there is a large-scale encirclement of Ukrainian troops, a claim explicitly denied by military chiefs in Kyiv.

The exchange of warm words between Trump and Putin is likely to cause further alarm in Kyiv and European capitals, already spooked by signs of the new US administration cosying up to Moscow while exerting pressure on Ukraine.

The remarks came after Steve Witkoff, Trump's close ally and special envoy to the Middle East, held late-night talks with Putin on Thursday to discuss the US proposal for an immediate 30-day ceasefire in the war on Ukraine.

Kyiv has already accepted the proposal, while Putin on Thursday set out a series of sweeping conditions that would need to be met before Russia would agree to the truce, which includes the condition that Ukraine should neither rearm nor mobilise during the 30-day truce.

In a post on Truth Social on Friday, however, Trump said there was a “very good chance” the war between Russia and Ukraine could “finally come to an end”.

Trump also said he had appealed to Putin to save the lives of “thousands of Ukrainian troops” supposedly surrounded by the Russian army. Putin first made the claim earlier in the week when he said Ukrainian troops had been surrounded during a retreat from Russia's Kursk region, and had the choice to “surrender or die”.

Trump repeated Putin's claim, writing that thousands of troops had been “completely surrounded” during the retreat. He wrote “I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared. This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II. God bless them all.”

Putin told his security council that he had heard Trump's appeal, and said the lives of Ukrainian troops would be spared if they surrendered. The Ukrainian military and independent analysts, however, denied there was an encirclement of troops.

Ukrainian general staff wrote in a statement published on their media channels: “Reports of the alleged ‘encirclement' of Ukrainian units by the enemy in the Kursk region are false and fabricated by the Russians for political manipulation and to exert pressure on Ukraine and its partners. There is no threat of encirclement of our units.”

Ukrainian security sources, independent military analysts and even pro-Russian Telegram channels disputed the encirclement claims by Putin and Trump.

Soldiers fighting in the region say a staged withdrawal has been under way for two weeks, and while many soldiers have faced a dangerous and challenging route to withdraw, they do not believe there is a mass encirclement of troops. “After seven months, we simply withdrew. There was no encirclement,” one senior security official told the Guardian on Thursday.

Michael Kofman, a military analyst at Carnegie Endowment, described the claims of a mass encirclement as “fiction”.

Some influential Russian pro-war military bloggers have cast doubt in recent days of the encirclement claims by Russian officials, saying none of the signs of such an action have been visible.

Earlier on Friday, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Putin had sent Trump a message via Witkoff about his proposal for a ceasefire, adding that it saw grounds for “cautious optimism” that a deal could be reached.

Peskov's statement was echoed by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, who said there were “reasons to be cautiously optimistic”.

“We'll examine the Russian position more closely and the president will then determine what the next steps are. Suffice it to say, I think there is reason to be cautiously optimistic,” Rubio said. “Obviously, we will see what Russia and others are willing to do. It's not just Russia, obviously, it has to be acceptable to Ukraine.”

Despite apparent optimism from the White House, US intelligence services have reportedly assessed that Putin remains committed to achieving “his maximalist goal of dominating Ukraine”.

The Washington Post reported on Friday citing an intelligence report circulated among Trump administration policymakers on 6 March, which stated that Putin remains determined to maintain control over Kyiv.

The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, reiterated on Friday that Russian attempts to set up conditions for the 30-day ceasefire only “complicate and drag out the process”.

“Russia is the only party that wants the war to continue and diplomacy to break down,” Zelenskyy said on X after a call with the secretary of state of the Holy See, Cardinal Pietro Parolin. “Putin will not end the war on his own. But the strength of America is enough to make it happen.”

Zelenskyy emphasised Ukraine's commitment to upholding the ceasefire, describing it as an opportunity to establish a lasting peace. “During the period of silence, we could prepare a reliable peace plan, put it on the table, discuss the details, and implement it. We are ready,” the Ukrainian president said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Lawyers demand in updated lawsuit that Columbia University graduate be released from custody

Mahmoud Khalil felt as though he was being kidnapped when he was handcuffed and shackled and rushed from New York to immigration detention in Louisiana last weekend, his lawyers wrote in an updated lawsuit demanding that the Columbia University graduate be released from custody immediately.

The activist has told his lawyers that agents who arrested him at his university housing last Saturday night, in front of his eight-month pregnant wife, never identified themselves.

Once in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention in Louisiana, he was left to sleep in a bunker with no pillow or blanket, as top Trump administration officials cheered the effort to deport a man his lawyers say sometimes became the “public face” of student protests on Columbia's campus last year against Israel's military actions in Gaza.

The filing late on Thursday in Manhattan federal court was the result of a federal judge's Wednesday order that the lawyers finally be allowed to speak with Khalil.

The Trump administration has not accused the activist of any criminal behavior but has said he is aligned with Hamas, the Islamist militant group that controls Gaza and is designated as a terrorist organization by the US. It has invoked an obscure legal provision to try to deport him.

One of his lawyers, Donna Lieberman, told CNN on Friday in a TV interview: “This is a targeted, retaliatory and extreme attack on the right of free expression” and said Khalil was being detained “for having ideas.”

“They're not claiming he did anything illegal they just don't like what he has said,” she added, warning: “It's an attempt to bully students, faculty and the rest of us … this move to quell free speech is absolutely terrifying.”

The lawyers said in their filing that his treatment by federal authorities from Saturday, when he was first arrested, to Monday reminded Khalil of when he left Syria shortly after the forced disappearance of his friends there during a period of arbitrary detention in 2013.

“Throughout this process, Mr Khalil felt as though he was being kidnapped,” the lawyers wrote of his treatment.

Earlier this week, Donald Trump heralded Khalil's arrest as the first “of many to come”, vowing on social media to deport students he said engage in “pro-terrorist, antisemitic, anti-American activity.”

In court papers, lawyers for the justice department said Kahlil was detained under a law allowing Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, to remove someone from the country if he has reasonable grounds to believe their presence or activities would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences. Trump and Rubio were added as defendants in the civil lawsuit seeking to free Khalil.

After Khalil, who is a US green card holder, or permanent resident, and a Palestinian, was arrested on Saturday night he was held for some hours then at some point early on Sunday was taken to the Elizabeth detention center in Elizabeth, New Jersey, a privately run facility where he spent the rest of the night in a cold waiting room for processing, his request for a blanket denied, the lawsuit said.

He was flown to Louisiana and arrived at 1am on Monday and a police car took him to the Louisiana Detention Facility in Jena, Louisiana.

He worries about his wife and is “also very concerned about missing the birth of his first child”, the lawsuit said.

He was denied release during a federal court hearing in New York on Wednesday and his arrest has sparked protests. The government is trying to move his case to Louisiana, where courts are more conservative. Khalil has previously worked for the British government.

At least eight Senate Democrats need to vote with Republicans to advance bill ahead of midnight deadline to fund government

California Democratic representative and former House speaker Nancy Pelosi has released a statement in response to the government funding bill that is now in the Senate.

Calling it a “devastating assault on the wellbeing of working-class families,” Pelosi said:

Donald Trump and Elon Musk have offered the Congress a false choice between a government shutdown or a blank check that makes a devastating assault on the wellbeing of working families across America. Let's be clear: neither is a good option for the American people. But this false choice that some are buying instead of fighting is unacceptable. I salute leader Hakeem Jeffries for his courageous rejection of this false choice, and I am proud of my colleagues in the House Democratic caucus for their overwhelming vote against this bill.
  “Democratic senators should listen to the women. Appropriations leaders Rosa DeLauro and Patty Murray have eloquently presented the case that we must have a better choice: a four-week funding extension to keep government open and negotiate a bipartisan agreement. America has experienced a Trump shutdown before – but this damaging legislation only makes matters worse. Democrats must not buy into this false choice. We must fight back for a better way. Listen to the women, For The People.”

Meanwhile, Canada today swore in Mark Carney as prime minister, and among his first tasks will be dealing with the trade war with the United States that has escalated over the past weeks. Here's more on Carney's new administration, from the Guardian's Leyland Cecco:

Mark Carney has said Canada will never be part of the US, after being sworn in as the country's 24th prime minister in a sudden rise to power.

“We will never, in any shape or form, be part of the US,” the former governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England told a crowd outside Rideau Hall in Ottawa, rejecting Donald Trump's annexation threats. “We are very fundamentally a different country.”

Canada “expects respect” from the US, he added, while also voicing hope his government could find ways “to work together” with the Trump administration.

Less than a week ago, Carney beat the former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, the former government house leader Karina Gould and the former member of parliament Frank Baylis with a dominant 85.9% of the vote, in a closely watched leadership race. He has no prior elected experience and does not have a seat in the House of Commons, making him a rarity in Canadian history.

Carney is expected to announce an election in the coming days, reflecting both the urgency of Canada's trade war with the US, and the awkward reality that as prime minister without a seat in parliament, he is unable to attend sessions of the House of Commons.

Nevada's Democratic senator Catherine Cortez Masto says she will vote for the continuing resolution that prevents a government shutdown:

A government shutdown would be devastating for the American people. It would force tens of thousands of Nevada military personnel, union members, law enforcement agents and nurses to work without pay. Shutting down the government gives President Trump and Elon Musk even more power to cherry-pick who is an essential employee, who they want to fire, and what agencies they want to shutter. And a shutdown would force federal courts to slow work on lawsuits against this administration's illegal actions. The last government shutdown cost the American economy $11 billion and thousands of hardworking Americans were harmed. I cannot vote for that.

She joins minority leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Pennsylvania's John Fetterman as the only Democrats to have explicitly said they will support the bill. Several others, however, have not yet spoken out.

Fellow Nevada Democratic senator Jacky Rosen, who eked out re-election in November even as Donald Trump won her state's electoral votes, says she will not support the spending bill:

Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have complete control of the federal government, and they're using their power to help Elon Musk continue to systematically dismantle basic government functions from veterans' health care to aviation safety and cancer research

I cannot vote for an irresponsible and hyper-partisan bill that gives Trump and Musk even more power to hurt millions of Americans all while Congressional Republicans continue to push for cuts to Medicaid to pay for more tax breaks for the ultra-rich and giant corporations.

But the press really did try to get House Democratic leaders to reveal their true feelings about Chuck Schumer and other Senate colleagues who are ready to pass the spending bill they oppose.

“You keep engaging in these parlor games because you want to take the focus off the American people,” House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries replied to one particularly pushy reporter. “What we're saying is we look forward to continuing to work with our Senate colleagues, all of them, in opposition to the extremism that's being unleashed on the American people.”

Whip Katherine Clark put it this way:

Most American people, they can't name us. They don't know who Chuck Schumer is, but they do know what this administration and Elon Musk and the GOP are planning for them, and it's why you're seeing this uproar in town halls.

More about those town halls:

House Democratic leaders told a press conference they remain firmly opposed to the government funding bill, but batted away questions about how Senate Democrats should vote on it.

“House Democrats remain strongly opposed to the partisan, Republican spending bill that will hurt families, hurt veterans, hurt seniors and hurt the American people. It is a false choice that Donald Trump, Elon Musk and House Republicans have been presenting between their reckless and partisan spending bill and a government shutdown,” said the minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries.

He demanded that the Republicans, who control both houses of Congress, return to the negotiating table to hammer out a bill that can attract bipartisan support:

We're ready to pass a four week spending bill that keeps the government open and will allow the House and the Senate to negotiate an actual agreement that meets the needs of the American people, but we do not support A bill that is designed to hurt the American people.

Reporters wanted to know his thoughts on the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer's argument that a government shutdown would be worse than the spending legislation.

“That's a question that is best addressed by the Senate,” Jeffries replied.

Asked to elaborate on his recent conversations with Schumer, Jeffries replied:

He and I have had repeated and private conversations throughout the week, and those conversations will remain private.

Earlier in the day, the Associated Press reported that Raphael Warnock, Georgia's Democratic senator, hinted that he would support Chuck Schumer stepping down as minority leader.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that Warnock was actually referring to Democrats' chances of retaking the White House and Senate over the next four years, not Schumer.

Nancy Pelosi's statement against the government funding bill was a notable flareup of infighting within the Democratic party, and between the House and Senate.

Though she's no longer House speaker or party leader, Pelosi remains a force in Democratic politics, and played a major role in the pressure campaign that pushed Joe Biden to end his bid for a second term. Now, she has urged Senate Democrats not to back a continuing resolution to keep the government open – a position that puts her at odds with minority leader Chuck Schumer, who views the bill's passage as a necessary evil.

Pelosi has long put women's rights at the center of her politics, and noted in her statement that senator Patty Murray and congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, two top appropriators, are both against the bill.

Here's what Murray has said about it:

Good morning. I am a firm 100% NO on House Republicans' slush fund CR.

I will NOT vote to let Elon and Trump pick winners and losers with your taxpayer dollars.

Senators were not elected to beg Trump for federal resources.

And DeLauro:

Last week, House Democrats opposed giving Elon Musk and Trump a blank check funding bill that would allow them to gut programs and services families rely on.

The Senate must pass a short-term spending bill so we can pass bipartisan bills that protect programs for our communities.

New York state Democrats have thrown their support behind Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer after the senator said he would vote for the Republican funding bill in order to avert a government shutdown.

In a statement on Friday, chair Jay S Jacobs said:

“Reading the angry comments directed toward Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer by fellow Democrats compels me to weigh in on this issue. Too many Democrats prefer the ‘circular firing squad' and ‘eating our own' to the more effective approach of finding the right long-term strategy. Once again, this is such a case.

Shutting down the government would lend legitimacy to President Trump's efforts to cut funding from all of the departments and agencies of the government using the argument that he was forced – by the Democrats – to not spend the money that was not allocated. Every day that the government remains shut and on austerity would be another day of MAGA mayhem.

Senator Schumer is 100% correct. Anger about his reluctance to invoke the use of the filibuster – an arcane rule of the Senate that we regularly condemn when employed by the other side in order to thwart the wishes of the democratically elected majority in that body – as odious as it is to contemplate the reality of a Republican majority – may feel good giving vent to our frustration, but will work against our long-term desire to win back the Congress in 2026 and the Presidency in 2028.”

On Friday, the Democratic representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez condemned Schumer's “acquiesce” to the Republican bill bill, saying: “We have time to correct course on this decision. Senate Democrats can vote no.”

Speaking to reporters after a meeting with G7 foreign ministers in Canada, secretary of state Marco Rubio has warned that more visas of anti-war protesters who are on temporary status in the US will be revoked, Reuters reports.

“In the days to come, you should expect more visas will be revoked as we identify people that we should have never allowed in,” Rubio said, his comments following immigration authorities' arrest and detention of Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University student and green card holder whom Donald Trump's administration is seeking to deport over his activism against Israel's deadly war in Gaza.

California Democratic representative and former House speaker Nancy Pelosi has released a statement in response to the government funding bill that is now in the Senate.

Calling it a “devastating assault on the wellbeing of working-class families,” Pelosi said:

Donald Trump and Elon Musk have offered the Congress a false choice between a government shutdown or a blank check that makes a devastating assault on the wellbeing of working families across America. Let's be clear: neither is a good option for the American people. But this false choice that some are buying instead of fighting is unacceptable. I salute leader Hakeem Jeffries for his courageous rejection of this false choice, and I am proud of my colleagues in the House Democratic caucus for their overwhelming vote against this bill.
  “Democratic senators should listen to the women. Appropriations leaders Rosa DeLauro and Patty Murray have eloquently presented the case that we must have a better choice: a four-week funding extension to keep government open and negotiate a bipartisan agreement. America has experienced a Trump shutdown before – but this damaging legislation only makes matters worse. Democrats must not buy into this false choice. We must fight back for a better way. Listen to the women, For The People.”

Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer has argued that allowing the government to shut down would supercharge Donald Trump and Elon Musk's efforts to gut federal agencies.

But the Federal Unionists Network, a group of federal employees that opposes the administration's campaign to dramatically downsize government, disagrees. In a statement, spokesperson Chris Dols says the group believes the funding bill under consideration would make the situation worse:

Let us be clear: federal workers have been doing their best to provide services all while navigating a daily assault that has amounted to an effective shutdown of our government through an acceleration of mass firings, illegal agency closures, ending critical, life-saving programs and services to our communities. Americans want a government that works for them, not against them.

Once again, Congress is failing in its responsibility to the American people. If passed, this [continuing resolution] will give Trump and Musk the power to complete their assault on federal workers. That is why the solution must be to organize across industry, union, demographic and political affiliation to stop this corporate coup.

There's definitely ire among Senate Democrats right now towards Chuck Schumer, their long-serving leader, over his plan to vote for the government funding bill.

Schumer's support may give the measure enough votes for passage, though we still don't know that for sure. Many other Democratic senators disagree with Schumer and see stopping the bill as an opportunity to stand up to the Trump administration, even if it sparks a shutdown.

The vibes are bad enough that the Associated Press reports the Democratic senator Raphael Warnock hinted he thinks its time for Schumer to go:

I think come ‘26, ‘28 we'll get some new leadership.

He's far from the only Democrat expressing such sentiment:

Donald Trump and Elon Musk's much-vaunted department of “government efficiency” may not be all that popular with voters, the Guardian's Martin Pengelly reports:

Donald Trump and Elon Musk face increasing headwinds in their attempt to brutally slash federal budgets and staffing, after two judges ruled against the firing of probationary employees by Musk's so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) and public polling revealed strong disapproval of the Tesla billionaire's work.

Nonetheless, the gathering effects of the cuts were illustrated by news that federal agencies will begin to vacate hundreds of offices across the country this summer.

Citing internal documents from the General Services Administration (GSA), the Associated Press reported that dozens of federal leases were expected to end by 30 June, with hundreds more ending in the following months.

The GSA did not comment. But the AP reported that some agencies and lawmakers have appealed to exempt specific buildings, as several face 20 or more lease cancellations, among them the Internal Revenue Service, Social Security Administration, Department of Agriculture and US Geological Survey.

In his remarks, Chuck Schumer also reflected on the difficult choice facing Senate Democrats.

When the government spending bill was up for a vote in the House, Democrats were near-unanimous in their opposition, including several lawmakers who occupy seats vulnerable to being reclaimed by Republicans. Schumer's insistence on passing the bill through the Senate has left vulnerable House Democrats in a bit of a lurch, and also led to a split within the party's lawmakers in the upper chamber.

Here's what Schumer had to say about the choice the party was facing:

Our caucus members have been torn between two awful alternatives, and my colleagues and I have wrestled with which alternative would be worse for the American people. Different senators come down on different sides of this question. But that does not mean that any Senate Democrat supports a shutdown.

Whatever the outcome, our caucus will be united in our determination to continue the long term fight to stop Donald Trump's dangerous war on our democracy and on America's working families.

Democratic minority leader Chuck Schumer just spoke on the Senate floor and reiterated his support for the government spending bill that will prevent a shutdown from beginning at midnight.

He warned that if government funding were to lapse, Donald Trump, Elon Musk and the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) would be free to make even more disruptive cuts to federal agencies.

“If government were to shut down, Doge has a plan in place to exploit the crisis for maximum destruction,” Schumer said.

He continued:

A shutdown will allow Doge to shift into overdrive. It would give Donald Trump and Doge the keys to the city, state and country. Donald Trump and Elon Musk would be free to destroy vital government services at a much faster rate than they can right now and over a much broader field of destruction that they would render.

In a shutdown, Donald Trump and Doge will have the power to determine what is considered essential and what is not, and their views on what is not essential would be mean and vicious, and would decimate vital services and cause unimaginable harm to the American people.

Reporters in the Capitol heard from Republican Senate majority leader John Thune, who said a few things about the struggle to pass a continuing resolution and prevent a government shutdown.

According to Punchbowl News, Thune said he has not yet spoken to Democratic minority leader Chuck Schumer today, who has backed the bill even as much of the rest of his party has not.

Thune also said he may allow some amendment votes on the legislation, which could potentially offer a way to assuage Democrats' concerns.

In addition to talking to Vladimir Putin this morning, Donald Trump posted on Truth Social a note of congratulations for Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader who said yesterday he will vote to advance a bill to fund the government:

Congratulations to Chuck Schumer for doing the right thing — Took “guts” and courage! The big Tax Cuts, L.A. fire fix, Debt Ceiling Bill, and so much more, is coming. We should all work together on that very dangerous situation. A non pass would be a Country destroyer, approval will lead us to new heights. Again, really good and smart move by Senator Schumer. This could lead to something big for the USA, a whole new direction and beginning! DJT

Schumer's support may – emphasis on may – attract the Democratic votes necessary to move the bill, which will prevent a shutdown that is set to begin at midnight.

Donald Trump says he had a “very good and productive” phone call with Vladimir Putin and thinks “there is a very good chance” that the war in Ukraine can end.

The president's comments come days after Ukraine said it would accept a 30-day ceasefire in the conflict, and Washington agreed to restart military and intelligence sharing.

Some say incursion achieved many goals while others wonder if it cost Ukrainian lives for no tangible gain

Under constant attack from drones attached to fibre optic cables, the soldiers scrambled in groups of two or three along hidden tracks or through fields, often walking miles to reach Ukrainian territory.

The Ukrainian retreat from the Kursk region, carried out in stages over the past two weeks, appears to mark the end of one of the most audacious and surprising operations of the conflict, and strips Ukraine of one of its few solid bargaining chips in possible peace negotiations with Russia.

For seven months, Ukraine held on to a chunk of Russian territory, including the town of Sudzha, which had a prewar population of about 5,000. It was the first time a foreign army had occupied Russian land since the second world war.

Russia, with the help of North Korean troops, has been pushing Ukrainian forces back, and in recent weeks the pressure on Ukrainian positions has become overwhelming. On Wednesday, Vladimir Putin donned military fatigues to visit a command post in the region, and on Thursday, Russia announced it had regained full control of Sudzha.

While Ukrainian troops continue to hold a few remaining villages in Kursk, soldiers involved in the operation said it was probably only a matter of time before the retreat was concluded.

“The Russians are already pushing into Sumy region [in Ukraine], all the tasks now are defensive,” said Serhiy, a special operations commander who recently left the region.

The demand by Putin that troops create a “buffer zone” close to the border suggests a Russian offensive pushing back into Ukraine may be on the cards, and authorities have already evacuated several settlements close to the border.

The end of the seven-month operation has led to mixed assessments in Ukraine, with some saying it achieved many of its goals, and others wondering if it was a distraction from the main war effort and cost Ukrainian lives for no tangible gain.

“Kursk displaced the conflict on to Russian territory, and Russia used some of its best units to fight for it, but it also required a sizeable number of Ukraine's elite units to hold the pocket,” said Michael Kofman, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

Now, the Russian offensive may change the dynamic of the war again, at a moment when the US is pushing Moscow and Kyiv to sign a ceasefire agreement. “My worry is that this gives the Kremlin and the Russian army a new bout of enthusiasm and adrenaline,” the Kyiv-based political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko said.

The initial incursion into Kursk happened last August. It was planned by a very small circle to retain an element of surprise, and Kyiv did not even brief western allies until after the operation was under way. Troops arrived in nearby Sumy in small groups, and many stayed in rented apartments.

Documents recovered from Russian army positions showed that Moscow's military planners had warned of the threat of an incursion for months, but when it came Ukrainian troops were able to overrun Russian positions, taking hundreds of prisoners of war.

In Sudzha, officials and police fled without even destroying or taking away sensitive documents, leaving them for Ukrainian troops to seize and send to Kyiv for analysis.

Those with knowledge of the planning say Ukrainian officials were taken aback by just how well the initial stage of the operation went, as Ukraine took control of about 500 sq miles within a few days.

“At the beginning, the idea was just to create a diversion and to draw troops away from Donbas. But it went better than expected and suddenly we were digging in,” said one source.

“We have no wish to occupy this territory,” Zelenskyy's aide Mykhailo Podolyak told the Guardian in late August. “Our tasks are to push Russian artillery and other systems further away, destroy the warehouses and other military infrastructure that is there, and also to affect public opinion in Russia.”

For the first time in the war, the shoe was on the other foot and Ukraine became an occupying power. The Ukrainian army took journalists on tours of Sudzha, where stunned residents could not believe the war they had seen on their television screens had arrived on Russian territory. A historian from Sumy recorded a podcast in Sudzha's small history museum, explaining how Sudzha and the rest of the region was historically Ukrainian land, a nod to Russian claims about Ukrainian territories.

At one point, there were plans to ask Russians who were fighting alongside Ukraine to enter the region and take over police functions. The idea would have been to troll Russia, which masked its 2014 intervention in Donbas as the work of Ukrainian separatists. However, the plans were quickly discarded as unworkable and incendiary.

The capture of hundreds of prisoners allowed Ukraine to offer an exchange for captured Ukrainians held in Russian jails, and the operation was also credited with providing a morale boost to Ukrainian troops and society after months of setbacks.

The longer Ukrainian troops held on to the land, the more it became clear that the endgame of the operation was now the chance to use Kursk as a card at future negotiations. Zelenskyy told the Guardian last month that Kyiv would “swap one territory for another”.

However, as time went on, Russia upped the pressure on Ukrainian positions in the region. By the beginning of this year, Ukrainian military planners could see Russia making a sustained effort to concentrate forces on Kursk.

“Everything is going to Kursk,” one military source said in early February. “At the beginning they didn't seem to pay that much attention to it, but then the North Koreans came, and then since the beginning of the year they are throwing everything at Kursk, perhaps to try to take it back before negotiating.”

Some of Russia's best drone units were relocated to the Kursk theatre. Because Ukrainian forces can use radio jammers to block Russian FPV (first person view) drones, Russia has increasingly begun using fibre optic drones, which unspool a thin cable over several miles and are immune to jammers.

“The fields we are retreating through are like a spider's web with all the fibre optic cables,” said Serhiy, the special operations commander.

He criticised the failure to build nets around the main road between Sumy and Sudzha to protect it from drones, as the Russians have done in part of the front in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. “Only in the last two weeks they started trying to do this, but now it's too dangerous. They should have done it in September, October, when everything was calm,” he said.

Ukrainian officials say that while ultimately the operation will not provide the hoped-for bargaining chip, it was able to change the narrative of the war, at a time when gloominess over Ukrainian prospects for any kind of advance had set in. They say that while the withdrawal may be fraught, it has so far passed without enormous loss of life or stubbornly holding on to undefendable positions.

“After seven months, we simply withdrew. There was no encirclement,” said one senior security official, painting the operation as a success. “There were political goals, military goals, there was getting the Russians to move troops from Pokrovsk [in Donetsk] to Kursk. And we showed how shameful it is for the Russians, that they can't fight Ukraine without North Koreans.”

Others had a more mixed assessment, noting that the offensive stretched Ukraine's already understaffed forces, and did not slow the Russian advance in the east. “Tactically it was successful, but the offensive changed little in the overall dynamic of this war, and failed to achieve its wider operational objectives,” Kofman said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Commentary urged CK Hutchison to ‘think twice' about ‘what position and side they are on' in sale to US investors

China has criticised the sale of the business that controls ports in Panama to US investors, saying the Hong Kong-based parent company should “think twice” and that the $22.8bn deal is “power politics” that is not in the country's national interest.

Shares in the Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison fell more than 6% on Friday after a critical commentary appeared in the Beijing-backed newspaper Ta Kung Pao in Hong Kong.

Last week, CK Hutchison struck a deal to sell a majority stake in Panama Ports Company, which holds the contract to run the ports of Balboa and Cristóbal until 2047, to a consortium led by the US financial giant BlackRock.

The move followed pressure from Donald Trump to end what he sees as China's influence and control over the key trading route through the Panama canal.

On Friday, China used the strongly worded commentary in Ta Kung Pao to attack the US for pressuring the deal “through despicable means”.

“[Critics] say this is a spineless, grovelling, profit-seeking move that sells one's integrity for personal gains,” said the opinion piece. “And an act that disregards national interests … [which] betrays and sells out all Chinese people.”

The opinion piece said the sale would result in China's shipping and trade being curbed by the US, and that CK Hutchison should “think twice” about “what position and side they are on”.

After publication of the commentary, China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), the governing body overseeing the territory, reposted the article on its website, prompting investor fears that the deal may not complete without Beijing's backing.

BlackRock's Panama Ports move is part of a wider deal for Hutchison Ports' global business that would give the US-led group control of 43 ports in 23 countries.

“It is power politics packaged as a ‘business behaviour',” stated the opinion piece. “This deal is an act of hegemony by the US, which uses its state power to infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of other countries through despicable means such as coercion, pressure and inducement.”

Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, visited Panama City in February to meet the Panamanian president, José Raúl Mulino.

After the meeting, he said that “control of the Chinese Communist party over the Panama canal” was unacceptable and the US would use “measures necessary to protect its rights”.

CK Hutchison has insisted the deal is unrelated to Trump's vow to “take back” the canal.

“I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,” said Frank Sixt, the co-managing director of CK Hutchison. “[The sale] was the result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received.”

While CK Hutchison is in a 145-day exclusive negotiation period with the BlackRock consortium, the deal has not yet been finalised.

On Thursday, it emerged that the Trump administration had called on the Pentagon to provide military options to ensure the US had full access to the Panama canal.

One US official said a document, described as interim national security guidance by the Trump administration, has asked the military to look at options to ensure “unfettered” access to the canal.

The US government has also proposed steep levies of up to $1.5m (£1.2m) for each port of call on Chinese-made ships coming to the US, as part of a plan to bring more ship manufacturing back to America.

Mainland China and Hong Kong accounted for nearly 14% of CK Hutchison's revenues in 2023, compared with about half from UK and European operations.

CK Hutchison, which is controlled by the billionaire Li Ka-shing, has always maintained that its business operations are independent of China, which took control of Hong Kong from the UK in 1997.

In the UK, CK Hutchison is in the process of merging its mobile business 3 with Vodafone.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor sworn in and expected to call election soon

Mark Carney has said Canada will never be part of the US, after being sworn in as the country's 24th prime minister in a sudden rise to power.

“We will never, in any shape or form, be part of the US,” the former governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England told a crowd outside Rideau Hall in Ottawa, rejecting Donald Trump's annexation threats. “We are very fundamentally a different country.”

Canada “expects respect” from the US, he added, while also voicing hope his government could find ways “to work together” with the Trump administration.

Less than a week ago, Carney beat the former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, the former government house leader Karina Gould and the former member of parliament Frank Baylis with a dominant 85.9% of the vote, in a closely watched leadership race. He has no prior elected experience and does not have a seat in the House of Commons, making him a rarity in Canadian history.

Carney is expected to announce an election in the coming days, reflecting both the urgency of Canada's trade war with the US, and the awkward reality that as prime minister without a seat in parliament, he is unable to attend sessions of the House of Commons.

The effects of Donald Trump's economic attack on Canada are so wide-ranging and so damaging that they are likely to overshadow all other issues in the coming months. US trade tariffs, if held in place for an extended period of time, could push Canada's fragile economy into a recession and unleash a cascading chain of knock-on upheavals.

Asked about the comments by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, on Friday morning that “economically speaking Canada would be better as the 51st state of the United States”, Carney replied: “It's crazy. That's all you can say.”

An election would also put limits on spending for political parties, which disproportionately affect the cash-flush Conservative party. The Conservatives lead the polls, but the lead is narrowing.

Earlier on Friday morning, Justin Trudeau formally resigned as prime minister, capping a nearly decade-long tenure that saw a rise in favourability in his final weeks as he stared down threats to Canadian sovereignty pushed by Trump. “Thank you, Canada – for trusting in me, for challenging me, and for granting me the privilege to serve the best country, and the best people, on Earth,” Trudeau said on social media.

In announcing his new, smaller cabinet, Carney left key ministers in cabinet. The finance minister, Dominic LeBlanc, was shifted to minister of international trade, the foreign affairs minister, Mélanie Joly, kept her role, and the industry minister, François-Philippe Champagne, took on the role as finance minister. Bill Blair remained as minister of national defence.

Notably, Carney brought his former leadership rival Freeland back into cabinet, as she assumed the role of transport minister. Freeland has previously served as foreign minister, finance minister and deputy prime minister.

Carney removed some key ministers who served in Trudeau's cabinet and were seen as close allies of the former prime minister, including the health minister, Mark Holland, who endorsed Freeland in the leadership race and the immigration minister, Marc Miller, a longtime friend of Trudeau.

Also absent was the former government house leader Gould, who placed third in the Liberal leadership race.

“I am committed to supporting our government as we defend Canada from Donald Trump and his ill-conceived and unjustified trade war,” Gould wrote on social media. “I will continue to stand up for my constituents … and fight for a fairer, more inclusive, more prosperous Canada in Ottawa.”

In recent weeks, the Liberals have reversed a political freefall, sharply rebounding to such a degree that a previously expected Conservative majority in the next general election looks increasingly unlikely. The shift in the polls has been so dramatic that pollsters have struggled to find any historical precedent.

A newly released poll from Abacus Data showed the Conservative support had shrunk to 38%, with 34% going to the incumbent Liberals.

In a result likely to concern Conservatives, Abacus asked respondents who was best qualified to handle tasks as future prime minister, including finding common ground, standing up to a bully and helping people manage household expenses. Carney was seen as more skilled at six of the eight.

Heading into the event, the former prime minister Jean Chrétien said Carney “will do very well”, adding: “He is respected internationally.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Apparent rejection of new offer to free US-Israeli hostage dashes hopes of progress but will please Tel Aviv

The Trump administration has accused Hamas of making “entirely impractical” demands and stalling on a deal to release a US-Israeli hostage in exchange for an extension of the Gaza ceasefire.

“Hamas is making a very bad bet that time is on its side. It is not,” the office of Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and the US national security council said in a statement. “Hamas is well aware of the deadline, and should know that we will respond accordingly if that deadline passes,” it said, adding that Trump had already vowed Hamas would “pay a severe price” for not freeing hostages.

A week ago Trump repeated a threat to destroy Hamas in a “last warning” to release the hostages, but it is unclear exactly to which of several potential deadlines the new statement referred.

The US appears to have brushed aside an offer made earlier on Friday by the militant Islamist organisation to free Edan Alexander, an Israeli-American hostage who was abducted while serving as a soldier in the Israel Defence Forces during Hamas's surprise raid into Israel in October 2023, and the remains of four other Israeli-Americans who have died in captivity in Gaza.

“Unfortunately, Hamas has chosen to respond by publicly claiming flexibility while privately making demands that are entirely impractical without a permanent ceasefire,” the statement added.

The reaction from the US dashed any hopes of sudden progress in continuing indirect negotiations in Qatar over the fragile ceasefire in Gaza but will comes as a relief to the Israeli government.

The initial phase of the ceasefire in the devastated territory came into effect in January but lapsed almost two weeks ago. In recent statements, Hamas has said it wants Israel to implement the second phase of the ceasefire, which was supposed to definitively end the conflict.

Israel has so far refused to move to the second phase, and is calling for an extension of several weeks to the first phase instead, leaving open the possibility of a new offensive in the months to come.

Witkoff has presented a “bridge” proposal in Qatar to extend the first phase of the truce to mid-April if Hamas releases living hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.

“Hamas was told in no uncertain terms that this ‘bridge' would have to be implemented soon – and that dual US-Israeli citizen Edan Alexander would have to be released immediately,” the statement said.

After the Hamas statement, Netanyahu's office said Israel had “accepted the Witkoff outline and showed flexibility”, but said “Hamas is refusing and will not budge from its positions”.
 “At the same time, it continues to use manipulation and psychological warfare – the reports about Hamas's willingness to release American hostages are intended to sabotage the negotiations,” the prime minister's office said.
 It added that Netanyahu would convene his ministerial team on Saturday night to receive a detailed report from the negotiation team and “decide on the next steps for the release of hostages”.

Netanyahu has consistently opposed any permanent end to the war in Gaza, in part due to domestic political considerations. However, the Israeli leader has made it clear that maintaining good relations with the White House is a priority.

After more than 16 months of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas brokered by the US, Qatar and Egypt, Washington recently opened a direct channel of talks with Hamas with the aim of freeing US citizens abducted by the organisation during its raid into Israel.

Hamas abducted 251 hostages during its attack and killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians.

In a social media post earlier this month, Donald Trump said there would be “hell to pay” if all the 58 hostages still in Gaza were not released. Fewer than half are thought to be still alive.

In an attempt to pressure Hamas, Israel has cut off all supplies of goods to Gaza and on Sunday stopped any remaining electricity supplies from Israel to the territory.

Almost the entire population of Gaza was displaced by Israel's military offensive, which killed 48,500 people, mostly civilians, and reduced swaths of the territory to rubble.

The six-week first phase of the ceasefire led to the exchange of 25 living Israeli hostages and the remains of eight others, in return for the release of about 1,800 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. It also allowed much-needed food, shelter and medical assistance to re-enter Gaza.

Official reaction from the Israeli government to the news last week of direct talks between the US and Hamas was limited to a single terse statement by the office of Netanyahu acknowledging the negotiations, but the mass-market newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth said Israel had been “stunned to discover that, behind its back, Trump's envoy had flirted for weeks in Doha” with a senior Hamas official.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Letter from Elon Musk's firm to US trade representative warns of ‘downstream impacts' of tit-for-tat tariffs

Elon Musk's Tesla has warned that Donald Trump's trade war could expose the electric carmaker to retaliatory tariffs that would also affect other automotive manufacturers in the US.

In an unsigned letter to Jamieson Greer, the US trade representative, Tesla said it “supports fair trade” but that the US administration should ensure it did not “inadvertently harm US companies”.

Tesla said in the letter: “As a US manufacturer and exporter, Tesla encourages the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to consider the downstream impacts of certain proposed actions taken to address unfair trade practices.”

The company, led by Musk, a close Trump ally who is leading efforts to downsize the federal government, said it wanted to avoid a similar impact to previous trade disputes that resulted in increased tariffs on electric vehicles imported into countries targeted by the US.

Tesla said: “US exporters are inherently exposed to disproportionate impacts when other countries respond to US trade actions. The assessment undertaken by USTR of potential actions to rectify unfair trade should also take into account exports from the United States.

“For example, past trade actions by the United States have resulted in immediate reactions by the targeted countries, including increased tariffs on electric vehicles imported into those countries.”

Trump has imposed significant tariffs that will affect vehicles and parts made around the world.

The EU and Canada have announced large-scale retaliations for tariffs on steel and aluminium imports into the US, while the UK has so far held off on announcing any countermeasures.

Tesla's share price has fallen by more than a third over the last month in an apparent buyer backlash against Musk, who has shown support for Germany's far-right Alternative für Deutschland party, theatrically brandished a chainsaw at a conservative conference, and accused the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, and other senior politicians of covering up a scandal over grooming gangs.

This week Trump said he was buying a “brand new Tesla” and blamed “radical left lunatics” for “illegally” boycotting the EV company – a day after Tesla's worst share price fall in almost five years.

Tesla said: “As USTR continues to evaluate possible trade actions to rectify unfair trade practices, consideration should also be given to the timeline of implementation. US companies will benefit from a phased approach that enables them to prepare accordingly and ensure appropriate supply chain and compliance measures are taken.”

Separately on Friday, the German carmaker BMW reported that net profits slumped more than a third last year, as the owner of Mini and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars warned of the potential impact of US trade tariffs.

The company reported a 37% fall in net profits to €7.68bn (£6.4bn) in 2024, and expects an earnings margin for cars of 5% to 7% this year.

BMW reported a margin of 6.3% for last year, the lowest in four years, against a target of keeping carmaking returns above 8%.

“A challenging competitive environment, trade and geopolitical developments could all have a significant impact on business performance,” the company said.

BMW's forecasts account for all tariffs imposed up to 12 March, including levies on steel and aluminium, a 20% tariff on China and 25% on Canada and Mexico.

The company continues to struggle in China, where local EV producers such as BYD have taken market share, and sales of BMWs and Minis fell 13.4% year on year. BMW's overall car sales dropped 4% last year to 2.45m.

Last month, BMW paused a £600m investment into a Mini car assembly plant in the UK amid declining demand for EVs.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Ukraine president says pressure must be put on Russia after US president says talks between Witkoff and Putin were ‘productive'

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that “we must not let the war drag on,” as he urged the US to put pressure on Putin to “ensure that Russia is ready to end the war.”

He said that “pressure must be put on Russia” to force Putin into ending the conflict, repeating that Ukraine was “ready to act quickly and constructively.”

He contrasted Ukraine's “immediate” agreement to the US proposal for a ceasefire with Putin's evasive, non-committal answers, saying: “We do not want to play games with war.”

In a blistering attack on Putin, he criticised him for “lying about the real situation on the battlefield,” casualties, and the state of the Russian economy, which he said “has been damaged by his foolish imperial ambitions.”

“Putin cannot exit this war because that would leave him with nothing. That is why he is now doing everything he can to sabotage diplomacy by setting extremely difficult and unacceptable conditions right from the start, even before a ceasefire,” he warned.

Zelenskyy in particular said that Putin “will try to drag everyone into endless discussions … while his guns continue to kill people,” as he argued that “every condition Putin puts forward is just an attempt to block any diplomacy.”

“This is how Russia works. We warned about this,” he added.

Repeatedly appealing to US president Donald Trump and the US administration more broadly, he said that “especially the United States” can influence Putin and Russia to force through a ceasefire and, ultimately, a lasting peace.

“Putin will not end the war on his own. But the strength of America is enough to make it happen,” he said.

Here are his posts in full:

Today, Ukraine marks Military Volunteer Day. This day was established not so long ago, but it honors the bravery of those who have been defending Ukraine's statehood and independence for a long time.

More than three years of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. Over 11 years of a treacherous hybrid war that began with the occupation of Crimea and the battles in Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

Hundreds of thousands of our people have shown heroism in this war. Millions are working to defend our country. Thousands, unfortunately, have died on the front lines and from Russian bombs and missiles. The whole world knows Ukrainian bravery and is inspired by how our people defend their homes.

But we wouldn't wish such years and decades of war on any nation. In Ukraine, we want peace. From the very first minutes of this war, we have wanted only one thing – for Russia to leave our people in peace and for Russian occupiers to get off our land. This is a natural desire for any nation – the desire for independence and security.

This is exactly what we are fighting for. We fight with weapons and diplomacy. Right now, we have a good chance to end this war quickly and secure peace. We have solid security understandings with our European partners.

There was a productive meeting with our American partners in Saudi Arabia. We are now close to the first step in ending any war – silence. We proposed starting with silence in the air and at sea. The American side suggested going further – an immediate and unconditional ceasefire on the ground.

When our team in Jeddah heard this proposal, they contacted me, and I immediately agreed. We do not want to play games with war. Every day of war means losing the lives of our people – the most valuable thing we have.

Of course, we think about security guarantees. Of course, we think about how to control the ceasefire. But the first step is necessary. We support our American partners and President Trump in this. We want to trust America and its President. Ukraine is ready to act quickly and constructively. And we have warned that the only side that will try to sabotage everything will not be us.

Yesterday, we heard from Putin, he's putting forward some conditions that clearly show he does not want any ceasefire. He needs war – this has always been obvious, and it is obvious now.

Putin is lying about the real situation on the battlefield, he is lying about the casualties, he is lying about the true state of his economy, which has been damaged by his foolish imperial ambitions, and he is doing everything possible to ensure that diplomacy fails.

Putin cannot exit this war because that would leave him with nothing. That is why he is now doing everything he can to sabotage diplomacy by setting extremely difficult and unacceptable conditions right from the starteven before a ceasefire.

Putin will try to drag everyone into endless discussions, just like he did with ‘Minsk' wasting days, weeks, and months on meaningless talks while his guns continue to kill people. Every condition Putin puts forward is just an attempt to block any diplomacy. This is how Russia works. And we warned about this.

But we need peace. Real peace. And we must not let the war drag on. We have had constructive discussions with the Americans. We will continue working with Europeans and other partners. I'm grateful to Saudi Arabia and everyone helping with mediation and negotiation platforms.

But I strongly urge everyone who can influence Russia, especially the United States, to take strong steps that can help. Pressure must be applied to the one who does not want to stop the war. Pressure must be put on Russia. Only decisive actions can end this war, which has already lasted for years.

The U.S. side proposed starting with an unconditional ceasefire. Then, during the period of silence, we could prepare a reliable peace plan, put it on the table, discuss the details, and implement it. We are ready.

And we believe it is our partners' responsibility to ensure that Russia is ready to end the war – not to look for reasons why it should continue for more weeks, months, or years, but to end it. Putin will not end the war on his own. But the strength of America is enough to make it happen.

Strong steps are needed. Strong pressure must be applied to the only one who wants to continue this war. This is what ‘peace through strength' means.

Thank you to everyone helping to bring peace closer – the United States, Europe, and the whole world. Thank you to all partners whose strength and diplomacy will eventually succeed.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that “we must not let the war drag on,” as he urged the US to put pressure on Putin to “ensure that Russia is ready to end the war.” He said that “pressure must be put on Russia” to force Putin into ending the conflict, repeating that Ukraine was “ready to act quickly and constructively.”

US state secretary Marco Rubio is the latest senior politician involved in the US-Russia talks to repeat the line that there are “reasons to be cautiously optimistic” on ceasefire talks in Ukraine. Rubio described the talks by special envoy Steve Witkoff in Moscow as “a very positive and productive engagement yesterday with a President Putin.”

Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Russia will guarantee the safety of Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region if they surrender. Speaking to the Russian Security Council, Putin emphasised that Ukrainian authorities need to instruct their troops to lay down their arms, Reuters reported.

French president Emmanuel Macron said on Friday that Russia must accept a proposed 30-day ceasefire deal put forward by the United States and Ukraine. Macron added he had discussed the situation on Friday with British prime minister Keir Starmer and Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has blamed Vladimir Putin's Russia for obstructing peace discussions over the ceasefire. In a long post on his conversation with the Vatican's secretary of state Pietro Parolin, Zelenskyy said that “the world sees how Russia is deliberately putting forward conditions that only complicate and delay everything.”

Sources in Ukraine and military analysts closely tracking the conflict say Donald Trump's claims of a mass encirclement of Ukrainian troops inside Russia's Kursk region are not accurate. Trump claimed on Friday, apparently based on information fed by Putin, that “at this very moment, thousands of Ukrainian troops are completely surrounded by the Russian military” and that he has asked Putin to spare their lives to avoid what he described as “a horrible massacre, one not seen since the second world war”.

The White House has clarified that it was US envoy Steve Witkoff who spoke with Russian president Vladimir Putin, and not US president Donald Trump. The confusion was caused by Trump's social media post earlier, in which he praised the discussions with the Russian leader, and said “I have strongly requested to President Putin,” making it sound as if he spoke with Putin personally.

The EU executive could play a role in joint purchase of missiles, drones and other military equipment, according to a draft document on the future of European defence. The European Commission could “act as a central purchasing body” on behalf of EU member states upon their request, states a leaked white paper. The document, due to be released next Wednesday ahead of a summit of EU leaders, reveals how rapidly the EU is evolving following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Donald Trump's return to the White House.

Senior EU diplomats have agreed on Friday morning to extend for six months sanctions against about 2,000 Russians, including Vladimir Putin and many senior politicians and business people. The sanctions, which have to be renewed unanimously every six months, remain in place until 15 September 2025.

The three German parties involved in discussions on creating a new €500bn euros fund boosting public spending and relaxing the constitutional debt break have agreed on the final shape of the proposal, presumed chancellor Friedrich Merz confirmed. The conservative CDU/CSU party, which won last month's parliamentary elections, have agreed with the social democratic SPD, it's likely next coalition partner, and the Greens, moving back to the opposition, on the structure of the proposal.

Danish foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen rejected US president Donald Trump's latest remarks about annexing Greenland, saying the Danish autonomous island could not be taken over by another country, AFP reported. “If you look at the Nato treaty, the UN charter or international law, Greenland is not open to annexation,” he told reporters.

Portuguese president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa has announced a snap election for 18 May, the third in three years, after the fall of Luis Montenegro's government. The president said he wanted to move quickly to avoid prolonged instability, adding in a televised address that 18 May was “the preferred date for the majority of parties”.

French president Emmanuel Macron said on Friday that Russia must accept a proposed 30-day ceasefire deal put forward by the United States and Ukraine.

Macron added he had discussed the situation on Friday with British prime minister Keir Starmer and Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Russia will guarantee the safety of Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region if they surrender.

Speaking to the Russian Security Council, Putin emphasised that Ukrainian authorities need to instruct their troops to lay down their arms, Reuters reported.

US president Donald Trump urged Putin on Friday to spare Ukrainian troops being pushed back out of Russia's Kursk region and said there was a “very good chance” the war could end.

That's all from Rubio, speaking from the G7 ministerial summit in Canada.

And that's all from me, Jakub Krupa, as I hand over to Tom Ambrose, who will guide you through the evening.

Rubio got asked on details on the concessions he would expect from Ukraine and Russia, and his definition of territorial integrity in this context.

He started by saying that Russia will, too, have to make concessions.

But then returned to his earlier point that it is too early to speculate, as the first step is to get both sides to join negotiations.

I'm just stating the obvious. 

When people sit down and negotiate and end the wars, there's usually a give and take. 

What that give and take is depends on the parties that are at the table. 

We're not going to predetermine anything, but that's what's going to take to end the war.

Rubio was also asked about the G7's statement declaring support for Ukraine's territorial integrity.

Rubio said that is “not a change in public policy” for the US, as “I have never heard president Trump say Russia has a right to take all of Ukraine and do whatever they want there.”

But he then stressed that both sides will have to make concessions in the course of negotiations.

There is a war going on that has no military solution to it.

Neither Russia nor Ukraine can achieve its maximalist military aims.

The only way to end this war is through a process of negotiations, and negotiations – be it in business, in commerce, or in geopolitics – involve both sides giving something, both sides making concessions.

…

What those concessions are remains to be seen.

That'll have to be part of the negotiation, but it's not going to be, it's not going to be helpful to enter into those negotiations making blanket statements that may give an excuse for one side or the other not to participate in it.

Rubio also asked reporters to clearly differentiate between a ceasefire and a final peace deal.

He said that in ultimate peace talks there will have to be discussions about Ukraine's security guarantees as he acknowledged that “every country in the world has a right to security, to defend itself, to protect its territory.”

This will have to involve not just the US, but also the EU, which “imposed significant sanctions” on Russia.

But he warned against “putting everything ahead of itself,” as the first stage is to temporarily stop hostilities to create space for negotiations.

Rubio then was challenged by reporters, saying that Putin appeared to add new conditions to the US proposal.

He repeated there were “reasons for cautious optimism,” but added “there is a lot of work,” as he “never told anybody that this is going to be easy, fast, simple, slam dunk.”

“We are in a better place today … I believe, … than we were a week ago, but we still have a long way to go. It could come together pretty quickly if everyone aligns, but I don't know how aligned we are yet. That's what we're going about to find out,” he said.

He was asked about suggestions that Putin was deploying “delay tactics,” saying:

I'm not going to answer that, because I can't characterise that for you … right now. 

I think we'll know sooner rather than later, and a lot of that will be based on the conversation Ambassador Witkoff had yesterday and other factors that are in play.

But we are not there yet.

Rubio was also pushed on the details of Witkoff's conversations with Putin and the Russian president's public comments on the proposal.

But he batted it away saying “that's going to play out in press conferences.”

This is going to play out the way things of this nature and calibre have traditionally and normally play out, and that is with the leaders of individual of the countries involved speaking, not in front of the cameras, not in front of the media, but in these negotiations that happen, in these talks that happen. 

So I don't want to, I'm not going to comment on what President Putin said, other than he said he agreed with it in concept.

Rubio was also asked about whether he trusted Putin.

He said it was “an irrelevant question,” as “it is not about trusting, it's about action – about things you do.”

“You can't just say you want peace. You have to do peace, and that's true for both sides in any conflict, so in any war and in any engagement,” he said.

Rubio told reporters that foreign policy worked in a different way to domestic politics as you often have to work with people you don't like, but equally have disagreements with people you do like.

“Sometimes you will have to figure out how to work together with nations that are not aligned with you on most issues, and in some other cases, you may find yourself unaligned on an issue with the nation that you work with very closely on a bunch of other things,” he explained.

US state secretary Marco Rubio is the latest senior politician involved in the US-Russia talks to repeat the line that there are “reasons to be cautiously optimistic” on ceasefire talks in Ukraine.

Rubio described the talks by special envoy Steve Witkoff in Moscow as “a very positive and productive engagement yesterday with a President Putin.”

“We'll examine the Russian position more closely and the president will then determine what the next steps are. Suffice it to say, I think there is reason to be cautiously optimistic,” he said.

Rubio added that “we continue to recognise this is a difficult and complex situation,” and he stressed “it will not be easy, it will not be simple, but we certainly feel like we're at least some steps closer to ending this war and bringing peace.”

“Obviously, we will see what Russia and others are willing to do. It's not just Russia, obviously, it has to be acceptable to Ukraine,” he says.

“We'll know more once special envoy Witkoff returns and we have a chance to all convene and talk about it and obviously the president is the ultimate decider on next steps,” he said.

Separately, a United Nations investigation concluded that Russia has committed the crimes against humanity of enforced disappearances and torture in its war in Ukraine, AFP reported.

The crimes were perpetrated as part of a systematic, widespread attack against civilians, the UN's Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine said in a new report to be formally presented next Tuesday.

The Russian authorities “committed additional violations and crimes during these prolonged detentions. Many victims have been missing for months and years, and some died in captivity,” it said.

The UN Human Rights Council established its highest level of inquiry in March 2022 to probe violations and abuses committed during the conflict.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that “we must not let the war drag on,” as he urged the US to put pressure on Putin to “ensure that Russia is ready to end the war.”

He said that “pressure must be put on Russia” to force Putin into ending the conflict, repeating that Ukraine was “ready to act quickly and constructively.”

Over in Germany, I reported earlier about the breakthrough in political discussions about the proposed spending boost and changes to the constitutional debt break.

This Friday is only getting better for presumed next chancellor Friedrich Merz as Germany's constitutional court threw out several challenges by opposition parties against the plan.

Here is the decision in full (in German).

The decision paves the way for parliament to convene on Tuesday to further consider and approve the proposals to reform constitutional debt rules and set up a €500bn infrastructure fund.

Earlier today, Merz's CDU/CSU and the Social Democrats have secured the support of the Greens to approve the plans in the old Bundestag.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

While carefully avoiding an outright rejection of US ceasefire proposals, Moscow is playing for time

For once, the US president and European leaders were on the same page.

Grasping for a familiar metaphor, a chorus of western heads of state declared this week that “the ball was in Russia's court” after Ukraine agreed in talks with the US on Tuesday to an immediate 30-day ceasefire.

Rather than making a play, Vladimir Putin on Thursday picked up the ball, scrawled a fresh set of conditions across it, and lobbed it back – insisting the game could not move forward until the other side played by his rules.

“The idea itself is the right one, and we definitely support it,” Putin said, sitting alongside his longtime ally Alexander Lukashenko at a press conference in the Kremlin.

It was the “but” that followed that did all the heavy lifting.

“There are questions that we need to discuss, and I think we need to talk them through with our American colleagues and partner,” he added, suggesting that Ukraine should neither rearm nor mobilise and that western military aid to Kyiv be halted during the ceasefire.

Meanwhile, the message was clear: Russia had no intention of halting its own rearmament. Ukraine fears that Putin is preparing to do exactly what he accuses Kyiv of: exploiting the ceasefire to rearm and intensify his offensive if talks fall apart, as Russian forces press their advantage on the ground.

Over the past month, the geopolitical landscape has shifted dramatically in favour of the Russian leader, as Donald Trump reshaped US foreign policy to Moscow's advantage while straining relations with American allies.

But the introduction of a joint ceasefire proposal from the US and Ukraine turned the tables on Putin, forcing him to navigate the growing tension between his ambitions for a decisive victory in Ukraine and his efforts to maintain a close relationship with Trump.

By steering clear of an outright rejection of Trump's proposal, Putin appeared to be buying time – walking a fine line between avoiding an open rebuff of Trump's peace initiative and imposing his own stringent conditions, effectively prolonging the negotiations.

To his admirers, it was a masterclass in Putin's diplomatic manoeuvring, flanked by the seasoned foreign policy veterans Sergei Lavrov and Yuri Ushakov – both with decades of experience.

“Putin used one of his favourite phrases … A firm ‘Yes, but … '” quipped Andrei Kolesnikov, the chief political reporter for Russia's Kommersant newspaper and one of the few journalists with direct access to the president.

Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, predictably viewed Putin's ambivalent response as yet another cynical trick, dismissing it as “manipulative”. Putin, he said, was “afraid to say directly to President Trump that he wants to continue this war”, accusing the Russian leader of “framing the idea of a ceasefire with such preconditions that nothing will work out at all, or for as long as possible”.

For longtime observers, it was a familiar Russian tactic. Moscow has long excelled at delaying negotiations, offering just enough hope of progress to keep talks alive while avoiding major concessions.

Putin's remarks and Zelenskyy's response have drawn a clear dividing line between the two sides' positions.

Ukraine envisions a two-step approach: an immediate ceasefire followed by negotiations for a long-term settlement backed by western security guarantees.

Russia, on the other hand, insists that both issues must be settled within a single, comprehensive agreement, one that extends far beyond a simple ceasefire.

The contours of Russia's demands were discussed behind closed doors on Thursday, as Putin held late-night talks with Steven Witkoff, the billionaire friend of Trump and chief Ukraine negotiator.

Moscow is expected to push for sweeping concessions, including the demilitarisation of Ukraine, an end to western military aid and guarantees that Kyiv will remain outside Nato.

Foreign troop deployments in Ukraine remain a non-starter for Moscow, which is also seeking international recognition of its claims to Crimea and the four Ukrainian regions annexed in 2022. Putin may further revive broader security demands from 2021, including limits on Nato's military presence in countries that joined the alliance after 1997, when its expansion into former communist states began.

The Washington Post reported on Friday, citing classified US intelligence assessments, including one from earlier this month, that the Russian president had not “veered from his maximalist goal of dominating Ukraine”.

Trump, in his push for a deal to halt the war in Ukraine, started with the low-hanging fruit – pressuring Zelenskyy, whose military relies on American support.

But Trump had “few options to counter either a Russian rejection or prolonged feigned compliance”, said Alexander Baunov, a political analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

While Trump had pledged to intensify sanctions against Russia, the reality was that the US had little room left to escalate pressure – aside from increasing military support, which he had said he was reluctant to do.

Instead, Baunov argued, the most effective way to influence Russia would be the carrot rather than the stick – offering the prospect of sanctions relief and reintegration into western economies.

From the outset, Trump had dangled financial investment and a return to normal relations as incentives for Russia, or as his transactional administration put it, “the incredible opportunities that exist to partner with the Russians” – both geopolitically and economically.

But there was also a far darker possibility for Ukraine. “Faced with the reality that he has no real leverage over Putin for a quick deal, Trump could once again align himself with the Russian leader – turning Putin's demands into a joint agenda,” Baunov said.

Early signs will be worrying for Kyiv. On Friday, Trump echoed Putin's claims that thousands of Ukrainian troops were encircled by the Russian army in the Kursk region – a claim refuted by Ukrainian sources and independent analysts.

Trump wrote on his Truth Social app that he had asked Putin to spare the lives of Ukrainian soldiers – a favour Putin may gladly grant, given that, according to reports, no Ukrainian troops appear to be actually trapped.

By allowing Putin to play the role of the merciful leader, Trump subtly slips yet another card into Russia's ever-growing deck.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Backing of Greens is tantamount to approval of chancellor-in-waiting's proposal to relax debt brake

Germany's conservative chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, has said he has secured the support of the Green party for his radical plan to increase spending on defence and infrastructure after marathon talks that went through the night, paving the way for its approval in parliament.

“Germany is back,” Merz said in Berlin on Friday. “Germany is making its large contribution to the defence of freedom and peace in Europe.”

The conservative CDU/CSU bloc, which won last month's election, and the Social Democrats, who are in talks to form a new government, put forward a deal that will relax Germany's strict debt brake, allowing an increase in defence spending and a €500bn (£420bn) “special fund” dedicated to infrastructure reforms.

Merz, who is on the verge of becoming Germany's new leader, wants to seal the funding deal before parliament convenes in less than two weeks. The backing of the Green party, which would give Merz the necessary two-thirds majority for a constitutional change, is tantamount to him getting the deal through.

An expanded group of far-right and far-left MPs in the new Bundestag could oppose the spending plan as a “blocking minority”, something Merz is keen to avoid.

The Greens had previously criticised Merz's funding proposals for being too vague, as well as lacking climate protection commitments.

The controversial but ambitious plans put forward with Merz's potential coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPD), are necessary, he says, for Germany to become independent of Washington in terms of its security and that of Europe. The proposals envisage defence spending being exempt from the constitutionally protected debt brake when it exceeds 1% of GDP.

The debt brake was introduced in 2009 after the global financial crisis, with the aim of limiting Germany's borrowing capacity in order to protect future generations from the burden of excessive debt. But in recent years, especially after crises such as the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, the brake has increasingly been seen as an impediment and an obstacle to economic growth.

In a debate during the first reading of the legislation in parliament on Thursday, Merz stressed the urgency of investing in security. Germany must “do something now … anything else would be irresponsible,” he said.

He appeared to make concessions to the Greens, saying he would dedicate “up to €50bn” of the special fund to climate protection, as well as offering to expand the scope of defence spending to include civil defence and intelligence, asking: “What more do you actually want from us?”

The Greens, part of the existing government but due to go into opposition, have been furious at the extent of the conservative bloc's criticism of the party, blaming the Greens' climate policies for Germany's economic woes and ridiculing the party repeatedly in public.

Markets reacted positively to the news on Friday, with the euro, German government bond yields and equities all rising on the back of reports that the much-anticipated deal had been reached.

Analysts said it sent a signal that Germany was capable of decisiveness and raising its commitment to defence at a time of global uncertainty.

The SPD leader, Lars Klingbeil, one of the first to react to the news, called the package “a powerful boost for Germany”. He said it “laid the foundation for Germany to get back on its feet and protect itself”.

Merz called the package “a clear message to our partners … but also to the enemies of our freedom: we are capable of defending ourselves”.

Europe's biggest economy has suffered two consecutive years of negative growth. Economists say the funding plans could help to pull it out of the economic doldrums.

The Greens and the conservatives have announced press conferences to take place this afternoon. The Greens have called for guarantees that investment should finance new projects, not existing ones, as well as requesting more money for climate protection.

The outgoing Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, is scheduled to hear the second and third readings of the legislation on Tuesday morning before voting on the deal. After that, it will go to the upper house of parliament, the Bundesrat, where a two-thirds majority is also required. Germany's new parliament is due to convene on 25 March.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Duterte faces charges over his years-long campaign against drug users and dealers that rights groups say killed tens of thousands. This live blog is closed

Philippine ex-president Rodrigo Duterte is appearing by video link before judges at the international criminal court.

Duterte would follow the proceedings through a video link, a court spokesperson said.

No explanation was immediately given for his failure to appear in person for his first hearing at the ICC.

Philippine ex-president Rodrigo Duterte appeared by video link before judges at the international criminal court. He followed the proceedings through a video link.

The judge said that Duterte had been allowed to participate in his first ICC hearing by videoconference because he had just come off a long flight. Duterte, wearing a jacket and tie, listened to the hearing through headphones, often with his eyes closed. He spoke in English to confirm his name, and his date and place of birth.

Presiding judge Iulia Antoanella Motoc set a pre-trial hearing date of 23 September to establish if prosecution evidence is strong enough to merit sending the case to trial. If a trial does go ahead, it could take years, and if Duterte is convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, AP reported.

Duterte's lawyer, Salvador Medialdea, said that his client had been “abducted from his country”. “He was summarily transported to The Hague,” Medialdea said. “To lawyers it's extrajudicial rendition. For less legal minds, it's pure and simple kidnapping.” His lawyer called Duterte's arrest “political score-settling” in the Philippines. Medialdea said that Duterte had been under observation at a hospital because of health issues.

Duterte's children have been trying to rally support for their father over recent days, accusing the Philippines government of undermining the country's sovereignty by complying with the arrest warrant, and demanding that he be returned. His eldest daughter, Sara Duterte, who is the vice-president, has travelled to the ICC and is expected to speak to media outside the court later today. Duterte's youngest daughter Veronica, who has posted frequently about her father's arrest on social media, has called for people to light a candle in support.

 Duterte, the first former Asian leader detained by the ICC, was read his rights and formally informed of the charges of crimes against humanity that the court's prosecutors filed against him after a lengthy investigation.

The hearing, which started about a half-hour late, lasted about 30 minutes.

Duterte's children have been trying to rally support for their father over recent days, accusing the Philippines government of undermining the country's sovereignty by complying with the arrest warrant, and demanding that he be returned.

His eldest daughter, Sara Duterte, who is the vice-president, has travelled to the ICC and is expected to speak to media outside the court later today.

Duterte's youngest daughter Veronica, who has posted frequently about her father's arrest on social media, has called for people to light a candle in support.

She said:

I am calling unto you, not as his supporters, but as Filipinos, to stand for what is right and light a candle, whether you are in the Philippines or abroad.

Let us be one in prayer and one in upholding our rights to this sovereignty.

Duterte remained popular throughout his presidency, and, while his arrest has been celebrated by rights groups and the families of the victims of the “war on drugs”, it has also prompted some protests in his stronghold, Mindanao and the Visayas.

Duterte's lawyer at the ICC hearing has claimed that Duterte was “abducted from his country” and is “not able to contribute” to the proceedings.

Duterte has “debilitating medical issues,” his lawyer has told the ICC hearing, explaining that he cannot participate in today's hearing.

However, ICC presiding judge Iulia Antoanella Motoc noted that the court doctor was of the opinion that Duterte was “fully mentally aware and fit.”

The ICC presiding judge says Duterte was allowed to follow the case from a detention centre after “a long journey with considerable time difference”.

The former Phillipines president was arrested Tuesday amid chaotic scenes in Manila after returning from a visit to Hong Kong.

He was swiftly put on a chartered jet and flown to the Netherlands.

Rebecca Ratcliffe and Kate Lamb have written this profile for the Guardian of some of the people instrumental in bringing the case against Rodrigo Duterte to the international criminal court in The Hague. They wrote:

To some Duterte's arrest this week came as a sudden shock. But for years many brave Filipinos, from priests, politicians, pathologists, to relatives of the victims and journalists, have worked tirelessly, in and out of the spotlight, to expose the horrors of the deadly campaign and collect enough evidence to hold Duterte to account.

There have been demonstrations in the Philippines calling for the imprisonment of Rodrigo Duterte. These images show protesters in the streets of Quezon City.

Earlier this week my colleague Kate Lamb wrote this profile of the former president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte.

Speaking earlier this week, Karim Khan KC, who has served as prosecutor of the international criminal court since 2021, said that the appearance of Rodrigo Duterte in The Hague showed that international law was “not as weak as some may think.”

Describing the arrest of Duterte as “an important moment”, Khan said:

The office has been investigating the situation of the Philippines for some time in relation to the so-called “war on drugs”.

The judges have issued [a] warrant, and it's been executed. And in issuing the warrant, the judges have found reasonable grounds to believe that MDuterte has committed the crime of murder as the founder, as the head of the so-called Davao death squad, as the mayor of Davao City, and then later as the president of the Philippines between 2011 and 2019.

I think it's important to show that the office has been working with communities, with states, with international organisations, with other partners, to make sure that the investigation could be focused and could move as effectively as possible, and the fact that it's been executed is important to victims.

It means a lot, I think, to victims. That's the feedback we've already received.

And many say that international law is not as strong as we want, and I agree with that, but as I also repeatedly emphasise, international law is not as weak as some may think.

When we come together, when we work, when we build partnerships, the rule of law can prevail. Warrants can be executed.

Khan went on to remind people that the court views Duterte as “presumed innocent”, saying:

It is important to underline, as we now start a new stage of proceedings, that Duterte is presumed innocent. He will make his initial appearance before the court soon, and the focus of the office is on the judicial proceedings, and on proving his case before the judges of the international criminal court.

Reuters notes that Duterte's surrender to the court marks a victory for Khan, who faces US sanctions over the court issuing arrest warrants in November 2024 for Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes relating to the Gaza war.

Former president of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte has previously said he will accept responsibility for his government's so-called “war on drugs” in a video message filmed on board a plane shortly before he was taken into the custody of the international criminal court (ICC).

“Whatever happened in the past, I will be the front of our law enforcement and the military. I said this already, that I will protect you, and I will be responsible for everything,” he said.

The video message, which appeared to have been filmed on board the aircraft that brought him to the Netherlands to face charges of crimes against humanity, were his first comments to the Philippines public since his dramatic arrest on Tuesday.

Dressed in a plain white shirt, and speaking to the camera, he said: “This will be a long legal proceeding. But I say to you, I will continue to serve the country. So be it. If that is my destiny. Thank you”

Rodrigo Duterte's arrest came amid a breakdown in relations between his family and the Marcos family, who had previously joined forces to run the Philippines.

Current president Ferdinand Marcos and vice-president Sara Duterte – Rodrigo's daughter – are at loggerheads, with the latter facing an impeachment trial over charges including an alleged assassination plot against Marcos.

Sara Duterte is in the Netherlands to support her father, after labelling his arrest “oppression and persecution”, with the Duterte family having sought an emergency injunction from the supreme court to stop his transfer.

But victims of the “war on drugs” hope that Duterte will finally face justice for his alleged crimes.

Few expected things to move so quickly. Supporters of the Philippines' former president Rodrigo Duterte barely had time to protest before he was jetted off to The Hague to face charges of crimes against humanity in relation to his country's so-called “war on drugs”. According to activists, this bloody crackdown has seen as many as 30,000 people killed since 2016.

The charges brought against the former leader are the culmination of years of work by activists, lawyers and victims, who documented abuses committed under his government, often at great personal risk. But Duterte arguably would not have been surrendered to The Hague if it weren't for his family's dramatic feud with that of Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the current president.

The two families were once allies. Marcos Jr ran on a joint ticket with Duterte's eldest daughter – Sara Duterte, now the vice-president – in the 2022 election, winning a landslide victory. At the time, Marcos Jr, who capitalised on the popularity of the Duterte name, was careful not to criticise Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs, and promised not to cooperate with the international criminal court's continuing investigation.

It was inevitable that the families' alliance would collapse, according to Prof Maria Ela L Atienza, of the University of the Philippines. Both sides want their candidate to be elected president in 2028, so, she said: “It's a fight for the survival of their political families, their dynasties.”

Marcos Jr's public comments about the ICC shifted as tension grew. His government has continued to maintain that it would not assist the court, of which the Philippines is no longer a member, but explained that it would cooperate with any arrest warrant issued via Interpol.

Rodrigo Duterte's ‘war on drugs' in the Philippines – explained in 30 seconds.

The former president faces an investigation by the international criminal court for crimes against humanity over the alleged extrajudicial killing of thousands of drug suspects.

For a rundown of what led to this point, see our explainer here:

Former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte is scheduled to make his first appearance before judges of the international criminal court at 1pm GMT, days after his arrest in Manila on murder charges linked to the deadly ‘war on drugs' he oversaw while in office.

The 79-year-old Duterte, the first Asian former leader arrested on an ICC warrant, will be read his rights and formally informed of the charges of crimes against humanity that the court's prosecutors filed against him after a lengthy investigation, AP reported.

Soon after his election in 2016, Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte launched his so-called “war on drugs”, a bloody campaign in which as many as 30,000 civilians were killed.

Most of the victims were men from poor, urban areas, who were gunned down in the streets or their homes by police, or in some cases, unidentified assailants.

The authorities routinely claimed police had killed in self-defence. However, groups documenting the killings have challenged this claim, alleging the police regularly falsified evidence, including by planting drugs and guns at the scene.

Witnesses frequently stated that victims were unarmed and did not pose a threat. The type of wounds sustained by victims also contradicted police claims: many were shot multiple times, and in some cases in their backs or the back of their heads.

Today, the court will also seek to set a date for a key pre-trial hearing – likely months from now – at which judges will assess whether there is enough evidence to proceed to a full trial, which could take years. If Duterte is convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

Duterte was arrested Tuesday amid chaotic scenes in the Philippine capital after returning from a visit to Hong Kong. He threatened a police general with lawsuits, refused to be fingerprinted and told law enforcers “you have to kill me to bring me to The Hague,” according to police Maj. Gen. Nicolas Torre.

The standoff occurred at a Philippine airbase before he and other police officers managed to bring the former leader on to a government-chartered jet that took him to the Netherlands. Torre described the confrontation as “very tense” and said Duterte refused to be fingerprinted.

Duterte's legal team challenges his arrest and said that Philippine authorities didn't show any copy of the ICC warrant and violated his constitutional rights. He will not be required to formally enter a plea at Friday's hearing.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Mayor of city ‘with steel in its veins' says ‘There's a lot of tension … a lot of worry' as 25% export levy kicks in

The sprawling ArcelorMittal Dofasco steel plant in Hamilton, Ontario has in recent months become a site of pilgrimage for Canadian political leaders.

Dressed in pristine orange coveralls and hard hats, prime ministers and provincial premiers gaze at coiled sheets of steel with the stern grimaces and keen interest of generals reviewing a military parade.

And, in the eyes of many Canadians, the country is already in a state of conflict.

This week, after a string of feints and retreats, a phony trade war came to an end as Donald Trump threatened to inflict “a financial price … so big that it will be read about in History Books for many years to come”.

US tariffs of 25% on steel and aluminum imports took effect on Wednesday, followed in turn by retaliatory levies by Canada.

And so, barely 48 hours after winning the race to lead the ruling federal Liberal party, Canada's prime minister-designate, Mark Carney, became the latest politician to head to Dofasco.

The former governor of the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada criticized the “unjustified” tariffs and said he was willing to sit down with Trump, as long as the president showed “respect for Canadian sovereignty”.

That remained in doubt: just a day earlier, Trump had restated his argument that Canada should become the “cherished Fifty First State”, adding: “The artificial line of separation drawn many years ago will finally disappear.”

Such talk might once have been dismissed as harmless trolling or perhaps a strategy to win trade concessions, but Canadians are taking Trump at his word – and readying for a worsening of relations.

“Nobody wants to be here. Nobody wants a trade war. But here we are and I can say one thing – we're not going to roll over,” said Andrea Horwath, the mayor of Hamilton. “We've seen a powerful Team Canada approach across the country because at this moment, fracturing is not an option. Instead, we're seeing Canada at its finest.”

That unity has come in the form of a “buy Canada” movement, boycotts of leisure travel to the United States, cancellation of entertainment subscriptions and a rallying cry of “Elbows Up” – a reference to energetic tackles in ice hockey.

At the Dofasco site, the relentless hum of machines, punctuated by the clang of passing trains provides the soundtrack to a city Horwath said had “steel in its veins”. Red trucks ferried batches of hot pressed coils, each weighing 20 tons, for shipment to buyers – many of which are south of the border.

Canada is the largest supplier of steel and aluminum to the US, exporting 10m tonnes and 3m tonnes of the metals respectively last year.

“There's really a lot of uncertainty,” said Vikas Jha, who works as a contractor in the steel industry. “There's also a lot of talk, but no one really knows what do with that or how seriously to take it.”

A previous round of Trump tariffs, has tempered unease for some: in his first term, the president put a 25% tariff on raw Canadian steel and aluminum. Those levies persisted for a year, but companies like Dofasco felt minimal damage as steel prices soared.

“Last time around, we were fine. The customers in the United States were still buying the steel because they had to continue to operate,” said Jha. “But this time round – we're not entirely sure what's going to happen. We're not seeing panic. But if it's a long-term thing? Then the mood is going to change pretty quickly.”

In some sectors, the mood has already shifted. This time round, Trump's tariffs on steel also apply to finished steel-products companies, including National Steel Car, Canada's largest train car manufacturer, which has seen orders disappear since Trump was elected.

“The fact that leaders are coming here means that industry has their ear,” said one Dofasco worker, Robert Meneguzzi. “Everybody understands the stakes and what's going on. It's more a question of what's actually going on. All we're seeing on the ground is confusion and uncertainty.”

That sense of doubt has infected bilateral ties of all kinds, rendering unrecognizable a relationship long defined by stability and predictability.

American officials announced that Canadians who visit the US for more than 30 days will be required to register with authorities and submit to fingerprinting – a provision from which Canadians were previously exempt. The shift is likely to affect the 900,000 Canadian “snowbird” senior citizens who annually drive south to spend their winter in warmer southern states.

The United States has also paused negotiations on the Columbia River Treaty, a key water-sharing agreement between the two nations that expired in September.

On the Canadian side, government liquor stores have pulled American spirits and wines. While in British Columbia, the utility operator BC Hydro said it was excluding Tesla from its electric vehicle charger rebate program.

The tariffs, framed by Trump as a move to restore “fairness” in global trade, threaten to inflict disproportionate pain in Canada's industrial hubs.

Hamilton's steel industry has declined in recent decades – accounting for 30,000 jobs in the early 1980s but fewer than 10,000 today – but it remains a fixture of the city's history and tax base.

And the knock-on effect of job losses could be devastating, compounding the impact of that decline, said Horwath.

“We've had companies already say that they're laying off already, that orders have dried up. Others don't know if they can weather the storm, because they don't know how long the storm will last,” she said.

“Hamilton is a city that makes things, and we have been for a very, very long time. What's next and where is this all going? There's a lot of tension, a lot of uncertainty and a lot of worry.”

Horwath, who says as many as 42,000 jobs could be at risk in the region, recently met with company leaders who pledged to keep roots in the industrial city.

“The commitment they showed to Hamilton, to Canada, and the fierceness by which they spoke about their intent to, you know, to hold on and to fight back and to rebuild was heartening,” she said. “Of course, there are limits depending on how things get.”

On Thursday, Ontario's premier, Doug Ford, and the federal finance minister, Dominic LeBlanc, visited Washington to meet with Trump's combative commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, in an effort to dial back tensions.

“If you're racing to the basement, there's no real prize for the first person to get to the basement,” said LeBlanc before the visit.

Horwath, who recently returned from the US capital after meeting with other mayors along the Great Lakes, said the ripple effects of a sustained fight would be “catastrophic” for Hamilton.

“This isn't theoretical. This is real. And I'm grateful for all the attention we're getting from federal and provincial leaders because they reality is, we're ground zero,” she said. “We're an example of the bad things that happen if we don't fight like hell.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Israeli Oscar-winner Yuval Abraham speaks out after Miami Beach mayor proposed evicting a local cinema for screening the Palestinian-focused documentary

The Israeli director of No Other Land has criticised a Florida mayor's efforts to evict a local cinema after it screened his Oscar-winning documentary about Palestinian displacement in the West Bank, saying: “Banning a film only makes people more determined to see it.”

Steven Meiner, the mayor of Miami Beach, has issued a draft resolution calling for the termination of the city's lease agreement with O Cinema, and withdrawing $40,000 in promised grant funding for the nonprofit that runs the independent cinema.

In a newsletter sent to residents on Tuesday, Meiner condemned No Other Land as “a false one-sided propaganda attack on the Jewish people that is not consistent with the values of our City and residents” and accused it “of normalizing hate and … disseminating antisemitism”.

Meiner had previously urged the O Cinema to cancel scheduled screenings of the documentary, citing criticism from Israeli and German officials.

Yuval Abraham, an Israeli journalist and one of the documentary's four directors who are all from Israel and Palestine, issued a statement to Deadline on Thursday.

“When the mayor uses the word antisemitism to silence Palestinians and Israelis who proudly oppose occupation and apartheid together, fighting for justice and equality, he is emptying it out of meaning,” Abraham said. “I find that to be very dangerous. Censorship is always wrong.”

“We made this film to reach US audiences from a wide variety of political views. I believe that once you see the harsh reality of occupation in Masafer Yatta in the West Bank, it becomes impossible to justify it, and that's why the mayor is so afraid of No Other Land. It won't work. Banning a film only makes people more determined to see it.

According to Meiner's newsletter, O Cinema's CEO, Vivian Marthell, allegedly agreed to withdraw the film from programming, citing “concerns of antisemitic rhetoric”, but Meiner claimed she reversed her decision the following day. The screenings sold out and the cinema added additional dates in March.

“Our decision to screen No Other Land is not a declaration of political alignment. It is, however, a bold reaffirmation of our fundamental belief that every voice deserves to be heard,” Marthell told the Miami Herald.

Kristen Rosen Gonzalez, a Miami Beach commissioner, said she shared the mayor's negative assessment of the film but cautioned against a “kneejerk reaction” that could trigger “costly legal battles”, and noted O Cinema's “longstanding commitment to the Jewish community”.

The documentary, which won the Academy Award for best documentary feature, follows the destruction of Palestinian villages in the occupied West Bank and chronicles the unlikely friendship between Abraham and Palestinian activist Basel Adra, who co-directed the film.

No Other Land is being self-distributed in the US after no distributors would pick it up, even after it won several awards and secured its Oscar nomination.

“We were told that people were afraid” of distributing a film critical of the Israeli government during the war with Gaza, Abraham previously told the Guardian – despite No Other Land being filmed in the West Bank, not Gaza, and finished before Hamas' 7 October 2023 terror attack.

Meiner's proposal to cancel the cinema's lease is set for a commission vote next Wednesday.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Ed Miliband visits Beijing as part of plan to create global axis working in favour of climate action

The UK is hoping to shape a new global axis in favour of climate action along with China and a host of developing countries, to offset the impact of Donald Trump's abandonment of green policies and his sharp veer towards climate-hostile countries such as Russia and Saudi Arabia.

Ed Miliband, the UK's energy and net zero secretary, arrived in Beijing on Friday for three days of talks with top Chinese officials, including discussions on green technology supply chains, coal and the critical minerals needed for clean energy. The UK's green economy is growing three times faster than the rest of the economy, but access to components and materials will be crucial for that to continue.

He said: “We can only keep future generations safe from climate change if all major emitters act. It is simply an act of negligence to today's and future generations not to engage China on how it can play its part in taking action on climate.”

Writing in the Guardian, he added: “Climate action at home without pushing other, larger countries to do their fair share would not protect current and future generations. We will only protect our farmers, our pensioners and our children if we get other countries of the world to play their part.”

China is facing a barrage of tariffs from Trump on its exports to the US, and the possibility that the EU will start levying green tariffs on imports of high-carbon Chinese goods, such as steel.

The world's biggest greenhouse gas emitter is profiting from record exports of electric vehicles, solar panels and other low-carbon goods. But it is still highly dependent on coal, and though the upward march of its emissions appears to have paused, whether China reduces its carbon output or returns to fossil fuels may depend largely on the government's response to Trump's trade war.

Many experts believe the only prospect of staving off climate breakdown is for China, the EU, the UK and other major economies to form a pro-climate bloc alongside vulnerable developing countries, to counter the weight of US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and petrostates pushing for the continued expansion of fossil fuels.

Miliband's visit to Beijing is the first by a UK energy secretary in eight years. He visited India last month on a similar mission, and travelled to Brazil last year, as well as holding meetings with many minsters of developing countries at the Cop29 climate summit last November.

Catherine Abreu, the director of the International Climate Politics Hub, said: “It's really important to see this happening – there is no way to fulfil the Paris agreement without China. And China has made clear it is willing to be more vocal on these issues, to boost climate action. We see an openness in China to band together with Europe, Canada, the UK on climate issues.”

But the prospects of agreement on the sharp emissions cuts needed globally to limit temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, in line with the Paris agreement, are increasingly remote. Brazil will host this year's UN climate summit, Cop30, in the Amazon in November amid the worst geopolitical tensions in decades, and as many governments prepare to pour money into rearmament.

Only a handful of countries, including the UK, have so far submitted their national plans on emissions cuts for the next decade as required under the 2015 Paris agreement, despite the deadline passing last month. China is unlikely to produce its plan until much closer to the Cop30 conference, and will be keenly watched, as its current carbon targets are much too weak to stay within the 1.5C limit.

Miliband may find he needs to adapt his plans for a booming green economy in the UK in the face of China's economic dominance of the low-carbon technology market, according to Li Shuo, the director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute.

“We need to be honest about the economic reality,” he said. “All countries in the world are hoping for a share of the green pie. But that is not aligned with the economic reality … that they can't outcompete China.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Document described as interim national security guidance calls on US military to create options

The Trump administration has called on the Pentagon to provide military options to ensure the country has full access to the Panama canal, two US officials told Reuters on Thursday.

Donald Trump has said repeatedly he wants to “take back” the Panama canal, which is located at the narrowest part of the isthmus between North and South America and is considered one of the world's most strategically important waterways, but he has not offered specifics about how he would do so, or if military action might be required.

One US official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said a document, described as interim national security guidance by the new administration, asked the military to look at options to ensure “unfettered” access to the Panama canal.

A second official said the US military had a wide array of potential options to guarantee access, including ensuring a close partnership with Panama's military.

The Pentagon last published a national defense strategy in 2022, laying out the priorities for the military. An interim document sets out broad policy guidance, much like Trump's executive orders and public remarks, before a more considered policy document like a formal NDS.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The interim document was first reported by CNN. NBC News earlier on Thursday reported that the White House had ordered the Pentagon to create options for the Panama canal.

Trump has asserted that the US needs to “take back” the canal, arguing, without evidence, that China controls it and could use the waterway to undermine American interests. In his inaugural speech in January, Trump accused Panama of breaking a promise for the final transfer of the canal in 1999.

Ilya Espino de Marotta, the canal's deputy administrator, told the Guardian in January: “The canal is run by Panamanians 100%. We are an autonomous entity. …

“There is no Chinese management of the canal.”

Any move by a foreign power to take the canal by force would almost certainly violate international law.

The US and Panama are treaty-bound to defend the canal against any threat to its neutrality and are permitted to take unilateral action to do so.

The US acquired the rights to build and operate the canal in the early 20th century. In a treaty signed in 1979, during the administration of Jimmy Carter, the US agreed to turn over control of the canal to Panama at the close of 1999.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Lai Ching-te's speech – which included a proposal to set up military courts – prompted an angry reaction from Beijing, which called him a ‘creator of crisis'

Taiwan's new president has formally labelled China a “foreign hostile force” and ramped up national security measures in the face of growing threats and a string of spying cases.

The new measures announced on Thursday include a controversial proposal to restore a military court system in Taiwan, which was under martial law until the late 1980s.

The president, Lai Ching-te, made the announcement after convening a high-level national security meeting. It prompted an almost immediate reaction from Beijing, which called Lai a “destroyer of cross-Straits peace” and “creator of crisis” who was pushing Taiwan towards the “perilous brink of war”.

Lai told reporters he was responding to China's increasing grey zone attacks and infiltration of government, military and society. He said China met the definition of a “foreign hostile force” under Taiwan's anti-infiltration act and he had “no choice but to take even more proactive measures”.

“China has been taking advantage of democratic Taiwan's freedom, diversity, and openness to recruit gangs, the media, commentators, political parties, and even active-duty and retired members of the armed forces and police to carry out actions to divide, destroy, and subvert us from within,” Lai said.

The most concrete measure announced was plans to re-establish a peacetime military court system to prosecute “military crimes as sedition, aiding the enemy, leaking confidential information, dereliction of duty, or disobedience”.

Taiwan was ruled under brutal martial law for decades, and abolished its military court in 2014 after backlash over the handling of an investigation into the hazing-related death of a young recruit.

Opposition parties – which hold the majority in Taiwan's legislature and have been highly obstructionist to Lai's agenda – have questioned the plan. Opposition KMT legislator Wang Hung-wei said her party wasn't “totally against it” but accused the ruling DPP of backflipping on its long-held positions. Another opposition party, the TPP, said the proposal would send Taiwan backwards on human rights.

In his speech Lai flagged tightening restrictions on Chinese travellers and new residents, as well as monitoring of Taiwanese people working or travelling in China.

Taiwan has prosecuted dozens of current and former military personnel who have been recruited as spies for Beijing, and has criticised Taiwanese entertainers and influencers for endorsing Beijing's claims over Taiwan and spreading propaganda, Lai said.

This week a Chinese-born resident was expelled for posting online content endorsing a Chinese invasion. China has also been offering an unknown number of Taiwanese citizens Chinese residency or passports, which Lai said was “an attempt to muddle Taiwanese people's sense of national identity”.

China's government this week concluded its annual Two Sessions political meeting, during which officials emphasised their continued objective to annex Taiwan and punish leaders it sees as “separatists”. Officials at the Two Sessions reiterated a preference for peaceful “reunification”, but hardened language around a willingness to use military force if necessary.

Chen Binhua, spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, had said on Wednesday: “If the ‘Taiwan independence' separatist forces provoke, exert pressure, or dare to cross the red line, resolute actions will be taken in response.”

On Friday morning Taiwan's defence ministry said 12 fighter jets, seven navy vessels and one “official” ship (likely coast guard) had been detected around Taiwan since 6am. It said nine of the jets crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait.

The Loess plateau was the most eroded place on Earth until China took action and reversed decades of damage from grazing and farming

It was one of China's most ambitious environmental endeavours ever.

The Loess plateau, an area spanning more than 245,000 sq miles (640,000 sq km) across three provinces and parts of four others, supports about 100 million people. By the end of the 20th century, however, this land, once fertile and productive, was considered the most eroded place on Earth, according to a documentary by the ecologist John D Liu.

Generations of farmers had cleared and cultivated the land, slowly breaking down the soil and destroying the cover. Every year, the dust from the plain jammed the Yellow River with silt (this is how the river gets its name), sending plumes of loess, a fine wind-blown sediment, across Chinese cities – including to the capital, Beijing.

And so in 1999 the Chinese government took drastic emergency action with the launch of Grain to Green, a pilot project backed by World Bank funding, to regreen the plateau and reverse the damage done by overgrazing and overcultivation of the once forested hillsides that would become what the bank described in 2004 as “the largest and most successful water and soil conservancy project in the world” (pdf).

The primary focus was to restore agricultural production and incomes in the plateau, but the dust storms descending on already polluted cities, “making people cough even more”, also became a driver, says Peter Bridgewater, an honorary professor at the Australian National University's Centre for Heritage and Museum Studies.

World Bank participants spent more than three years designing the project, working with experts as well as communities, officials and farmers on how to overturn the longstanding but unsustainable grazing and herding of livestock. Tree-cutting, planting on hillsides and uncurbed sheep and goat grazing were banned. The sustainable practices demonstrated in some small villages were scaled up.

The project was extraordinarily ambitious, and was powered through by China's authoritarian system. “If you want major change, the Chinese system is well adapted to making major change,” says Bridgewater wryly.

There were grain and cash subsidies for people converting farmland to grassland, economic forest or protected ecological forest. There were tax subsidies and benefits to offset farming losses, long-term land use contracts and conversion to more sustainable farming including orchards and nuts, and widespread tree-planting employment programmes.

By 2016, China had converted more than 11,500 sq miles of rain-fed cropland to forest or grassland – a 25% increase in vegetative cover in a decade, according to a study published in Nature Climate Change. Other studies showed large reductions in erosion and positive changes in plant productivity.

“When the environment improved, all the birds returned. The forest has developed its ecological system naturally,” the forestry worker Yan Rufeng told the state-run news channel CGTN.

It wasn't straightforward, however. There was some community resistance, particularly to demands to plant trees on farming land. “What about the next generation? They can't eat trees,” said one man interviewed for Liu's documentary.

In the early years there also appeared to be a correlation between the project and a sudden drop in grain yield. Over the years, officials would debate whether the programme was harming China's food security, although studies found there to be several factors at play, and that yields later improved.

In hindsight, the early methods employed to regreen the dusty hills were also problematic. “There was a lot of mass tree planting – not necessarily natives – and in plantation format, in other words, monocultural stands,” says Bridgewater.

Mass-species planting eventually began to replace the monoculture plantations, helping to increase wildlife, but there were also issues with water management, with the burgeoning tree cover and agriculture taking more and more water out of the Yellow River system.

“It's looking like there is a point at which the revegetation will become too successful in that it actually then swings the water balance of the landscape, reducing the potential for water to go into the rivers and be available for human use,” says Bridgewater.

“So this is another element that was not really thought about at the start, because the aim wasn't ‘let's stabilise the system'. But it's a good lesson as to how all these interconnecting factors need to be thought about very carefully before you launch into these things.”

A big factor in the success and demands of the programme was and remains the changing climate. The plateau sits in a transition zone between arid and semi-humid climates. The varied natural factors of the region, combined with unsustainable human activity, had contributed to the fragility of the plateau, a 2021 study found. “At the same time, the climate in this region has shown warming and wetting, particularly in the south in which precipitation increased by 20-50 mm from 2000 to 2014.”

The climate around the Loess plateau is changing, which means what existed, or even thrived, several decades ago can't necessarily be put back, says Bridgewater. “But we can produce something, a system that will produce ecosystem services at a better range and a better quality and more regularly than the systems that we've destabilised.”

Bridgewater adds: “Given the speed of climate change, and not just climate but hydrology and all the other associated global changes, we need to be thinking about what we want. What we want out of our ecosystems are actually services.

“We need to think actually in multi-dimensions … to develop a whole new way of thinking as to how we manage the landscape. And in a way, the whole Loess plateau project is a good example of that, [even if] that wasn't the way of thinking at the start.”

Lu FuChin, a former farmer, told the official state news outlet Xinhua that the programme had boosted local employment. “I used to cut trees for firewood, but now I grow them instead,” said the 52-year-old forestry worker. “It used to be that people had to go far for work, but now they can find employment by the Yellow River. As the environment is improving, I believe the villagers' lives will become more prosperous too.”

Moscow offers heavily qualified support for US-Ukraine proposal as Russia regains more of Kursk region

The Ukrainian army on Thursday was trying to quickly build up defensive lines near the border to prevent Russia from turning its Sudzha counter-invasion into a launchpad for advancing into north-eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian invasion of Kursk was intended to redirect Russian forces from inside Ukraine, while the land gained was supposed to be a potential bargaining chip for Ukraine to get back at least some of the 20% of its territory invaded by Russia.

Ukraine said on Thursday it had ordered the mandatory evacuation of eight villages near the border with the Kursk region. The Sumy region's military administration posted that “a decision was made to conduct a mandatory evacuation of the population from eight settlements” due to “the exacerbation of the operational situation in the region” and “constant shelling by Russia”.

Russia has retaken control of about 70% of the territory Ukraine captured in the first weeks of its August incursion into Kursk, according to the Institute for the Study of War in Washington. Ukraine holds less than 200 square kilometres (77 square miles) in Kursk, down from 1,300 sq km at the peak of the incursion, according to the Russian military. To flee the Kursk region, Ukrainian soldiers reportedly must walk dozens of kilometres to get back into Ukraine while avoiding Russian forces.

Canada on Thursday called on the G7 powers to back Ukraine against Russia's “aggression” as Donald Trump's conciliatory approach towards Moscow split the club of wealthy democracies. Canada, the current G7 president, is gathering foreign ministers for three days of talks in Charlevoix, Quebec.

Britain said on Friday it would increase the overall amount it lends other countries to buy from British defence firms, in an effort to boost exports of missiles and aircraft and bolster its defence industry. The government will increase its credit agency UK Export Finance's (UKEF) direct lending capacity for defence by £2bn ($2.6bn) to £10bn, the finance ministry said. The boost comes a few weeks after Britain pledged to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, saying it was necessary in light of global instability and the war in Ukraine.

Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia supported in principle a US proposal for a ceasefire in Ukraine, but sought a number of clarifications and conditions that appeared to rule out a quick end to the fighting. The Russian president's heavily qualified support looked designed to signal goodwill to Washington, but he said many crucial details needed to be sorted out and any agreement must address what he considers the root causes of the conflict. “We agree with the proposals to cease hostilities,” Putin told reporters at the Kremlin after talks with Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian president. “The idea itself is correct, and we certainly support it.”

Trump said Steve Witkoff, his special envoy, was engaged in serious talks with the Russians in Moscow on the proposal that the US and Kyiv have agreed. “Now we're going to see whether or not Russia is there, and if they're not, it'll be a very disappointing moment for the world,” Trump said.

Trump said his administration has been discussing what land Ukraine would keep or lose under any settlement, as well as the future of a large power plant. He did not name it but was likely referring to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia power station, Europe's largest nuclear plant.

Zelenskyy said Putin was preparing to reject the ceasefire proposal but was afraid to tell Trump. “That's why in Moscow they are imposing upon the idea of a ceasefire these conditions, so that nothing happens at all, or so that it cannot happen for as long as possible,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address.

Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Putin in a phone call the kingdom remained committed to facilitating dialogue and supporting a political resolution, the Saudi state news agency reported on Friday.

The US is poised to resume shipments to Ukraine of long-range bombs known as Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bombs (GLSDB) after they were upgraded to better counter Russian jamming, two people familiar with the weapon told Reuters. The munitions will arrive amid reports that Ukraine's supply of the similarly ranged Army Tactical Missile Systems (Atacms) has been depleted. The glide bombs were bought under Joe Biden's presidency using the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative.

The destruction of a large Ukrainian dam in 2023 triggered a “toxic timebomb” of environmental harm, a study has found. Lakebed sediments holding 83,000 tonnes of heavy metals – which include lead, cadmium and nickel – were exposed when the Kakhovka dam was blown up one year into Russia's invasion, researchers found.

Germany's chancellor-in-waiting has tried to win over the Greens to his ambitious but controversial plans to raise the country's defence spending, promising to expand the scope of the plans and demanding of them: “What more do you actually want from us?” The outgoing parliament met on Thursday to debate the creation of a €500bn (£420bn) fund for infrastructure investment and radical changes in Germany's borrowing limits in order to boost defence spending.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

UK national security adviser may prefer to work behind the scenes but he found himself in the limelight this week

In the topsy-turvy world in which Keir Starmer and his aides operate, the US putting the onus on Russia to agree to a truce with Ukraine marked a significant victory.

The proposed 30-day ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine is the culmination of two weeks of high-wire negotiations involving Ukraine, the US, UK, France and Germany.

Within hours of the plan becoming public on Tuesday, UK sources let it be known that among its architects was Jonathan Powell, a veteran of the New Labour years who has emerged as one of the most important figures in shaping British foreign policy under Starmer.

Powell was in Ukraine over the weekend thrashing out the terms of the proposal in writing with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, before Ukraine and the US entered crunch negotiations in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to get it over the line.

The Guardian has been told that Powell has been pivotal in steering the UK response to the fallout between Donald Trump and Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on 28 February. He successfully argued that Starmer should not issue an immediate reaction on social media and instead get on the phone to both leaders.

“Jonathan Powell has earned his money,” said Emily Thornberry, the Labour chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, on Wednesday. “The idea that he's been out in the United States and speaking to the Americans and the Germans and the French, and crafting the offer and then going to Ukraine and crafting the response: it's an achievement,” she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

Thornberry said Powell brought a “depth of understanding and a calm” to the role. Aged 38 when he started working for Tony Blair in opposition, he served as chief of staff for the entirety of Blair's premiership and helped to negotiate the Good Friday agreement. Before that, he was a diplomat who worked on negotiations to return Hong Kong to China and arms control talks with the Soviet Union in the mid-1980s.

At 67 he was brought back into government from Inter Mediate, the conflict resolution not-for-profit organisation he founded. Those who have worked with him in the past year say he is a calm and seasoned operator who does not seek the limelight. “He has an air about him of a person who has done this all before,” one colleague said.

The same person said Powell was “very much the PM's choice” for national security adviser, having impressed while leading the government's negotiations to return the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, a much-maligned deal that now looks set to be waved through by Trump.

Powell has also become No 10's de facto chief adviser on foreign policy, filling a vacuum left by John Bew, who had the role under three Conservative prime ministers. This has prompted concerns in sections of Whitehall that Powell is spinning too many plates and cracks will begin to show.

“The two biggest concerns that I'm consistently hearing is that he's got way too much on, and he's having to travel the whole time as he's effectively the chief envoy,” said a foreign policy expert who is plugged into Whitehall.

The Guardian reported in January that Morgan McSweeney, Starmer's chief of staff, intended to appoint a foreign policy adviser to bolster the No 10 operation. Special advisers were told on Tuesday that the role would be filled by Henna Shah, an ally of McSweeney who has been serving as No 10 director of party relations and will play a supporting role to Powell.

Peter Ricketts, who served as national security adviser under David Cameron, said: “Each PM designs No 10 and the staff around them to suit them. Tony Blair used Jonathan Powell in much the same sort of way as Keir Starmer is doing and it suits the Starmer style – no drama, quiet, effective work in the background.

“The issue for Jonathan to watch is that he's keeping very much on side with David Lammy [the foreign secretary] – this quiet backchannel work needs to be done in close coordination with Lammy and John Healey [the defence secretary] so both ministers feel they have full confidence in him,” Ricketts said.

Powell's centrality to the negotiations has raised questions about whether Lammy is being sidelined as the UK's chief diplomat. One diplomatic source said: “Power in foreign policy affairs tends to swing between Downing Street and the Foreign Office. Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak all largely left it to the Foreign Office, but Starmer has brought it firmly back into No 10. David Lammy is currently a bit player, but he's not the first foreign secretary to find himself in that position.”

Lammy's allies say he has been closely involved in the ceasefire negotiations over the past week and spent a year laying the groundwork for engagement with the Trump administration, including by building a strong relationship with the vice-president, JD Vance. Unlike Joe Biden's administration, where much of the power rested with the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, under Trump there are several influential figures shaping foreign policy, including Lammy's direct counterpart, Marco Rubio.

Powell also helped advise Lammy and Starmer on foreign policy issues in opposition, and the foreign secretary is said to have argued that Powell should be brought into government after Labour won the election.

“He has enough political intuitiveness to be able to adapt,” the foreign policy expert said of Powell. “He is given the authority to speak and act on behalf of the prime minister, which hasn't always been the case with his predecessors.”

Lib Dem leader says PM should make public show of support for ally against ‘shocking attacks' on its sovereignty

The leader of the UK's Liberal Democrats has called on the prime minister to publicly support Canada and oppose the “shocking attacks” on Canadian sovereignty, as the Trump administration further escalates its global trade war against longstanding allies.

Ed Davey, who leads the third largest political party in the UK, has called on Keir Starmer to travel to Canada in a show of support to the nation's new prime minister, Mark Carney, as the commonwealth nation faces a generational crisis under Trump's tariff war and suggestions that the country might become the 51st US state.

“I believe Britain needs to stand by our allies, our allies in the commonwealth and our allies in Europe,” Davey said.

“Would we want the US to back away with its tariffs? Of course we would, and we should use every diplomatic weapon at our disposal to get it over to the White House that this is unfriendly, wrong and self-destructive.”

The call for Starmer to publicly stand by Canada comes at a crucial moment for the future of the Nato alliance and the war in Ukraine, as the prime minister has found himself walking a political tightrope between Europe and the US only months into Trump's second term.

This week, the US announced a 25% tariff on all imports of steel and aluminium, in part as retaliation for Ontario imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to the US, which was itself a response to US tariffs. The move was swiftly countered by the European Commission with up to €26bn (£22bn) worth of US goods.

The tariffs, which could affect 5% of Britain's steel exports and 6% of aluminium exports, according to government figures, would not be countered by Starmer, he said before they went into effect on Wednesday.

Davey said: “I think in the short and the long term it serves you better if you make it clear to Trump that you are not going to roll over, that you are going to have principles and you will stand up to him.

“I'd like him to do more to show publicly that we support Canada and oppose these shocking attacks on Canadian sovereignty,” he added, calling the 51st state suggestion “appalling”.

On Wednesday during prime minister's questions, Davey asked if Starmer would fly out to Canada “as soon as possible” in a show of support for Canada against Trump's threats and tariffs.

Starmer said the situation in Canada has been discussed with allies on many occasions. He said he was disappointed to see the global tariffs on steel and aluminium, and said the UK will take “a pragmatic approach”.

“Canada is an ally, and a very important ally too,” said Starmer. “We are, as the right honourable gentleman knows, negotiating an economic deal, which covers and will include tariffs, if we succeed, but we will keep all options on the table.”

When Starmer visited the White House in February, Trump suggested a “real trade deal” between the US and the UK could mean tariffs were not necessary.

Throughout Canada's 158 years as a nation, a British king or queen has served as head of state. Having King Charles as head of state for both the UK and Canada “ought to mean something”, argued Davey, who said he understood Canadians' frustrations over silence from Nato partners and calls to dismantle the monarchy.

“I hope they now hear there are political voices in the UK standing up for them,” he added.

In his final days as prime minister, Justin Trudeau met King Charles at his Sandringham estate in Norfolk. After the meeting, a royal source said the king was “very conscious” of his global responsibility and unique diplomatic role, and is determined to put that to use. The king has recently expressed his “deepest affection” toward Canada, according to reports.

Davey said: “I hope we can find ways to deepen the contacts between the two countries because one of the things about good friends is you do need to be together, you do need to spend time together, you do need to remind yourself of that friendship and nurture it.

“There's always a danger that over time the strength of that relationship can ebb and flow, and I think if the Trump horror makes us do anything, it should make us remember who our friends and our dear allies are.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Allegations of crimes against humanity laid out against former Philippines president over his deadly ‘war on drugs'

Rodrigo Duterte has become the first Asian former leader to appear before the international criminal court, where he stands accused of committing crimes against humanity during his notorious “war on drugs” which is estimated to have killed as many as 30,000 people.

The ex-president of the Philippines, who was in office from 2016 to 2022, was arrested in Manila on an ICC warrant early on Tuesday, put on a government-chartered jet hours later, and arrived in The Hague the following day.

The 79-year-old politician was allowed to follow Friday's proceedings via video link from a detention centre after the presiding judge, Iulia Motoc, noted that he had endured “a long journey with considerable time difference”.

Appearing before the court shortly before 3pm local time, Duterte was informed of the crimes he is alleged to have committed, as well as his rights as a defendant. Sounding frail and wearing a blue suit and tie, he spoke briefly to confirm his name and date of birth.

Duterte's lawyer, Salvador Medialdea, told the court that his client had been “abducted from his country”, adding: “He was summarily transported to The Hague. To lawyers it's extrajudicial rendition. For less legal minds it's pure and simple kidnapping.”

Medialdea said Duterte would be unable to contribute to the proceedings because of what he termed his client's “debilitating medical issues”. But Motoc said the court doctor who had examined Duterte was of the opinion that he was “fully mentally aware and fit”.

The judge set a pre-trial hearing date of 23 September to establish whether the prosecution's evidence is strong enough to send the case to trial. If a trial does go ahead, it could take years, and if Duterte is convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

Duterte was arrested amid dramatic scenes three days ago. Despite threatening a police general with lawsuits, refusing to be fingerprinted and telling officers “you have to kill me to bring me to The Hague”, he eventually boarded the plane that arrived in the Netherlands on Wednesday.

As he landed in The Hague, the former leader was calm and appeared to accept responsibility for his actions, saying in a Facebook video: “I have been telling the police, the military, that it was my job and I am responsible.”

His arrest came amid a spectacular breakdown in relations between his family and the Marcos family, who had previously joined forces to run the Philippines.

The current president, Ferdinand Marcos, and the vice-president, Sara Duterte – who is Rodrigo's daughter – are at loggerheads, with the latter facing an impeachment trial over charges including an alleged assassination plot against Marcos.

Sara Duterte travelled to the Netherlands to support her father, whose arrest she has described as “oppression and persecution”. The Duterte family had sought an emergency injunction from the supreme court to stop his transfer.

Speaking to supporters and reporters outside the court on Friday morning, she said she was hoping to visit her father and to have the hearing moved. “We are praying and hoping that the court will grant our request to move the initial appearance just so that we can properly sit down with the former president and discuss the legal strategies since we haven't talked to him yet,” she told Agence France-Presse.

Duterte became president nine years ago after promising a merciless, bloody crackdown that would rid the country of drugs. On the campaign trail he once said there would be so many bodies dumped in Manila Bay that fish would grow fat from feeding on them. After taking office, he publicly stated he would kill suspected drug dealers, and urged the public to kill addicts.

Estimates of the death toll under his administration rule vary: the national police put the number at 6,000 people, while human rights groups claim the true figure is five times higher. Most of the victims were men in poor, urban areas who were gunned down in the streets.

Even as his tactics provoked international horror, he remained highly popular at home throughout his presidency. While his arrest has been celebrated by rights groups and the families of the victims of the “war on drugs”, it has also prompted some protests in his strongholds of Mindanao and the Visayas.

Duterte, who appeared before a senate inquiry into the drugs war killings last year, said he offered “no apologies, no excuses” for his policies, saying: “I did what I had to do, and whether you believe it or not, I did it for my country.”

Campaigners and victims of his crackdowns hope that Duterte's arrest will finally result in him facing justice for his alleged crimes.

Rachel Chhoa-Howard, Amnesty International's south-east Asia researcher, said Friday's hearing proved that no one was above the law.

“The very institution that former President Duterte mocked will now try him for murder as a crime against humanity,” she said. “This is a symbolic moment and a day of hope for families of victims and human rights defenders who have for years fought tirelessly for justice despite grave risks to their lives and safety.”

The ICC's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, has hailed Duterte's arrest as a key moment for victims and international justice as a whole.

“Many say that international law is not as strong as we want, and I agree with that. But as I also repeatedly emphasise, international law is not as weak as some may think,” Khan said. “When we come together … when we build partnerships, the rule of law can prevail.”

Israeli forces have used sexual violence as weapon to ‘dominate and destroy' Palestinian people, report also says

Israel's systemic attacks on women's healthcare in Gaza amount to “genocidal acts”, and Israeli security forces have used sexual violence as a weapon of war to “dominate and destroy the Palestinian people”, a UN report states.

The 49-page report on sexual and gender-based violence was drawn up by the UN's Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Including East Jerusalem, and presented to the UN human rights council.

It details attacks on maternity wards and other healthcare facilities for women, the destruction of an IVF clinic and controls on the entry of food and medical supplies into Gaza that together “destroyed in part the reproductive capacity of Palestinians in Gaza as a group”.

Israel's actions amounted to “two categories of genocidal acts in the Rome statute and the genocide convention, including deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the physical destruction of Palestinians and imposing measures intended to prevent births”, the human rights council said in a press release about the report.

The report found that Israel's security forces had made certain forms of sexual and gender-based violence part of “standard operating procedures”, including forced public stripping and nudity, sexual harassment including threats of rape, and sexual assault.

The “pattern of sexual violence” that Israeli forces used, including cases of rape and sexualised torture, constituted war crimes and crimes against humanity, the commission found.

“The frequency, prevalence and severity of sexual and gender-based crimes perpetrated across the Occupied Palestinian Territory leads the commission to conclude that sexual and gender-based violence is increasingly used as a method of war by Israel to destabilise, dominate, oppress and destroy the Palestinian people.”

Israel's civilian and military leadership provided “either explicit orders or implicit encouragement” to carry out sexual violence including rape and attacks on genitals, the UN investigators said.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the accusations in the report were baseless, and attacked the UN human rights council as biased against Israel.

A previous commission report investigated sexual and gender-based violence committed by Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups during the 7 October 2023 attacks, when about 1,200 people were killed, the majority of them civilians, and 250 taken hostage to Gaza.

The latest report documents a wide range of violations against Palestinian men, women and children across the occupied territories in the wake of that attack.

Repeated patterns in the abuse of Palestinian boys and men showed the violence was intended as collective punishment, to “humiliate and intimidate”, the report found. This included filming and photographing public stripping, nudity and sexualised abuse and torture, and sharing images online.

Most perpetrators of sexual and gender-based violence listed in the report were members of the armed forces or working in detention centres, but they also included Israeli settlers targeting Palestinians.

The chair of the commission that drew up the report, Navi Pillay, said Israel's failure to investigate or prosecute abuses created a culture of impunity.

Israel last month sentenced a soldier to seven months for severe assaults of Palestinian detainees, the first conviction for abuse in the detention system. Nine other soldiers were arrested last year over allegations of sexual abuse so violent it left a detainee in a critical condition, but they have not gone on trial.

Pillay said: “The exculpatory statements and actions by Israeli leaders and the lack of effectiveness shown by the military justice system to prosecute cases and convict perpetrators send a clear message to members of the Israeli security forces that they can continue committing such acts without fear of accountability.

“In this context, accountability through the international criminal court and national courts, through their domestic law or exercising universal jurisdiction, is essential if the rule of law is to be upheld and victims awarded justice.”

The ​UN's international court of justice ordered the Israeli government to ensure its forces did not commit acts of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza in January 2024.

Israel is party to the genocide convention, but not the Rome statute under which the international criminal court has jurisdiction to rule on individual criminal cases involving genocide.

The UN commission of inquiry also highlighted the “unprecedented scale” of female deaths in Gaza as another gendered aspect of the violence. Israeli attacks have killed more than 48,000 people in Gaza, 33% of them women and girls.

That is a higher proportion than during Israel's past wars in Gaza, caused by “an Israeli strategy of deliberately targeting residential buildings and using heavy explosives in densely populated areas”, the report said.

Egypt and Hamas officials on Thursday welcomed comments from Donald Trump that Palestinians would not be forced out of Gaza. “Nobody is expelling any Palestinians from Gaza,” the US president said after a White House meeting with the Irish prime minister, Micheál Martin.

Trump has repeatedly called for the US to take ownership of the strip and rebuild it as a “riviera” for the Middle East without its Palestinian residents, suggesting they should move to neighbouring countries including Egypt.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Whether the Meta boss and his ex-lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg are truly beyond awful is neither here nor there. I thought he was done with factchecking

I am as shocked as I am confused that Mark Zuckerberg is going all-out to block a memoir by Facebook's former director of global public policy, Sarah Wynn-Williams. I thought information wanted to be free? I definitely heard that speech should be. We know Meta's revolting oligarch doesn't write his self-serving public pronouncements, but he should at least make time in his busy Magafication schedule to read them.

Anyway, even if you think the stories in Careless People are untrue – and I don't, for a single nanosecond – I thought the Meta boss said disinformation wasn't a thing any more? He recently binned off all his factcheckers to “dramatically reduce the amount of censorship”. Yet here we are reading stories of how Meta this week launched an emergency action in the US to ban Wynn-Williams from promoting or further distributing copies of her book. It argued – successfully, for now – that it would face “immediate loss … in the absence of immediate relief”.

Honestly, Mark: TOUGHEN UP! It was only about 10 minutes ago that you were telling Joe Rogan that corporations needed more “masculine energy”. If something's wrong or dangerous or really seriously harmful, just let everyone keep seeing it – because, freedom – but pop a “community note” on it. As for how you put a community note on a book, my advice to you would be to go and stand outside Pan Macmillan, which bravely published Wynn-Williams, with a little sign saying “context”. Listen, if it's a good enough bulwark against the risk of genocide in some boring old developing-world backwater, then it should be good enough for you.

The grounds for Meta calling in emergency lawyers to block Wynn-Williams's book seem to be that she has gone against the terms of her severance. Luckily, none of us has a “non-disparagement clause” against Zuckerberg, who on this evidence and so much more should be disparaged every minute of every day in the countries where he operates, and even in the ones he doesn't. There's a lovely bit in the book where his company is said to be “dangling the possibility that it'll give the Chinese regime special access to users' data”.

In conversation, I overuse the phrase “the worst people in the world”, but the Facebook/Meta top brass really are up there. Wynn-Williams's book is that simultaneously satisfying yet horrifying thing – an insider account that shows you that absolutely every single one of the awful things you already suspected apparently really did go on behind closed doors. As did a few you didn't suspect. I knew Sheryl Sandberg's brand of “lean in” feminism was bullshit – but I didn't think it involved female employees being encouraged to lean into her lap/her bed on private planes.

Shortly after turning this offer down, Wynn-Williams nearly dies in childbirth. Once she's back at work, her male boss tells her she was insufficiently “responsive” during the period. “In my defence,” says Wynn-Williams, “I was in a coma for some of it.” For light relief, we meet a shadowy Zuckerberg aide who supposedly games his boss's own algorithm so his posts have mega-engagement. Mark's senior staff all let him win at Catan.

And that's just the office politics stuff. The hardcore business – what we might call the politics politics stuff – is so much worse. Meta is currently insisting Wynn-Williams was ultimately fired for “poor performance and toxic behaviour”. But it's amazing to think anyone at Meta could get fired for “toxic behaviour”. I'm sure whatever they've done didn't actively stoke a genocide, like the Rohingya claim that the firm's negligence did in Myanmar. I'm sure it couldn't be as bad as betraying vulnerable citizens in exchange for market penetration.

Quite early on in Wynn-Williams's 2011-2017 stint at Facebook, a US Treasury official tells the Facebook execs they're two years away from being hated as much as the investment banks. Well, that turned out to be adorably optimistic. I think we all love the cuddly old banks compared to companies such as Mark's or Elon's. But, of course, the tech firms are way, way too powerful to care.

Meanwhile, the world's children have simply been allowed to become hideously and destructively addicted to their products by politicians who either implicitly – or, as is often claimed in this book, explicitly – thank the companies for assisting their electoral success. We non-American outsiders bang on about US gun laws and how unspeakable it seems to us to raise children in a world of active shooter drills and school massacres. But all western countries and plenty beyond have failed to protect children from the known iniquities and poison of social media. Australia alone has just banned it for under-16s. I've no idea where Zuckerberg's children (the first born of whom he apparently asked Xi Jinping to name) go to school. But – like metaphorical crack dealers – many Silicon Valley bosses sent their kids to a specific local Steiner school where it's all crocheted textbooks and chalkboards and no one is stupid enough to let the little scions near the narcotising horrors of the product.

So on Meta sails. There are words and phrases for these supranational organised enterprises that harm societies and seemingly do whatever they like, and none of them is the nerdily bland “tech firm”. What was it that the Indians used to call the period of chaos and social instability wreaked by the East India Company, the rampaging entity/“honourable company” that I increasingly feel Meta is most redolent of? Ah yes: the anarchy. We live in a modern form of it now, thanks to Zuckerberg and others, and it's way past time we did more than simply scroll defeatedly on.

Russian leader's comments signal there will be difficult negotiations ahead that could frustrate President Donald Trump's hope for a swift peace deal.

Russian President Vladimir Putin refused Thursday to fully embrace a U.S. proposal for a ceasefire in the Ukraine war, saying there are “nuances” that require “painstaking research,” especially since Russian forces are advancing in the war.

President Donald Trump, speaking in the Oval Office after Putin's remarks, said the Russian leader “put out a very promising statement, but it was incomplete. And yeah, I'd love to meet with him or talk to him, but we have to get it over with fast.”

The Russian leader was due to meet Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff on Thursday evening to discuss the ceasefire proposal, which earlier one of Putin's top aides had dismissed as unworkable. Putin's comments allow Russia to engage in protracted negotiations without immediately rejecting a truce.

Putin, who thanked Trump for his efforts to resolve the conflict, said Russia would agree to a ceasefire, but only if it led to long-term peace, hinting that Russia wanted to place conditions on a ceasefire, such as barring Ukraine from receiving arms from the United States or mobilizing new forces. He also questioned how a ceasefire would be verified, indicating that complex negotiations would be required before he could endorse it.

“The idea in itself is the right one, and we certainly support it, but there are issues that we need to discuss,” Putin said. “We should talk to our U.S. colleagues, maybe in a call with President Trump.”

Trump said the United States had discussed territorial and other issues that could be in a final deal.

“So a lot of the details of a final agreement have actually been discussed,” he said. “Now we're going to see whether or not Russia's there. And if they're not, it'll be a very disappointing moment for the world.”

Putin's references to the complexity of reaching a ceasefire and the need for “painstaking research” would effectively delay the proposed immediate short-term ceasefire, allowing Russia to continue fighting as negotiations drag on. The remarks reflect his confidence in Russia's position in the war, and his belief that Western military support to Kyiv will most probably dwindle under the Trump administration, which recently  halted military aid and intelligence sharing temporarily.

Putin also talked about how Russian troops were advancing against the remaining Ukrainian forces in its southern Kursk region. “If we stop fighting for 30 days, what does that mean? That everyone who's there will get out without a fight?”

He said agreeing on the next steps to end the conflict will depend “on how the situation develops on the ground,” in a clear reference to Russia's ongoing military successes.

Putin on Wednesday sent a defiant military message with a rare appearance in a camouflage uniform to mark Russian advances against Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region. He urged his forces to fight on, evict Ukrainian forces from the Russian territory and drive forward to create a security zone on the border inside Ukraine.

Russian political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, called Putin's rejection of an unconditional ceasefire “an uncomfortable stance that risks angering Trump and hindering the otherwise promising prospects of normalizing bilateral relations.”

Putin's conditions for a ceasefire, including demands that the United States halt military supplies and that Kyiv not use the pause to strengthen its defenses, rearm or mobilize, are intended to secure Ukraine's capitulation, Stanovaya wrote on X.

But Putin's comments were softer than those of his aide Yuri Ushakov, who is on Russia's negotiating team in talks with the United States over the Ukraine war. Ushakov told the state broadcaster that he had outlined Moscow's opposition to a 30-day ceasefire to U.S. national security adviser Michael Waltz in a phone call.

“The proposed temporary ceasefire in Ukraine is nothing more than a reprieve for the Ukrainian military,” Ushakov said. “Russia seeks a long-term peace settlement on Ukraine that addresses Moscow's interests and concerns. Steps that mimic peaceful actions are of no use to anyone.”

Putin has repeatedly opposed calls for a short-term ceasefire. In January, at a meeting of Russia's Security Council, he said the goal of the settlement should be “not a short truce, not some kind of respite for regrouping forces and rearmament with the aim of subsequently continuing the conflict, but long-term peace.”

Trump envoy Witkoff arrived in Moscow on Thursday and was expected to meet with Putin to discuss the U.S. ceasefire proposal. Witkoff met Putin last month and negotiated a deal for the release of American schoolteacher Marc Fogel, setting the scene for the talks between Russia and the United States in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and Istanbul. At the time, Witkoff said Trump's friendship with Putin had enabled the negotiations and would continue to do so.

Putin's talk of lengthy discussions over the terms of a ceasefire would probably mean that fighting will continue, and hundreds or thousands more lives could be lost — a prospect at odds with Trump's stated desire for an end to the bloodshed.

It would also allow Russia to capture more territory and continue its slow advance in eastern Ukraine. It has been three years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who joined Putin at his briefing, said earlier that it would be difficult for Russia to agree to a ceasefire because it was advancing on the front line. “As Trump said, they hold high cards in their hands,” he said, adding that these could allow Russia to “start winning this card game. Then an agreement will be reached.”

Fighting continued in western Russia, where Ukraine's seven-month-old occupation of a sliver of territory in the Kursk region appeared to be nearing an end. Gen. Valery Gerasimov, chief of staff of the Russian armed forces, told Putin on Wednesday that the operation to evict enemy forces was in its final stages.

With the Russian Defense Ministry announcing Thursday the recapture of Sudzha — the largest town once under Ukrainian control — Moscow looks set to strip Kyiv of a territorial bargaining chip it had hoped to use in peace talks brokered by the Trump administration.

A Ukrainian drone commander who has been fighting in Kursk since August said his brigade was “gradually withdrawing.” He said troops are holding on to parts of Sudzha to give other units time to withdraw.

“We will try to hold them at the Ukrainian border,” said Andriy, who asked that his last name not be used because he was not authorized to speak with the media. “I think the Russians will try to advance further and enter Sumy region. This is what we are fighting against right now.”

Ukraine's army chief, Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, said Wednesday that combat operations were continuing in the Kursk region, even as the Russian offensive was pushing steadily forward. Syrsky said Russia had “almost completely destroyed” the town of Sudzha with aerial bombardment.

In the official video released Wednesday that the Kremlin said showed a uniformed Putin visiting a command point in the Kursk region, Putin ordered Gerasimov to drive Ukrainian forces from the region as quickly as possible and to “completely destroy the enemy.”

Putin's appearance in uniform is a signal of determination to complete the operation to liberate the Kursk region in the very near future,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian media. Many pro-war nationalist military bloggers also took it as a sign that the Russian leader would press ahead with the war.

“The previous status along the border must be restored,” Putin said in the video. Any captured prisoners should be treated as terrorists, he added, fueling concerns about Russian treatment of prisoners after widespread allegations of Ukrainian POWs being tortured by Russian forces.

Putin also said Russia must send forces into Ukraine to create a “security zone,” in a sign he intends to drive forward ahead of proposed peace talks. In the past, Putin has called for a security corridor on Ukrainian territory — not on Russian-occupied land — as a condition of any peace agreement.

Ukraine's August incursion and occupation of Russian territory shattered Putin's oft-stated red line that attacks on Russian territory are unacceptable, and Russia was forced to deploy North Korean troops to the region in an effort to win back the territory.

Gerasimov said Kyiv “aimed to create a so-called strategic foothold in the Kursk region to use it later as a bargaining chip in the potential talks with Russia.”

He added: “The plan of our enemy has failed.”

Russia's terms for a peace deal have so far remained sweeping and inflexible, including shutting Ukraine out of NATO, gaining recognition of Russia's land grab as legitimate, and demilitarizing Ukraine, leaving it with a small army incapable of deterring future attacks.

Russia's position so far appears to hew closely to the recommendations on negotiating tactics and approach by an influential Moscow-based think tank close to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), which set out Russia's maximalist demands for any end to the conflict in Ukraine.

Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, on Thursday once more spelled out Russia's maximalist conditions, in an indication that the peace negotiations will be difficult. He ruled out any chance of Russia ceding any of the land it has seized, insisting that it was Russian territory that could never be returned.

“Crimea, Sevastopol, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, Luhansk — these are regions of Russia. They are written into the constitution. This is a given fact,” he said.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Thursday also ruled out the presence of any foreign peacekeepers in Ukraine — a plan being mulled by European nations as a security guarantee for any future agreement.

“Russia does not accept the deployment of armed forces of other countries in Ukraine,” she said. “It would mean involvement in the conflict.” If this occurred, “Moscow will react with all means.”

A civilian search group found a gruesome site near Guadalajara, sparking outrage as authorities had raided the area months earlier but did not uncover the graves.

For months, the tips had been appearing on a Facebook page. There was a mass grave hidden in a rural village outside Guadalajara, in western Mexico, the messages said.

Mexico has grappled for years with a crisis of disappearances, with more than 110,000 people reported missing. Relatives of the disappeared have unearthed hundreds of graves filled with corpses. This seemed like another. But the people who ran the Facebook page — a group in Jalisco state who search for the missing — were puzzled. The grave was said to be in the village of La Estanzuela. But where, exactly?

After getting more anonymous tips, Indira Navarro, head of the group, and dozens of other victims' relatives arrived on March 5 at an abandoned ranch outside La Estanzuela and started poking around. They dug up three underground ovens. They found hundreds and hundreds of singed bone shards — from skulls, fingers, teeth. It was what Mexicans call an “extermination camp.”

But the image that's really stunned Mexicans was of the shoes. There were piles of them — well over 200.

“Of course, it immediately evokes the conditions at Auschwitz,” said José Ramón Cossío, the former chief justice of Mexico's Supreme Court, in an interview with the radio program Aristegui Noticias.

The discovery has shocked Mexicans, dominating news reports and prompting an outcry from citizens' groups, the Catholic Church and lawyers.

The country has been wracked by extreme violence since 2008, after the Mexican military — with U.S. backing — launched an offensive against criminal groups who had developed their own private armies. Several other extermination camps have been found in Mexico, and mass graves turn up nearly every week. But the site in Jalisco elicited a particular horror.

The camp is a sign of how much criminal groups have penetrated the Mexican economy. They don't just traffic drugs to the United States; they extort businesses, “tax” migrant smugglers, and run vast networks of contraband goods, from gasoline to wood.

Navarro's group believes the ranch in La Estanzuela was a recruiting and training center for one such crime group. The area is dominated by one of the country's largest cartels, Jalisco New Generation (CJNG).

Navarro's group — called the Searching Warriors of Jalisco — had been hearing since last year about young people who arrived at bus stations in the Guadalajara area, responding to online ads for jobs as security guards, electricians or farmers. Then they disappeared.

Since the discovery of the camp, several individuals have offered detailed accounts to Navarro and Mexican media of what happened there, speaking on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution. They said they arrived in the Guadalajara area expecting to meet their employers and were instead taken to the ranch and forced to undergo military-style training. Some people who failed or didn't follow orders were killed, and their bodies cut up in pieces, according to the accounts. Others died of dehydration or beatings. The recruits were forced to dig the holes, then build makeshift ovens out of bricks and stones, they said.

While many people at the camp were taken against their will, others had volunteered to work for the crime group, according to some of the accounts.

Criminal groups have become so big that they are major employers in Mexico. They need to continuously replenish their workforce, since their employees are killed or jailed. “Recruiting between 350 and 370 people per week [nationwide] is essential to avoid their collapse,” said a study by Mexican and Italian researchers published in 2023.

One reason the camp has caused such outrage is that authorities were already aware of it. The national guard raided the ranch last September, detaining 10 people, rescuing two kidnapped people and discovering one body wrapped in plastic, officials say.

Salvador González de los Santos, the state attorney general, said 10 government workers combed the site at the time, using a backhoe and dogs, but didn't find any other corpses. They “couldn't examine the entire ranch” because it was too big, he said.

The civilian searchers found the graves by inserting simple metal rods into the earth and smelling their tips to detect the stench of decomposing bodies.

“A civil-society collective, without any training in police techniques, was able to search the ranch better than the investigating experts,” wrote Sergio Sarmiento, a columnist for Reforma.

In recent days, authorities have identified six areas with underground graves at the site. It's not yet clear how many people were killed in total.

Civilian search groups have mushroomed around the country over the past 15 years, as the number of disappeared has exploded. In 2019, at the start of his term, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador vowed to intensify the search for the missing, which he characterized as a problem of prior governments. But after his own commissioner documented a growing pattern of disappearances during his term, she was forced to resign.

Navarro, head of the search group, has been looking for her brother for nine years. But she said the sight of the clothing, shoes and other items at the ranch in Jalisco shocked her. “Your skin crawls seeing everything thrown on the ground, seeing the suitcases, the dreams of these young people,” she told Radio Fórmula. “To see how they ended up there because they thought they could have a better life and better salary.”

European leaders are working to bolster the Ukrainian military and recruiting partners for a “coalition of the willing” to serve in a postwar Ukraine.

LONDON — European leaders, buoyed by progress in talks between Washington and Kyiv and enjoying praise from U.S. officials, are pushing for a larger role in President Donald Trump's drive to halt the war between Russia and Ukraine and discussing how their forces can help secure a post-conflict landscape.

French and British officials, initially sidelined in the U.S. effort, helped coax Washington and Kyiv back to talks after the relationship appeared to break down last month. Now they're working to bolster the Ukrainian military and recruiting partners for a “coalition of the willing” to back Ukraine, while continuing to seek a European say in U.S. discussions with Russia. All these will strengthen Kyiv's position in negotiations and deter Russia from breaching any deal, they say.

Revived U.S.-Ukrainian talks this week yielded a preliminary agreement on a 30-day ceasefire. Russia hasn't committed to it yet, and many here are skeptical that Moscow will deal in good faith. But it has led Washington to resume military and intelligence assistance to Kyiv — and has dramatically improved the tone between the two governments, whose ties had seemed in danger of rupturing entirely.

“The signs of Europe focusing on this are very real,” said Bronwen Maddox, director of the  think tank Chatham House. “It's been an impressive change.”

Now leaders are trying to build on the momentum. “This is the moment when Europe must pull its full weight for Ukraine, and for itself,” French President Emmanuel Macron told European and NATO military leaders in Paris on Tuesday. He beseeched them to accelerate planning.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is hosting a summit by video this weekend to discuss the still-undefined international force that would back any long-term truce.

Russia has opposed the deployment of NATO troops in Ukraine. “NATO countries are not neutral,” Sergei Markov, a hawkish Kremlin-connected analyst, told the BBC on Wednesday. NATO soldiers on Ukrainian territory would not be peacekeepers, he said, and “would be killed by Russian soldiers.”

Some European officials say their willingness to put boots on the ground sends a message to Russia and also to Trump, who is pushing Europe to do more for its own defense. Starmer's office says several countries have signaled they would contribute by providing soldiers, materials or both.

The idea of a European force in Ukraine backed by air and sea power has gained support, but it's certainly not unanimous. Italy, led by right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, has opposed sending soldiers. She has not decided whether to attend Starmer's video conference, Italian media reported.

Some countries have been reluctant to commit to greater military involvement without a better understanding of what U.S. backing they might expect. Trump has not ruled out a role for European troops but has said little about whether the United States would support them.

European officials describe U.S. political and logistical backing as vital amid questions about how a European force should respond if Russia breaks a deal or attacks the force itself.

London and Paris want to pool the capabilities of several countries for a force powerful enough to deter Russia from reigniting a full-blown conflict. Some European diplomats say a concrete plan would provide a means to negotiate with the Trump team on a possible “U.S. backstop.”

A peace deal could unfold in multiple phases, others have said, with more countries joining the coalition as plans advance. The proposed one-month ceasefire could be a first step.

It's time to “move from concept to plan,” Macron told military leaders, according to his office. The army chiefs of more than 30 European and NATO countries gathered in Paris without the United States on Tuesday to discuss Ukraine's postwar “security architecture.”

About 15 countries were ready to move ahead with planning, French Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu told reporters Wednesday. He did not name them. There was consensus, he said, that the first task was to shore up “the Ukrainian army itself, its capacity, equipment, training and format.” (Russia, in contrast, has called for demilitarization.)

Military planning would go well beyond a possible troop deployment, he said; it would also, for example, “urgently” address security in the Black Sea and of nuclear sites in Ukraine.

The talks have included a broad range of countries — Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, the Nordic and Baltic states. Some, such as NATO ally Turkey, have expressed openness to pooling resources.

On the diplomatic front, Europeans are hoping to build on what they see as a triumph of fence mending since Zelensky's disastrous Feb. 28 visit to the Oval Office.

Trump's abrupt tilt toward Moscow and his hostility to Zelensky in the early weeks of his presidency blindsided and sidelined European leaders. But they have since pushed on several fronts to assert more influence.

European leaders met in London days after the White House confrontation. Macron's proposals for a one-month ceasefire helped clear a pathway to the agreement between Washington and Kyiv on Tuesday. British officials have been coaching Zelensky on repairing the breach with Trump and embracing the approach.

European leaders and Zelensky say such a truce could serve as a test of Russia's interest in ending its war in Ukraine. At the least, the agreement appears to have shifted the narrative of the negotiations. Trump had called Zelensky a dictator and accused him of standing in the way of peace.

Now, European leaders have said repeatedly, “the ball is in Russia's court.”

The proposal has been presented at the talks as an American one, but some diplomats here quietly call it the “European plan” and hope it is a sign that Europe's struggles to sway Trump's peace process are beginning to bear fruit, at least for now.

A senior British official familiar with the efforts, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said London began a full-court press immediately after the Oval Office blowup. Jonathan Powell, Starmer's national security adviser, personally engaged the Ukrainians and discussed the text of a proposal to send to the Americans, this official said.

“We think it clearly led directly to the invitation for Zelensky to join the discussions in Jeddah [Saudi Arabia] that has led to some pretty swift progress in restoring aid and intelligence,” the official said,

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio singled out Britain and France as European powers he has worked with closely on the Trump administration's efforts to end the war in Ukraine.

“They've been very helpful, and, frankly, we've worked very closely with them on the prelude to this meeting and hopefully in the days to come,” Rubio said Tuesday during his flight to Saudi Arabia.

The former central bank chief takes over at what he has called “a time of great peril” for Canada, with Trump attacking its sovereignty and economic security.

TORONTO — Former central bank chief Mark Carney was sworn in as Canada's prime minister on Friday, taking over at what he has called “a time of great peril” as the country faces a trade war with the United States and annexation threats from President Donald Trump.

Carney won the Liberal leadership contest Sunday in a landslide. He is expected to call a snap election in the next 10 days to capitalize on his party's resurgence in a tight race with the Conservatives.

Carney has no political experience. He ascended to power in a Liberal Party leadership race that was organized after Justin Trudeau — facing the loss of his top lieutenant, a caucus revolt and cratering poll numbers — announced his intention to resign as party leader and prime minister on Jan. 6.

Since his victory on Sunday, Carney has met with Trudeau and several top officials, including the head of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canada's chief of the defense staff and the country's ambassador to the United States.

On Wednesday, he visited a steel factory in Hamilton, Ontario, as Canada slapped retaliatory tariffs on $20 billion worth of U.S. goods. The move came after Trump escalated a trade war by levying 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum. He has promised more tariffs on April 2.

Carney called the tariffs “unjustified” and said he supports the use of dollar-for-dollar retaliation. He said Wednesday that he would meet with Trump to discuss trade when there is “respect for Canadian sovereignty.”

“The Americans want our resources, our water, our land, our country,” he said in his victory speech on Sunday. “ … If they succeeded, they would destroy our way of life. … Canada never, ever will be part of America in any way, shape or form.”

Handling Trump — and defending Canada — will be at the top of his priorities.

Carney, a former Goldman Sachs banker and proponent of green investing, was the governor of the Bank of Canada during the global financial crisis and the head of the Bank of England during Britain's divorce from the European Union.

His experience navigating that upheaval is key to his pitch that he is the leader the country needs as it faces a generational crisis: A U.S. president taking a wrecking ball to the free-trade deal at the heart of U.S.-Canada ties and threatening to use “economic” force to annex its northern neighbor.

“The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First state,” Trump said in a social media post this week. “This would make all Tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear.”

Trump and his aides have offered myriad — and, at times, conflicting — justifications for the tariffs.

Few here believe they are about fentanyl, as he initially claimed. Less than 1 percent of fentanyl seized by U.S. border agents at the land border in the 2024 fiscal year was confiscated at or near the northern border.

“The only constant in this unjustifiable trade war seems to be President Trump's talks of annexing our country through economic coercion,” Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly said his week.

In a Feb. 3 call with Trudeau, the president said he had in front of him a document outlining a list of grievances with Canada, said a senior government official who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Trump mentioned previously uncontroversial treaties, the official said, including the 1908 treaty finalizing the U.S.-Canada border and a deal regulating flood control and hydroelectric power in the Columbia River, which flows from British Columbia to the Pacific Northwest.

In one call with Trudeau, Trump also asked if Canada was part of NORAD, the joint U.S.-Canada command created during the Cold War to defend the continent against Soviet aggression. When Trudeau replied that it was, the official said Trump moved on.

Canadian officials have said that their U.S. interlocutors say that even they don't know what Trump will ultimately do and that they have not been able to articulate to them what more they want Canada to do to end the trade war.

François Philippe-Champagne, Canada's industry minister, told reporters on Thursday that he believed a change in prime minister could offer an opportunity to “reset” U.S.-Canada ties.

Wilbur Ross, Trump's commerce secretary during his first term, agreed.

“[Carney] knows a lot more about the nuts and bolts of government finance probably than any elected official that Canada has ever had,” he told The Washington Post. “I think Carney's personality is well-suited to trying to negotiate a satisfactory resolution.”

Trudeau had sought to arrange one last call with Trump before the end of his time as prime minister, but the call did not materialize, a senior Canadian government official said.

A federal election must be held by the end of October, but Carney is expected to call one shortly.

At the start of the year, the Liberals trailed Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives by 20 points. Trudeau's resignation, coupled with Trump's return to the White House, have helped the Liberals nearly close that gap. Some polls show Canadians trust Carney more than Poilievre to handle Trump.

Poilievre provides a stark contrast to Carney. He is a lifelong politician and a populist with a combative, caustic style and a penchant for short, snappy slogans. Carney is a measured technocrat and political neophyte.

In his victory speech Sunday, Carney previewed his attacks on Poilievre, casting him as similar to Trump and “the type of lifelong politician … who worships at the altar of the free market despite never having made a payroll himself.”

“Donald Trump thinks he can weaken us with his plan to divide and conquer,” he said. “Pierre Poilievre's plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered. Because a person who worships at the altar of Donald Trump will kneel before him, not stand up to him.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Thousands have fled into Lebanon after tensions between Syria's Alawite minority and forces backing the new government exploded last week.

MASSOUDIEH, Lebanon — The Syrian man was carrying his disabled 7-year-old son on his shoulders as the family arrived at a mosque just inside Lebanon to find shelter, fleeing the sectarian violence that erupted late last week in Syria's coastal region.

The boy clung to his mother's hand while his brother, 10, cradled a bandaged arm.

“The bullet went in one side and straight out the other,” the man said Wednesday, not long after reaching Massoudieh, a village less than a mile from the Syrian border. “Monsters,” he said, referring to those whom he accused of executing members of his Alawite minority. He spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisals, like most others interviewed for this article.

Thousands of largely Alawite refugees have crossed into Lebanon over the past week after attacks on Syrian security forces by Alawite gunmen affiliated with the ousted regime of Bashar al-Assad triggered a surge of reprisals and sectarian bloodletting.

About 500 families have sought shelter in Massoudieh alone, according to local officials. Many of the refugees had waded across the Nahr el-Kabir river marking the border, hoisting their few possessions overhead.

The wave of killings in coastal Syria has posed the biggest test so far for the country's interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, whose forces overthrew Assad in December. He has accused “remnants of the former regime” of trying to drag Syria into renewed civil war and vowed to hold accountable those who have “overstepped the authority of the state.”

Sharaa has not named who was responsible for the violence. It remains unclear how much of the killing was carried out by government forces or loosely affiliated militias or Islamist extremists drawn to Syria during its 14-year civil war.

Syria has seen a proliferation of armed Sunni Muslim extremist groups that consider Alawites and some other minorities to be apostates, while many Syrians remain aggrieved by Alawites' support for Assad during his brutal rule. Sharaa, who was formerly affiliated with al-Qaeda, has yet to demonstrate that he is willing or able to control the gunmen who have targeted the Alawites.

Sharaa's pledge of accountability has done little to reassure the refugees.

“They say, ‘You are safe, don't worry,' and then they kill you,” said the man who had carried his son to Lebanon. “It's impossible to go back.”

He and his family fled their home in the coastal town of al-Sanobar on March 7 as masked gunmen approached, he recounted. Residents of a neighboring village had warned that executions had begun.

The family hid in a pine forest surrounding the town. His 10-year-old son was shot when gunmen opened fire into the trees. Local officials in al-Sanobar said they have documented 193 deaths in that town alone.

The fleeing family traveled 70 miles to Lebanon, walking and hitchhiking, avoiding security forces along the roads. “This is from all the walking,” the man said, pointing to the rubber sole peeling off his shoe. He said they are wearing the same clothes in which they fled.

Fadel Abdulghany, director of the Syrian Network for Human Rights, said armed groups loyal to the former Assad regime also had targeted civilians. He said these groups had taken control of neighborhoods and villages, and their snipers had targeted vehicles with license plates from Idlib — the governorate that Sharaa and his Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham movement had ruled before capturing the country.

The monitoring group said it has documented 803 deaths as of Wednesday, including 172 members of Syria's new police, military and other security forces. Members of the Assadist militias are not included in the count, which tallies only killings considered unlawful.

Many refugees in Massoudieh, a largely Alawite village, were reluctant to discuss the attacks by Alawite gunmen that set off clashes between Alawite militias and government forces, prompting a major deployment of security forces to the coast.

A couple from Dahlia, a village in Syria's Latakia province, where the clashes first erupted, said some people who had lived there were wanted by authorities. So the fighting that erupted was in “self-defense,” said the husband, sitting on the steps of a half-constructed house where his family is sheltering. Plastic film was taped over the unfinished windows to keep out the cold.

His 24-year-old wife was unabashed about her political stance. “We want Bashar al-Assad to come back,” she said of Syria's former president, whose image still adorns posters hung around her largely Alawite village.

Another man, sitting outside another half-built house, said he had no choice but to flee his village, Kartu, because his name was on a government wanted list of people suspected to be activists in Assad's Baath Party He dismissed the Alawite insurgency as “individual acts.”

Yet other refugees viewed the violence as an attempt at ethnic cleansing by Syria's new rulers.

“Why is this happening to us? It's because we are Alawites,” said a 24-year-old woman from the village of Tanita, where the Syrian government has said there were fierce clashes with armed groups.

She, her husband and their 5-year-old child share a small cinder-block structure erected in the yard of an old school with another family of 10. About 120 people are camped out in the school's classrooms and yard. Elsewhere in the village, private homes are teeming with refugees, and the local mosque is sleeping 305 families.

Lilian Hussein, 33, one of the few who was willing to be named, said government-aligned fighters who had been dispatched to the coast used the pretext that there were “remnants” of the regime to attack unarmed villagers. “We fled under gunfire,” she said. Her cousin was shot in the back, she said.

The pace of refugees crossing the river has slowed in recent days as the violence abates, according to smugglers who help families make the illegal crossing.

But refugees continued to arrive this week, scrambling from the Syrian side down the river's steep banks. Some led farm animals through the water. One woman, weak from exhaustion, had to be held up by relatives. A thick plume of smoke rose over Syria's Tartous province in the distance.

On Wednesday, many of the refugees were from Safita, about 10 miles from the border, and said they'd been unable to flee until now.

“There are a lot of armed men in our town. They didn't let people go in or out,” said a 45-year-old woman who crossed the knee-high waters with two relatives.

After civil war engulfed Syria following a popular uprising in 2011, Lebanon took in more than 1 million Syrian refugees. The vast majority of the refugees then were Sunni Muslims, who made up much of the movement against Assad. Today, the tides have shifted.

“We welcomed the earlier refugees, and we welcome these,” said Ali Alali, the mayor of Massoudieh. Outside his office, aid workers handed out mattresses and blankets to the newly arrived.

“People have seen their men, women and children slaughtered,” the mayor said. “After they were robbed of gold and money, they ask them, ‘What is your religion?'”

Some Syrians who fled said they had waited in hiding for days for the right moment to cross, fearing government patrols near the border.

“They shoot anybody that's not a Sunni,” a man from Safita said as he emerged from the river. “It's sectarian war.”

Pulling a train by the strength of your teeth is no easy task

CAIRO — Pulling a train by the strength of your teeth is no easy task. But for Egyptian wrestler Ashraf Mahrous, also known by his nickname Kabonga, it's just one of several things he can do to show off his astonishing strength.

Mahrous this week received formal recognition by the Guinness World Records in three categories, including the heaviest rail pull using only his teeth. His two other certificates are for the heaviest locomotive pull and for the fastest 100-meter road vehicle pull.

He says he pulled the two-ton locomotive in under 40 seconds.

On Thursday, crowds gathered at the Ramses train station in downtown Cairo to watch and cheer him on as he pulled a train — weighing 279 tons — with a rope held by his teeth for a distance of nearly 10 meters (33 feet).

He then repeated the feat, pulling the train with the strap around his shoulders to cheering spectators.

Mahrous, who is in his 40s and also is president of the Egyptian Federation for Professional Wrestlers, was previously recognized by the the international franchise for cracking and eating 11 raw eggs in 30 seconds in February 2024, and for pulling a 15,730-kilogram truck with his teeth in June 2021.

One of the organizers of Thursday's spectacle in the Egyptian capital, Dawlet Elnakeb, who runs a sports company, said Mahrous trained — but not very consistently — for just 20 days before the event.

Mahrous simply has “abnormal strength,” Elnakeb said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Follow:


            President Donald Trump rarely stops bragging about his “great relationship” with Vladimir Putin.
    


            A skeptical world will soon find out whether the supposed mind-meld counts for anything.
    


            The Russian president, author of an unprovoked and brutal invasion of Ukraine, responded in time-honored Moscow fashion Thursday to the US plan for an immediate ceasefire that the administration forced Kyiv into supporting. Putin produced a long set of obfuscations and new demands that would be unacceptable to Ukraine. But they may have been designed to tempt a US president who is desperate for the kind of win a truce would represent.
    


            Putin did not reject Trump's overture. He called it “great and correct” and said he supported it in principle. He was careful not to alienate a US president who has already offered a series of concessions to Russia before formal peace talks begin, including an understanding that Ukraine would never have a path to NATO membership.
    


            But Putin's objections and calls for further discussions, including with Trump, were an attempt to buy time, with his troops on the cusp of pushing Ukrainian forces out of Russia's Kursk region — one of the few bargaining chips Kyiv would have at future peace talks.
    


            Putin also raised questions about the monitoring  of any ceasefire, and whether Ukraine would be allowed to rearm during any cessation of fighting, in a way that suggested he was already seeking to shape any eventual agreement to ensure Russian dominance. Putin also referred to the need to tackle the “root causes” of the war. This is code for a number of Russian grievances that include the existence of a democratic government in Kyiv. It also refers to Moscow's claims that it is threatened by NATO expansion after the Cold War and to its desire to see alliance troops withdrawn from former communist states once in the Soviet Union's orbit, such as Poland and Romania.
    


            Russia's response is out of its classic diplomatic playbook, which typically seeks to suck interlocutors into exhausting negotiations that stack up delays and conditions that enable the Kremlin to pursue its strategic goals in the meantime.
    


            Thursday's events showed just how hard it will be for the Trump administration to move Russia away from its position and into serious negotiations on a ceasefire.
    


            Russia's stalling contrasted with Trump's rush for a valuable breakthrough as his trade policies set off stock market slumps and cast a cloud over the economy.  “I think we're going to be in very good shape to get it done. We want to get it over with,” Trump said at the Oval Office on Thursday, in an outburst of optimism that jarred with reality.
    


            Trump put the best spin on Putin's response, saying he'd issued a “very promising statement, but it wasn't complete.” He added: “Now we're going to see whether or not Russia's there. And if they're not, it will be a very disappointing moment for the world.” Trump's optimism was understandable as he seeks to build momentum for a fledgling diplomatic initiative. But his willingness to ignore a new set of onerous conditions from Putin made for a stark contrast with his fury when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky sat in the Oval Office and tried to explain why he wouldn't trust Russia's word in a peace deal without security guarantees.
    


            Retired Adm. James Stavridis said Thursday the Russian leader was staking out a careful line: “If you put it on a scale between ‘nyet,' ‘no,' and ‘da,' ‘yes,' he's right in the middle,” he told CNN's Jim Sciutto. Stavridis, a former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe, said the Russian president would take a couple of punches from Trump but would not stop pressing toward his own goals.
    


            Trump repeated Thursday his frequent refrain that there is ocean between the continental US and the largest land war in Europe since World War II. Those closer to the threat are far less optimistic about America's peace proposals. “I am pessimistic and skeptical about Russia's intentions and Russia's will to proceed with a just and sustainable peace,” Latvian Defense Minister Andris Sprūds told Isa Soares on CNN International. He said that Russia was using its typical “salami” tactics to reach its strategic goals, namely by slicing up its overarching political goals and dealing with them “piece by piece.”
    


            Should Trump forge a lasting, sustainable peace in Ukraine, he will deliver a great achievement that might be worth the Nobel Peace Prize that he reportedly craves. More importantly, thousands of lives — Ukrainians and Russians — will be saved. There may also be some truth to the frequent claim of administration officials that only this president has a chance to end the war. While President Joe Biden rallied the Western alliance effectively to provide Ukraine with arms, ammunition and financial aid that saved its independence, there was never a track for peace talks with Putin, who was ostracized after his invasion of Ukraine three years ago.
    


            Trump may also be tapping into fatigue among many Americans at the cost of that support, although his claim that the US has spent $350 billion is a wild exaggeration. And some analysts believe that the new administration is only stating the obvious — that Ukraine will be unable to liberate eastern regions captured by Russia and Crimea, annexed by Putin in 2014. Furthermore, there's agreement, even among European governments that have sided with Zelensky after Trump's bullying, that some kind of partition will be needed to end the war.
    


            But Trump's excessive deference to Putin in his first term and his early praise for the invasion of Ukraine, along with his longtime fascination with the Russian leader, raise doubt about his motives in his push to quickly end the war. Since taking office for a second time, the president has strong-armed Zelensky in a notorious Oval Office photo op and switched official American government sympathies from the victim of a vicious onslaught to its perpetrator, Putin. The president cut off vital US intelligence-sharing that helps Ukraine on the battlefield and to protect its civilians from waves of drone attacks. He also halted US military assistance to force Zelensky to accept his demand for an immediate ceasefire. US supplies and intelligence are flowing again, but the interruption sent a clear message to Zelensky that Trump could end the war on his terms if he wanted.
    


            But will any such pressure be brought to bear on Putin, now that he, unlike the Ukrainian leader, has spurned Trump's terms? After all, the US president has said for weeks that he was convinced that Putin wanted to stop the fighting. Thursday's response shows that, at least for now, the Kremlin wants to keep the war going.
    


            The president has this week threatened tariffs on Russian imports and banking sanctions that he said would devastate Moscow's finances — but after three years of efforts to cut Russia out of the global economy, business interactions between it and the United States are minimal. And Moscow has established channels, including through China, to support its wartime economy.
    


            Trump refused to say on Thursday what leverage he could bring to bear on Putin that might work. But it's been clear ever since the president took back the White House that he sees Ukraine as a stepping stone on the way to a restored superpower relationship with Russia. The president has, for example, called for Moscow's return to the Group of Seven. The rich-nations club was known as the G8 until Russia was kicked out after it snatched Crimea. He appears barely able to wait for the opportunity to hold a summit with Putin in person that would restore the Russian leader's place on the world stage. And Trump's expansionist rhetoric about folding Canada and Greenland into the US recall Putin's justifications for the invasion of Ukraine. So there could come a time when the incentives for a broader relationship with Washington convince Putin that it's time to shelve, probably temporarily, his obsession with Ukraine.
    


            In Trump's first term, there was rampant speculation about whether he was compromised by Russia; why Moscow intervened in the 2016 election to help him, as US intelligence agencies assessed; and why he admired Putin so much.
    


            The roots of Trump's obsessions remain unclear, though the allegations he's an asset of Moscow were never proven and still seem far-fetched.
    


            But in his second term, Trump has attacked longtime US allies and blamed Zelensky for the war instead of the Russian leader who started it.
    


            That's why traditional US foreign policy experts and governments worry about what the answer would be if Putin asked Trump to help oust Zelensky as a condition for a peace deal — especially since the US president has already suggested, falsely, that the Ukrainian leader who got caught up in his first impeachment was a dictator. And how would the president respond if the Russians called for him to withdraw NATO troops in Eastern Europe to address what Putin falsely calls “the root causes” of the Ukrainian conflict?
    


            The question is whether Trump is negotiating with Putin or whether the Russian leader is manipulating him.

When Congress pushed ahead last year with adding 10 new daily flights to Washington D.C.'s Reagan National Airport, the Federal Aviation Administration had data showing an unnerving number of near misses in the already-crowded skies — something lawmakers apparently did not know.



The FAA, which manages the nation's airspace and oversees aviation safety, had data on dozens of incidents that experts said documented a safety concern. That data didn't prompt any action before January's deadly midair collision between an American Airlines jetliner and a military helicopter that killed 67 people.

“Why someone was not paying attention to those numbers and those events are questions yet to be answered,” said James Hall, a former National Transportation Safety Board chair during the Clinton administration. “What not to do is to ignore that many incidents.”



Data collected by the FAA shows close calls were far more frequent than travelers and outside aviation experts knew at Reagan National, which was built to handle 15 million passengers a year, not the 25 million traveling through it annually. 



Now, safety experts and family members who lost loved ones in the Jan. 29 crash are asking why action wasn't taken earlier.



The NTSB said airplane pilots were alerted to take evasive action to avoid hitting helicopters at least once a month from 2011 through 2024, citing data compiled by the FAA, and that there were 85 near misses when aircraft were within a few hundred feet (meters) of each other during recent years. 






“How does that happen in this day and age and somebody doesn't do something about it?” asked Doug Lane, whose wife, Christine Conrad Lane, and their 16-year-old son, Spencer, died in the crash. 



Pilots have long worried about the congested and complex airspace around Reagan National, near the heart of the capital, where flights must maneuver around military aircraft and restricted areas. It was no secret there had been previous close calls, but the numbers found by the NTSB were alarming. 



FAA officials have not yet addressed who inside the agency saw the data and whether it prompted discussions about possible changes. Messages seeking comment were not immediately returned Thursday.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)





Current NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who oversees the FAA, both said they were angry that the number of close calls were not recognized earlier by the FAA.



“If someone was paying attention, someone was on the job, they would have seen this,” Duffy said. He also announced he will move forward with banning some helicopter flights around the airport, a move that was temporarily made after the crash. 



Safety advocate Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general of the U.S. Transportation Department, said that while there was plenty of blame to go around for the midair collision, the FAA was shockingly complacent.



“They literally wait for a disaster,” she said. ”I can't even fathom how the families of those lost in this crash can even deal with this. I mean this would be so maddening to hear.”



In Kansas, some officials also argue the FAA's data should have been readily accessible to the public. State Rep. John Carmichael, from Wichita, where the airliner's flight started, said Thursday that it's not enough for people to get data through Freedom of Information Act requests when that can take months.



“The public absolutely needs to know about statistics like that because we all put our lives in the hands of pilots and air traffic controllers every time we get on a plane,” said Kris Kobach, the state's attorney general. “I'm hopeful that the Trump administration will make this kind of information available to the traveling public.”



Commercial passenger airlines are authorized to make a total of 864 landings and departures from Reagan National from 6 a.m. to midnight each day, or 48 an hour, according to the airport's website. Of those, 64 have been added by Congress since 2000. Local airport authorities have objected to the increases. 



The crowded airspace around Washington drew attention last year when Congress debated an aviation safety bill that allowed 10 more flights a day at Reagan National, despite strong objections from Virginia's Democratic senators, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner.



Squeezing in more flights would only increase the risks, they warned, calling a near miss between two planes on a runway last April a “flashing red warning light.”



While Congress did OK the extra flights, they had not started as of the deadly January collision.



Kaine told reporters Thursday he was troubled by the number of near misses and the lack of action by the FAA. “What were they doing with the information if they weren't making the changes that needed to be made?” he said.



The FAA limits arrival and departure slots at three of the nation's busiest airports where demand exceeds the airport's capacity: Reagan National and New York City's LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International airports. 



But Congress has a history of directing the FAA to add slots at Reagan, even though Washington's other international airport, Dulles, has capacity to handle them. Reagan is closer to the capital and most federal departments and therefore more convenient, particularly for lawmakers. 



Mike McCormick, coordinator of the Air Traffic Management program at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said the congestion at Reagan National clearly contributed to the midair collision because the American Airlines jetliner, which was on a newly added route from Wichita, Kansas, was diverted to a different runway closer to the helicopter flights.



“In this instance, the sole reason for doing it was because they were too busy,” McCormick said. “This is something that controller has probably done thousands of times.”



The flight from Wichita to Washington began operating in early 2024, the first direct flight from Kansas' largest city to Reagan National. It was not among the 10 added last year, but announced by American Airlines and Kansas Republican Sen. Jerry Moran separate of any congressional action in July 2023. Moran said it was “vital” to link the nation's capital with the city, which has a long history as an aircraft manufacturing hub. 



U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Kansas Democrat who serves on an aviation subcommittee, said the cause of the accident and the congestion at Reagan National are for now, “two different conversations.” 



“I understand, the desire for us all to be able to connect these dots,” she said. “Right now that is not a connection that has been made by the NTSB.”

U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose 200% tariffs on alcohol from Europe would serve a major blow to drinks makers on the continent, but it could have one unlikely beneficiary — the struggling beer industry.

President Trump said Thursday that he may target wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages from France and other European nations after the European Union moved to reinstate an import tax on American whiskey in response to earlier Trump tariffs.

Such a levy, if enacted, could ""literally wipe out"" all global profits for some European drinks producers, Trevor Stirling, managing director and European beverages analyst at Bernstein, said Friday.

""If you take it at face value, for some of the producers, it could literally wipe out all of their global profits,"" Stirling told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""

French spirits maker Rémy Cointreau — which derives around one-third of its global sales from the U.S., would likely be among the worst affected — Stirling said, noting that markets were currently failing to fully price in the impact of the proposed tax.

Wine and spirits firms Pernod Ricard, Rémy Cointreau and Davide Campari all fell more than 3% Thursday, following Trump's comments, with the latter two slipping again during Friday's session. LVMH, which owns Moët & Chandon and Hennessy among others, briefly turned positive Friday before slipping back in the red following nine negative sessions.

""Investors are perhaps being a little bit too blasé about the potential that there is a real risk it could be a 200% tariff,"" Stirling said, acknowledging that the rate was unusually high relative to those leveled against other countries and sectors. ""One has learned never to underestimate the Trump administration.""

The levies form part of Trump's broader vision to relocate global production to the U.S. — a strategy many analysts have questioned, particularly within the production-specific drinks and luxury sectors.

""Provenance matters when selling premium spirits and wine — cognac has to be from Cognac, champagne from Champagne etc. As a result, it is not a category that the Trump administration will encourage onshoring with,"" Chris Beckett, head of equity research at Quilter Cheviot, wrote in a note Thursday.

Nevertheless, the proposals could provide a boon for the already highly localized beer industry, which has been under pressure over recent quarters amid declining sales and shifting consumer habits.

""Beer is just not in the crosshairs of this. Beer looks like an island of stability right now,"" Stirling told ""Squawk Box Europe.""

AB InBev, the world's largest brewer, which owns brands including Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois, told CNBC last month that it sees limited impact from tariffs given its high levels of domestic production.

""We don't think that we're going to have big topics to discuss during this year in terms of tariffs,"" CEO Michel Doukeris said.

Heineken CEO Dolf van den Brink, meanwhile, in February described proposed U.S. tariffs, including on aluminum used in beer cans, to be ""relatively manageable.""

""The beer industry is capital intensive and it's very local. So, as such, it's an industry that's a bit less susceptible to disruption in international trade flows,"" he told ""Squawk Box Europe"" last month.

Marc Filippino, Alec Russell and John Reed

PublishedMarch 14 2025

Your guide to what the 2024 US election means for Washington and the world

This is an audio transcript of the FT News Briefing podcast episode: ‘Modi's tariff tap dance with Trump'

Marc FilippinoGood morning from the Financial Times. Today is Friday, March 14th, and this is your FT News Briefing.

Intel had a rare bit of good news, and Russia is playing hardball over a potential ceasefire with Ukraine. Plus, India and the US are strong trading partners, but will tariffs get in the way of all that?

I'm Marc Filippino and here's the news you need to start your day.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Vladimir Putin has set some tough conditions for a ceasefire in Ukraine. But the Russian president technically supports the idea of the 30-day pause in fighting that the US proposed this week. So what does this current moment look like for Ukraine? The FT's foreign editor, Alec Russell, is just back from a visit to the country, and he joins me now. Hey, Alec!

Alec RussellMarc, hi! Very good to be back with you.

Marc FilippinoSo do me a favour, can you just describe the mood in Ukraine? How tired are people of this war?

Alec RussellThey are immensely tired of this war, Marc. It has been going on full tilt effectively for three years and they are bone tired. I mean, take Kyiv — the capital, for example — every night some drones come over and explode over Kyiv and possibly a ballistic missile. And I spoke to one soldier in Kyiv the other day, and he said, it is very strange, we've reached a situation where now people are so relaxed about these missiles that they sort of say, oh, that sounds like it was a ballistic missile just in the next-door neighbourhood, but I don't think it was a very big one. And they joke about it. So obviously that's great that they're sort of come into terms, but it's miserable, miserable, miserable in Ukraine right now.

Marc FilippinoYeah. Tough conditions that they've desensitised themselves to. Does that mean that they're willing to accept a deal on Russia's terms? And what would those terms be?

Alec RussellAbsolutely they are not willing to accept a deal on Russia's terms. Russia's terms haven't changed since Putin launched the full-scale invasion in February 2022. He wants Ukraine to effectively be a neutered state. He doesn't want it to have close links to the west, he wants it to be in the shadow of Moscow. And Ukrainians, however exhausted they are by this war and demoralised, they feel why, after all we've been through, should we effectively capitulate. And also they have at the back of their mind that actually this is a very slow progress for Russia in this war. And so they feel that maybe they're just gonna have to keep going.

Marc FilippinoYeah. But on the flip side of that, Alec, Ukraine has lost confidence in a wavering major ally in the United States. What does Ukraine do if it has to keep fighting with or without American help?

Alec RussellSo it faces three massive problems if America pulls the plug on its aid permanently. It loses American intelligence, it loses air defence systems — which have been protecting Ukraine's major cities, and then the third thing they worry about losing is the Starlink satellite system — which has been essential for battlefield communications.

Now that said, Ukrainians, they point to two things: they say that they have built up in the last year or so an extraordinary drone manufacturing industry. And this is immensely important because the war has become increasingly a war of drones and robotic vehicles. And then they point to Europe and they say, if, if, if Europe can deliver on what it promises to deliver, then maybe they can just about hull Russia off.

Marc FilippinoOK, so, Alec, where does Ukraine go from here? We have the US ceasefire plan on the table, what's next?

Alec RussellWell, this is now . . . It's a very, very interesting time. Even though Ukraine would not accept a ceasefire — let alone a full-term settlement on Russia's terms — absolutely, just about everyone in Ukraine wants this war to end — as long as it ends, as they say, fairly and justly. And I think that privately, increasingly, most Ukrainians would accept that much of the territory that Russian forces have taken control of in the last three years is lost to them. 

And what is essential to them, though, is not the regaining of that territory so much as some form of a security guarantee from the west that ensures that Putin's not gonna come back for more. And I struggle to see how Putin's going to agree to that.

Marc FilippinoAlec Russell is the FT's foreign editor. Thanks, Alec.

Alec RussellThank you. Marc.

Marc FilippinoIntel had a good day yesterday, and that hasn't happened a lot lately. The US chipmaker's share price soared by as much as 15 per cent. The FT reported on Wednesday that Intel has appointed a new top boss to take over the hot seat. Lip-Bu Tan will take over as CEO — he's the former head of the software group Cadence. Tan is replacing Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted by the board in December. And oooh boy, does Tan have his work cut out for him?

You see, Intel is the only US company that can theoretically make super high-end chips. Most other companies are in Taiwan, which leaves those supply chains pretty exposed if tensions ratchet up with China. But Intel hasn't been able to capitalise on its position, and in fact, it's haemorrhaged billions of dollars lately. To put this all into perspective, its share price is down a whopping 45 per cent over the past year.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

India is a tough market for foreign competitors to enter. It has protected its home-grown industry since independence in 1947, and it has some of the highest tariff barriers in the world. But could all this be about to change under the Trump presidency?

Donald Trump voice clipYou can't even sell anything into India, it's almost restrictive — it is restrictive. You know, we do very little business inside. They've agreed, by the way, they want to cut their tariffs way down now.

Marc FilippinoThat was Donald Trump speaking a few days ago at the White House. I'm joined by the FT's John Reed in New Delhi. Hey, John.

John ReedHi, Marc.

Marc FilippinoSo can you just give us a picture of the current trading relationship between the US and India? How important is it to each side?

John ReedSo the US is India's largest trading partner by a small margin, roughly on a par with China. From the US point of view, it's a less important trading partner. If you look at the rank of large economies with which the US runs a trade deficit, I think it ranks number 10. But as you pointed out in your intro, it has some of the highest tariffs in the world. And so this puts India firmly in Trump's sights.

Marc FilippinoNow we heard that clip of Trump earlier, is it right what he said that India has agreed to slash its tariffs?

John ReedNot that according to latest information we have, which is that a negotiation is underway, perhaps well underway. The two countries have set a deadline of getting the first tranche of a bilateral trade agreement done by September. I will add with a proverbial gun to India's head. I think this is something that the Trump administration was demanding. That said, talks are well underway and there have been various leaks coming from both camps that indicate they are talking about substantive issues.

Marc FilippinoHow is the Indian government handling trade issues with the US compared, say, with how it's handled talks with other countries?

John ReedThat's a really good question. I find it fascinating to observe the language that India uses. Delhi has traditionally been a very tough negotiator on other trade talks, including the Free Trade Association talks, which are ongoing with the UK and the FTA agreement that was concluded with EFTA — that's the European Free Trade Association last year. In both of these negotiations, India was very tough, even rambunctious, demanding better access for its goods than it was going to give access to its own market.

When you see how Modi conducted himself in Washington last month, he was very and I don't know what the word is very complacent. Very different power dynamic. He sort of had his shoulders hunched, almost. There was a recognition that the US is India's most powerful diplomatic partner, an increasing defence supplier and that it had to conduct itself rather differently with Washington than it has done in past trade talks.

Marc FilippinoJohn, one last question. What could a potential realignment on the tariffs mean for Indian businesses?

John ReedI think we don't know yet, it depends on what they agree. Obviously, agriculture is the most sensitive area. India is one of the biggest farming countries and indeed food producers in the world. It's a very protected market. That's where some of the highest tariffs are.

If India were to be pressured by Washington successfully to open up to more imports of foodstuffs like US rice or wheat, this would be a really big deal and a shock to the sector. And again, farmers have traditionally been a very sort of intransigent lobby group in India, which is why I'm doubtful this will happen. And again, the Trump administration has been a sort of very volatile actor. So I think it's very hard to predict from either side how this whole thing will land.

Marc FilippinoJohn Reed is the FT's south Asia bureau chief. Thanks, John.

Oops, something went wrong

Count Rubrik (RBRK) as another software play not seeing a slowdown in business at the hands of March's market volatility.

""We see continued strong demand,"" Rubrik co-founder and CEO Bipul Sinha told me on Yahoo Finance on Friday. Sinha's comments echo those of Docusign CEO Allan Thygesen to Yahoo Finance earlier this morning.

Sinha added, ""We are confident in delivering on our full-year goals.""

Shares of the cybersecurity firm priced its April 2024 IPO at $32, above the high end of their expected range. The stock opened for trading at $38.60.

The upsized IPO hauled in $752 million for Rubrik's expansion plans, initially valuing the company at $5.6 billion.

The stock now trades at $69, and the company sports a market cap of $13 billion after a 25% post-earnings pop today.

Rubrik's fourth quarter showed a cybersecurity play getting a larger chunk of spend from tech departments seeking to protect data in the age of AI. The company grew sales at a hearty pace and cut its losses significantly versus the prior year.

""Overall, this was another massive quarter for the Rubrik growth story, which we believe is still in the early innings with the market for cyber resilience estimated to hit $53 billion by 2027,"" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said.

Ives reiterated an Outperform rating on the stock.

Fourth quarter net sales: +47% year over year to $258.1 million vs. estimates for $233 million

Subscription annual recurring revenue: +39% to $1.09 billion vs. estimates for $106 billion

Diluted earnings per share: Loss per share of $0.18 vs. a loss of $1.52 a year ago vs. estimates for a loss of $0.39

First quarter:

Sales: $259 million to $261 million vs. estimates for $243.3 million

Diluted earnings per share: Loss of $0.31 to $0.33 vs. estimates for a $0.50 loss

Full year:

Sales: $1.145 billion to $1.16 billion vs. estimates for $3.15 billion vs. estimates for $1.11 billion

Diluted earnings per share: Loss of $1.13 to $1.23 vs. estimates for a $1.25 loss

Rubrik had 2,246 customers with subscription annual recurring revenue of $100,000 or more, up 29% year over year.

Oops, something went wrong

Docusign's (DOCU) business remains brisk despite a bruised stock market and rising concerns of an economic growth slowdown in the US.

CEO Allan Thygesen said on Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief on Friday that demand trends in February remained solid.

""As I looked at our February numbers, for example, our transaction volumes were pretty much on target with what we had expected — not seeing any major impact there,"" Thygesen said. ""So at this point, we haven't seen any impact of the recent volatility.""

Docusign reported on Thursday evening that fourth quarter earnings came in better than expected as more customers adopted its AI agreement technology. The momentum in the business appears to have legs as the company's billings guidance surprised Wall Street estimates to the upside.

Shares of the software play rose more than 16% in Friday morning trading. The stock was the No. 1 trending ticker on Yahoo Finance.

""We maintain our positive view as we see potential for continued international expansion, IAM [intelligent agreements] optionality in FY26, and operating leverage in future years,"" Citi analyst Tyler Radke wrote.

Radke reiterated a Buy rating on Docusign's stock.

Fourth quarter net sales: +9% year over year to $776.3 million, vs. estimates for $761.5 million

Billings: +11%% year over year to $923.2 million, vs. estimates for $863.8 million

Diluted earnings per share: +13.2% year over year to $0.86, vs. estimates for $0.85

First quarter:

Sales: $745 million to $749 million vs. estimates for $757.2 million

Billings: $741 million to $751 million vs. estimates for $744.2 million

Full year:

Sales: $3.13 billion to $3.14 billion vs. estimates for $3.15 billion

Billings: $3.3 billion to $3.35 million vs. estimates for $3.22 billion

Gross profit margins dropped to 82.2% from 82.6% in 2024.

Docusign repurchased $683.5 million in stock versus $145.5 million in the same period last year.

It reported a strong $1.1 billion in cash.

Gold made the sprint to $3,000 on Friday as uncertainties about the economy and an escalating trade war drove up demand for the safe-haven asset.

Gold (GC=F) futures rose to hover above $3,008 per ounce while spot gold reached above $3,001.

The precious metal was on track for a second straight week of gains amid new data indicating moderating inflation and the announcement of retaliatory tariffs from the United States' trading partners.

""Though it feels like a psychological threshold, gold at $3,000 might just be a stepping stone if trade wars deepen,"" said Tony Redondo, founder of Cosmos Currency Exchange. ""That said, it's not all about Trump. Central banks, interest rate bets, geopolitical tensions, and inflation concerns are all stoking the flames.""

Trade tensions grew this week after President Trump threatened 200% tariffs on wine and spirit imports from Europe on Thursday. The threat followed the EU's announcement of retaliatory tariffs after the US put a 25% duty on steel and aluminum.

Gold is up more than 12% year to date after making multiple record highs in recent months.

""All eyes are on how gold continues to play a role as a safe haven asset,"" said Joe Cavatoni, market strategist at the World Gold Council. ""With rising inflation expectations, lower rates, and continued uncertainty, we continue to see support for gold looking ahead.”

Wall Street has been playing catch-up by raising price targets to keep pace with gold's rise.

In a note on Thursday, Macquarie Group predicted the precious metal will touch $3,500 in the third quarter.

""Year-to-date, gold has been running ahead of our expectations,"" wrote Marcus Garvey, head of commodities strategy at Macquarie.

""We are raising our gold price forecast to a 3Q25 quarter average peak of $3,150 per ounce and our single point price high to $3,500 per ounce,"" he added.

Wall Street strategists have attributed much of these gains to continued central bank buying and tariff uncertainty, including the possibility that even imports of the precious metal into the US won't be spared.

Institutional investors have shipped elevated amounts of physical gold bars to vaults in New York in a move to front-run tariffs and take advantage of a price disparity between London and New York.

Republican Sen. Ted Cruz supports President Trump's use of tariffs, just not for the long term.

""I fully support the president using the threat of tariffs to incentivize Mexico and Canada to help secure the border. Now that being said, my home state of Texas does an enormous amount of trade with Mexico and Canada. I don't want to see the long-term economic policy being big tariffs against Mexico and Canada,"" Cruz told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).

""And so my hope is that those policies stay as an incentive rather than an ongoing feature of economic policy.""

The president has paused 25% duties on Canadian and Mexican imports that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement (USMCA). But Trump on Wednesday hit Canada with 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, backing off a floated 50% duty.

On Thursday, Trump said that if the European Union didn't remove a 50% tariff on whiskey, the US would place a 200% tariff on wine, champagne, and other alcoholic products.

Trump has implemented a second round of 10% duties on Chinese imports after instituting 10% in February.

The targeted countries wasted no time hitting back.

China unveiled a 15% tariff on US chicken, wheat, corn, and cotton products and an additional 10% tariff on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, seafood, fruits, vegetables and dairy products. The new tariffs from China began on Monday.

Canada announced a 25% tariff on 30 billion Canadian dollars of US imports.

As for Cruz, there is a lot at risk for his home state of Texas after brisk 3.9% GDP growth in 2024.

Mexico has been Texas's biggest trade partner for the past 16 years. Texas's top imports from Mexico include electric machinery, sound and TV equipment, various fuels, and medical and surgical equipment.

Texas houses about one-third of US refining capacity and refines crude oil imported from Canada and Mexico.

Businesses in the state may already be wary of the tariff pinch.

The latest Dallas Fed survey for February saw its production index — a barometer of state manufacturing conditions — plunge 21 points from January. The new orders index fell 11 points and the capacity utilization index declined 14 points.

Perceptions of broader business conditions worsened in February too.

""It's clear in the next four years, we will see more tariffs than we had the previous four years,"" Cruz said. ""What I've urged him [the president] is two things. No. 1, focus on China. I have said for a long time that China poses the greatest geopolitical risk to the United States over the next hundred years. And so I want to see our economy delink from China.""

""And then secondly, what I've urged the president to do is focus on reciprocity,"" he explained. ""And the virtue of reciprocity is if President Trump imposes tariffs on a foreign country and the foreign country doesn't like those tariffs, they already have a solution to that, which is lower the tariffs they're putting on US goods.""

 

Investors have reacted harshly this month to the flurry of tariff headlines.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 1.4% on Thursday, the 10th daily decline this year with a loss above 1% according to data from Creative Planning chief markets strategist Charlie Bilello. Last year, at this point, the S&P 500 had only three big down days, which Bilello said was ""abnormally"" low.

The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) are each down by about 5% in March.

Some of the market's often most popular stocks, such as Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and Palantir (PLTR), have seen pullbacks of more than 10% from their 52-week highs.

Wall Street recession calls have begun to creep into the picture too.

""Well, look, there's no doubt there has been some uncertainty,"" Cruz said. ""When I talk to business leaders, the most consistent question I get from them is what's going to happen on the tariff front? So I understand that uncertainty, and I think it'll take some time to have a clearer picture of what the exact tariff landscape is going to look like.""

The chart of the day

What we're watching

What we're reading

Economic data releases and earnings

The stock market is used to the wait-and-see approach from the Fed. But now the president is riffing on that game plan too.

Their deliveries contrast sharply. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is explicit. We can wait and are in a position to do so. And as the outlook evolves and the tariff landscape takes shape, the central bank can take action with its powder dry.

Trump is opaque. When a sympathetic business journalist recently asked him to offer clarity to the market, he scoffed. The stock market's tanking? So what. Another day, another tariff. But the similarities between the two leaders come in the form of detachment from Wall Street panic and a longer-term view.

Trump isn't exactly known for his patience. But on the issue of levies, he's been both unyielding in thought and transactional in practice. Mexico and Canada received some reprieve, but Europe is under new threats. And the dizzying back-and-forth has created a conceptual traffic jam of economic paralysis that has reverberated through consumer sentiment.

Trump is daring heads of state to respond, Powell is waiting for Trump to make up his mind and data to change, and Wall Street is looking for the White House and the Fed to get off the fence.

If Trump's distinctive tariff policy is a time bomb, the explosion of them taking effect isn't the only dangerous part. It's the ticking, the randomness of the timer, the affliction caused by the endless anticipation. Businesses may dislike tariffs. But what they really hate is uncertainty.

Meanwhile, the Fed has to make sense of fluctuating pricing pressures.

On Thursday, new inflation data showed price increases slowed in February — but economists saw warning signs that the central bank may interpret as reasons to continue waiting.

""Thursday's inflation data is backward looking, and the real worry is the inflationary effects that may come from tariffs, which is a wildcard for markets and the Federal Reserve,"" said Paul Stanley, chief investment officer at Granite Bay Wealth Management. ""It's too early to tell what tariffs mean for inflation because we don't know yet the extent of the tariffs or if the administration will end up reversing course and adopting a more dovish tariff policy.""

But if tariff clarity is delayed indefinitely, it's hard to imagine rate cuts not sharing that itinerary.

The waiting game has other ripple effects. As this newsletter has discussed this week, Wall Street is struggling to calibrate the timing of Trump's pronouncements with their potential longer-term consequences. What triggers a stock market sell-off today might actually boost corporate profits later this year. That's a favorable way of viewing Trump's America First strategy.

“If the Fed makes monetary policy decisions based on policies enacted today, they could make substantial cuts to interest rates in 2025,"" said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank. ""On the other hand, if they assume that the overall fiscal stance will be more supportive of growth after factoring in decisions likely to be made later in the year, they may reduce rates only a little, if at all, in 2025.""

Investors are used to the Fed's approach — and its straightforward dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment. But they are still coming to grips with Trump's agenda. And as hard as it is to accept the sequencing of pain first and pleasure later, it's still not a guarantee.

So far, the only sure thing is discomfort for today and uncertainty for tomorrow.

Two recent readings on inflation showed price increases decelerated in February — but within the details, economists see warning signs.

Thursday's report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that its ""core"" Producer Price Index (PPI) — which tracks the price changes companies see and excludes food and energy — rose 3.4% from the year prior, down from the 3.6% seen in January. The day before, the bureau's Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed core prices rose 3.1% in February, the lowest yearly increase in core CPI since April 2021.

But the components from CPI and PPI that pass through to the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure — the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index — indicate the closely followed inflation metric didn't fall in February.

Bank of America economists and several other Wall Street research teams now estimate that ""core"" PCE, which excludes food and energy, will show prices increased 2.7% in February, up from the 2.6% increase seen in January.

""This would indicate progress on inflation continues to stall and reinforces our call for the Fed to remain on hold,"" Bank of America US economist Stephen Juneau wrote in a note to clients.

The readings come amid investor fears that inflation may remain sticky while economic growth slows. In recent weeks, concerns over the latter have pushed markets to price in the possibility of a Fed interest cut in May. But after the two inflation readings, those bets have faded.

As of Thursday, markets were pricing in just a 30% chance the Fed cuts rates at its May meeting, down from a 52% chance seen a week ago, per the CME FedWatch Tool.

Economist Thomas Ryan also expects the two inflation readings to lead to an increase in the Fed's preferred inflation gauge for February.

""This is the opposite of the downward progress on inflation the Fed needs to see to justify easing policy further and reinforces our view that the window for cuts has already closed this year,"" the Capital Economics North America economist wrote.

Oops, something went wrong

The long-dreaded Trump tariffs have finally arrived. Canadians have been quick to rally against our increasingly unstable neighbour's economic threats, and at long last, Canadian governments have started to follow suit — finally prioritizing easier and cheaper buying and selling within our own borders. Old habits die hard, however, and progress continues to be unacceptably slow.

To their credit, governments are moving faster than ever, particularly on labour mobility, with key agreements set to be in place by June 1. A mutual recognition pilot program for trucking — though only a pilot program — is rolling out this spring, and the federal government has committed to cutting over half of its exceptions under 2017's Canadian Free Trade Agreement. More importantly, Nova Scotia has set a new benchmark with its bold Free Trade and Mobility within Canada Act, which adopts mutual recognition, the simple principle that if a product or worker is certified in any Canadian province, that's good enough for Nova Scotia. Now, provinces like Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta  are showing growing interest in following suit.

But “faster than ever” is a low bar, especially when the previous pace was barely a crawl, and Canada is now strapped to a ticking tariff time bomb. Barriers within Canada are a drag on trade equivalent to a 21 per cent internal tariff on goods and services, according to the International Monetary Fund. Even when international sourcing becomes more expensive, an internal tariff that high means buying domestically still may not feel like the better option. Commitments are great, but we need faster timelines for getting that 21 per cent tariff close to zero.

Some of the hoops Canadians are expected to jump through when moving goods and services across provincial borders can be ludicrous. A hairstylist from Manitoba can't cut hair in New Brunswick without being completely recertified. Construction sites in Ontario need different toilet seats than those in Alberta. Every province has its own requirements for individual coffee creamer packaging. Provincially inspected food can't move from Ottawa to Gatineau (a 10-minute drive) without being federally inspected. Because of inconsistent trucking regulations across the country, freight costs are an average of 8.3 per cent higher than they need to be. Canada has long championed sensible free trade agreements with the U.S., Europe, Asia and others but we have completely failed to apply the same principles of non-discrimination at home.

Nova Scotia's breakthrough was a game-changer, however. By introducing mutual recognition for goods, services and licences from reciprocating jurisdictions, Premier Tim Houston set a new standard for what's possible. Other provinces have since followed with incremental steps, joining agreements to facilitate labour mobility and direct-to-consumer alcohol shipments. But why stop there? What is everybody waiting for? Nova Scotia has shown the way forward.

With economic uncertainty looming, Canadian governments need to act now. At the Canadian Federation of Independent Business we have heard from countless small businesses that until now at least, it has been easier to work with American partners than with their neighbours in other parts of Canada. No wonder 88 per cent of small businesses surveyed say eliminating internal trade barriers needs to be a top priority. They say the maze of provincial regulations hinders their productivity and expansion. For consumers, that means less market competition, fewer job opportunities and higher prices. Yet, despite knowing that, until now governments have remained bogged down in painfully slow negotiations over minor technicalities, such as which high-visibility safety apparel all jurisdictions should adopt — on which negotiations are expected to drag on for nearly two more years!

It shouldn't have taken this long or required an elephant to come crashing against our door to make a free internal market a top priority. But now we need to seize the moment. Canadians have been quick to raise their elbows, show unity and rally behind Canadian businesses. Now, it's time for governments to match that urgency by breaking down the barriers that have been blocking internal trade.

Red tape is the silent killer of businesses

Do we fight Trump to our last sacred cow?

Nova Scotia has shown the way. Which premier will step up next? Some seem ready to follow suit, but if Canadian leaders are as committed as they claim, the answer should be: all of them. No business should find it easier to trade abroad than at home. It's time to get this done, once and for all.

 Bitcoin's recovery near $85,000 shows solid buying at lower levels, signaling that the downside may be limited. 

Bitcoin (BTC) has risen back above the 200-day simple moving average ($83,754), indicating that the bulls are attempting a comeback. The failure of the bears to capitalize on the drop below the 200-day SMA shows that selling dries up at lower levels.

However, Bitcoin may not be out of the woods yet. Crypto analyst Matthew Hyland said in a video posted to X that Bitcoin needs a weekly close above $89,000 to confirm a bottom. 

A move above $89,000 could liquidate roughly $1.60 billion in short positions, according to CoinGlass data. If that does not happen, Hyland warns that Bitcoin will fall into the $74,000 to $69,000 range.

Buyers have a challenging task ahead of them. The inflows of $13.3 million into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on March 12 could not be sustained, and the ETFs recorded outflows of $135.2 million on March 13, per Farside Investors data. 

This shows that the investors remain nervous and are pressing the sell button on new tariff threats and actions by US President Donald Trump.

Could Bitcoin surge to $100,000, pulling select altcoins higher? Let's analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.

Bitcoin bulls are trying to start a recovery but are expected to face significant resistance in the zone between the 200-day SMA and the 20-day exponential moving average ($86,717).

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

If buyers drive the price above the 20-day EMA, it will signal that the break below the 200-day SMA may have been a bear trap. The BTC/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($93,876) and, after that, to the $100,000 psychological barrier.

Conversely, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance zone with force, it will indicate that the bears are in command. That increases the likelihood of a drop to the vital support at $73,777. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $73,777 level because a drop below it may pull the pair to $67,000.

Ether (ETH) has been trading in a tight range between $1,963 and $1,754, indicating a tough battle between the bulls and the bears.

ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The relative strength index (RSI) is showing early signs of forming a positive divergence. If the price rises above $1,963, the ETH/USDT pair could climb to the breakdown level of $2,111. This level may attract aggressive selling by the bears, but if the bulls persist, the pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($2,597).

This optimistic view will be negated if the price turns down from the current level of $2,111 and breaks below $1,754. That will signal the resumption of the downtrend. The pair may then nosedive to $1,500.

XRP (XRP) rebounded off the $2 support on March 11 and reached the 20-day EMA ($2.35) on March 13.

XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The bears are trying to halt the recovery at the 20-day EMA, but the bulls have kept up the pressure. That increases the possibility of a break above the 20-day EMA. The XRP/USDT pair may then rise to $2.64. If this level is cleared, the pair could rally to $3.

Contrarily, if the price turns down sharply from the current level, it will suggest that the sentiment remains negative. The pair may retest the crucial $2 support, and if this level gives way, the pair will complete a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern. That may sink the pair to $1.28.

BNB (BNB) rose above the 20-day EMA ($591) on March 13, but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels, as seen from the long wick on the candlestick.

BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The bulls are again trying to push the price above the 20-day EMA. The BNB/USDT pair could challenge the 50-day SMA ($624) if they can pull it off. A break and close above the 50-day SMA will suggest that the correction may be over. The pair could then attempt a rally to $686.

If bears want to prevent the upside, they will have to yank the price below the $500 support. The pair may then fall to $460, which is expected to attract aggressive buying by the bulls.

Solana (SOL) has been trading above the $120 level, but the bulls have failed to push the price above $132.

If the price skids below $120, the SOL/USDT pair could drop to $110. This is a critical support to watch out for because a break and close below it may start a downward move to $98 and then to $80.

On the upside, a break and close above the 20-day EMA suggests that the selling pressure is reducing. The pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($178), where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense.

Cardano (ADA) was rejected from the 20-day EMA ($0.77) on March 12, signaling that the bears are selling on rallies.

The ADA/USDT pair could drop to the uptrend line, which is an important level for the bulls to defend. If the price bounces off the uptrend line with strength, it will improve the prospects of a break above the moving averages. If that happens, the pair could rise to $1.02.

This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the uptrend line. That could start a slide to $0.58 and subsequently to the Feb. 3 intraday low of $0.50.

Dogecoin (DOGE) bounced off the $0.14 support on March 11, indicating that the bulls are trying to defend the level.

The relief rally is expected to face selling at the 20-day EMA ($0.19). If the price turns down sharply from $0.19, it increases the possibility of a break below $0.14. The DOGE/USDT pair could then plummet to $0.10.

The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 20-day EMA. That could open the doors for a rally to the 50-day SMA ($0.24). Sellers will try to stall the up move at the 50-day SMA, but if the bulls pierce the resistance, the pair could climb to $0.29.

Pi's (PI) recovery stalled at $1.80 on March 13, indicating that the bears are selling on every minor rally.

The bears will try to sink the price to $1.20, which is a crucial level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off $1.20, it will indicate a possible range formation. The PI/USDT pair could oscillate between $1.20 and $1.80 for some time.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price continues lower and breaks below $1.20, it will signal the resumption of the downward move. The pair could descend to the 78.6% retracement level of $0.72.

UNUS SED LEO (LEO) has been trading near the $10 overhead resistance, indicating that the bulls have kept up the pressure.

A break and close above $10 will complete a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which could start an upmove toward the pattern target of $12.04.

The bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to pull the price to the uptrend line, which is an important level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the uptrend line, it will signal that the LEO/USD pair may remain inside the triangle for a while. 

The bears will gain the upper hand on a break and close below the uptrend line. That could sink the pair to $8.84 and later to $8.30.

Chainlink (LINK) plunged and closed below the support line of the descending channel pattern on March 10, but the bears could not sustain the lower levels.

LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The bulls have pushed the price back into the channel on March 14, but their efforts are likely to be met with strong selling at the 20-day EMA ($15.14). If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will attempt to sink the LINK/USDT pair below $11.85. If they manage to do that, the pair could decline to $10.

On the contrary, a break and close above the 20-day EMA will signal that the markets have rejected the break below the channel. The pair may then climb to the 50-day SMA ($18.27).

 US tariffs amplify Bitcoin's volatility, but there could be a silver lining for BTC price. 

In the first three months of his presidency, Donald Trump has ignited trade tensions by announcing tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China and the result has been unexpected turmoil in US and global markets.

The fallout from the tariffs has been relatively swift, and the impact has been felt across the crypto market. As of March 8, the US president had backed away from some plans to impose tariffs on certain Mexican and Canadian goods—another twist in the rollercoaster of US trade policy that continues to shake markets.

Singapore crypto trading firm QCP Capital said in a note. “This week's crypto markets have been nothing short of a roller coaster. With macro conditions in flux, crypto remains tightly linked to equities, with price action reflecting broader economic shifts.”

The wild swings underscore the volatility ahead for cryptocurrencies—often seen as high-risk assets—as the Trump administration tests the limits of economic and foreign policy and serves as a cautionary tale as uncertainty pervades markets. 

In a post on X, former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said that […] tariff policy has already taken $2 trillion off the value of the US stock market,” and Summers suggested that these measures were “ill-conceived” and that they would undermine US competitiveness.

While tariffs and Trump's market-moving policy announcements may create a sense of impending doom, their impact on the future of the crypto sector remains in question. If a trade war weakens the US dollar through inflation, Bitcoin could actually benefit, says Eugene Epstein, head of trading and structured products at Moneycorp. Investors fleeing depreciating fiat currencies may turn to crypto, and if tariff-hit nations devalue their currencies in response, Bitcoin could serve as a vehicle for capital flight.

Unlike traditional markets, Bitcoin trades 24/7 and reacts instantly to macroeconomic shifts, making it highly vulnerable to risk-off sentiment. “Sentiment-wise, the primary drivers of crypto will continue to be the status of a federal crypto reserve as well as overall risk sentiment. If US equities continue falling it is hard to envision a strong crypto market, at least in the near term,” Epstein said.

Many in the crypto community expected Trump's return to the White House to send Bitcoin soaring, and initially, it did—rising from $69,374 on Election Day to a record $108,786 by Inauguration Day. But since then, BTC has tumbled, dropping below $80,000 by late February and again in March. The price weakness comes despite the administration's pro-crypto stance, including plans for a strategic crypto reserve and market-structure reforms.

Cumulative flows into Bitcoin Spot ETFs reached record highs following Trump's victory, with investors pouring over $10 billion into these instruments in the aftermath of the election, according to data by Farside Investors. However, growing concerns over a potential tariff war seem to have taken a toll on market sentiment and, by extension, on cryptocurrencies. 

Since early February, Bitcoin ETFs have seen significant outflows as uncertainty looms over the broader economic landscape. At the same time, safe haven assets like gold, have actually responded positively amid the tariff war.

This isn't the first time President Trump has wielded tariff threats as a bargaining chip and some traders believe the market will adjust to focus on fundamentals over the blunt use of tariffs as a way to force policy changes among US allies. 

That's why some traders in the industry choose to not base their strategies solely on tariffs. For Bob Walden, head of Trading at Abra, tariffs are “just a headline” that influences short-term investor sentiment but doesn't alter the market's fundamental conditions.

 Bitcoin is becoming more integrated into the legacy financial system through indirect exposure provided by corporate securities and ETFs. 

REX Shares, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) provider with over $6 billion in assets under management (AUM), launched its Bitcoin (BTC) Corporate Treasury Convertible Bond (BMAX) ETF that invests in the convertible bonds of companies with a BTC corporate reserve strategy.

According to the March 14 announcement, the ETF will purchase the convertible notes of companies such as Strategy. Convertible notes are commercial paper that can be converted into equity at a predetermined rate if an investor chooses.

Typically, these convertible bonds are purchased by institutional investors, including pension funds, some of which specialize in convertible note investing. Greg King, CEO of REX Financial, said:

Investing in convertible bonds, ETFs and the equity of companies such as Strategy, MARA and Metaplanet provides investors with indirect exposure to Bitcoin that removes the technical barrier to entry and self-custodial risks of holding BTC directly.

Institutional investors may lack the technical sophistication to hold BTC directly or have legal or fiduciary constraints preventing them from investing in digital assets.

At least 12 US states currently hold Strategy stock as part of their state pension funds and treasuries. Collectively, these states hold over $271 million in Strategy stock using current market prices.

The list comprises Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, North Carolina, New Jersey, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin.

California's State Teachers' Retirement Fund and its Public Employees Retirement System hold $67.2 million and $62.8 million in Strategy stock, respectively.

According to SaylorTracker, Strategy currently holds 499,096 BTC, valued at over $41.4 billion, making the company one of the largest corporate BTC holders in the world — eclipsing the US government's estimated 198,000 BTC.

Strategy's most recent Bitcoin purchase occurred on Feb. 24, when the company acquired 20,356 BTC for nearly $2 billion.

 The bill “aims to cement the reserve as a permanent fixture, shielding it from reversal by future administrations,” blockchain regulatory experts told Cointelegraph. 

A new bill set to be introduced in Congress aims to formalize President Donald Trump's executive order establishing a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a move that could further integrate Bitcoin into the nation's financial strategy.

Trump signed an executive order on March 7 to use Bitcoin (BTC) seized in government criminal cases to establish a national reserve.

The legislation, introduced by US Representative Byron Donalds, seeks to ensure the Bitcoin reserve becomes a permanent fixture, preventing future administrations from dismantling it through executive action.

“For years, the Democrats waged war on crypto,” Donalds, a Florida Republican, said in a statement to Bloomberg. “Now is the time for Congressional Republicans to decisively end this war.”

If the bill is passed, it would ensure that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the US Digital Asset Stockpile could not be eliminated via executive actions by a future administration.

The bill will require at least 60 votes in the Senate and a House majority to pass. With Republicans holding a Senate majority — and amid a generally more crypto-friendly environment — the bill has a chance of passing.

According to Bitcoinlaws data, at least 23 US states have introduced legislation supporting a Bitcoin reserve, reflecting growing state-level interest in integrating crypto into fiscal policy.

The introduction of the Bitcoin reserve-related bill marks a pivotal moment for the wider crypto industry, not just BTC.

The legislation “aims to cement the reserve as a permanent fixture, shielding it from reversal by future administrations,” according to Anndy Lian, author and intergovernmental blockchain expert.

The bill signals the US government's intent to integrate Bitcoin into its financial framework, Lian told Cointelegraph, adding:

“A codified reserve might encourage a more cohesive regulatory approach, offering businesses and investors a clearer path forward,” he added.

However, identifying the right funding mechanisms and custody solutions for the Bitcoin reserve is a challenging step for governmental entities that may delay the fund's creation.

The bill may also provide more clarity on the government's future Bitcoin acquisition strategies. Although the current plan does not involve government Bitcoin purchases, the order does not rule them out.

The order authorizes the US Treasury and Commerce secretaries to develop “budget-neutral strategies” to buy more Bitcoin for the reserve, provided there are no additional costs to taxpayers.

 A Democrat lawmaker has demanded the US Treasury prevent the Trump administration from pursuing a cryptocurrency reserve, flagging the president's alleged conflict of interest. 

A Democrat lawmaker has called on the US Treasury to “cease all attempts” to create a strategic crypto reserve in the United States, citing conflicts of interest with US President Donald Trump and arguing that a stockpile would not benefit the American people.

House Representative Gerald E. Connolly of Michigan criticized the “cryptocurrency reserve” in a March 13 letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, stating that it provides “no discernible benefit to the American people” and would instead significantly enrich the president and his donors.

Connolly, who didn't discern between the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the Digital Asset Stockpile, said Trump's plans would constitute “unsound fiscal policy” because it chooses certain cryptocurrencies over others via social media.

Connolly said the Trump administration's plan would also waste taxpayer dollars on what the Federal Reserve described as “the dumbest idea ever.”

“No strategic need has arisen that would necessitate investment in the volatile and speculative cryptocurrency market,” Connolly, the ranking Democrat on the House committee on oversight and government reform, said in the letter.

However, the White House has said that the Digital Asset Stockpile will only hold onto cryptocurrency already forfeited. At the same time, the Bitcoin (BTC) reserve will only make acquisitions through budget-neutral strategies that won't impact taxpayers.

Connolly also said that Trump failed to consult with Congress over the Bitcoin reserve plan, let alone obtain congressional authorization to create it.

Connolly also alleged there were conflicts of interest between Trump's presidential duties and the Trump Organization's ownership of the crypto platform World Liberty Financial, in addition to the Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin.

The Democrat referred to the TRUMP token as a “money grab” that has allowed Trump-linked entities to cash in on over $100 million worth of trading fees. 

This has been called Trump's “most lucrative get-rich scheme yet,” Connolly added.

Related: Bitcoin reserve may end up a ‘potent political weapon' — Arthur Hayes

Representative Maxine Waters, a Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, also criticized Trump's memecoin on Jan. 20, referring to a rug pull while claiming the launch represented the “worst of crypto.”

Connolly has asked Bessent to provide documents and communications related to the creation of a Bitcoin reserve and a complete list of steps the Trump administration has taken to avoid a conflict of interest.

Connolly also asked for a list of companies in which the Treasury has crypto-related financial interests. He also asked:

The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will initially use cryptocurrency forfeited in federal criminal or civil cases. Meanwhile, the Digital Asset Stockpile will consist of cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, which could include XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA) and Ether (ETH).

 World Liberty Finance, a Trump-backed DeFi project, completed its second round of token sales, netting the project $550 million from two rounds of public sales. 

World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance (DeFi) project backed by the Trump family, has completed its second public token sale, raising $250 million from investors.

WLFI launched on Sept. 16, 2024, with the goal of promoting DeFi and stablecoins pegged to the US dollar. The project is endorsed by President Donald Trump and his sons — Eric, Donald Jr. and Barron — who have positioned it as a step toward financial innovation and a shift away from traditional banking.

The company has now raised about $550 million by selling 25% of the crypto asset's total supply. Its first token sale, which opened on Oct. 15, 2024, netted the company about $300 million by selling 20 billion WLFI tokens for $0.015 each. 

On Jan. 20, the company announced another round of token sales “due to massive demand and overwhelming interest,” offering 5 billion tokens at $0.05 each — a 230% price increase from the first sale. The sale, completed on March 14, met its full target of $250 million.

Even before the public token sales, the company had been attracting investment from crypto executives. On Nov. 25, 2024, Tron Founder Justin Sun announced a $30 million investment in WLFI. Etherscan data shows Sun received 2 billion WLFI tokens in return at $0.015 a piece. 

On Jan. 27, investment platform Web3Port announced a $10 million investment into the crypto project. The company said it plans additional purchases and is exploring a “long-term partnership” with the DeFi project. 

On Feb. 11, venture capital firm Oddiyana Ventures announced a strategic investment in World Liberty Financial. However, the company did not disclose how much it invested.

While the company has raised over half a billion dollars, some crypto community members voiced concerns about whether it offers innovation or is just another cash grab.  

In an X post, 6MV managing partner Mike Dudas said the project was a “pay-to-play” scheme, not a DeFi gateway that would introduce new users to crypto. 

Yearn.finance creator and Sonic Labs co-founder Andre Cronje also questioned the company's high fees and reinvestment strategies. The executive said the company simply extracts value from crypto firms rather than providing utility. 

WLFI has not publicly addressed these criticisms.

 The National Securities Commission approved General Resolution No. 1058, which establishes final guidelines for crypto service providers. 

Argentina's securities regulator has finalized rules for virtual asset service providers (VASPs), which cover general codes of conduct and custody requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges and other platforms facilitating digital asset transactions. 

The regulations were published on March 13 by the National Securities Commission, also known as CNV, under General Resolution No. 1058. 

According to a translated version of the announcement, the regulations impose “obligations regarding registration, cybersecurity, asset custody, money laundering prevention, and risk disclosure” on VASPs operating in the country.

The stated goal of the rules is to guarantee “transparency, stability, and user protection in the crypto ecosystem,” the announcement said.

Argentine tax lawyer Diego Fraga said the final guidelines include mandatory separation of company and client funds, annual audits and monthly reporting with the CNV.

Since 2024, VASPs operating in Argentina have been required to register with the registry of virtual asset service providers, also known as PSAV. According to the new rules, registrations may be revoked for noncompliance, and any company operating without registration may be blocked by court order. 

Individuals who are registered with the PSAV have until July 1 to conform to the new rules. Companies incorporated in Argentina have until Aug. 1, and those incorporated abroad have until Sept. 1.

“Those who do not comply with the established requirements and deadlines will not be able to operate in Argentina,” said Roberto E. Silva, the CNV's president.

As global law firm DLA Piper explained, Argentina's push for clearer crypto regulations intensified one year ago after the CNV implemented registration requirements and said crypto issuers would be subject to securities laws. 

The regulatory pivot came amid a growing wave of crypto adoption in the country, which was partly driven by the rapid depreciation of the Argentine peso.

By mid-2024, crypto adoption in Argentina had surged as locals flocked to stablecoins like Tether's USDt (USDT).

An October Chainalysis report determined that Argentina had overtaken Brazil as the largest Latin American country for crypto inflows at roughly $91 billion between July 2023 and June 2024.

 The US has already suffered a crypto brain drain. That's why the Crypto Task Force needs to work with more urgency than it has shown. 

Opinion by: Kadan Stadelmann, chief technology officer, Komodo Platform

The Crypto Task Force held a press conference in early February 2025. It struck the wrong tone. While the task force gave lip service to regulatory clarity, the goal seemed to placate the crypto industry, not bring about change that empowers individuals. 

On Jan. 23, the president established a working group for digital assets to propose a federal regulatory framework around issuing and operating digital assets, including stablecoins and a Bitcoin reserve. These goals must be expanded upon, and it seems they are, as the development of a strategic reserve is now underway. 

Instead of perpetuating the same discussion on “regulatory clarity” that the industry has been having with officials for years, the task force should take a similar approach to crypto matters as the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has been working in feverish haste to cut federal agencies and programs that it has deemed wasteful.

Instead, the Crypto Task Force should expose the perils of central bank inflationary money that puts humanity on a neverending treadmill toward desperation. It should cultivate a spirit of competition and adopting decentralized, permissionless currencies. 

The Task Force should persuade lawmakers to adopt a laissez-faire crypto structure while effectively stamping out the rampant fraud by the truly bad actors who exploit people's false hopes of quick riches. The Crypto Task Force should put out press releases warning people about obvious scams. It should also teach people the virtues of proof-of-work and the follies of many proof-of-stake coins. 

The goal of Trump's crypto task force should be simple: Establish a freedom-focused growth trajectory for the crypto industry in the US without delay. 

Trump has clarified that he wants to promote the responsible growth and use of crypto. Such recommendations only hold as much merit as they grant entrepreneurs the freedom to take risks and curtail massive corporations from rolling out a digital panopticon with centralized cryptocurrencies. 

Recent: SEC task force continues meeting with firms over crypto regulations

If the US is to be competitive with countries like the United Arab Emirates, the US must create a regulatory sandbox that enables founders to develop technology — including controversial technologies like decentralized coin mixers — in legal gray areas without the fear of prison or jail time so long as they are not blatantly breaking pre-existing law. 

Before Trump was elected, US crypto founders contended with seemingly arbitrary Securities and Exchange Commission witch hunts, which have ensnared even the most respected crypto institutions, such as Coinbase and Kraken. The SEC went after Ripple for issuing an alleged unregistered security, but Ripple enjoyed significant wins in that case, especially when selling tokens to institutions. Countless founders have been de-banked in the US for having founded even crypto-adjacent companies. That suggests there has been an all-out war by Washington and big banks against the industry. That has to end, and the damage that has been done must be repaired. The Crypto Task Force cannot protect big banks against crypto. It must let the market decide.

Although many suits have been dropped, lawmakers have their work cut out for them. So much has changed since the 20th century, when the US was a world leader in the development of the internet. It has fallen far behind in crypto. 

What the US needs now is innovation, not crypto red tape. The world has Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) laws. The Crypto Task Force mustn't waste time developing a separate set of AML and KYC laws. Instead of studying the feasibility of a Bitcoin reserve, just put the Bitcoin confiscated from Ross Ulbricht, founder of the Silk Road, under the management of the Treasury and call it a day instead of selling it. 

The Crypto Task Force must work now to build a renewed spirit of technological innovation in the United States. Countries in Asia have demonstrated a higher level of participation at the retail level. The US needs a strategy to educate and empower the retail investing public to partake in exciting and new markets like blockchain and AI. The US must switch from a conservative approach to crypto toward a progressive approach akin to what we've seen in the UAE.

The US has already suffered a brain drain, as entrepreneurs have left to pursue opportunities in friendlier jurisdictions. If the US had developed a welcoming Bitcoin approach, El Salvador could have never attracted talent from the US.

Too much freedom has already been lost in the US. The Trump administration must unleash the crypto-anarchists with the enthusiasm of DOGE in the spirit of some of the US's greatest freedom thinkers, like Henry David Thoreau and others.

Long ago, the US fell behind in the crypto arm's race. It will take work to catch up, and the more radical the approach taken by the Crypto Task Force, the quicker the gap can be closed.

If it doesn't, you can bet we crypto-anarchists will be storming the gates.

 Bitcoin may be working on a classic bullish divergence, but gold takes center stage again as a turbulent week for risk-asset traders comes to a close.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD gaining up to 5% on the day before consolidating.

A characteristic lack of momentum at the start of the US trading session persisted, with risk assets still wary of macroeconomic and geopolitical surprises, notably in the form of US trade tariffs.

Assessing the current status quo on the daily BTC/USD chart, popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital reported increasing odds of a bullish divergence playing out on the relative strength index (RSI) metric.

Here, RSI should make higher lows as the price forms lower lows to indicate waning seller dominance.

“Promising early-stage signs of a Bullish Divergence developing,” he wrote in one of the day's posts on X.

Another post flagged a key horizontal resistance line currently under attack from bulls.

“Bitcoin continues to Daily Close below the blue resistance. However, each rejection from this resistance appears to be weakening in terms of follow-through to the downside,” Rekt Capital commented.

Keith Alan, co-founder of trading resource Material Indicators, meanwhile focused on the 21-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs). At the time of writing, these stood at $83,740 and $86,800, respectively.

“BTC is poised to make another run at reclaiming the 200-Day MA, but it will only count if we get a sustained close above it, AND it is closely followed by an R/S Flip at the 21-Day MA,” an X post on the topic read.

Russian companies have been using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and USDt to facilitate trade with China and India amid international sanctions, according to a Reuters report.

Russian oil companies have used crypto assets including Bitcoin (BTC) and Tether's USDt (USDT) for international trade, Reuters reported on March 14, citing four sources with direct knowledge of the matter.

One Russian oil trader reportedly conducts tens of millions of dollars worth of monthly transactions using digital assets, according to a source who spoke on condition of anonymity due to a non-disclosure agreement.

While the Russian finance minister publicly declared in late 2024 that Russia is free to use assets like Bitcoin in foreign trade, the use of crypto in oil transactions with China and India had not been previously reported.

According to Reuters, Russia's foreign oil trade in crypto involves intermediaries who manage offshore accounts and facilitate transactions in the buyer's local currency. One example includes a Chinese buyer of Russian oil that pays a trading company acting as a middleman in yuan into an offshore account.

The middleman then converts payments into crypto assets and transfers it to another account, which then sends it to a third account in Russia and converts it to Russian rubles, sources said.

According to one of Reuters' sources, crypto will likely continue to be used in Russia's foreign oil trading regardless of whether any sanctions are in place and even if the sanctions are lifted and Russia is free to use the dollar.

“It is a convenient tool and helps run operations faster,” the report said, citing the source.

The news comes amid the Bank of Russia officially proposing to legalize cryptocurrency investments for high-net-worth individuals who have at least $1.1 million in securities and deposits.

While Russia has been increasingly open to Bitcoin, including its use in foreign trade, mainland China has maintained a cautious and restrictive approach toward cryptocurrency.

Since banning virtually all crypto transactions in 2021, authorities in mainland China have maintained a restrictive agenda on crypto, while neighboring jurisdiction Hong Kong has emerged as a global crypto hub.

As the United States moves forward with its strategic Bitcoin reserve initiative, some industry observers believe China will not ignore Bitcoin's growing role in the global financial landscape.

According to data from the Bitcoin technology company Jan3, the Chinese government may be holding at least 193,000 BTC.

 DeFi has scored a victory in Congress, but how can lawmakers match real regulatory concerns with user privacy demands? 

The decentralized finance (DeFi) industry is breathing a sigh of relief as Congress relaxes reporting obligations, but questions remain about how lawmakers will regulate DeFi.

On March 12, the House of Representatives voted to nullify a rule that required DeFi protocols to report gross proceeds from crypto sales, as well as info on taxpayers involved, to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). 

The rule, which the IRS issued in December 2024 and wasn't set to take effect until 2027, was regarded by major industry lobby groups as burdensome and beyond the agency's authority. 

The White House has already signaled its support for the bill. President Donald Trump is ready to sign when it reaches his desk. But DeFi observers note that the industry has yet to strike a balance between privacy and regulation.

The crypto industry was quick to laud the vote in the House. Marta Belcher, president of the Filecoin Foundation, said that blocking the rule was particularly important for user privacy. 

She told Cointelegraph it is “critical to protect people's ability to transact directly with each other via open-source code (like smart contracts and decentralized exchanges) while remaining anonymous, in the same way that people can transact directly with each other using cash.”

Privacy concerns were central to the crypto industry's objections to the rule, with industry observers claiming that it was not fit for purpose and infringed on user privacy. 

Bill Hughes, senior counsel and director of global regulatory matters for Consensys Software wrote in December 2024, “Trading front ends would have to track and report on user activity — both US persons and non-US persons [...] And it applies to the sale of every single digital asset — including NFTs and even stablecoins.”

The Blockchain Association, a major crypto industry lobby group, stated that the rule was “an infringement on the privacy rights of individuals using decentralized technology” that would push DeFi offshore.

While the rule has been stopped for now, there still aren't fixed privacy guidelines in place — something Etherealize CEO Vivek Raman said the industry needs to move forward. 

“There needs to be clear frameworks for blockchain-based privacy while maintaining [Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering] requirements,” he told Cointelegraph.

Raman stated that some transactions and customer data will need to remain private, “and we need guidance on what privacy can look like.”

The crypto space has long juggled user privacy demands and regulators' Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer concerns. 

One problem lies in the technology itself — if a network is created by many and controlled by no single entity, who can the government contact? 

Per Raman, “It's hard for a decentralized protocol that is controlled by nobody to issue 1099s or fulfill broker-dealer responsibilities! Companies can certainly be [broker-dealers], but software has not been designed for [broker-dealer] rules.”

DeFi developers can and have been proactive in working with regulators, Chainalysis suggested, as was the case with certain protocols freezing funds after the disastrous $285 million KuCoin hack.

Cinneamhain Ventures partner and consultant Adam Cochran claimed that every protocol has certain pressure points regulators could press on if a protocol were used to commit a crime:

However, these specific instances do not make a comprehensive regulatory framework that both the industry and investor protection agencies can point to. 

In that regard, crypto analytics firm Chainalysis stated in 2020 that regulators may need to craft regulations for the DeFi space with decentralized reporting limitations in mind. 

Raman suggested that one possible solution could be zero-knowledge proofs, which allow users to confirm certain data without revealing it. 

He is optimistic about regulators' ability to find a way to regulate the space while still maintaining user privacy: “I think we'll see a positive sum environment where DeFi and compliance will coexist.”

Trump has already made a number of pro-crypto measures through executive orders and appointing pro-crypto individuals to head parts of his administration — the most recent being the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve.

The pro-crypto tenure of important financial regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has dropped a number of high-profile enforcement cases against crypto firms.

While notable, the big fish that the crypto industry is waiting for is the crypto regulatory framework and stablecoin bills circulating in Congress, which would give the industry the guardrails it claims it needs to thrive. 

On March 13, the Senate Banking Committee approved the GENIUS Act, the stablecoin bill, putting it one step closer to a vote on the Senate floor. 

The crypto framework bill, FIT 21, was first introduced in the 2024 legislative session, ultimately failing in the Senate. However, in February, House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill said that he anticipated the bill could pass in this session with “modest changes.”

But even if FIT 21 were passed soon, regulations for DeFi could be far off. The bill would exclude DeFi from SEC and CFTC oversight, but it would also establish a working group to research 12 key areas related to DeFi. 

This study will seek to understand the risks and benefits of DeFi and will ultimately make regulatory recommendations.

 Pump.fun memecoins are failing and they're dragging Bitcoin along for the ride. 

The memecoin frenzy on Pump.fun is hitting a wall, with the platform's “graduation rate” sinking below 1% for a fourth straight week.

“Graduation rate” is the memecoin launchpad's term for tokens that make it through the incubation phase and become fully tradable on a Solana decentralized exchange (DEX). To graduate, a token must meet specific liquidity and trading requirements.

Over the past four weeks, starting Feb. 17, Pump.fun's graduation rate has remained below 1% for the first time, Dune Analytics data shows.

Pump.fun's graduation rate has never been particularly high. The platform's best-performing week was in November 2024 when 1.67% of memecoins moved on to the open market. 

However, the sheer volume of tokens launched on the platform at the time made this percentage more significant than it is now. During the week starting Nov. 11, 323,000 tokens were created on Pump.fun, meaning the 1.67% graduation rate translated to roughly 5,400 tokens entering Solana's DeFi economy in a single week.

With token creation volume declining on both Pump.fun and Solana, weekly token graduations have plummeted to a four-week average of around 1,500 tokens at the time of writing, according to Dune.

Pump.fun's dropping graduation rate reflects waning investor appetite for memecoins, which have developed a reputation as degenerate lottery tickets or quick cash grabs for their creators.

Several political figures have launched their own memecoins as well, including US President Donald Trump. His token is down 84% from its all-time high set on Jan. 19, according to CoinGecko.

Memecoins' struggles persist despite improving liquidity, according to Matrixport. In February, Matrixport analysts noted that a strengthening US dollar had pressured Bitcoin prices by tightening dollar-denominated liquidity.

Since then, the US dollar has weakened. Over the past month, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar against a basket of major currencies, peaked at 107.61 on Feb. 28 before dropping to 103.95 on March 14.

“The US dollar has recently weakened, leading to a rebound in liquidity indicators and some marginal improvements in inflation data. Despite these positive shifts, memecoins — previously one of the strongest narratives during this bull market — continue to struggle significantly, with no apparent recovery,” Matrixport said in its report.

The struggling memecoin market has contributed to a $1 trillion wipeout in crypto market capitalization, according to Matrixport.

“This redistribution of wealth may lead investors to remain cautious about deploying further capital, causing rebounds — even those triggered by better-than-expected inflation data — to be limited,” the report noted.

Matrixport analysts warn that this could lead to further Bitcoin declines, with a potential retracement to as low as $73,000 — a level they believe would provide “strong support.”

 Crypto firms push for stricter rules on politically endorsed tokens after the $4 billion Libra collapse, citing liquidity locks and insider trading restrictions as solutions 

Industry voices warned that politically endorsed cryptocurrencies must adopt stronger investor protections and liquidity safeguards to prevent another major market collapse.

Investor sentiment remains shaken after the Libra (LIBRA) token, which was endorsed by Argentine President Javier Milei, suffered a $4 billion market cap wipeout due to insider cash-outs.

According to blockchain analytics firm DWF Labs, at least eight insider wallets withdrew $107 million in liquidity, triggering the massive collapse.

To avoid a similar meltdown, tokens with presidential endorsements will need more robust safety and economic mechanisms, such as liquidity locking or making the tokens in the liquidity pool non-sellable for a predetermined period, DWF Labs wrote in a report shared with Cointelegraph.

The report stated that tokens from high-profile leaders would also need launch restrictions to limit participation from crypto-sniping bots and large holders or whales.

“Limiting bot and whale activity is essential in limiting the impact of individuals acting on insider information to corner a large percentage of the token supply,” according to Andrei Grachev, managing partner at DWF Labs:

The Libra scandal resulted in 74,698 traders losing a cumulative $286 million worth of capital, according to DWF Labs' report.

The token's quick meltdown further illustrated the need for liquidity locking, which “ensures that there is sufficient liquidity for users to buy and sell into without high slippage,” Grachev said, adding:

DWF Labs' report comes a week after New York lawmakers introduced legislation aimed at protecting crypto investors from rug pulls and insider fraud, amid the latest wave of memecoin scams.

The Libra token's meltdown illustrates the necessity for more transparent token launch mechanisms, explained DWF Labs' Grachev, adding:

“There's always a degree of risk when launching any token, something which can't easily be fully mitigated,” he said.

“Nevertheless, by carefully scrutinizing the projects they partner with and taking full advantage of the transparency that is one of blockchain's core features, launchpads can empower users to make more informed decisions,” he added.

Some troubling developments have emerged since the meltdown of the memecoin endorsed by the Argentine president, including that Libra was an “open secret” in some memecoin circles, which were aware of the token's launch up to two weeks ahead.

Milei has requested the Anti-Corruption Office to investigate all government members, including the president, for potential misconduct, according to a Feb. 16 X statement issued by Argentina's presidential office, Oficina del Presidente.

Milei faces impeachment calls from his political opponents after endorsing the cryptocurrency that turned into a $100 million rug pull.

 Bolivia, which lifted its ban on Bitcoin and crypto transactions in 2024, has seen a demonstrable increase in crypto adoption. 

Bolivia's state-owned energy firm YPFB is planning to use cryptocurrency to pay for energy imports, according to a March 13 report from Reuters. The move comes as the South American nation faces a shortage of foreign currency reserves and a dwindling supply of domestic gas production.

A spokesperson for YPFB said that a system had been put in place to use cryptocurrency to purchase energy imports after the government approved the use of digital assets to meet the country's demand. While YPFB has not used the system yet, it plans to do so.

The report does not reveal what cryptocurrency will be used for the payments. Stablecoins, which are digital assets pegged to fiat currency, are often used to make cross-border transactions, though it is unclear if that will be the case in Bolivia.

The fuel shortage in Bolivia has led to protests and the threat of strikes among some of the nation's workers, including farmers, who say the lack of fuel threatens their summer harvest. Only 35%–50% of the country's public transport system is functional. Alejandro Gallardo, the energy and hydrocarbons minister, said there are challenges due to foreign currency shortages.

The spokesperson for YPFB noted that the new purchasing system was designed to support national fuel subsidies in the country amid the shortage of foreign currency. “From now on, these (cryptocurrency) transactions will be carried out,” they said.

In June 2024, Bolivia's central bank, Banco Central de Bolivia, lifted its ban on Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto payments, allowing financial institutions to transact with digital assets. The ban had been in place since 2014.

In September 2024, Bolivia reported a 100% rise in virtual asset trading, with roughly $15.6 million worth of assets traded on a monthly basis between July and September. The $48.6 million traded was largely made up of stablecoins. Stablecoins are often used in developing countries whose local currency has experienced a high degree of devaluation or where there's a shortage of foreign currency.

Stablecoin use gained further momentum in Bolivia in October 2024 when local bank Banco Bisa introduced a stablecoin custody service. That service, which was supported by the country's financial regulator, allows the nation's residents to buy, sell and trade Tether's USDt (USDT), a US dollar-pegged stablecoin.

Cointelegraph wrote in September 2016 that Bolivia had much to gain from adopting cryptocurrencies. At that time, much of that country's citizens were unbanked, with just 11% of residents using a debit card to make payments and only 5% using credit cards. However, the country continued upholding its ban until 2024, calling crypto a pyramid scheme in May 2017 and arresting crypto advocates.Magazine: Bitcoin payments are being undermined by centralized stablecoins","{'href': 'https://cointelegraph.com', 'title': 'Cointelegraph'}"

 Direct crypto payments are gaining traction across Asia, with stablecoins emerging as natural payment rails for major economies. 

Hong Kong-based crypto payment platform RedotPay closed a $40 million Series A funding round led by Lightspeed, with participation from HSG and Galaxy Ventures.

RedotPay aims to enable cryptocurrency use in everyday transactions while simplifying blockchain transactions for spenders, akin to fiat. In November 2023, the company launched its own physical Visa cards, which can be used for ATM cash withdrawals, along with a virtual card that supports digital payment services like Apple Pay and Google Pay.

The company has expanded its blockchain integrations, adding Solana in December 2024 and Ethereum layer 2 Arbitrum in February. Additionally, it partnered with StraitX and Visa to support retail crypto payments in Singapore.

Still, RedotPay appears to have cross-border service restrictions. Visitors outside Hong Kong are greeted with a warning when accessing the company's website.

Direct cryptocurrency payment solutions are gaining traction across Asia. In November 2024, Singapore-based digital asset trading platform Crypto.com partnered with Triple-A to enable direct crypto payments, eliminating the need to convert crypto into fiat.

Hong Kong has its share of competitors. Infini, a stablecoin-focused crypto payment firm, offers payment services while earning yields. However, it recently suffered a $50 million USDC exploit, allegedly orchestrated by a rogue developer who swapped USDC for DAI — a decentralized stablecoin that cannot be frozen like its centralized counterparts.

Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH), stablecoins can offer a more consistent option to hold for those who want to use them for payments, as the assets are designed to maintain a value pegged to their fiat counterparts. 

Japan, the second-largest Asian economy by gross domestic product, is making significant strides in stablecoin adoption. A recent report by Tokyo-based research and consulting firm Yuri Group shared with Cointelegraph Magazine suggests that the Japanese government views stablecoins as a potential catalyst to unlock $14 trillion in household savings.

Yuri Group highlights Progmat as a key player in Japan's digital asset ecosystem. Backed by the nation's largest bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Progmat operates in compliance with Japan's strict regulatory framework, which mandates a 1:1 reserve backing. This ensures that Japan's established financial institutions remain at the forefront of digital asset management.

In contrast, China, Asia's largest economy, has banned cryptocurrency trading and recognizes the renminbi as the country's sole legal tender.

 A Bitcoin mining firm has been granted a temporary restraining order against its hosting provider, which had blocked access to the rigs over a payment dispute. 

A Delaware court has granted a temporary reprieve to a Pennsylvanian Bitcoin mining firm currently in a payment dispute with its hosting company — barring the hosting provider from blocking access and otherwise commandeering the miner's 21,000 rigs at the property. 

Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn granted a temporary restraining order on March 12, requested by Bitcoin miner Consensus Colocation and systems owner Stone Ridge Ventures against Mawson Hosting, which provides hosting and colocation services for Bitcoin miners. 

The firms have been in disagreement over alleged unpaid fees, the terms of their agreement and Consensus' plan to relocate, allegedly leading to Mawson blocking the miner's personnel from accessing the site.  

The firms have also alleged Mawson has been operating the rigs since Feb. 28 for their own gain after preventing Consensus from entering the premises. 

Mawson, however, claims they are allowed to use the rigs under the terms of its agreement with Consensus, and they have the right of first refusal for its relocation plans. 

The Bitcoin miner has been seeking injunctive relief to regain control of their equipment and prevent Mawson from using them. 

As part of the March 12 order, Mawson is barred from using the hashrate from the miners and will no longer be allowed to restrict Consensus's digital and physical access to the rigs in the Midland, Pennsylvania, facility.

The temporary restraining is in force until the matter can be heard in a preliminary injunction hearing.

Mawson Infrastructure Group and Consensus Colocation did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph's request for comment. 

In a March 6 legal complaint, lawyers acting for Consensus accused Mawson of mining Bitcoin (BTC) with their rigs — valued at $30 million — since Feb. 28, generating daily profits of between $100,000 and $200,000 while blocking access to them both physically and through VPN access. 

Consensus and Stone Ridge signed a colocation agreement with Mawson in December 2023. 

They agreed to terminate the partnership by the end of March 2025, with a gradual reduction in capacity leading up to the deadline and a removal process scheduled to begin on March 3.

Mawson argues that it was owed fees and electricity prepayments for February and March, and its colocation agreement gives it the right to redirect the hashrate of Consensus' miners and use the proceeds to replenish the deposit.

“On its face, it was operative only prior to April 1, 2024, and only in narrow circumstances relating to the replenishment of a deposit,” lawyers acting for Consensus said in the suit. 

“When Mawson began redirecting the hashrate on Feb. 28, the deposit was fully paid. And in any event, Mawson has stolen hashrate worth many times more than the $17,505.45 Mawson claims, without justification, that Consensus owes in purported late fees.”

 Solana's SIMD-228 proposed to dynamically adjust Solana's inflation rate based on staking participation. 

A proposal to dramatically change Solana's inflation system has been rejected by stakeholders but is being hailed as a victory for the network's governance process.

“Even though our proposal was technically defeated by the vote, this was a major victory for the Solana ecosystem and its governance process,” commented Multicoin Capital co-founder Tushar Jain on March 14.

Around 74% of the staked supply voted on proposal SIMD-228 across 910 validators, but just 43.6% voted in favor of it, with 27.4% voting against it and 3.3% abstaining, according to Dune Analytics. It needed 66.67% approval from participating votes to pass and only received 61.4%.

Jain added that this was the biggest crypto governance vote ever, by both the number of participants and the participating market cap, of any ecosystem, chain or network.

“Solana SIMD-228 voter turnout was higher than every US presidential election in the last 100 years,” claimed the team behind Solana's X account.

SIMD-228 is a proposal to change Solana's (SOL) inflation system from a fixed schedule to a dynamic, market-based model. Instead of a pre-set decrease in inflation, this new system would dynamically adjust based on staking participation.

Currently, supply inflation begins at 8% annually, decreasing by 15% per year until it reaches 1.5%. The new mechanism may have reduced it by as much as 80%, according to some estimates. Solana inflation is currently 4.66%, and just 3% of the total supply is staked, according to Solana Compass. 

However, such high inflation can increase selling pressure, reduce SOL's price and discourage network use. The proposed system would have adjusted inflation based on staking levels to stabilize the network and minimize unnecessary token issuance.

Benefits would have included increased network security due to dynamically increasing inflation if staking participation drops, reaction to real-time staking levels rather than following a fixed, inflexible schedule, and encouraging more active use of SOL in DeFi, according to Solana developer tools provider Helius. 

However, lower inflation could have made it harder for smaller validators to stay profitable, the proposed model increased complexity, and unexpected shifts in staking rates might have led to instability.

There was little reaction in SOL prices, with the asset dipping 1.5% on the day to just below $125 at the time of writing. 

However, it has tanked by almost 60% in just two months as the memecoin bubble burst. Solana network revenue has also slumped over 90% since it was primarily used to mint and trade memecoins.

While the initial response was that the attack might have originated from a coordinated group or even a nation-state, Musk's comments pointed to Ukrainian IP addresses as the suspected source. However, he later clarified that the evidence was not definitive.

Also, several cybersecurity experts emphasized that attributing the source of such attacks based solely on IP addresses is unreliable, as attackers often use compromised devices worldwide to mask their actual location. 

So, what was the cause of X's disruption? 

 DDoS attacks are no small feat. These attacks flood the target's servers with excessive traffic, rendering them unable to function correctly. It's a strategy designed to exhaust a system's resources and make it impossible for genuine users to access the service. Experts pointed out that the attack on X was massive and well-coordinated, taking down parts of the platform for hours.Here's a timeline of the events on March 10:Early morning (Eastern Time): Users began reporting issues accessing X, with over 21,000 reports in the US and 10,800 in the UK. 9:30 am ET: A second wave of outages occurred, with about 40,000 users reporting disruptions. This outage persisted into the afternoon.Throughout the day: Users continued to experience intermittent access issues, with reports peaking during critical periods such as the start of National Football League free agency.Evening: By 6:24 pm ET, the number of reported issues decreased significantly to 403 in the US and 200 in the UK, indicating that the platform was stabilizing.Security experts noted that some of X's origin servers had not been adequately protected behind Cloudflare's DDoS defense systems. This created a vulnerability that cyber attackers could exploit, contributing to the success of the attack.Did any individual or group claim responsibility?Yes, in the aftermath of the attack, a pro-Palestinian hacker group known as Dark Storm Team claimed responsibility. This group has been active since late 2023 and is known for targeting organizations and governments perceived to support Israel. Their tactics often involve DDoS attacks to disrupt services and draw attention to their political motives. While X took quick action to shore up these weaknesses, this incident served as a reminder that even the most prominent platforms are not immune to cyber threats if their security infrastructure isn't up to the task.Did you know? Cloudflare is renowned for its robust DDoS protection, having previously defended against some of the largest recorded attacks, including a 5.6 terabit per second assault in October 2024.

 Over the years, the platform has faced several high-profile outages caused by cyberattacks, internal errors and technical limitations.In its early days, X (then Twitter) was notorious for frequent crashes, often displaying the now-iconic “fail whale” image to users. These outages were primarily due to the platform's struggle to handle surges in traffic, particularly during major global events like elections, award shows and sports finals.“Fail Whale” was Twitter's old error message, showing a cartoon whale being lifted by birds. It appeared when Twitter was overloaded or crashed. It became a symbol of Twitter's frequent outages, especially in its early days.Notable incidents from Fail Whale to Musk's X era include:2016 Dyn DDoS attack: One of the most severe outages in X's history occurred during the Dyn cyberattack in October 2016. This massive DDoS attack targeted a key internet infrastructure provider, taking down major websites, including X, Reddit and Spotify. The incident underscored the risks of centralized internet infrastructure.2020 API failures: In October 2020, a widespread outage due to internal system changes led to API failures. While not a cyberattack, the event demonstrated how a misconfiguration could bring down the platform for hours.2022 takeover disruptions: Following Elon Musk's acquisition in late 2022, several outages occurred due to mass layoffs affecting critical engineering teams. Reduced staffing raised concerns about the platform's ability to maintain reliability.2023 rate limit issues: In July 2023, X imposed strict rate limits on users due to excessive data scraping. This decision led to widespread service disruptions, with many users unable to load tweets.Did you know? The US Treasury is being sued for allegedly giving Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to millions of Americans' sensitive financial and personal data.

 The X outage highlights the growing concern about social media security in today's digital world. Platforms like X, Meta and Instagram have become crucial communication channels for individuals, businesses, governments and activists. Even X has become a hub for the crypto community, serving as a central platform for discussions, updates, and networking within the industry. However, these platforms are increasingly under threat from cyberattacks, misinformation campaigns and data breaches.Here are some key areas where social media security is essential:Protecting user data: With millions of users actively posting, messaging and storing sensitive data, social media platforms are prime targets for hackers. Personal information, including emails, phone numbers and even financial data, can be compromised if security measures are weak.Enhancing user authentication: Stronger authentication methods, such as multifactor authentication (MFA), biometric logins and encrypted messaging, can reduce the risk of unauthorized access. Users should be encouraged to enable MFA to add an extra layer of security to their accounts.Fighting disinformation and fake accounts: Cyberattacks aren't always about taking down a platform; sometimes, they aim to manipulate public perception. Fake accounts, bots and misinformation campaigns can create chaos, influence elections and spread propaganda. Social media companies must use advanced AI tools to proactively detect and remove such threats.Preventing DDoS and cyberattacks: As seen in the case of X, DDoS attacks can cripple a platform. While companies invest heavily in cybersecurity, hackers continue to evolve their tactics. This calls for constant vigilance and AI-driven security systems to detect and mitigate threats in real-time.Regular security audits and updates: Cybersecurity is an ongoing process. Social media companies must conduct regular security audits to identify and patch vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them. Keeping systems updated ensures that the latest security measures are in place.Finally, as you continue to integrate social media into various aspects of your lives, prioritizing security will ensure that these platforms remain trusted and reliable channels for communication and engagement.

 An upgrade that aims to bring more functionality to Ethereum wallets will be delayed until at least late April. 

Ethereum core developers have decided to create a third testnet, Hoodi, to better prepare for the Pectra upgrade, which has now been delayed until at least late April after the first two testnets encountered several bugs.

The Hoodi testnet will launch on March 17 and the Pectra upgrade for it will be activated on March 26, Ethereum Foundation developer Tim Beiko said following the Ethereum All Core Dev Call on March 13.

If Pectra runs smoothly on Hoodi without major issues, core developers could set a mainnet launch date for Pectra as soon as 30 days after Hoodi's activation, Beiko said.

That would mean Pectra could go live on Ethereum mainnet as early as April 25.

Tim Beiko's latest announcement on the Pectra upgrade: Ethereum Magicians

Pectra, which combines features from the Prague and Electra proposals, will implement over 10 Ethereum Improvement Proposals mostly aimed at bringing more functionality to Ethereum wallets and improving user experience.

It will also include scaling proposals to double the blob count for data availability from three to six.

Pectra was initially slated to launch on Ethereum mainnet in late 2024 but has faced repeated delays due to client readiness issues and synchronization bugs in the first two Ethereum testnets, Holesky and Sepolia.

Pectra was rolled out on Sepolia on March 5, but soon after, Ethereum developers started seeing error messages on their geth nodes and empty blocks being mined.

Galaxy Digital vice president of research Christine Kim said Hoodi would look to “mimic” the Ethereum mainnet as closely as possible by launching a validator set similar to how mainnet currently operates.

That would see at least 20 million test staked-Ether (ETH) distributed across 11 client teams and five staking operators.

Beiko noted that aspects of Pectra may still be tested on Sepolia and Holesky.

The third testnet comes as Ethereum core developers agreed to deploy future Ethereum protocol upgrades at a faster cadence during an “All Core Devs” meeting on Feb. 13.

Crypto-focused venture capital firm Paradigm also called on Ethereum core developers to ship faster protocol updates to achieve more milestones on its technical roadmap and maintain its competitive edge as a leading layer 1 blockchain.

 Bancor DAO has failed to answer or otherwise defend itself within the time allowed, said the Texan federal judge. 

A Texas federal judge has entered a default judgment against Bancor DAO, which operated the decentralized finance platform Bancor, after it failed to respond to an online summons. 

Judge Robert Pitman issued the judgment after Bancor DAO did not appear to defend itself following a summons that was posted on the DAO's forum in January 2024.

“Defendant Bancor DAO has failed to answer or otherwise defend itself within the time allowed, and that plaintiffs have demonstrated that failure,” wrote district court clerk Philip Delvin on March 13.

The class action involves investors who claim they lost tens of millions of dollars due to the exchange's failure to warn about liquidity issues during a 2022 withdrawal spike.

According to the plaintiffs, who filed the suit in May 2023, Bancor deceived investors about its impermanent loss protection mechanism for liquidity providers and also claimed its token was an unregistered security. 

They said Bancor's ILP operated at a deficit and tried to cover by launching a new product, v3, which promised “some of the most competitive returns anywhere […] without asking users to take on any risk.”

Impermanent losses occur within DeFi automated market maker models when liquidity providers deposit assets into a pool, and one of the tokens loses value against another in the pool. 

Bancor paused impermanent loss protection, citing “hostile” market conditions in June 2022.

The plaintiffs also argued that Bancor DAO is an “unincorporated general partnership” consisting of vBNT tokenholders and could be sued in that capacity, according to Law360.

The case was previously dismissed entirely because the protocol developers were not based in the United States, but was reopened in December.

The plaintiffs said that the DeFi platform “does not appear to be registered in any jurisdiction and has no physical office location, mailing address, officers, directors, or appointed agents.”

Bancor is an onchain liquidity protocol that enables automated, decentralized exchange across blockchains. It has $38 million in total value locked, a figure that is down 98% since its peak in May 2021, according to DeFillama.

Related: Lawsuits could be catastrophic for DAOs if denied ‘limited liability'

The ruling follows precedent from a similar case where the Commodity Futures Trading Commission won a default judgment against Ooki DAO.

A California federal judge also ruled in November that DAOs and their governing members can be sued in cases involving unregistered securities.

 3AC liquidators have been trying to claw back funds held by the hedge fund on FTX since it filed a June 2023 claim in the collapsed exchanges bankruptcy case. 

A US bankruptcy court has authorized liquidators of defunct crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) to increase their claim against collapsed crypto exchange FTX from $120 million to $1.53 billion.

Chief Judge John Dorsey rejected FTX's debtors' argument that the amended proof of claim (POC) from 3AC liquidators was untimely and an unjust attempt to slow the bankruptcy proceedings.

In a March 13 ruling in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, Dorsey opined that 3AC liquidators had provided sufficient notice of their claim and the possibility of amending it once they had analyzed all the available information. Any delay, he said, was caused by FTX's failure to share relevant records promptly.

“The evidence suggests that the delay in filing the Amended Proof of Claim was, in large part, caused by the Debtors themselves,” Dorsey said.

“The evidence also suggests that the Liquidators were diligent in attempting to obtain the information and that despite having the complete information in their possession, the Debtors repeatedly delayed giving it to them.”

3AC liquidators initially filed a $120 million claim in FTX's bankruptcy case in June 2023. They later expanded it in November 2024, alleging claims including breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and breach of fiduciary duty.

The liquidators alleged FTX held $1.53 billion in the hedge fund assets that were liquidated to settle $1.33 billion in liabilities in 2022.

They argued that the transactions were avoidable, caused harm to 3AC creditors and that FTX debtors had delayed providing the information that would have uncovered the liquidation.

FTX debtors objected to the amended claim, saying that the original POC was insufficient to inform them about the nature and amount 3AC liquidators would be claiming and that it came too late and should be disallowed.

Related: FTX filed for bankruptcy 2 years ago — What's happening now?

Before its collapse in June 2022, Three Arrows Capital was once one of the industry's largest crypto hedge funds, with over $3 billion in assets.

Its liquidators also pursued claims against collapsed crypto firm Terraform Labs through a $1.3 billion claim in Terra's bankruptcy case.

At the same time, FTX, which filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, has been undertaking its own recovery efforts to reclaim funds.

In November last year, it filed a trio of lawsuits, one against SkyBridge Capital and its founder, Anthony Scaramucci, to recoup funds spent by former FTX CEO Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried on sponsorship and investment deals. 

Another suit was filed against crypto exchange Binance and its former CEO, Changpeng Zhao, to recover $1.76 billion worth of cryptocurrency sent to the exchange as part of a July 2021 repurchase deal.

Waves founder Aleksandr Ivanov is also in the crosshairs for $80 million worth of crypto sent to the Waves-based decentralized liquidity protocol by Alameda Research in 2022.

 An Arkansas crypto mining group has taken action against two state officials who they claim enforced an unconstitutional law restricting a foreign-born US citizen's mining activities. 

The Arkansas Cryptomining Association is suing two Arkansas state officials, arguing that they enforced an unconstitutional and discriminatory state rule prohibiting foreign-born American citizens from engaging in crypto-mining activities, among other things.

The complaint was made against Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin and the director of the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission, Lawrence Bengal, on March 13 in the US District Court Eastern District of Arkansas. 

It follows a federal court ruling last November that temporarily barred Arkansas from preventing a naturalized US citizen of Chinese descent from operating a crypto mining business.

The Arkansas state rules concerned are “Rule K” and “Act 174,” which prohibits foreign-party controlled businesses in the state.

Director Connor L. Kempton of the Arkansas Cryptomining Association said the vagueness of Rule K and Act 174 gives the defendants arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement powers, enabling them to grant or deny permits at their own discretion.

He said the application of Rule K and Act 174 is unconstitutional and can be discriminatory based on race, alienage and national origin, among other things.

Kempton noted that these rules were enforced against crypto mining firm Jones Eagle LLC, which is run by Qimin “Jimmy” Chen, a naturalized US citizen of Chinese origin.

Kempton specifically pointed to the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution in arguing the illegality of Rule K and Act 174.

Related: Russia bans crypto mining for 6 years in 10 regions

The Equal Protection Clause similarly prohibits the US states from denying any person equal protection of the laws based on the person's race, alienage or national origin. 

The crypto mining executive also argued that Rule K and Act 174 strip American citizens like Chen of due process rights under the 14th Amendment.

Kempton also said the prohibitions and penalties imposed under Act 174 infringe on the federal government's authority to investigate, review and take action on foreign investments.

District Court Judge Kristine G. Baker said on Dec. 9 that the Arkansas state officials were barred from enforcing Act 174 against Jones Eagle until further notice.

 Vermont was one of 10 US states that launched legal action against Coinbase in 2023, alleging the exchange was offering unregistered securities to users. 

US state Vermont has dropped its “show cause order” against crypto exchange Coinbase for allegedly offering unregistered securities to users through a staking service.

Vermont's Department of Financial Regulation said in a March 13 order that in light of the US Securities and Exchange Commission tossing out its case on Feb. 28, it would follow suit and rescind its action against Coinbase without prejudice.

“The SEC has announced the formation of a new task force to, among other things, provide guidance for the promulgation of rules regarding the regulation of cryptocurrency products and services,” the department said.

“In light of the dismissal of the Federal Action and likelihood of new federal regulatory guidance, the Division believes it would be most efficient and in the best interests of justice to rescind the pending Show Cause Order, without prejudice.”

On the same day the SEC filed its lawsuit in June 2023, the US states of Alabama, California, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin said they were launching legal proceedings against Coinbase.

The show cause order asserted that Coinbase was violating securities laws by offering staking to its users without a license and demanded the exchange provide a reason why the courts shouldn't hit them with an order directing them to halt the service. 

Now that Vermont has opted out, Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal said in a March 13 statement to X that the other states with staking actions should take a “page from Vermont's playbook.”

“As we have always said: staking services are not securities. We applaud Vermont for embracing progress and providing clarity for its citizens who own digital assets,” he said.

“Our work isn't over. Congress must seize the bipartisan momentum we're seeing across the House and Senate to pass comprehensive legislation that takes into account the novel features of digital assets, such as staking,” he added.

A growing number of firms facing legal action from the SEC have had their cases dismissed in the wake of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who took a hardline stance toward crypto, resigning on Jan. 20.

Crypto trading firm Cumberland DRW was among the latest to have its case dropped on March 4, while the regulator is reportedly wrapping up its enforcement action against Ripple Labs after more than four years.

Grewal has also launched a request under the Freedom of Information Act to find out how many enforcement actions were brought against crypto firms under Gensler's tenure between April 17, 2021, and Jan. 20, 2025, and the cost to the taxpayer.

 Despite Bitcoin's decline since Trump's win, analysts say it is not the worst crypto downturn in history, pointing to past cycles with deeper losses and less liquidity. 

The cryptocurrency market has faced a significant downturn since the start of 2025, with some investors calling it the most painful cycle in history.

Some were disappointed about industry policy changes and the memecoin craze in the United States, while others even speculated about talent leaving the sector for other industries.

However, while the current crypto market state might look grim to some, the current cycle is far from being the most brutal on record, and many community members remain bullish.

“For those who have been through multiple cycles, this is just part of the process,” Trezor analyst Lucien Bourdon told Cointelegraph.

The current decline in crypto markets came after Bitcoin (BTC) reached an all-time high above $106,000 in December 2024, with the spike largely attributed to optimism around Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election.

While many were optimistic, some investors, such as BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, accurately predicted a crypto sell-off following Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20.

Since then, Bitcoin has tumbled more than 18%, with the total crypto market capitalization erasing almost all gains that came from Trump's election win, dropping 25%.

In the post-Trump inauguration sale, investors offloaded about $4.6 billion from crypto exchange-traded products by March 7, while the spot market saw even more outflows, with at least $1 billion in liquidations in a single day on March 3.

But the most recent sell-off is not the worst on record. “If we're talking about the worst Bitcoin cycle, 2014–2015 was possibly the most brutal,” Trezor's Bourdon told Cointelegraph.

Referring to the collapse of the Mt. Gox crypto exchange, which suffered an 850,000 BTC loss in a security breach in 2024, the analyst highlighted the event as the worst Bitcoin sell-off on record.

“The Mt. Gox collapse wiped out 70% of Bitcoin's trading volume, leading to an 85% drawdown in a market with no institutional support and far less liquidity,” Bourdon said.

According to Brett Reeves, head of BitGo's European sales, there is a “great deal more to just falling pieces” in the current market.

In addition to bigger price downturns in the past, Reeves highlighted notable advancements in global crypto products and regulation, which point to crypto assets increasingly becoming integral to the international financial system. He said:

Contrary to crypto doubters and pessimists, some industry executives even see the current market cycle as a bull market.

	This wasn't the first time a spacecraft watched an eclipse from the moon

From the surface of the moon, the Firefly lander captured this photo of a lunar eclipse — or from its perspective, a solar eclipse — on March 14 at 4:30 am EDT, capturing the ""diamond ring"" effect of the sun about to emerge from totality from behind Earth.

The privately-owned Blue Ghost moon lander, built by Texas-based company Firefly Aerospace, has captured rare views of a lunar eclipse from the moon's surface.

The lander, which touched down March 2 in a volcanic plain on the moon's nearside, has spent its time deploying instruments and collecting data. On the night of March 13, as Earth's shadow covered the moon in a total lunar eclipse, Blue Ghost turned its cameras back toward Earth. 

Around 4:30 a.m. EDT, the lander captured the “diamond ring effect,” as a single point of sunlight emerged from behind our planet at the end of totality. Earth itself, appearing as a dark disk in the black lunar sky, is encircled by glowing ring of light.

The first image from the eclipse, captured about three hours earlier, was deceptive — the sun appeared to still be shining brightly. But a reflection in the lander's solar panels revealed an otherwise hidden detail: an arc of light wreathing Earth with just a spot of sunlight sneaking through. 

Since landing, the spacecraft has put eight of its 10 science instruments to work. These include a device that uses a blast of pressurized nitrogen gas to collect and sort lunar soil; a dust shield demonstration, using electrical forces to lift lunar dirt from glass surfaces, which could help keep future spacecraft clean of famously sticky moondust; another experiment to measure the stickiness of that dust; a drill to measure heat flow from the moon's interior; and an experiment to test a form of lunar GPS.

Cameras on the lander's underside also took a video of the lander's engine plumes interacting with the lunar surface, which could provide insights for making future landings smoother and cleaner.

This is not the first time a spacecraft has observed an eclipse from the lunar vicinity. In 2009, the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency's Kaguya orbiter saw a penumbral eclipse, in which the Earth mostly blocked the sun. And NASA's Surveyor 3 moon lander saw an eclipse way back in 1967.

Narwhals wield their iconic tusks in surprising ways — possibly even to play with newfound toys.

Aerial videos showed the Arctic whales swinging their “horns” to thwack fish prior to eating them, and in one case, gingerly prodding and flipping a fish. The gentler movements may have been part of a narwhal play session, researchers report February 28 in Frontiers in Marine Science. It's the first reported evidence of narwhals (Monodon monoceros) likely amusing themselves for fun.

Few scientists have seen the apparent unicorns of the sea brandishing their tusks in the wild. The elongated, spiraled tooth protrudes from the top lip of males and some females, and can grow to around half the body length of the roughly 4.5-meter-long whales. Scientists suspect the tusk evolved in males to show off to or compete (even literally) for mates. But past research has found it has other benefits, like sensing changes in water temperature and salinity.

Although newer technologies involving genetics, satellite tagging and aerial counts and mapping have led to breakthroughs in whale research, they provide only snapshots of what the animals do, says behavioral ecologist and geneticist Greg O'Corry-Crowe of Florida Atlantic University in Fort Pierce. He wanted to try what he calls an “old-style natural history and behavioral observation.”

Using a remotely operated flying drone, O'Corry-Crowe and colleagues spent hours filming narwhals swimming in an island bay in the Canadian High Arctic in the summer of 2022. One recording captured three narwhals among several Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), chasing fish and occasionally swinging their tusks like baseball bats to stun fish before chowing down. Another video showed three narwhals following a large char, with one whale taking the lead in lightly nudging and flipping the fish with the tip or side of its tusk, altering the fish's path.

The second recording may have shown two species that don't regularly interact investigating one another, as little evidence implies that narwhals normally eat char, and they do most of the year's hunting and dining in the winter, O'Corry-Crowe says. “There's this tentativeness,” he explains. “The fish makes a dramatic movement, and even the big animal just recoils and goes whoa!” Aspects of the scene, such as the narwhals' low-stress environment, their repeated actions with their tusks and the fact that they didn't try to eat the fish, suggested the whales were playing.

Because of the Arctic's harsh environment, people often think creatures residing there are constantly fighting to survive, O'Corry-Crowe says. But the new study hints that sometimes these animals have time to explore — and possibly play — during their “summer vacation.”

About 10 minutes with a therapy dog soothed kids who felt anxious about being emergency room patients.

A clinical trial found that after spending time with a dog, young patients reported a significantly larger decrease in their anxiety than kids who didn't have dog time. The patients' parents also perceived significantly reduced anxiety in their kids, researchers report March 14 in JAMA Network Open.

Managing kids' anxiety and pain while receiving emergency medical care is a key part of the treatment plan, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Many pediatric emergency departments have child life specialists, who explain procedures in developmentally appropriate ways and help young patients cope with stress through play therapy and other methods.

The new clinical trial, which took place at Riley Children's Hospital in Indianapolis from early 2023 to mid-2024, investigated whether adding a dog therapy visit would calm young patients even further. Riley Children's Hospital has a dog therapy program in place. The dogs are vaccinated, have yearly vet checks and are certified as therapy animals.

All 80 participants in the trial, admitted patients 5 to 17 years old, worked with child life specialists. Forty of the patients also spent around 10 minutes with a therapy dog and the dog's handler. Kids who were fearful of dogs or had allergies to the animals were excluded from the trial.

The research team evaluated the kids' anxiety, and parents' perception of their kids' anxiety, with the FACES scale, which shows a series of faces in different amounts of distress. The scale ranges from zero, or no anxiety, to 10, or very severe anxiety.

The baseline, self-reported score for all 80 patients was 5.4 on average. Forty-five minutes after time with the child life specialists and, for those receiving it, the dog therapy visit, the research team assessed anxiety again. The kids getting the usual care saw an average drop in their score of 1.5, while the kids who hung out with therapy dogs had an average drop of 2.7 points. The pattern held true when the parents of the kids assessed their kids' anxiety over time.

Someone taking a walk in the snowy hills near the Swiss capital of Bern last winter would have been perplexed by a giant white balloon rising into the low-lying clouds. Near the hilltop where the balloon was tethered, they would have found a group of researchers launching a drone, then flying it upwind to sprinkle crystals of silver powder into the fog.

“We use the natural cloud as a laboratory,” says Ulrike Lohmann at ETH Zurich in Switzerland, a member…

Skywatchers snapped photos of the ""blood moon"" hovering above North and South America last night. Here's a gallery of images to celebrate the total lunar eclipse.

A ""blood moon"" was visible from Earth last night, marking the first total lunar eclipse since 2022.

A total lunar eclipse occurs when a full moon passes directly through Earth's shadow, casting our planet's natural satellite in a reddish, blood-like hue — often called a blood moon.

Skywatchers across the Americas snapped photographs of this unusual phenomenon as the moon completed its lunar phase on Thursday night and into Friday morning (March 13 to 14).



In North America, one photographer captured the ""blood moon"" rising over the Statue of Liberty in New York, while another caught it peaking out of the clouds above the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.

Further south, photos revealed the moon passing by the Little Prince monument in El Salvador and the Young Woman of Amajac statue in Mexico City.



A lunar eclipse is the opposite of a solar eclipse, when the moon slides between Earth and the sun. During a lunar eclipse, the moon travels behind Earth relative to the position of the sun, meaning the satellite is cast in shadow.

The moon is still visible during this lunar phase because some light from the sun refracts through Earth's atmosphere and hits the satellite before reflecting back to the surface of our planet facing the moon. The sun projects a spectrum of different colors in its light — the seven colors of the rainbow, plus infrared and ultraviolet light. However, particles in Earth's atmosphere scatter blues and other short-wavelength light, while allowing the longer-wavelength oranges and reds to pass through — similar to a sunset or sunrise — and then splash onto the moon.

Not every full moon results in a lunar eclipse. The event only happens when the moon is perfectly aligned behind our planet. If that alignment is slightly off, then the sun's light can still directly reach some of the moon — meaning it's a partial eclipse.

The next total lunar eclipse will occur on the night of Sept. 7 to 8, but it will only be visible in western North America. Around this time next year, there will be another blood moon that will be visible in all of North America.

The End-Permian mass extinction killed an estimated 80% of life on Earth, but new research suggests that plants might have done okay. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The mass extinction that killed 80% of life on Earth 250 million years ago may not have been quite so disastrous for plants, new fossils hint. Scientists have identified a refuge in China where it seems that plants weathered the planet's worst die-off.

The end-Permian mass extinction, also known as the ""Great Dying,"" took place 251.9 million years ago. At that time, the supercontinent Pangea was in the process of breaking up, but all land on Earth was still largely clustered together, with the newly formed continents separated by shallow seas. An enormous eruption from a volcanic system called the Siberian Traps seem to have pushed carbon dioxide levels to extremes: A 2021 study estimated that atmospheric CO2 got as high as 2,500 parts per million (ppm) in this period, compared with current levels of 425 ppm. This caused global warming and ocean acidification, leading to a massive collapse of the ocean ecosystem.

The situation on land is far hazier. Only a handful of places around the world have rock layers containing fossils from land ecosystems at the end of the Permian and beginning of the Triassic.

A new study of one of these spots — located in what is now northeastern China —revealed a refuge where the ecosystem remained relatively healthy despite the Great Dying. In this place, seed-producing gymnosperm forests continued to grow, complemented by spore-producing ferns.

""At least in this place, we don't see mass extinction of plants,"" study co-author Wan Yang, a professor of geology and geophysics at the Missouri University of Science and Technology, told Live Science.

The finding, published Wednesday (March 12) in the journal Science Advances, adds weight to the idea that the Great Dying was more complicated on land than in the seas, Yang said.



Yang and his colleagues looked at rock layers in Xinjiang that span the mass extinction event.

A major advantage of this now-desert site is that the rocks include layers of ash that hold tiny crystals called zircons. The zircons include radioactive elements — lead and uranium — that gradually decay, which enables researchers to determine how long it has been since the crystals formed. This means the researchers can more accurately date the rock layers here than they can at other sites.

Some of these layers also hold fossil spores and pollen. These fossils reveal that there wasn't a massive die-off and repopulation but a slow changeover of species, Yang said.

This is consistent with other evidence from Africa and Argentina, where plant populations seemed to have shifted gradually rather than dying off dramatically and then repopulating, said Josefina Bodnar, a paleobotanist at the National University of La Plata in Argentina who was not involved in the research.

Land plants ""have a lot of adaptations that allow them to survive this extinction,"" Bodnar told Live Science. ""For example, [they have] subterranean structures, roots or stems, that can survive perhaps hundreds of years."" Seeds can also persist a long time, she added.



This survival may have been particularly possible at humid, high-latitude regions. The site in Xinjiang was once dotted with lakes and rivers, a few hundred miles from the coast. Other places where plant refuges have been found, such as Argentina, were also high-latitude in the Permian, far from the equator where temperatures were the hottest.

Yang and his colleagues found that during the late Permian and early Triassic, the climate became a bit drier in what is now Xinjiang — but not enough to cause deforestation.

This may have been a consequence of location, said Devin Hoffman, a researcher in paleontology at University College London who was not involved in the new study. Marine animals had no escape from global ocean acidification. But climate change on land wasn't uniform. The impact would have been most pronounced in the center of Pangea, which was a vast desert.

This means that in more temperate regions on land, survival could have been possible, Hoffman told Live Science. ""You essentially have everything being pushed toward the poles and towards the coast, but on land you're able to escape some of the effects,"" he said.



These findings have led to some debate over whether the greatest mass extinction ever deserves the moniker on land. ""I will call it a crisis on land. I will not call it an extinction,"" said Robert Gastaldo, an emeritus professor of Geology at Colby College who was not involved in the new study, but who has collaborated with Yang in the past.

—Fearsome saber-toothed giant dominated at dawn of 'Great Dying', but its reign was short-lived

The end-Permian extinction is particularly interesting to scientists because it was driven by greenhouse gases, much like climate change today. The situation was far more extreme then: The polar ice caps melted completely — a situation that would cause sea levels to rise a staggering 230 feet (70 meters) today.

But humans may be nearly as deadly as giant volcanoes. A 2020 study, for example, found that a smaller extinction event at the end of the Triassic (201 million years ago) was driven by greenhouse gas pulses from volcanoes that were on a similar scale to what humans are expected to emit by the end of this century. Studying these ancient catastrophes can give us a sense of what to expect under atmospheric carbon dioxide levels people have never experienced, Gastaldo said.

""The planet has experienced it,"" he said. ""The planet's memory is in the rock record. And we can learn from the rock record what happens to our planet under these extreme conditions.""

Are there mathematical ways to prove that pi is an irrational number that has no end?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Originally defined as the ratio between the circumference of a circle and its diameter, pi — written as the Greek letter π — appears throughout mathematics, including in areas that are completely unconnected to circles such as chemistry, physical sciences and medicine.

Pi belongs to a huge mathematical group called irrational numbers, which go on forever and cannot be written as fractions. Scientists have calculated pi to 105 trillion digits, although most of us are more familiar with the approximation 3.14. But how do we know that pi is an irrational number?

Rational numbers, which make up the majority of numbers we use in day-to-day life (although less than half of all possible numbers), can be written in the form of one whole number divided by another. Pi, with its complicated string of decimals, certainly doesn't appear to be part of this group at first glance.

""Rationality is the practical property of having access to the number explicitly, i.e. without any approximation … so being able to write the number in a finite amount of symbols,"" Wadim Zudilin, a mathematician at Radboud University in the Netherlands, told Live Science.

Related: What is the largest known prime number?

However, actually proving that you can't write pi as a fraction is a surprisingly knotty issue. Mathematicians don't have a universal method to show that a particular number is irrational, so they must develop a different proof for each case, explained Keith Conrad, a mathematician at the University of Connecticut. ""How do you know a number is not a fraction?"" he said. ""You're trying to verify a negative property.""

Despite this difficulty, over the past 300 years, mathematicians have established different proofs of pi's irrationality, using techniques from across mathematics. Each of these arguments begins with the assumption that pi is rational, written in the form of an equation. Through a series of manipulations and deductions about the properties of the unknown values in this equation, it subsequently becomes clear that the math contradicts this original assertion, leading to the conclusion that pi must be irrational.

Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

The specific math involved is often incredibly complex, typically requiring a university-level understanding of calculus, trigonometry and infinite series. However, each approach relies on this central idea of proof by contradiction.

""There are proofs using calculus and trigonometric functions,"" Conrad said. ""In some of them, π is singled out as the first positive solution to sin(x) = 0. The first proof by Lambert in the 1760s used a piece of mathematics called infinite continued fractions — it's a kind of infinitely nested fraction.""

However, rather than proving pi is irrational directly, it's also possible to confirm irrationality using a different property of the number. Pi belongs to another numerical group called transcendental numbers, which are not algebraic and, importantly, cannot be written as the root of a polynomial equation. Because every transcendental number is irrational, any proof showing that pi is transcendental also proves that pi is irrational.

—Who was the first cyborg?

—Could monkeys really type the complete works of Shakespeare?

""Using calculus with complex numbers, you can prove π is transcendental,"" Conrad said. ""The proof uses the very famous equation called Euler's identity: eiπ +1 = 0.""

Although pi's universal importance may arise from this intangible irrationality, seven or eight decimal places is usually more than sufficient for any real-world applications. Even NASA uses only 16 digits of pi for its calculations.

""We approximate the value for practical purposes, 3.1415926 — that's already a lot of information!"" Zudilin said. ""But of course in mathematics, it's not satisfactory. We care about the nature of the numbers.""

Dark energy, the mysterious phenomenon that powers the expansion of the universe, may undergo periodic 'violent transitions' that reverse the growth of the cosmos, a new pre-print study hints.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Dark energy may have switched directions sometime in the distant past — and this violent transition may explain why cosmological observations aren't adding up, researchers propose in a new paper.

The modern picture of the evolution of the universe is known as ΛCDM (or lambda-CDM), for dark energy (represented by the Greek letter Λ) and cold dark matter. Dark energy is the mysterious force driving the accelerating expansion of the universe, and cold dark matter refers to the mysterious, invisible substance that provides most of the mass of almost every single galaxy.

This model has explained a wide variety of observations, such as the behavior of galaxies and clusters, the growth of large-scale structures, and the appearance of the cosmic microwave background. But in recent years, two troubling tensions have popped up.

One such problem, known as the Hubble tension, is a difference in measuring the present-day expansion rate of the universe, a number known as the Hubble constant. Probes of the distant, early universe seem to be giving estimates significantly lower than probes of the nearby, late universe do.

Related: After 2 years in space, the James Webb telescope has broken cosmology. Can it be fixed?

Related to this issue is the second problem, known as the sigma-8 tension. This is a measure of how clumpy matter is in the universe, and once again, different probes are yielding different results.

Something in the ΛCDM model has to be wrong, but we're not sure what. One hypothesis is that dark energy might be more dynamic than we originally thought. In the usual ΛCDM picture, dark energy is a cosmological constant. It stays the same through cosmic history.

But in a recent model that's been gaining interest, dark energy changes. And not by a little; it undergoes a complete phase transition, from decelerating the universe to accelerating the universe.

Now, adding a twist to that theory, a research team has explored the possibility that the phase change is even more dramatic. In a paper posted to the preprint server arXiv in February but not yet peer-reviewed, dark energy doesn't just switch signs; it also changes strength, so that it powers an acceleration differently than it powers a deceleration.

Then, the researchers tested their model against a wide variety of observations and datasets. These included the Planck space observatory's measurements of the cosmic microwave background, the oldest light we can see in the universe; a measurement of a phenomenon called the baryon acoustic oscillation, a pattern in the arrangement of galaxies at very large scales; the Pantheon dataset of supernova distance measures; and a weak lensing map that provides details accounting for the effects of dark matter.

—Cosmic voids may explain the universe's acceleration without dark energy

—'Heavy' dark matter would rip our understanding of the universe apart, new research suggests

—Something invisible and 'fuzzy' may lurk at the Milky Way's center, new research suggests

They found that the new model alleviated some of the Hubble and sigma-8 tensions, and thus they contend that this approach might be a promising way forward.

That said, the researchers noted that this model isn't exactly grounded in known physics. It's just a toy, a way to explore the physical consequences of a model without knowing the underlying physics. But because it seems like a promising direction, this approach could motivate theorists to come up with mechanisms to explain how dark energy might switch like this.

No matter what, it appears that the universe — especially dark energy — is more complicated than we assumed.

Chinese scientists have unveiled an artificial intelligence (AI) ""agent"" that makes its own decisions without requiring specific instructions from a human operator.

The AI agent, Manus, was developed by Chinese startup Butterfly Effect. Its representatives claim it is the world's first general AI agent — meaning it demonstrates a level of autonomy that current AI models lack. The scientists who created Manus say it shows a potential glimpse of what artificial general intelligence (AGI) may one day be capable of.

This emerging type of AI responds to text prompts, similar to chatbots such as ChatGPT or DeepSeek. However, unlike chatbots, they work on different tasks, without the need for frequent, step-by-step instructions.

Manus isn't available to the general public yet, but a limited distribution of invite codes has given a select few access, sparking a flurry of interest online. Some users appear to have created playable video games from simple prompts, while others have used Manus to design and launch websites.

It's still early days for Manus, however, with some users reporting crashes and other issues such as a tendency to get stuck in an infinite feedback loop. The company is also aware of relatively high failure rates in Manus versus ChatGPT. Chief scientist Peak Ji acknowledged these as part of the teething issues in launching a new tool on the social media platform X.

Reporter Caiwei Chen, who had access to Manus for MIT Technology Review, wrote that the experience was ""like collaborating with a highly intelligent and efficient intern."" However, Chen also noted that Manus sometimes lacked understanding of what it was supposed to do, made incorrect assumptions and cut corners. ""Ultimately, it's promising but not perfect,"" Chen wrote.

Manus AI is the second Chinese AI tool to send shock waves through the tech industry this year. In January, DeepSeek changed the landscape of AI by achieving similar or better chatbot results than its American competitors for reportedly a fraction of the cost. Manus, on the other hand, could represent the first of an entirely new generation of AI.

Chatbots usually run on a single large language model (LLM), while Manus uses multiple LLMs and other independently operating software to work autonomously on a variety of tasks, MIT Technology Review reported. This is also known as a multi-agent architecture, in which multiple components communicate and collaborate to process tasks.



In a head-to-head between Manus and ChatGPT, the agent will often provide more detailed responses than the chatbot — a claim which the company has reinforced with testing data from the GAIA benchmark. However, Manus also takes a lot longer to provide those responses as it does deeper research, Tom's Guide reported.

In other words, Manus will effectively go its own way and figure out what to do in response to a prompt, rather than relying on step-by-step instructions like a chatbot does. It's designed to start tasks on its own and dynamically adjust its approach along the way, Forbes reported.

—AGI could now arrive as early as 2026 — but not all scientists agree

—'Math Olympics' has a new contender — Google's AI now 'better than human gold medalists' at solving geometry problems

—Older AI models show signs of cognitive decline, study shows — but not everyone is entirely convinced

Give Manus a single prompt, and it will navigate the web, write code and analyze data for its reply, without requiring further intervention as a conventional LLM-powered chatbot would.

Some examples Manus AI has demonstrated on its website include planning a detailed holiday itinerary, analyzing the stock market and screening job resumes. The difference between this and a tool like ChatGPT is that Manus can break down and complete complex tasks without continuous input. The system works from the cloud, too, so users can close their computers at any time, and Manus will keep working in the background.

The arrival of a general AI agent brings a new wave of ethical questions and considerations surrounding the use of AI. Agents behave more like humans, but unlike humans, they can work fast and continuously — provided they don't crash — and never get tired.

Mount Washington is a prominent mountain in New Hampshire, known for its dramatic weather and conditions that are extremely dangerous for hikers and climbers.

Name: Mount Washington

Location: New Hampshire

Coordinates: 44.270631129317565, -71.30324713195401

Why it's incredible: The mountain has some of the wildest weather on Earth.

Mount Washington is the tallest peak in the Northeast. The mountain is famous for attracting extreme weather, with winds that exceed the force of a hurricane more than 100 days per year.

The mountain is home to ""the world's worst weather"" for three main reasons. Firstly, at 6,288 feet (1,917 meters) tall, it is the highest mountain in New England. Winds pick up speed when they can blow unobstructed, and the mountain is directly exposed to winds from the west that travel for hundreds of miles without obstruction. The closest mountains of a similar height to Mount Washington along this westerly windpath are the Black Hills of South Dakota about 1,600 miles (2,500 kilometers) away, according to the Mount Washington Observatory.

Not only do these winds hit Mount Washington at full speed but they are also siphoned toward the peak by the surrounding landscape. The mountains to the west of Mount Washington form a 75-mile-wide (120 km) funnel that channels westerly winds toward the mountain, accelerating already-fast winds until they reach breakneck speeds, according to the observatory.

Finally, Mount Washington sits on the confluence of three major storm tracks. Storms hit the summit every three days on average in the winter, bringing high winds and huge amounts of precipitation, according to the observatory. Record levels of precipitation for Mount Washington were measured in 1969, when 4.1 feet (1.3 m) of snow fell within 24 hours.

As a result of its unique position, Mount Washington is a contender for the world's fastest recorded wind speed. On ""calm"" summer days, instruments on Mount Washington's summit record wind speeds of 40 mph (65 km/h). But when storms roll in, these winds can whip up gusts exceeding 100 mph (160 km/h).

In the midst of making sure instruments were working well, the summit crew took some time to show us (safely) what 100mph winds looked like... and had some fun doing it. Tune in tonight at 5pm for the weekend's Higher Summits Forecast on Facebook Live. pic.twitter.com/6TSShijLgkMarch 7, 2025

On April 12, 1934, instruments at the summit measured a record wind speed of 231 mph (372 km/h), which is equivalent to wind speeds inside a level-5 tornado on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. Such winds have the power to level well-constructed buildings, blow away structures with weak foundations and throw cars over large distances. The record still stands today as the second-fastest natural wind gust ever recorded, with the fastest occurring on Barrow Island in Australia on April 10, 1996 and reaching speeds of 253 mph (407 km/h).

Even wind speeds of 100 mph can rip huge chunks of ice off the mountain and the Mount Washington Observatory building at the summit, which poses a severe risk for hikers and climbers in the winter. The observatory has bulletproof windows to mitigate the risk of one of these chunks smashing into the building, according to its website.

As well as flying ice, people climbing Mount Washington in the winter are faced with the risk of avalanches, hypothermia and frostbite. Temperatures on the mountain average 27.1 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 2.7 degrees Celsius), which can create extreme wind chill conditions, according to New Hampshire State Parks.

Several rescue teams monitor Mount Washington, and volunteers regularly save the lives of hikers who get lost or caught out by changing weather conditions.

As one of the most famous scientists of the 20th century, Albert Einstein has become synonymous with genius. He taught himself geometry and calculus while living in Germany in his teens before training in Switzerland to become a math teacher. Unable to find a teaching position, Einstein bounced around until he completed a doctorate in physics in 1905 and began publishing groundbreaking scientific papers that ultimately changed the world.

But Einstein had other interests that are less well known — he was a staunch pacifist, invented an early refrigerator and called himself a ""deeply religious non-believer.""

People find responses from artificial intelligence (AI) to be more compassionate and understanding than those from human mental health experts, a new study shows. The finding again demonstrates that AI can outperform humans in fields in which we've long assumed only people with shared experience are good at.

In the study, published Jan. 10 in the journal Communications Psychology, scientists conducted a series of four experiments to find out how 550 participants rated empathetic responses for compassion and responsiveness generated by AI versus those from professionals. Specifically, the participants gave information about personal experiences and then assessed the answers for compassion, responsiveness and overall preference.

The tests revealed that AI responses were considered more compassionate than those from professional crisis responders, even when the author of the responses was revealed to the participants.

The results suggest AI has uses in ""contexts requiring empathetic interaction, with the potential to address the increasing need for empathy in supportive communication contexts,"" the researchers wrote in the study.

On average, AI-generated responses were rated 16% more compassionate than human responses and were preferred 68% of the time, even when compared to trained crisis responders.

Study lead author Dariya Ovsyannikova, a lab manager at the University of Toronto's psychology department, attributed the AI's success to its ability to identify fine details and stay objective as crisis experiences were described. This made the AI better able to generate attentive communication that gave the user the illusion of empathy. At the same time, the humans may have performed worse because human responders are susceptible to fatigue and burnout, she added.

Live Science asked Eleanor Watson, IEEE member, AI ethics engineer and AI faculty at Singularity University, what the finding means, not just for the future of AI-human interactions but the ongoing debate about which jobs AI can't or shouldn't do when human understanding and input seems critical.

Watson called the finding ""fascinating"" but wasn't altogether surprised. ""[AI] can certainly model supportive responses with a remarkable consistency and apparent empathy, something that humans struggle to maintain due to fatigue and cognitive biases,"" she told Live Science.

""Human practitioners are constrained by their direct clinical experience and cognitive limitations. The scale of data AI can process fundamentally changes the equation of therapeutic support. It can also potentially enable patients to gain perspectives or approaches their therapist has not been trained in,"" she said.

Globally, mental health care is in crisis, and the study raises the possibility of AI filling the gaps. According to the World Health Organization, more than two-thirds of people with mental health conditions don't get the care they need. In low and middle income countries that figure rises to 85%.

Watson said the ease in accessing AI versus human therapists could make it a useful tool to help with mental health provision. ""The availability of machines is a welcome factor, especially compared with expensive practitioners whose time is limited,"" Watson said.

""Also, people often find dealing with a machine less daunting, particularly with more sensitive topics. There's less fear of judgment or gossip.""

But finding AI-generated responses more empathetic doesn't come without risks. Watson warned of the specter of supernormal stimulus, which is the tendency to respond more strongly to an exaggerated version of a stimulus.

—AI can 'fake' empathy but also encourage Nazism, disturbing study suggests

—People are falling in love with AI. Should we worry?

—Many kids are unsure if Alexa and Siri have feelings or think like people, study finds

""AI is so enticing we become entranced by it,"" Watson said. ""AI can be flirty, insightful, enlightening, fun, provocative, forbearing and accessible to the point where it's impossible for any human being to measure up.""

Content about mental health also exacerbates the privacy issues associated with AI. ""The privacy implications are stark,"" Watson noted. ""Having access to people's deepest vulnerabilities and struggles makes them vulnerable to various forms of attack and demoralization. Scrupulous governance of systems and the organizations behind them must be upheld to defend against exploitation by bad actors.""

Sound the alarms! DEFCON1! No team has been hit harder this offseason than the 49ers, and right on the heels of a season when no franchise was more ravaged by injuries than San Francisco. The 49ers lost a large contingent of household names that helped them dominate the NFC for the last five-plus years, headlined by the likes of Deebo Samuel, Dre Greenlaw, Talanoa Hufanga, Charvarius Ward and Kyle Juszczyk, among others.

Looking up and down this list, they've lost almost half their starters as they attempt to shed salary with Brock Purdy's massive contract extension looming.

The natural reaction to this exodus would be to suggest the 49ers' Super Bowl window is closed. After all, this is a historic amount of losses. Through four days of free agency, other teams have spent $321 million on 49ers free agents, the most on a team's departing free agents in NFL history. San Francisco has also only doled out $37 million through four days of free agency. That adds up to the worst free agent spending deficit ($284 million) in NFL history, by over $80 million! 

2025 49ers

-$284M

2025 Eagles

-$204M

2024 Dolphins

-$173M

2020 Cowboys

-$166M

Despite the historic numbers, this should be more of a quick reset for the 49ers rather than a major rebuild. This is the nature of free agency. Spending (or lack thereof) makes waves in the short term but they don't last. The worst teams are usually the ones going on spending sprees and are back to the well again a year or two later. The best teams keep their cores together and reload in the draft while other teams overpay for their free agents.

Recent history would agree the 49ers' losses could sting in 2025, but they should rebound beyond that. I averaged the five worst free agent spending deficits in each offseason since 2016 and found that no group improved their win total on average that year. Like I said, the short term is usually tough.

The 49ers are an extreme case, though, so let's look at the teams with the single worst free agent spending deficit in each of the last 15 offseasons. From the list below, only the 2018 Patriots even won a playoff game that year (they happened to win the Super Bowl).

However, on that list, you'll notice the Ravens, Steelers, Cowboys, Chiefs and Eagles have been able to win pretty consistently since their ""worst"" offseasons.

So, am I hitting the panic button even though the 49ers have a bunch of holes to fill? Not at all. Neither are oddsmakers.

According to FanDuel, the 49ers' odds to win Super Bowl LX are still sixth-best in the NFL. They've barely changed (14-1 to 15-1) since the Eagles won it all last month.

This is not 2015, when San Francisco lost Jim Harbaugh, Frank Gore, Michael Crabtree, Patrick Willis, Justin Smith, Aldon Smith, Mike Iupati, Chris Borland and Anthony Davis. Now, that was one of the worst offseasons any team has ever had. 

This 49ers team still has its core. The most important players are here, plus Kyle Shanahan and John Lynch are still running the show. 

DE Nick Bosa

WR Brandon Aiyuk

RB Christian McCaffrey

2027

LT Trent Williams

2026

LB Fred Warner

2026

TE George Kittle

2025

QB Brock Purdy

2025

It's an aging core with McCaffrey, Williams and Kittle, plus the prime years of Bosa, Warner and Aiyuk are precious, but there are even reasons to believe the 49ers could still make some noise this upcoming season. 

One silver lining for the 49ers coming off a last-place finish in the NFC West is they have the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL in 2025 based on opponent record in 2024 (.415). They also play in a very winnable division where the biggest threat is the Rams, who are coming off back-to-back 10-7 seasons. 

Many of the 49ers losses this offseason were either on the decline, injury prone or both. Samuel clearly lacked his usual explosiveness last year. Greenlaw and Hufanga had major injury concerns. Aaron Banks was obscenely overpaid for an average guard and Javon Hargrave is 32 coming off a season-ending injury. 

Plus, the return of Robert Saleh should boost a 49ers defense that struggled in 2024. 

Here's a closer look at what's next for the 49ers to ensure they remain competitive going forward despite the historic offseason losses. 

The 49ers are moving on from all these players to clear cap space for Purdy's contract extension. He had a cap hit worth $1 million last year, 66th among quarterbacks. I expect it'll be north of $50 million going forward, among the highest in the league. The 49ers don't have the luxury of the veteran depth they had in previous years with a quarterback on a rookie contract, and they are going to bite the bullet in 2025 with the most dead money ($77 million) in the NFL. It makes sense to deal with all of the dead money in 2025 as they play the easiest schedule in the NFL. 

This front office believes they can build a winner around Purdy for years to come, whether the rest of us do or not, is another question.

After Samuel was traded to Washington, general manager John Lynch acknowledged the 49ers were listening to calls from other teams on Brandon Aiyuk, who is coming off a torn ACL and is tied for the fifth-highest paid wide receiver in the NFL ($30 million per year). The 49ers could decide he is no longer worth that price tag coming off the injury, especially if the draft capital in return would be too good to refuse. 

The 49ers already have built-in replacements from the 2024 draft for some of their biggest losses this offseason. Ricky Pearsall showed flashes of why he was a first-round pick last year with two big games to end the year. San Francisco is banking on him picking up the slack after the Samuel trade. The 49ers found a gem with guard Dominick Puni in the third round, which should lessen the blow from Banks' departure. Renardo Green can make up for Ward's loss (he will start opposite Deommodore Lenoir, who got extended through 2029) and Malik Mustapha filled it capably for Hufanga last year.

The 49ers have certainly been hit-or-miss in the draft with this regime, but there's no denying they've hit some mid-to-late-round gems (Purdy, Warner, Kittle) and will have ample opportunity to strike again. They have 11 picks in the upcoming 2025 draft, tied with the Ravens and Dolphins for most in the NFL. They are always among the leaders in compensatory picks (four in 2025) and that will especially be true in the coming years with this year's departures.

The 49ers also have the No. 11 overall pick in a draft loaded with defensive line talent. They should be able to make up for some of the losses up front like Floyd, Hargrave and Collins. They can look to the Rams for a blueprint after they got Jared Verse and Braden Fiske in the first two rounds last year.

Free agency isn't over yet and San Francisco can make up for the loss of Greenlaw by signing former Cowboys linebacker Eric Kendricks, who is 33 years old and coming off a season with 138 tackles. He could be signed to an affordable one-year deal. The 49ers actually had a one-year deal in place with Kendricks last offseason before he changed his mind and went to Dallas.

So there's the draft, the 49ers core and a Purdy extension. Perhaps the thing that gives me the most confidence is Kyle Shanahan. He's still one of the best offensive minds in the league and should be highly motivated after a Super Bowl hangover in 2024. The 49ers were hit hard by injuries last year, but some of the struggles fall on Shanahan's shoulders. The 49ers did not have the same offensive firepower and creativity in 2024.

It'll be fascinating to see what Shanahan comes back with in 2025. The passing game should be better in some ways. San Francisco was dead last in average target separation last year per NFL Pro insights and they got rid of Samuel, who lost a step. 

The run game could be improved even though they released Juszczyk because they signed tight end Luke Farrell to a three-year deal worth over $20 million. The team will be switching from 21 personnel (2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE) to 12 personnel (1 RB, 2 WR, 2 TE).

All of this gives me reason to believe claims that the 49ers' Super Bowl window is closed are premature. My expectations are lower in 2025, but still high over the next few years with the core this team has.

There was a development in the ACC Tournament on Thursday that could have ramifications at both ends of the bracket.

Duke All-American freshman Cooper Flagg suffered a sprained ankle in the first half of the Blue Devils' win over Georgia Tech in the ACC quarterfinals. It is unknown how long he will be out, but Duke coach Jon Scheyer sounded very pessimistic that he would be able to play in Friday's semifinal against North Carolina.

That raises two questions: If North Carolina beats Duke, will it affect the Blue Devils' seed? And will the committee discount the win for the Tar Heels and keep them out of the tournament if they do not go on to win the ACC?

Let's start with what the committee will not do. It will not assume a result would be different if both teams were at full strength. The result is the result. North Carolina would likely find a spot in the bracket with a win Friday, while Duke is still a No. 1 seed even with a loss.

One thing that could possibly change that outcome for Duke is if Flagg were deemed out for the season and the committee felt that the team was diminished enough to warrant a seed change.

That has happened before, but it's been a while.  

In 2000, Cincinnati was the No. 1 team in the country led by National Player of the Year Kenyon Martin. In the first few minutes of the first game of their conference tournament, Martin broke his leg and was lost for the season. The Bearcats went on to lose that game, and the committee, thinking that Cincinnati was very much not the same without him, made them a 2-seed instead of the overall No.1. The Bearcats lost in the second round that year.

It is very unlikely that it could be determined whether Flagg will be out of the season before Selection Sunday, so this is not really the same situation as in 2000.  Still, if you are a Duke fan, you have to be concerned about the Blue Devils' prospects if this is an injury that lingers.

Check out Palm's bracket and full field of 68 at the Bracketology hub. 

The change in seed that is closest to the top of the bracket this morning is Texas Tech replacing Texas A&M as a 2-seed following the Aggies loss to Texas in the SEC Tournament. The Red Raiders beat Baylor in the Big 12 Tournament.

As for the bubble, only four teams are left standing now. Boise State beat San Diego State in the double bubble game on Thursday. The Broncos will face top seed New Mexico in the Mountain West semifinal on Friday.

The other bubble team in the Mountain West that is still alive is Colorado State. The second seed in the will face Utah State in the other semifinal.

Finally, Texas has been added back to the bubble following the Longhorns win over Texas A&M. They get Tennessee next in the SEC Tournament.

There are no new teams in the bracket this morning, although there was a little shuffling among the last four in. Xavier is now the last team in after falling to Marquette in the Big East Tournament. San Diego State is just ahead of them. North Carolina leads the list of teams on the first four out list.

As we approach the business-end of the season, one hoped-for reality of the NBA has come into focus: The league's goal to create more parity is working.

We've got several elite teams, yes, but there are a host of other would-be contenders lurking just below this season's Big Three -- rejuvenated former-juggernauts, here-they-come youth movements, surging question marks and other teams that could, if it all breaks right, surprise everyone.

Even among the elite, some small-market teams are romping, poised to win now and for years to come. The road to the Finals no longer necessarily rolls solely through the lands of LeBron James and Steph Curry, nor through Celtics green. And the future is full of myriad newbies who could, soon, contend.

With exactly one month left before the playoffs, we can spot 10 possible NBA contenders in a hope-filled view of who could win it all.

There are just three teams atop the NBA's season-long, king-of-the-hill marathon. The Cleveland Cavaliers, Boston Celtics and Oklahoma City Thunder are head and shoulders above everyone else.

Each boasts a top-10 offense and defense, historically a strong indicator of a championship-level team. The Cavs (first and sixth), the Celtics (third and fifth) and the Thunder (fourth and first) have that balance associated with the Larry O'Brien Trophy.

And yet.

As great as they are -- and they are great -- their march to June glory is far from assured. These versions of the Thunder and Cavs have not been to a conference finals, let alone a Finals, and the road to a ring, as the Celtics can surely tell you, is usually paved with fits and starts, including conference finals and Finals letdowns. It's often a slow, methodical journey.

Yes, one of these unproven teams could win it all this year. But they could also come up short, just as the Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown-led Celtics did in 2023, 2022, 2020, 2018 and 2017. Those were all years Boston made at least the conference finals but failed to win it all.

In every one of those seasons other than 2020, the Celtics finished at least in second place in the Eastern Conference.

Point is: Winning in the regular season is one thing. Winning in the playoffs is something else entirely, and often takes time even for the most formidable organizations.

Speaking of the Celtics, this year's version is trying to defy recent history and show back-to-back champs can still be a thing. The league is sitting on a streak of seven straight NBA seasons without a repeat champion.

Sure, Boston can win it all. They're my favorite. But there's a reason grabbing that glory has gotten harder.

Which brings us to some of the other teams that could keep that revolving-door-of-NBA champions swinging round as the leagues's parity reality continues to ramp up.

Both the Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors are good enough to win it all this year, a statement of fact that would have been preposterous before the trade deadline changed everything.

Yes, the Lakers need LeBron James back and healthy, a hope that's currently accompanied by a question mark as they await his return from a groin injury. But when he does come back, and if he can stay healthy, the 40-year-old will be at the tail end of a season almost as good as the one from 2012-13, when he last won a Most Valuable Player award.

The Lakers also have the best defense in the league since Jan. 6, a stretch of a whopping 28 games -- and, it is worth noting, a stretch in which the now-departed Anthony Davis played only nine times.

Throw in the obvious addition of Luka Dončić, and they can win the whole thing, this year.

The Warriors are in a very similar spot. They're an outstanding defensive team rejuvenated by the trade-deadline arrival of Jimmy Butler and buoyed by the remarkable level of their own older all-time great.

Since the trade deadline, Golden State has the league's third-best record, fifth-best offense and fourth-best defense -- a team on par with Tier 1. We've seen, particularly, a liberated Stephen Curry (who became the founding member of the NBA's 4,000 career 3-pointers club on Thursday night). With Butler joining Curry, the Warriors are contenders yet again.

Nikola Jokić.

That's it. That's the analysis.

Yes, the Denver Nuggets have a lackluster defense. Jamal Murray has a high ceiling but also lulls that can be worrisome, particularly if your goal is title or bust. Michael Porter Jr. is … the same guy he's been for a long time. And so on.

Same as two years ago, when Jokić carried a mediocre defense and a team many doubted could be great in the postseason all the way. Throw in a vastly improved Christian Braun, a wow-he's-still-good Russell Westbrook, and, of course, mostly just the best player on earth, and anything's possible.

Let's start with the New York Knicks here. While New York fans might bemoan the lack of surety and ""respect"" in this tier, it's for good reason. The Knicks have a high ceiling, but they also have a mediocre defense.

Plus an uncertain playoff track record.

Plus having to sweat Jalen's Brunson's rolled ankle.

But they do have a high-octane offense supercharged by last summer's trade for Karl-Anthony Towns, who's having a banner year. And their individual defensive pieces, particularly on the perimeter, suggest defensive-minded head coach Tom Thibodeau may be able to flip that switch come April.

If Brunson, the favorite for the Clutch Player of the Year Award, is right when it matters most, and the Knicks hold up beneath the minutes Thibs liked to pile upon them, New York could do something special.

The Memphis Grizzlies are in a similar spot, worried about Jaren Jackson Jr.'s own ankle injury. The Grizzlies also have to fret after their own talismanic point guard, Ja Morant -- because we always have to fret about Ja Morant's durability. 

But he, like Brunson in New York, is an otherworldly player, and if he stays healthy, and JJJ gets back going by the playoffs, this Memphis team can create some magic. They have one of those top-10 offenses and defenses we talked about like the Celtics, Thunder and Cavs, a nice bit of depth, and more experience together than several other top teams.

Last on this list are the Indiana Pacers. 

Yes, the Pacers. 

OK, so it's a pet belief of mine, but hear me out. They made the Conference Finals last year, Tyrese Halliburton has shown flashes lately of what he can do, Pascal Siakam seems grossly underrated, and Rick Carlisle remains one of the game's best coaches.

On Dec. 13, they were 11-15 and languishing with other bad teams in the play-in zone. Since then, they have the game's sixth-best record while being fifth in offensive rating and 11th defensively.

That's a 39-game run in which all the metrics, and last year's run, suggest not to sleep on Indiana.

The Minnesota Timberwolves are sitting on a six-game winning streak, and they're also almost in that elusive club of teams with top-10 offenses and defenses: 11th offensively, seventh in D.

While KAT is now in New York, Anthony Edwards still has it in him to carry a team. They'd be best served fighting off the Warriors for the final guaranteed playoff spot, but we saw last year, when Ant gets going and Minnesota's defense locks in, that they can beat some real teams come the playoffs.

The Los Angeles Clippers have a similar argument, even if it's harder, in 2025, to summon the same kind of optimism you'd need to take it seriously, even if I'm the wrong person to push their case. They'll certainly be a play-in team. But maybe there are reasons to hope.

This plucky Clippers team does have the league's fourth-best defense, plus James Harden, plus -- we said we were going to be optimistic -- one Kawhi Leonard.

Yes, trying to talk yourself into believing in Kawhi in March is a lot like trying to talk yourself into believing in the Sixers in early November. Seems smart at the time, only to remember later you're an idiot. (I'm talking about myself here).

Wrote this exact same thing last year and got it right then, too.

Yes, while the Milwaukee Bucks did wash out early in the playoffs that time, it's also true that Giannis Antetokounmpo missed his team's opening-round series while Damian Lillard struggled with his own injury.

But a full season under Rivers -- he just needs a training camp!, they told us -- hasn't exactly given Milwaukee the sheen of an NBA title force. They're jostling with the Pacers and Pistons for the four, five and six spots in the East, they're good-but-not-great offensively, and, yes, Doc is still the wrong guy.

Still, what the hell, throw them on the list. They do have Giannis (see: Tier 4). Maybe Rivers, after 15 years, will at least get back to another NBA Finals.

That gives us 12 potential title contenders in 2025. The teams below are not title contenders this season, but still worth mentioning.

It's hard not to love the Houston Rockets, Detroit Pistons and Orlando Magic (at least, with the Magic, if you're my guy, Beyond The Arc co-host John Gonzalez).

All three have young, exciting cores, great coaches, and exciting years ahead. The Rockets and Pistons have shown that this season, and each will be playoff teams able to turn fine seasons into critical experience for future runs.

The Magic have been undermined by injuries this time around, and still need to find an offense, but they have the NBA's second-best defense, and a Paolo Banchero-Franz Wagner future is a bright one.

Let's also throw the San Antonio Spurs on here, despite the worries about Victor Wembanyama's future and the fact De'Aaron Fox just got shut down for the rest of the season. When Wemby is back, they will be a rising force out West.

Take Marlo Brando dressed in the jersey of one of these teams, put him on the waterfront, and add some forlornness and regret, and you've arrived at Tier 8.

All of Atlanta, Miami, Sacramento, Dallas and Phoenix may, in some parallel universe, be in the mix, full of optimism and making plans for playoff basketball in May and maybe beyond.

What if the Heat hadn't gotten sideways with Jimmy Butler? What if the Kings had made it work with De'Aaron Fox, or at least not tried to create the Chicago Bulls West? What if Phoenix hadn't given Bradley Beal a no-trade clause? What if Atlanta, all those years ago, had drafted Luka Doncic instead of Trae Young, or had properly navigated their promise a few years after that when they did indeed make the Eastern conference finals?

What if Dallas … well, you know.

Just: What if.

Each of these teams are a reminder of the fine line between competing and capitulating, between being somebody and wishing, at least in basketball terms, you were someone else entirely.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The Big 12 Tournament needed a dark horse -- a cuddly, lovable underdog for the masses. 

Kansas missed its big chance to fill that role -- along with a lot of rims Thursday. 

Then it got worse, if that's possible this season. Kansas not only lost to Arizona, missing the Big 12 Tournament semifinals in consecutive years for the first time ever, but it got run out of the building late against the Wildcats. 

The dark horse, if you will, was put down before it ever got out of the gate. The numbers showed that Arizona pulled away late 88-77.

How Kansas got to this point is becoming repetitive. Arizona's hostile takeover of the paint Thursday night was evidenced by a 46-20 advantage. 

Kansas has a problem being complete. It doesn't play defense particularly well. Its bench is thin, while Arizona's bench outscored KU 45-13. The Jayhawks don't have an edge on the road. A team that has beaten Duke and Michigan State is also 9-9 since mid-January. It is drafting on months-old accomplishments and about to get its lowest NCAA seed in years. 

""I'd say we're one of the volatile teams in the country,"" center Hunter Dickinson said. ""When you look at it, we've played the best in the country and been neck-and-neck with them. We've been neck-and-neck with a lot of average teams. It depends on which Kansas team shows up.""

Hang your hopes on that assessment. 

""I thought tonight we tried hard,"" Self said.

Which is important. 

Thursday was a symptom, not a diagnosis. These Jayhawks just never seemed to fit together consistently this season. This year's transfer class brought in by Self wasn't good enough.

Zeke Mayo -- the Lawrence, Kansas native who arrived from South Dakota State -- had a tough time developing into the consistent scorer he was expected to be. In a March 1 loss at home to Texas Tech, Mayo went 1-for-7, including 0-5 from the arc. Mayo said he was harassed online to the point Self had to put out a statement of condemnation. 

No matter who it came from -- disgruntled gambler or disgruntled fan -- it was another ugly chapter in a down season. Mayo then rebounded with consecutive 5-for-7 games from 3 before Thursday night. 

""It's not gonna get any better,"" Dickinson said. ""Those type of people, they're not going to go away -- especially if they bet on you, they're going to let you know if you lose.""

To Mayo's credit, he has rebounded nicely. It was only because of his 3-point shooting -- 5-for-12, 20 points total -- that KU hung in Thursday. It was only because the Jayhawks got into an overtime shootout win with UCF on Wednesday that the excuses about being worn out were ready made. 

Dickinson, bless him, didn't go there. 

""I don't think you can blame fatigue,"" he said. ""In this NIL era, we're paid to play so we have to be professionals out there.""

""Scoring 77 points should be enough,"" Self admitted. 

The Jayhawks, now a pedestrian 21-12, were going to hold that underdog designation a) only if they won Thursday in the Big 12 quarterfinals against Wildcats and b) because they had backed into their current plight to begin with.

As a whole, Thursday was entertaining. There were 85 total 3s in the four tournament games, an average of 10.6 per team. The day was inspirational with all the new meat, but it was also foreign to the T-Mobile Center. All local support has been stripped. The day's results assured that there will be a first-time tournament winner. The two biggest winners were BYU and Arizona, which won their first Big 12 Tournament games. 

Celebrity corner featured the owner of the Utah Hockey Club, BYU grad Ryan Smith, seated next to Kansas City Chiefs coach Andy Reid, a former BYU offensive lineman. 

That sort of thing seems odd when Kansas and Iowa State have combined to win nine of the last 11 Big 12 Tournaments. Just don't ask any of the local pubs who make a living off Kansas, Iowa State and Kansas State being good this week. 

While the NCAA Tournament fate of Kansas and Iowa State is still to be determined -- Kansas State is out -- let's just say plenty of tickets will be available for the tournament's final four: Houston vs. Baylor and Texas Tech vs. Arizona. 

Kansas, the tournament's No. 6 seed, now has lost its most conference games since Self was a sophomore at Oklahoma State 42 years ago. 

""We need a couple of days of rest,"" Self said. ""We've got a tired team.""

Actually, he has an average team. Underachieving, too? Absolutely. Cuddly? Nah, not heading into an NCAA Tournament full of uncertainty. 

Five days after Kansas rallied late in the teams' first meeting as conference rivals in Lawrence, Arizona flipped the ending. It outscored KU 18-8 down the stretch. 

Kansas was pushed around in a place it used to rule -- the paint. Now it must push ahead to an NCAA Tournament that looks a bit like the edge of a cliff unless things change quickly. 

""The blessing and the curse about these next couple of games is that you only have to be great for 40 minutes,"" Dickinson said.

That has been a challenge for KU all season.

League mulls College Football Playoff AQ options with play-in games at forefront","https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/big-12-back-to-divisions-league-mulls-college-football-playoff-aq-options-with-play-in-games-at-forefront/","Fri, 14 Mar 2025 15:02:00 GMT","

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The Big 12 will continue to grow. That is, if you believe the possibilities going forward regarding automatic qualifiers in the College Football Playoff.

That's a reference to possibly more Big 12 games, not more Big 12 teams as the format and structure of the CFP begin to take shape for the 2026 season when the new six-year deal with ESPN begins. 

Some are almost resigned to the fact there will be automatic qualifiers in the field at the urging of the Big Ten and SEC. Their proposed model of 4-4-2-2-1-1 means four AQs each for the Big Ten and SEC, two each for the ACC and Big 12, one at-large spot and one for the highest-ranked Group of Five conference champion. 

After making the rounds this week at the Big 12 Tournament, it's clear the conference has begun to consider its place in that new world. Commissioner Brett Yormark has not publicly committed to the AQ model for his conference, but it's fair to say every league has at least considered the concept of play-in games for those AQ spots.

""Let me ask you something,"" Yormark replied to a questioner Tuesday at a tournament kickoff press conference, ""do you think I'm shy or no?""

CBS Sports reported on the details of play-in games in December. While the possibilities are preliminary -- and almost endless -- at this point, there are at least two models to consider to determine those two Big 12 automatic qualifiers. 

1) The top four regular-season teams qualify with the No. 1 seed playing the No. 4 seed and No. 2 playing No. 3. The two winners on that championship weekend in December would advance to the CFP. 

Using last year's standings, these would be the matchups:

2) The 16-team league could split into two divisions, looking a lot like the old Big 12. One possibility is the two first-place teams in each division would qualify along with the teams with next two best records. (Don't even start with tiebreakers in that scenario). 

Let's take it a step further and dream up the composition of those two divisions based on geography … 

Again, based on last year's standings the matchups would go the same way:

In that setting, each team would play a seven-team, round-robin schedule against the teams in its division. There would be two crossover games. You're way ahead of things in the scenario above if you've already noticed three of the four play-in teams would come from the West division. 

In both play-in structures, there is no outright conference champion. In one iteration, the two winners would be declared co-champs. In another, a team with the best record could be declared the ""regular-season"" champion. 

But that gets complicated, and the Big 12 has had its share of complicated. In 2014, the first year of the CFP, TCU and Baylor were declared co-champs during a time where league didn't have a championship game. Because of that philosophy,  neither TCU nor Baylor got into the four-team field. 

This would be different. If everybody is OK with co-champs -- and they might be given the benefits (a CFP spot) -- the Big 12 would be adding an extra postseason game. That would probably take some sort of rule change from the NCAA, but given the current landscape that's seemingly changing by the day, the association likely wouldn't stand in the way. 

Also, think creatively -- one of the games could be played at AT&T Stadium, perhaps the other on campus. 

The Big 12, along with the other conferences, also would have to go back to their rightsholders and ask for more money for the additional games. The biggest hurdle remains getting AQs instituted in the first place. While Yormark has straddled the fence, ACC commissioner Jim Phillips has been adamantly against the proposal.

The stakeholders have been warned extensively about doing so by media analysts.

FBS conferences meet again on April 3 to discuss matters further. 

""I think it's fair to say I represent the conference pretty aggressively when I'm in those forums,"" Yormark said. ""It's important for us to be heard and we are. I would say the relationship among the commissioners for the Power Four has never been better. We don't agree on everything, but we have a mutual respect factor that exists. We hear each other out. I feel really good about where we're situated.""

Vikings in the mix?","https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/aaron-rodgers-rumors-giants-offering-the-biggest-contract-steelers-still-favorites-vikings-in-the-mix/","Fri, 14 Mar 2025 12:01:37 GMT","

A day after becoming a free agent for the first time in his NFL career, Aaron Rodgers is still without a team for the 2025 season. It's not for a lack of headlines. Amid reports and rumors regarding the Pittsburgh Steelers zeroing in on the former New York Jets signal-caller, the New York Giants have made Rodgers his largest contract offer up to this point, according to The Athletic.

Both the Giants and Steelers have discussed the parameters of a potential deal with Rodgers' representation, Dianna Russini reported on the ""Scoop City"" podcast Thursday, and the quarterback's agent has already informed both clubs he intends to make a decision on his next destination soon. Some inside Rodgers' camp have already indicated ""it's gonna be the Steelers,"" per Russini, but ""nobody in Pittsburgh believes that"" since no official communications have stated as much.

The Giants, meanwhile, have extended the most lucrative offer, per Russini, but in fact may not be ""itching as much"" to land Rodgers, given their apparent interest in also addressing quarterback near the top of the 2025 NFL Draft. In other words, the Giants would like Rodgers, and might be willing to pay the most money to secure his services, but they aren't necessarily desperate to get him so much as any quarterback.

And then there's the Minnesota Vikings, who are ""having meetings and conversations"" about the feasibility of a potential Rodgers pursuit, despite most anticipating the team turning to 2024 first-round draft pick J.J. McCarthy as the immediate successor to Sam Darnold. Others have loosely linked Rodgers to the Vikings, who also declined to re-sign Daniel Jones in free agency, but there's been no indication yet that Minnesota brass is serious about committing top dollar to Rodgers with McCarthy already in tow.

Inside all three teams -- the Giants, Steelers and Vikings -- are personnel executives who believe Rodgers can still play ""at a very high level,"" Russini noted, despite the 41-year-old's lackluster two-year run with the Jets.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP)  Otega Oweh made a baseline jumper with 0.5 seconds left after No. 15 Kentucky had blown a late lead in the final minutes, and the Wildcats beat Oklahoma 85-84 on Thursday night to advance to the Southeastern Conference Tournament quarterfinals.

The sixth-seeded Wildcats (22-10), who led by 10 with 1:20 left, won their third straight and now will play fifth-ranked and third-seeded Alabama on Friday night.

Oweh finished with 27 points. Koby Brea added 22 and Andrew Carr 11.

No. 14 seed Oklahoma (20-13) won its SEC Tournament debut only to lose to a former Sooner for the second time since Feb. 26. Oweh led Kentucky against his old school with another late bucket.

Jeremiah Fears scored 28 points for Oklahoma, including a basket that gave the Sooners an 84-83 lead with 5.6 seconds remaining.

Oklahoma: The Sooners will have to wait for their first win against Kentucky after dropping their second this season and fifth all-time to the Wildcats. They also lost for the first time on a neutral court this season in their seventh such game.

Kentucky: Winners of this tournament a league-high 31 times, this was just the second time the Wildcats had played in the second round. Now the Wildcats keep chasing their first title here since 2018.

They did it with starting guard Lamont Butler playing only eight minutes, leaving at 9:35 of the first half with a right shoulder issue seconds after finishing a fast-break with a layup for his only points.

Fears scored seven straight points capped by his layup to give the Sooners their first lead since 15:51. They trailed by as much as 77-65 with 4:31 left.

The Sooners couldn't stop Oweh again when it mattered most.

Oklahoma heads home 1-1 in its SEC Tournament debut waiting for its NCAA Tournament destination. Kentucky gets a third chance at Alabama, which took both games during the regular season.

Despite having the NBA's most expensive roster, the Phoenix Suns are 30-36, 11th in the Western Conference and 2.5 games out of the final play-in spot. They are 5-14 since the beginning of February, they've lost three of their last four games, and they have the most difficult late-season schedule in the league, as their remaining opponents have a cumulative winning percentage of .592.

This is bleak. It's certainly not what the Suns were expecting this season, and they can't even blame it on injuries. When their Big Three of Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal have shared the court, they've been outscored by 3.3 points per 100 possessions.

Assuming the story more or less stays the same for the next month, major changes are expected in the offseason. ""They're gonna trade [Durant], and he knows that,"" ESPN's Brian Windhorst said on ""NBA Today"" on Feb. 26. There is an argument that Phoenix should also trade Booker -- perhaps to the Houston Rockets, who own its unprotected 2027 and 2029 first-round draft picks and swap rights in this year's draft -- so it can rebuild in earnest.

In an interview with ESPN's Tim MacMahon, Suns owner Mat Ishbia acknowledged that they have not come close to meeting internal expectations and they could ""pivot and reload"" in the summer. He also maintained that Booker is completely off the table in trade talks.

ESPN reported that the Rockets have ""repeatedly expressed interest"" in trading for Booker, a four-time All-Star who will turn 29 in October. Ishbia interrupted a question about potentially trading him and starting over by saying it would ""never happen.""

""It's silly,"" Ishbia told ESPN. ""So here's what I'll tell you: I have Devin Booker in the prime. In order to win an NBA championship, you got to have a superstar. You got to have a great player.""

Ishbia's win-now mentality has not changed whatsoever.

""It's surprising to me that other people, other fans, they actually like the rebuild process,"" Ishbia told ESPN. ""Like, 'Oh, let's rebuild it.' Are you crazy?! You think I'm going to go for seven years and try to get there? You enjoy the 2030 draft picks that we have holding? I want to try to see the game today. I want us to win today, and we're going to try.""

Ishbia then went a step further, promising that ""we will win championships here in Phoenix.""

Booker has consistently said that he would like to spend his entire career in Phoenix and reiterated to ESPN that he wants to win a title there. ""It might not look the most pretty right now,"" he said, but we got to get it done and I'm going to do it.""

The front office explored trades involving Durant (who turns 37 in September) and Beal (who turns 32 in June) before last month's trade deadline. A Suns source told ESPN that, while Durant has had ""an amazing year,"" they are ""not in a position to not look at everything"" and ""there's always been conversation with everyone on our team minus Devin Booker.""

""I'll just say that we're going to evaluate in the offseason,"" Ishbia told ESPN. ""We're going to find a way to win, and it's probably a lot easier winning with Kevin Durant than without him. But at the same time, yes, if we're not good enough in this iteration of the Phoenix Suns, we're going to find a way to be better next year.""

Beal has a no-trade clause and is owed $110.8 million in the two seasons that follow this one. He didn't want to change teams during the season, but that doesn't necessarily mean he'll finish this contract in Phoenix.

""It is a different deal in the summer,"" Beal told ESPN. ""Everything is kind of more laid out on the table. You got more options.""

Ishbia told ESPN that he still believes in the roster and in coach Mike Budenholzer, and that, if the Suns manage to make the playoffs, ""I don't think we're an easy out for anybody."" At the same time, he said that the season has been ""really disappointing,"" and, when it's over, they'll make decisions based on the results. 

For now, that seems to mean that the Durant-Booker-Beal era is likely near its end, and the front office will try to build a different kind of team around Booker. Given how Phoenix has operated during Ishbia's tenure as owner, though, putting together a contender will be enormously difficult. The Suns have either traded or swapped all of its first-round picks through 2031, and they have extremely limited flexibility because of their payroll.

Ishbia is right that winning a championship generally requires a superstar, and that's why no team wants to trade a player of Booker's caliber in his prime. There are plenty of examples, though, of teams that have employed elite players and fallen far short of championship contention. When that happens year after year despite the front office going all-in, there usually comes a time when the franchise has to trade that player. Often, it regrets not doing it sooner.

NEW YORK (AP)  Alex Karaban scored 15 of his 18 points in the second half to help Connecticut rally for a 73-56 victory over Villanova in a Big East Conference Tournament quarterfinal at Madison Square Garden on Thursday night.

The third-seeded Huskies (23-9) move on to play No. 2 seed Creighton in a Friday semifinal. The Bluejays had to go to a second overtime before beating 10th-seeded DePaul 85-81. The Blue Demons were aiming for the school's first semifinal appearance in the tournament. Top-seeded and sixth-ranked St. John's plays No. 5 seed Marquette in the other semifinal.

UConn didn't take the lead in the second half until Karaban made two free throws for a 49-48 advantage with 9:09 remaining. Eric Dixon had a three-point play to tie the game at 51 with eight minutes left. Karaban hit a 3-pointer to cap a 7-0 run and the Huskies outscored the Wildcats 22-5 down the stretch.

Wooga Poplar scored 15 on 7-for-9 shooting to lead sixth-seeded Villanova to a 36-31 advantage at halftime. The Wildcats missed 19 of 24 shots after the break.

Villanova's Eric Dixon needed 17 points to break Kerry Kittles' school record of 2,243 career points. He finished with eight on 2-for-15 shooting and will have to hope the Wildcats earn a spot in a postseason tournament to break it.

Karaban finished a rebound shy of a double-double for UConn. Liam McNeeley totaled 12 points and seven rebounds. Samson Johnson didn't miss a shot and matched Solo Ball with 11 points.

Poplar led all scorers with 25 points. Jordan Longino added 10 points for Villanova.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP)  Chase Hunter scored 21 points, Jaeden Zackery added 11 points and No. 10 Clemson battled back to beat SMU 57-54 on Thursday night for its ninth straight win to reach the Atlantic Coast Conference semifinals.

Ian Schieffelin chipped in with nine points and 12 rebounds for the Tigers (27-5), who are seeking their first ACC Tournament title.

Matt Cross led SMU (23-10) with 13 points, while Boopie Miller had 10.

SMU led most of the second half, but Viktor Lakhin's lane jumper gave the Tigers a 52-51 lead with 4:50 left in the game.

SMU had a chance to tie or take the lead after Hunter missed a 3 with 17 seconds left. The Mustangs called timeout with 12.5 seconds left, but Chuck Harris missed a corner 3. There was a battle for the rebound before the ball went out of bounds. It was initially ruled the ball went off a Clemson player, but after reviewing the play officials ruled SMU touched the ball last.

Hunter was fouled on the inbounds play and made a free throw with 2.1 seconds. Cross' full-court heave at the buzzer fell short.

SMU: Cross picked up his fourth foul midway through the second half, but the Mustangs didn't waiver and stayed right with the Tigers until the end.

Clemson: Starting guard Dillon Hunter appeared to jam a finger late in the first half and did not return. Coach Brad Brownell said after the game Hunter might have broken his hand. Hunter had an ice bag on his right hand in the locker room after the game. He will have X-rays on Friday.

Hunter drove through the lane, stopped and then hit a turnaround jumper to put Clemson up by four with less than two minutes remaining.

SMU finished 1 of 14 from 3-point range.

Clemson moves on to face No. 13 Louisville, a 75-73 winner over Stanford, in the semifinals. SMU looks to be headed to the NIT.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP)  Trey Kaufman-Renn matched a career high with 30 points, including the go-ahead free throws with 28 seconds left, and No. 20 Purdue scored the final five points to beat Southern California 76-71 on Thursday night in the second round of the Big Ten Tournament.

The sixth-seeded Boilermakers (22-10) trailed by 10 points in the first half, but they tied it by halftime and emerged from a back-and-forth second half thanks largely to Kaufman-Renn, who finished 12 of 20 from the field and 6 of 11 from the free-throw line.

Purdue advanced to face No. 22 and second-seeded Michigan in Friday's quarterfinals. The teams split this season, with each winning at home.

With USC (16-17) trailing by three in the closing seconds, Desmond Claude turned the ball over before the Trojans could attempt a tying 3-pointer. Big Ten Player of the Year Braden Smith made two free throws to finish the scoring with 3.6 seconds remaining. Smith had 12 points on 3-of-10 shooting and nine assists.

Claude led the Trojans with 18 points. Wesley Yates added 13.

USC: The Trojans have the athletic skill and length to match up with most teams and pushed Purdue despite having played a double-overtime game the night before. On talent alone, this team should get an NIT bid.

Purdue: Despite struggling to defend taller, quicker players in the backcourt, the Boilermakers did just enough in the final moments. They had lost five of their previous seven.

Kaufman-Renn made a layup with 5:14 left to tie the game at 67-all, and Purdue never trailed gain.

Purdue made 15 of 23 free throws. USC was 10 of 14.

The Trojans await a possible NIT bid while the Boilermakers' tournament run continues.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP)  Henri Veesaar and KJ Lewis scored 19 points apiece and Arizona pulled away late to beat Kansas 88-77 in a Big 12 Conference Tournament quarterfinal at T-Mobile Center on Thursday night.

Veesaar came off the bench to sink 7 of 11 shots with two 3-pointers for the third-seeded Wildcats (21-11), who move on to play second-seeded and ninth-ranked Texas Tech in a Friday semifinal. No. 1 seed Houston plays No. 4 seed BYU in the other semifinal.

Veesaar scored 10, leading Arizona to a 45-37 advantage at halftime. Dajuan Harris Jr.'s 3-pointer gave No. 6 seed Kansas (21-12) its only lead of the half at 3-2. The Wildcats twice built 12-point leads. KJ Adams made two free throws to get the Jayhawks within 40-37, but Veesaar answered with a 3-pointer and Arizona stayed in front.

Arizona played with a lead until Zeke Mayo hit back-to-back 3-pointers for Kansas to knot the score at 50 with 15:43 remaining. Harris hit a 3-pointer to give the Jayhawks their second lead at 56-54. Rylan Griffen hit a jumper with 8:44 left to put Kansas up for the last time at 63-61. Trey Townsend followed with a dunk and a three-point play and Arizona maintained a lead over the final 7:48.

Towsend had 16 points and Love scored 11 with six assists.

Mayo scored 20 to lead Kansas. Hunter Dickinson totaled 19 points and 12 rebounds. Harris hit four 3-pointers and scored 16.

The Jayhawks wore their blue jerseys in the tournament for the first time since the 2008 title game against the Texas Longhorns. They were the higher seed and wore white in their previous 36 straight games. Kansas - the two seed in '08 - beat the top-seeded Longhorns 84-74.

NEW YORK (AP)  Ryan Kalkbrenner had 32 points and scored the go-ahead basket in the second overtime after Creighton scored the final 11 points in regulation, and the Bluejays held on for an 85-81 victory over DePaul in a Big East Tournament quarterfinal at Madison Square Garden on Thursday night.

Kalkbrenner scored in the paint to give No. 2 seed Creighton a 77-76 lead and the Bluejays (23-9) never trailed over the final 2:12 against the 10th-seeded Blue Demons (14-19). Creighton advanced to the semifinals Friday night against third-seeded UConn, which earned a 73-56 victory over No. 6 seed Villanova.

Creighton's Fedor Zugic and Steven Ashworth had 3-pointers at both ends of an 11-0 run to end regulation. Ashworth's shot came with 21 seconds left and forced OT tied at 62.

A layup by Ty Davis gave the Bluejays a 72-64 lead with 1:33 left in the first OT. The Blue Demons' Layden Blocker outscored Creighton 9-1 from there and his jumper with one second left forced a second OT tied at 73.

Kalkbrenner also grabbed nine rebounds and blocked five shots for Creighton. Zugic had 13 points off the bench and Ashworth scored 10 before fouling out.

Blocker hit five 3-pointers and scored 25 to lead DePaul, which has never reached the Big East semifinals. Isaiah Rivera totaled 17 points and nine rebounds. CJ Gunn scored 14 before fouling out.

Rivera had nine points and Gunn scored eight to guide the Blue Demons to a 36-21 lead at halftime.

He may have a deep affinity for Dallas, but DeMarcus Lawrence apparently doesn't have much love for his former team, the Dallas Cowboys, who employed him during his first 11 NFL seasons. 

Lawrence, a four-time Pro Bowler who recently signed with the Seattle Seahawks, wasted no time throwing shade at the Cowboys upon joining the Seahawks while alluding to the team's 30-year championship drought. 

""Dallas is my home. Made my home there,"" Lawrence said. ""My family lives there. I'm forever gonna be there. I know for sure I'm not gonna win a Super Bowl there. So, yeah, we here."" 

One can assume that Lawrence's comments won't sit well with Jerry Jones, who undoubtedly takes the team's championship drought more personally than anyone on the planet. Jones, after all, is the team's owner, president and general manager whose hands are virtually on every aspect of ""America's Team."" 

We know for certain that former teammate Micah Parsons isn't sitting well with the remarks, either. The star pass rusher shared video of Lawrence's comments with the following caption: ""This is what rejection and envy look like! This some clown s---!""

Lawrence promptly followed up with a defense: ""Calling me a clown won't change the fact that I told the truth. Maybe if you spent less time tweeting and more time winning, I wouldn't have left.""

The Cowboys own the fourth-best winning percentage in the NFL since Jones purchased the team in 1989. Jones' run with the Cowboys includes the quickest turnaround in NFL history (the Cowboys won their first Super Bowl under Jones three years after going 1-15 during his first season in Dallas) and a then-record three Super Bowl wins over a four-year span. 

But since their last Super Bowl win (a 27-17 win over the Steelers at the end of the 1995 season), the Cowboys have not been back to an NFC Championship Game, let alone a Super Bowl. The Cowboys now have the longest NFC title game drought after the Commanders' surprising run this past season. 

Dallas hasn't been back to a Super Bowl despite having several talented players over the past 30 years, including Lawrence, who will look to get to the mountaintop with Seattle after not being able to do so in his beloved Dallas.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP)  Chucky Hepburn's putback jumper at the buzzer helped No. 13 Louisville overcome a 15-point second-half deficit to beat Stanford 75-73 on Thursday night and advance to the semifinals of the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament.

Terrence Edwards scored 25 points and Hepburn added 20 for the Cardinals (26-6), who've won 10 straight. Noah Waterman and James Scott each had 12.

Oziyah Sellers had 22 points and Maxime Raynaud added 17 points for Stanford (20-13), which was playing in its first ACC Tournament.

Stanford led 33-30 at halftime and appeared ready to pull away in the second half, building a 52-37 lead in the second half behind an 11-0 run.

But Raynaud picked up his fourth foul with 13 1/2 minutes left and Louisville capitalized, battling back to take the lead 70-65 with three minutes remaining after Hepburn knocked down a 3 and then fed J'Vonne Hadley for a layup. Raynaud fouled out on the ensuing possession, but Stanford tied the game on Chisom Okpara's three-point play with 32 seconds left.

Edwards missed a 3-pointer, but as players collapsed for the rebound the ball bounced out directly to Hepburn, who caught it and buried a 15-footer for the win.

Stanford: Raynaud picking up his fourth foul early in the second half was a huge turning point, as Louisville turned the momentum of the game.

Louisville: The Cardinals played without guard Reyne Smith, their third-leading scorer at 13.4 points per games, due to an ankle injury. Smith's absence seemed to impact Louisville's chemistry, particularly in the first half.

There was no bigger moment than Hepburn's putback at the buzzer.

Louisville outrebounded Stanford 32-28.

Louisville will face No. 10 Clemson in the semifinals. Stanford is likely headed to the NIT.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP)  Kylan Boswell scored a career-high 24 points and four other Illinois players finished in double figures as the 24th-ranked Fighting Illini beat Iowa 106-94 in a wild second-round Big Ten Tournament game on Thursday night.

Tre White had 22 points and Tomislav Ivisic added 19 points, 10 rebounds and six assists as Illinois (21-11) won its fourth straight. The Illini face No. 11 Maryland in Friday's third quarterfinal game in Indianapolis.

Hawkeyes coach Fran McCaffery wasn't on the bench when Iowa guard Payton Sandfort tied the league's single-game tourney record for 3-pointers. McCaffery was ejected with 13:33 left to play after drawing two technical fouls when he left the coach's box to argue with referees.

Sandfort made eight 3s, matching a mark done twice previously, to tie a career high with 30 points. Josh Dix added 21 points.

The 15th-seeded Hawkeyes (17-16) trailed 69-60 when McCaffery left. But Illinois made all four free throws and fended off a brief momentum swing as Iowa cut the deficit to single digits.

Iowa: The Hawkeyes certainly can score. But in their second game in two nights, the up-tempo pace eventually took its toll and wore them down.

Illinois: The Fighting Illini put on a shooting clinic, making nearly 55% of their shots. They've been on a roll since losing to Duke.

McCaffery's ejection. Iowa did manage to gain some momentum after the free throws, but it dissipated fast and the team never recovered.

Sandfort had the big game, but Illinois offset it by making 12 of 26 3s.

Illinois will try to extend its winning streak against the Terrapins. Iowa is likely headed either to the NIT or has seen the last of McCaffery until next season.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP)  JT Toppin had 26 points and 10 rebounds to lift No. 9 Texas Tech to a 76-74 victory over Baylor in the Big 12 Tournament quarterfinals on Thursday night.

The second-seeded Red Raiders never trailed but almost gave up the lead in the final minute after missing their final 10 field-goal attempts. VJ Edgecombe's attempt at a tying jumper at the buzzer missed off the glass.

Darrion Williams scored 14 points and Elijah Hawkins and Kerwin Walton had 12 each for Texas Tech (25-7), which will face Arizona in Friday's semifinals.

Norchad Omier had 29 points and 15 rebounds for seventh-seeded Baylor (19-14).

Baylor: The Bears need more offense from players other than Omier. Edgecombe, with 11 points, was the only other Baylor player in double figures.

Texas Tech: The Red Raiders shot 19.4% from the field in the second half, including 3 of 15 from 3-point range.

Omier picked up two fouls in 11 seconds, the second with 9:46 left, giving him four for the game. He went to the bench with the Bears trailing 68-58. The Bears managed to cut into the lead, but their momentum was stalled when Jeremy Roach picked up his fourth foul with 5:29 left.

Texas Tech hit 12 3-pointers in the first half, including 11 of 15 in the first 12:35, and finished 15 of 34 (44.1%). The Red Raiders averaged 10.1 3-pointers per game at a 37.8% clip this season.

The Bears have been projected to earn an at-large berth into the NCAA Tournament. The Red Raiders split their games with Arizona this season.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP)  Tamar Bates scored 25 points and No. 21 Missouri beat Mississippi State 85-73 on Thursday night to reach the quarterfinals of the Southeastern Conference Tournament.

Tony Perkins added a season-high 20 for the seventh-seeded Tigers (22-10), who will face No. 4 Florida on Friday night in the first tournament game for the Gators.

Josh Hubbard paced Mississippi State (21-12), which was the No. 10 seed in the SEC, with 24 points and Keshawn Murphy added 18.

Caleb Grill hit a 3-pointer as time expired in the first half, putting the Tigers up 39-34.

Thursday's game was much closer than the only regular-season matchup against the Tigers, an 88-61 victory for Missouri in Starkville.

Mississippi State: The loss will strengthen the Bulldogs' already strong probability of receiving an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament.

Missouri: Playing their first game of the SEC Tournament, the Tigers had to battle most of the second half against Mississippi State, which kept the game close until the final minutes. Friday's matchup against the highly-ranked Gators should be a tougher test.

Grill broke the 17th and final tie of the game with a dunk with 4:05 remaining in the second half to put the Tigers up 71-69. The dunk and the 3-pointer at the end of the first half were the only points Grill scored.

Missouri finished the second half hitting six of its final seven field goals, while the Bulldogs hit just one of their final nine attempts from the field.

The Tigers face No. 4 Florida on Friday, while the Bulldogs wait to learn their next opponent on Selection Sunday.

Spring ball is getting underway across college football, and hope springs eternal for teams across the Big 12. The conference is the most upwardly mobile of the power leagues, and everyone will have Arizona State's magical run from worst-to-first in mind as they prepare for the season. 

After a hyper-competitive race for the Big 12 title game in 2024, even more is expected in 2025. According to FanDuel, no team in the league has better than even +500 odds to win the conference. Six are between +550 and +800 with more close behind. 

However, teams will have to do it without departing superstars like Colorado's Travis Hunter, Arizona State's Cameron Skattebo and Iowa State's Jayden Higgins. A new generation now enters during this cycle. 

Here are the biggest questions facing each of the 16 league members as spring practice starts. 

What will a Brent Brennan team look like? 

The Wildcats made a bold gamble by hiring Brennan to lead an existing roster, an attempt to get the most out of star wide receiver Tetairoa McMillan before he declared for the NFL. Simply put, it failed. Brennan didn't have the answers. Now, Arizona is Brennan's program. Offensive coordinator Seth Doege came in from Marshall. Danny Gonzalez was promoted to defensive coordinator. Fifty-three new scholarship players entered the program, while Arizona managed to hang onto quarterback Noah Fifita. The Wildcats won't have a player of McMillan's talent for a very long time; regardless, can Brennan put his stamp on the program this offseason? 

Can the Sun Devils replace Cam Skattebo?

Skattebo was the breakout player in college football last season after exploding for 2,300 all-purpose yards, the most by any power conference player. Now, he's off to the NFL, leaving a gaping hole. The good news? There's serious talent in the pipeline. Kyson Brown and Raleek Brown are former blue-chip recruits with serious upside. Alton McCaskill didn't play much as he recovered from an injury, but he rushed for nearly 1,000 yards as a freshman at Houston. Army running back Kanye Udoh also transferred in after clearing 1,100 yards and 10 touchdowns with the Black Knights. Can the group replace Skattebo in the aggregate? We'll see. 

Will the Bears continue to grow in the secondary?

Baylor ended the 2024 regular season on a six-game winning streak and are poised to enter 2025 among the preseason favorites. But for all the excitement about the offense, the passing defense still remains an issue. LSU exposed the deficiency in the Texas Bowl behind 313 yards passing from Garrett Nussmeier and a pair of 100-yard receivers. The Bears ranked No. 94 nationally in passing defense. Most of the key secondary contributors are back, and the Bears added defensive back contributors Devin Turner (Northwestern), Tyler Turner (Oregon) and Calvin Simpson-Hunt (Ohio State) in the portal. Along with the addition of defensive passing game coordinator Paul Gonzalez from TCU, the Bears have high expectations for the unit. 

Do the Cougars have another gear? 

Despite a breakout 11-2 season, BYU still remains shockingly under the radar. If not for a November hiccup, the Cougars may have been in the College Football Playoff. Now, the vast majority of contributors are back on both sides of the ball, including quarterback Jake Retzlaff, linebacker Jack Kelly and wide receiver Chase Roberts. Both coordinators are back. The program added a few key transfers, including tight end Carsen Ryan and defensive lineman Keanu Tanuvasa from rival Utah. BYU is positioned for a national run, but it starts in spring camp. 

Can Cincinnati stop the run? 

The Bearcats boast one of the nation's best defensive linemen in tackle Dontay Corleone, but the unit as a whole has been lackluster in each of Scott Satterfield's first two seasons. Cincinnati allowed 4.7 yards per carry to rank among the worst in the Big 12, which was only accentuated by a 3-3-5 defense that lacked consistent playmakers. Transfer Jaylon White-McClain (Old Dominion) will compete for playing time and multiple others are back from injury. The linebacker room remains largely intact. In seven losses, the Bearcats allowed more than 4.9 yards per carry. Simply put, that's just not good enough to compete in a major conference. 

What does Phase 2 look like? 

Several teams across the Big 12 are going through roster changes. The Buffaloes are going through a wholesale identity change. Heisman winner Travis Hunter is off to the NFL. Coach Deion Sanders will coach college ball without his son, Shedeur, at quarterback for the first time in his career. While the program added quarterbacks Kaidon Salter (Liberty) and Julian Lewis (freshman), it's highly unlikely they can just count on 300 yards of efficient passing per game heading forward. There are still some serious stars around, including left tackle Jordan Seaton and wide receiver Drelon Miller. The defense, coordinated by up-and-coming Robert Livingstone, could be a solid unit. But replicating the breakout nine-win season of 2024 will require taking on a new identity. 

How far along is the offense? 

After fielding a bottom 10 national offense, Willie Fritz went straight back to the drawing board to start over. Thanks to a wave of high-profile transfers, the unit will look much different in 2025. Quarterback Conner Weigman returns to Houston after starting at Texas A&M and reunites with lineman Matthew Wykoff. Running back Dean Connors (Rice) and receiver Amare Thomas (UAB) also sit as potential starters. Fritz led Tulane to the New Year's Six and is the perfect coach to tie together all the pieces, especially if the trenches come along. 

What's the future at receiver?

The Cyclones quietly had the best wide receiver combo in college football last season -- seriously. Jaylin Noel and Jayden Higgins were the only pairing to cross 1,000 yards in the regular season and both will go way higher than people realize in the 2025 NFL Draft. While quarterback Rocco Becht is back, the 'Clones don't have a returning receiver with more than 150 yards. East Carolina transfer Chase Sowell is a big-time player and UCF transfer Xavier Townsend has upside, but both have to transition to Ames well for the Cyclones to stay in the Big 12 title conversation. 

Can the Jayhawks get up to speed at DB? 

Kansas boasted All-Big 12 performers Mello Dotson and Cobee Bryant at defensive back last season, but both are off to the NFL. The Jayhawks quickly moved to restock with four transfers in the defensive backfield alone, including Alabama's Jahlil Hurley and Oklahoma State's Lyrik Rawls. Even with the talent last season, KU was a bottom-half passing defense unit in the conference. Especially after the loss of running back Devin Neal, the defense will have to paper over some holes.  

What steps can Avery Johnson take as a passer?

Johnson ranks among the highest-rated recruits in K-State history and flashed massive potential in several games. He scored four touchdowns in a bowl win over Rutgers, completed 66% of his passes with three touchdowns on the road against West Virginia and rushed for 100 yards against Arizona. However, he failed to clear 60% completion in his last six games and hit just 58.3% of passes on the season. Johnson's athletic gifts are known, but Kansas State needs more from him as a passer. During a two-game losing streak against Houston and ASU, he threw one touchdown to four interceptions. 

Does Mike Gundy have any answers left?

When times are lowest, Gundy has a knack for pulling out a miracle. Over the last 15 seasons, Oklahoma State has reached 10 wins on eight occasions. That said, the 3-9 season was the first losing season under Gundy and worst winning percentage since 1991. Nearly everything will be different in Stillwater heading into 2025, from new quarterbacks to a new offensive line to new coordinators on both sides of the ball. The Cowboys didn't have a single all-conference player in 2024, There certainly aren't surefire candidates to reach the mark next season.  

Can any run game be found? 

The Horned Frogs put together one of the quietest nine-win campaigns in the country last year and have a few exciting pieces in quarterback Josh Hoover and a senior-heavy defense. However, the Frogs rushing offense ranked No. 113 nationally and averaged only 3.7 yards per carry, a miserable number that cost them multiple games. Trent Battle should step into a bigger role after dealing with injuries and most of the offensive line is back, but modest improvements aren't enough. When Hoover has time, he's one of the best in the Big 12. Without a complementary running game, the offense won't work. 

Is Behren Morton ready for the moment? 

Texas Tech coach Joey McGuire reeled in a sensational transfer class to complement a strong roster, which should quickly make the Red Raiders conference contenders. Both coordinators are flipping out, but Mack Leftwich (Texas State) and Shiel Woods (Houston) are quick studies. Now, the final piece is Morton, a former blue-chip recruit out of Eastland, Texas. Morton was prolific, throwing for 3,335 yards and 27 touchdowns. Still, he has to be more consistent and stay healthy for the Red Raiders to have a chance for a special season. This is the moment Texas Tech has been building towards since McGuire got to campus. 

Does Scott Frost still have it? 

Once upon a time, Frost was the hottest coaching candidate in the country after leading UCF from 0-12 to a 13-0 record in 2017. Two years after getting fired from a disastrous run at Nebraska, Frost is back in Orlando with a chance to make things right. The Knights have underwhelmed in two Big 12 seasons with a combined 10-15 record, but Frost brings a high-flying, dynamic offense with him. He has talent to work with, but is he cut out for this level? The new expectations at UCF are sky high.

Is the offense ready for primetime? 

After the departure of longtime offensive coordinator Andy Ludwig and quarterback Cameron Rising, coach Kyle Whittingham is turning the page. Instead of looking to the pro-style world, Whittingham reeled in RPO-friendly coach Jason Beck from New Mexico to run the offense. Beck also brought quarterback Devon Dampier from UNM, one of the most exciting underclassmen in the country. However, the offense ranked bottom-two in the conference each of the past two seasons. Can Beck save the offense in time? 

What can Rich Rod accomplish in Year 1? 

The Mountaineers surprisingly brought Rich Rodriguez back to the program more than 15 years after he left for Michigan. Rodriguez bounced around for years before leading Jacksonville State to wild success as a transitioning program, but WVU is a tougher job the second time around. The Mountaineers only have one seven-win season since 2018 and lost their only two players to reach an all-conference team. Running back Jahiem White should fit perfectly within a Rich Rod offense, but almost every other projected contributor is brand new to campus.

Once again, the NFL news cycle is being dominated by Aaron Rodgers as the future Hall of Fame quarterback tries to figure out his next move. 

The four-time league MVP, former Super Bowl MVP and future Hall of Famer is facing an unknown future after the New York Jets decided to go in another direction earlier this offseason. Rodgers is reportedly trying to decide whether he will either retire or play a 21st season in the NFL. The Steelers and Giants are reportedly the front-runners to land Rodgers if he decides to resume his career, but the Minnesota Vikings are also a dark-horse candidate after losing Sam Darnold via free agency. 

Rodgers, 41, is coming off a 2024 season that was odd to say the least. While he put up decent numbers, Rodgers lacked the mobility that he had prior to his major Achilles injury that wiped out virtually his entire first season with the Jets. Rodgers was also part of a Jets team that endured a horrific 5-12 season that led to a regime change in the Big Apple. 

It's easy to fall behind on this story, as there is seemingly an update on Rodgers' future by the hour. In order to stay on top of the latest news, here is a running thread of the latest stories and updates regarding Rodgers and the teams that he has been linked to. 

Giants, Steelers making contingency plans at QB: As Rodgers continues to weigh his options, the Steelers re-signed QB Mason Rudolph, who went 8-4-1 as Pittsburgh's starting quarterback during his first go-around with the team. Rudolph spent last season with Tennessee. 

New York met with veteran Joe Flacco on Thursday and will meet on Friday with Russell Wilson. Wilson met with the Browns the previous day but left Cleveland without a contract. 

Teams be warned: An NFL team executive told CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones that teams still waiting for the future Hall of Famer to make his decision should ""do so at their own risk."" Teams should only wait so long and can only wait so long to make a decision on their quarterback room, given the free agent market and the upcoming draft class.

Giants make highest offer: Amid reports and rumors regarding the Pittsburgh Steelers zeroing in on the former New York Jets signal-caller, the New York Giants have made Rodgers his largest contract offer up to this point, according to The Athletic. 

Show me the money? Money is not the reason why Rodgers hasn't signed with the Steelers yet. The Steelers have made their offer to Rodgers, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. It's simply about Rodgers taking his time about making a decision. 

Based on the Post-Gazette's report, it appears that Rodgers is OK with the Steelers' offer, so things should come together rather quickly if he decides to come to Pittsburgh. 

Vikings might be in play: The Vikings' decision-makers are evaluating their options at quarterback which includes Rodgers, according to The Athletic, who also reported that Rodgers is intrigued by the idea of playing in Minnesota.

Of the three teams that appear to be in the running to get him, the Vikings appear to be the best spot, considering that the Vikings are coming off a 14-3 season, have one of the league's top receiving duos in Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison, running back and former Rodgers' teammate Aaron Jones, and a defense that recently added free agents Jonathan Allen and Javon Hargrave. 

Jets releasing Rodgers: While this was a formality, it was reported on Wednesday that the Jets would officially release Rodgers sometime after the start of the new league year. While they haven't released him yet, Rodgers was allowed to begin speaking to other teams after the Jets announced their intentions to part ways with him last month. 

Holding the Steelers hostage? Former NFL GM Doug Whaley said on Wednesday that Rodgers is ""holding the entire Steelers organization hostage"" during a Pittsburgh radio hit. The Steelers are indeed reportedly waiting for Rodgers to give them an answer, although NFL Media reported Wednesday morning that it could be weeks before a decision is made. Retirement is still a possible an option for Rodgers. 

Wilson not waiting around: Instead of waiting for Rodgers to make a decision, Russell Wilson -- the other notable quarterback who is still a free agent -- is taking matters into his own hands. Wilson is reportedly meeting with the Browns on Thursday and the Giants on Friday. 

If he were to sign with Cleveland, Wilson could find himself in a position battle with Kenny Pickett, who was traded from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia shortly after Wilson was signed by the Steelers last offseason.

NEW YORK (AP)  Kam Jones scored 28 points to surpass 2,000 for his career and No. 25 Marquette rallied past Xavier 89-87 on Thursday in the Big East Tournament quarterfinals.

After trailing by 14 early in the second half, the fifth-seeded Golden Eagles (23-9) took the lead for good at 81-80 on Jones' layup with 1:16 remaining.

David Joplin connected on a pivotal 3-pointer with 26 seconds left, and Marquette held on to earn a semifinal matchup with sixth-ranked and top-seeded St. John's on Friday night at Madison Square Garden.

Ryan Conwell scored a career-high 38 points for Xavier (21-11), a school record for a Big East Tournament game. The fourth-seeded Musketeers, perched precariously on the bubble for an NCAA Tournament bid, had won seven straight.

With former Marquette star Dwyane Wade sitting in the front row, Conwell shot 13 of 18 from the field and 7 for 11 on 3-pointers - including a long one he tossed in at the buzzer. Zach Freemantle had 15 points and Dailyn Swain added 11.

Chase Ross and Stevie Mitchell scored 16 points apiece for Marquette. Joplin finished with 14.

Xavier went 11 of 23 (48%) on 3s. Should the Musketeers make the NCAA Tournament, that will be a key weapon in their arsenal.

Jones boosted his career total to 2,005 points. Marquette heads into the semifinals on the strength of his scoring, but the Golden Eagles showed they're more than a one-man band with five players in double figures.

Ross stole the ball from Freemantle near the top of the key, leading to a 3 from Joplin that gave Marquette an 84-80 advantage with 26 seconds to play.

Jones scored in double figures for the 48th straight game, the longest current streak in the country.

Xavier: Fingers crossed on Selection Sunday.

Marquette: Dropped both its regular-season games against St. John's, losing 70-64 at MSG in early February and then 86-84 in overtime last Saturday at home.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP)  Jackson Shelstad had 18 points and TJ Bamba scored 17 to help No. 23 Oregon pull away late for a 72-59 victory over Indiana in the second round of the Big Ten Tournament on Thursday.

The Ducks (24-8) head into Friday's quarterfinal round against No. 7 Michigan State, the Big Ten regular-season champs, riding an eight-game winning streak.

Indiana (19-13) lost to Oregon for the second time in nine days and now must wait until Sunday to see if it makes the 68-team NCAA Tournament field.

Malik Reneau scored 19 points to lead the Hoosiers, while Trey Galloway added 15 points and nine assists.

Oregon took control by scoring the final 10 points of the first half, giving it a 37-29 lead and sealed the victory with a late 9-0 run to take a 65-56 lead. Indiana couldn't recover from either spurt.

Indiana: The Hoosiers may have done enough to make the tourney field. The question is whether they'll avoid a First Four game in Dayton, Ohio. They have no control over that now.

Oregon: The Ducks didn't earn a lot of style points, but they did advance to Friday's quarterfinal round - and in March, that's all that matters.

After the Hoosiers cut the deficit to 56-54 with 7:32 to play, Indiana was held scoreless for the next 5:28.

Indiana was 5 of 10 at the free-throw line and Oregon made eight 3-pointers compared with only four for the Hoosiers.

Oregon will try to get even with the Spartans after losing 86-74 in East Lansing, Michigan, on Feb. 8.

After 15 seasons, the Fran McCaffery era has come to an end for the Iowa Hawkeyes. The 65-year-old coach was fired Friday by athletic director Beth Goetz, sources told CBS Sports, one day removed from the Hawkeyes' 106-94 second-round loss in the Big Ten Tournament to Illinois.

McCaffery was ejected midway through the second half of the loss.

The Hawkeyes are 17-16 and will miss the NCAAs for the second straight season. McCaffery took Iowa to the NCAA tourney seven times, and it would have been eight if there had been a 2020 March Madness. But Iowa didn't make the Sweet 16 once under McCaffery; the school last advanced that far in 1999 under Tom Davis. 

The program suffered from notably poor attendance this season, one of its worst in the past two decades, as enthusiasm waned at the tail end of this phase. Iowa is considered a tough job in the Big Ten, but there were plenty of good times over the past decade. McCaffery coached 2020-21 national player of the year Luka Garza, in addition to 2022 top-five pick Keegan Murray and his brother, Kris, who was drafted 23rd overall in 2023.

Payton Sandfort is another program great who was developed by McCaffery. He was in tears as he left the court Thursday night.

Emotions overcome Payton Sandfort as he checks out of the game for the last time at Iowa.What a moment. pic.twitter.com/53QpkdkBQD

In the seven seasons prior to this one, McCaffery's offenses were ranked in the top 20 in efficiency. The Hawkeyes had four top-four Big Ten finishes, but this season wound up 12th in the 18-team league, which was the worst under McCaffery. He leaves with a 297-207 record overall and a 4-7 mark in the NCAAs.

For his career, McCaffery is 548-384.

Iowa will try to move quickly on its next coach. Candidates could include the likes of Drake's Ben McCollum (who is also drawing serious interest from Indiana), West Virginia's Darian DeVries, Colorado State's Niko Medved, Mississippi State's Chris Jans and Bradley's Brian Wardle.

The 2025 NWSL regular season starts on Friday signaling another thrilling chapter in women's soccer. All 14 clubs will be in action over the weekend and will show off their offseason prep, while rising stars start to shape the league's competitive landscape in year 13. As the season unfolds, the NWSL typically delivers skill and flare along with drama and chaos. Fans can watch select NWSL regular season matches across CBS platforms including CBS, CBS Sports Network, Paramount+, and CBS Sports Golazo Network. 

With new talent and strategic roster moves, some teams have already emerged as leading candicdates for successful season. But which clubs are the front runners and who has work to do?

Let's see where teams have separated themselves to start the season:

These are the top teams in the NWSL heading into the 2025 season, the ones that have already established gaps between themselves and ten other clubs. Not only will they compete against the league for supremacy, they'll be gunning for each other when it comes to titles on the line. 

Orlando Pride: Reigning Shield winners and NWSL Champions, the Pride are back, with most of their title winning roster in tact. In fact, they're welcoming back key pieces from injury, and Rafaelle adds another layer to the Pride's backline as Barbra Banda, Marta, and Ally Watt handle the attack.

Washington Spirit: Head coach Jonatan Giraldez and his squad already snatched the first title of the year witht he 2025 Challenge Cup and could gear up for more. Their internationals have high potential to shake things up and if Trinity Rodman can stay healthy, she'll have early MVP chatter around her and the Spirit will be difficult to stop. 

Kansas City Current: Armed with 2024 MVP and Golden Boot winner Temwa Chawinga, the Current looked poised for another deep run in 2025. If head coach Vlatko Andonovski can get the team off to a better defensive start and manage the goalkeeper postion, they'll find themselves competing for titles again.

NJ/NY Gotham FC: The squad misssed out on a shot at spot in the 2024 Championship on penalties, so they'll be motivated. USWNT players Rose Lavelle, Tierna Davidson, and Emily Sonnett are back, and Midge Purce returns for one more season. New international signings Gabi Portilho and Stella Nyamekey could be game changers if the coaching staff stick with their organized chaos and continue to utilize the entire roster.

These are teams who will likely be in the playoff mix and could even break through. They could land anywhere from fifth through seventh place and even break up a bracket in the playoffs if they're hitting their stride. But, they might be missing a certain piece or even experience to make a deeper run.

North Carolina Courage: The Courage will remain a dark horse until they can get past the quarterfinal round, but new acquisitions could bring some needed unpredictability to their mostly constant style of profit through possession. The club made a huge move in trading for Jaedyn Shaw, and if she's developing quick chemistry with Ashley Sanchez then then the duo could get the club further into the postseason than the last two seasons.

Seattle Reign FC: The Reign missed the playoffs last year for the first time since 2018 and made moves to make their return in 2025. Adding USWNT forward Lynn Biyendolo immediately boosts the attack and if sophomore players Jordyn Bugg, Sam Meza, Madison Curry, and Emeri Adames can be breakout contributors, the Reign will break back into the playoffs. 

Bay FC: No team is teetering the will they or won't they line more than Bay FC. The coaching staff is currently under investigation and the players are expected to compete alongside something outside of their control. They cracked the 2024 playoffs as a seventh seed , but how they're managed will play a role in where they go in 2025.

Utah Royals FC: The squad went on a solid second-half run last season and were the only bottom half table team to have a three game win streak in the final five weeks of the 2024 season. If they can carry that momentum into 2025 they'll remain a dark horse candidate, and if Mina Tanaka and Ally Sentnor have strong seasons, then Utah may crack the playoff picture.

Congrats on every team in this category as the club fighting to be the eighth best team in the league. It's far from a glowing compliment, but it's never over until its over, and for all these teams it's just beginning. Chasing eighth means it's a change to participate in the postseason, and anything can happen in playoffs. Can't manage an eighth place finish in a 14 team league? Yikes.

Angel City FC: A lot will depend on how interim coach Sam Laity can get young players out the gate. Jun Endo is their most dynamic player and is coming off an ACL injury, and Christen Press is back for one more season. If Angel City can set themselves up with some good early results, they can make things less difficult on themselves in the second half of the season.

Houston Dash: The club made a lot of offseason moves to try and compete in 2025, but everything will have to come together. Adding Yazmeen Ryan, Delanie Sheehan, and Messiah Bright were good steps in a competitive direction, but what tactics head coach Fabrice Gautrat settles on is the big question. Combine that with a club sale inquiry, and whatever success the Dash get this season will be brought by players excelling beyond a difficult environment.

Racing Louisville FC: No other team has been a ninth place team more times in a row than Racing Lousiville. Where ninth place was just flat out poor in past seasons, last year's expanded playoff format meant they found themselves just outside of postseason picture. The puzzle might not be any less complicated in 2025, but Savannah DeMelo, Taylor Flint, Bethany Balcer, and Janine Sonis might change things.

Portland Thorns FC: Soccer is a team sport and no one player can dicate everything, but not having Sophia Wilson for 2025 will be a change for the Thorns. The USWNT striker recently announced her pregnancy and the squad also has to manage multiple season ending injuries to Morgan Weaver, defender Nicole Payne, and defender Marie Muller. Young midfielder Olivia Moultrie returns from injury, and Sam Coffey and Hina Sugita will be tasked with dictating play if Portland want to reach the playoffs.

Chicago Stars FC: They made the playoffs in 2024, but their competitive decline happened with a skid into that postseason. For 2025 they may or may not have Mallory Swanson to contend this year so that means they'll have to bank on third-year player Ally Schlegel to have a big year and for Ludmilla to break out after joining the club last year during late mid-season. Add in question marks around healthy defenders and things don't look great to start.

San Diego Wave FC: They have a new coach and small roster to start the year. There's no replacing Naomi Girma or Alex Morgan, but they'll certainly try. It just might be painful along the way. How their new international signings adapt to the league could help them get resuls over the season.

Iowa coach Fran McCaffery received two technical fouls in the span of 15 seconds and was ejected from Thursday's Big Ten Tournament game vs. Illinois with 13:33 remaining in the second half. 

The first technical foul came in an apparent response to McCaffery jawing at an official near him while Iowa was setting up on offense. With play stopped, another one came 15 seconds of real-time later after he appeared to mouth the words ""that's f---ing bullshit"" at the official who dinged him.

The game was 69-60 before the blow-up, and Illinois made all four technical free throws to take a 73-60 lead.

By McCaffery standards, the quick hook was tame. But it came at a crucial point in the game that cost the Hawkeyes momentum, and possibly the game, which will effectively end its season.

The irony is that the outburst, a McCaffery staple over the years, might be the last one we see from him as Iowa's coach. The team will miss the NCAA Tournament this season for a second consecutive year, and McCaffery's seat appears to be red-hot after failing to finish above .500 in Big Ten play for two consecutive seasons.

There isn't a good time to have to hire a football coach, but Scot Loeffler's sudden departure from Bowling Green to take an assistant job with the Philadelphia Eagles on Feb. 28 left athletic director Derek van der Merwe in a particularly bad spot. With college football's coaching carousel already complete and spring practice just around the corner, van der Merwe had an unconventional list of candidates to navigate and a short window to complete the process.

Bowling Green coaching alum Urban Meyer pushed an ""out of the box"" name onto van der Merwe's radar in Eddie George. The former Heisman Trophy winner, NFL All-Pro and sitting coach at Tennessee State -- who ironically took Meyer's initial call while driving through Bowling Green, Kentucky -- emerged as the leading candidate and was hired on March 10. 

With a splash hire secured, van der Merwe began to see the upside to the awkwardly timed change in leadership.  

""What's unique about this one is that if you can imagine like you're sitting in December, and you have a coach leaving after a season or after a bowl game. Then all of a sudden, that transfer portal is wide open,"" van der Merwe told CBS Sports. ""Sometimes they're out the door before there's that chance for that coach to kind of on-ramp into that relationship, and demonstrate that person's really committed to the well-being and the development (of the players).

""So there's somewhat of an advantage for a March (hiring) situation. Yes, they have this transfer portal window open because of the transition, but you know that they're still enrolled in school for the semester and they they're still going to complete the semester in school. (This way they) get the chance for that coach to actually sit down with that person.""

Now the Falcons are full steam ahead preparing for spring practice -- still set to start next week -- and only one player has formally entered the portal since Loffler left. George and his staff will get 15 full practice sessions to make an impression before the portal window opens on April 16. 

He's no stranger to a late start. He hit the ground running in April of his first season at TSU. He has conducted meetings with the current assistants and it's unclear if he will make any outside hires -- which could include with members of the TSU staff that won an OVC title and qualified for the FCS playoffs last year. 

""I think now the goal is, how do we get to September?"" George told reporters after his introductory press conference. ""It's going to take diligence. It's going to take us, for us to be focused, operate with a great attitude (and) be intentional. You know, trust the process of us getting there. And that process is constantly having communication, being transparent with that communication and understanding that the end goal is to put the best staff together. "" 

Van der Merwe calls George a renaissance man who has been successful in business, Broadway, and now coaching. It stands to reason that George will be key in raising funds for the program as a familiar face to alumni who remember him as a Tennessee Titans or Ohio State star. It's also unclear if George will be donating back to the school a la Joe Moglia at Coastal Carolina or Biff Poggi at Charlotte. 

The Eddie George era may be starting a little late in comparison to other coaching tenures, but the fact that it's happening at all is a bold bet by Bowling Green that he can bring a renaissance for the Falcons -- just like Meyer did 25 years ago.

Indiana star Oumar Ballo shared Thursday after the team's Big Ten Tournament loss to Oregon that he has received death wishes, death threats and other ""crazy"" messages this season after transferring in from Arizona. 

Ballo is believed to have been one of the higher-paid players in college basketball this season through NIL after earning All-Pac-12 honors the two seasons prior, and he says he has repeatedly been the target of online harassment during his time in Bloomington, a year he described as ""mentally draining.""

""All we're trying to do is win for these people, but we lose one game, two games — the next thing you know, your DM is crazy,"" Ballo said. ""You know, like death wishes, like death threats and stuff like that. Like nobody wants to live like that, you know. And I hope people change stuff like that, because this is not helping anybody. 

""At the end of the day, we are human beings and we have feelings, you know? Just like you, you wake up, go to work, and someone is wishing nothing but the worst for you and your work. You know, it's mentally draining, and nobody want to deal with that for a whole five-month season.""

""Death wishes, death threats."" - Indiana Hoosier center Oumar Ballo on interactions over social media this season. ""Nobody wants to live like that.""I'm not talking about the true fans because I know they have our back. If you're not cheering for us, leave us alone."" #IUBB pic.twitter.com/t5rN9b0jOo

Ballo's comments echoed a similar sentiment shared from Kansas State's Coleman Hawkins earlier in the week after the Wildcats fell to Baylor in the second round of the Big 12 Tournament, likely leaving them on the wrong side of the NCAA Tournament bubble. Hawkins fought through tears as he admitted social media affected his play this season.

""I really wanted to come in and impact the program,"" Hawkins said. ""I'm sorry for crying, but shit, this shit hurts, but I really wanted to come in and impact the program. And, you know, some of the stuff, the outcome obviously wasn't what we wanted. But you know, if someone asked me if I regret coming here, I tell them, you know, I don't regret being with my team, the coaching staff, the people I met. 

""I feel like I let a lot of people down. I feel like I did a poor job of letting people talk about me. It affected my play, and it was evident all year. And I wish I could just go back and block out everything, not for myself, but for the team, so we could have had a more successful year. But I mean, this is a learning lesson for me, and I wish the best for the future of this program.""

K-State senior Coleman Hawkins spoke through tears for a minute and a half after the loss to Baylor""These guys haven't experienced some of the things I experienced. I really wanted to come in an impact the program. I'm sorry for crying, but shit, this shit hurts"" pic.twitter.com/YxJsR13TTR

Indiana enters Selection Sunday at 19-13 overall and one of the last four teams in the 68-team field according to Jerry Palm, though they are in serious jeopardy of missing March Madness. The team struggled earlier this year with seven losses in an eight-game span before finishing 5-3.

Kansas State lost six straight to start the 2025 year before winning six straight — only to lose four straight.

Both the schools are believed to be among the most competitive in college basketball in terms of NIL resources, meaning both Ballo and Hawkins are presumably well-compensated for their services. But the trickle-down effect of that economy and all that comes with it has left players exposed to online badgering from fans and even gamblers.

""It's too much to take in, for players and for coaches,"" Ballo said. ""I hope, man, it changes, because it's time. Like, they're not helping us. They're not helping anybody. ... If you're not cheering for us, just leave us alone, because at some point you have life, you know. Go take care of that and let us handle our work.""

Filed under:

Transfers are the new NCAA norm. Here's why some women's basketball players stayed put instead.

After her freshman season, Harmoni Turner was flooded with offers. The Harvard guard – and former five-star recruit – averaged 15.9 points, 6.5 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 2.5 steals per game in her first Ivy League campaign, and major programs took notice. The SEC was particularly keen on getting Turner out of Cambridge and into the country's premier conference. 

That was during the 2021-22 season, just as the new NIL rules were put into place. That, combined with transfer rules allowing players to see the court instantly without a redshirt season, changed the landscape of college basketball. Since then, switching programs season after season has become the norm, with an estimated 1,400 women's basketball players entering the transfer portal after the 2024 season. But despite the ease of transferring, and the perks that often come with it, there are still players like Turner who have made a permanent home at their schools. 

“The numbers these SEC schools were throwing at me were crazy,” Turner said of her NIL offers. “But having a Harvard degree is important to me. Plus, I love my team. Like, I really love my team. So, I don't regret turning down the money at all.”

Turner is one of many mid-major stars who have chosen to remain at their respective programs instead of making the jump to high-major basketball. Building and maintaining a program in this era of college basketball is a challenge, but doing it at the mid-major level is even more difficult. Recruits like Turner, who opt to stick it out instead of looking for greener pastures, make a difference. 

“College athletics right now are kind of leaning in the direction of money, glitz and glamour, limelight and all of that,” Harvard coach Carrie Moore said. “I think there is something so meaningful in a player like Harmoni staying put when she could have gone really anywhere.”

With an excess of opportunities available for players at all times, small programs have to provide something different in order to draw attention. For Moore and Harvard, the chance to earn an Ivy League education can serve as a draw for players. Other schools have to build brands that are desirable in other ways.

“Some of those schools have huge resources and all kinds of money to spend on players,” South Dakota State coach Aaron Johnson said. “We're not going to win that bidding war. We're not going to win that dollar amount war. So we have to have some different things that differentiate our program.”

Johnson has built a mid-major powerhouse at South Dakota State. When he took over the program in 2000, it was still a Division II school. Since the Jackrabbits moved to Division I in 2004 and became eligible for the postseason in 2009, they have won the Summit League 12 times to earn automatic NCAA Tournament bids. This season, South Dakota State went undefeated in conference play and won its conference tournament for the third consecutive year. Those are the kind of numbers Johnson shares with potential recruits. Winning, he says, is one of the things that makes South Dakota State stand out.

“I think our players are choosing South Dakota State for a variety of reasons,” he said. “Maybe they want more balance in their lives, maybe they want a different fit, a different team dynamic. Or maybe they want a chance to win. There's a lot of power five schools that win, but there are a lot that don't win. We've had success over the years.”

For Larchwood, Iowa-native Brooklyn Meyer, the decision to come to South Dakota State was an easy one. The decision to stay was even easier. The 2023-24 Summit League Player of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year grew up just an hour away from campus, on the Iowa and South Dakota border. She was already aware of the program's success, and South Dakota State was the first school to reach out to her, and later, the first to offer her a scholarship. 

Johnson says establishing relationships when players are freshman or sophomores is crucial. Big-name schools can jump in late and still have a shot, but in order to compete, South Dakota State has to see the potential before anyone else does. Sometimes that means it takes players until their junior or senior years in college to really develop. But Meyer was ready to compete from the jump. She turned down Power Five offers to go to South Dakota State. 

She has already played in two NCAA Tournaments with the Jackrabbits, with another on the horizon, and Meyer has won the top individual awards for her conference, but she's not even entertaining the idea of moving on to another program.

“Every case is different, and everyone needs to do what is best for them,” Meyer said. “But for me, I love my teammates, I love the community here and that's something I don't want to give up. I haven't explored the idea of leaving at all.”

Drake's Katie Dinnebier feels the same way. The senior guard made a name for herself on a national stage early in her career, when she scored 24 points in an overtime loss to Caitlin Clark and Iowa to start her sophomore season. Dinnebier has had plenty of other impressive performances against high-major teams, including 40 points this season against Iowa and 39 against Iowa State. She's also eighth in the nation in scoring, with 22.7 points per game. 

Dinnebier is matter of fact about why she likes playing at Drake: “I like winning championships,” she said with a laugh. The Bulldogs won the Missouri Valley conference tournament in 2023 and 2024, and Dinnebier will play for another, starting on Friday. 

She's also from West Des Moines, which is a mere 9.8 miles away from Des Moines, where Drake is located. Playing in front of her friends and family is just one of the ways Dinnebier continues to find joy in basketball, something that was a priority for her when choosing a school. 

“College basketball nowadays is a business,” she said. “But I don't feel that way at Drake. Obviously we still work hard, but we are more like a family. That's what has kept me here, and that's what makes Drake special.”

Turner, Meyer and Dinnebier all benefit from NIL at their respective schools. They each have deals with local companies, but none of them want that to be the only thing that influences the decisions of young recruits, or more experienced players who are considering entering the portal.

“People tend to think bigger is better, but I'm getting my school paid for, I'm in my hometown and I love the culture of my program,” Dinnebier said. “Don't get me wrong, NIL is great because we don't have time for jobs or internships, we don't have time to make our own money. And for some people, transferring is the right move. But there is also a specialness of committing to a school and staying there.”

F1 driver Fernando Alonso channeled Marshawn Lynch Friday at the Australian Grand Prix

If you buy something from an SB Nation link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

“I'm just here so I don't get fined.”

That short sentence during Media Day at Super Bowl XLIX turned Marshawn Lynch into a household name. The Seattle Seahawks running back began his entire podium session ahead of the big game advising the reporters in front of him that he was just here so he did not get fined, and that they could ask him “all the questions they want to,” but the answer would be the same.

He was there so he would not get fined by the league.

Enter Formula 1 driver Fernando Alonso.

Following Friday's two practice sessions at the Australian Grand Prix the Aston Martin driver stopped to talk with the official F1 channel, as is requisite during race weekends. While drivers are not required to talk to the assembled print media following Friday practice sessions, speaking with the official F1 channel is part of their duties.

Alonso was rather ... reserved during the discussion and made it clear he would be all season.

“Nothing, and if I learned something I would not tell you,” began Alonso when speaking with Lawrence Barretto, with a smile on his face.

“We come here because it's mandatory,” said Alonso. “But there is nothing really to talk [about]. We just jump out of the car and, as you said, it will be 24 Fridays like now and you can ask anything, I will not answer.”

Asked by Barretto if he got a “feel” for the car, Alonso simply responded “could be,” before then outlining that he needed to review everything with the team. “I need to review everything now with my team and privately discuss what we did today,” added the driver.

Barretto then asked if there were any problems with the car, and Alonso again was rather reserved with his answer, all with a smile on his face. 

“No, we did laps, the car goes, the engine is alive, the brakes are okay, the gearbox is changing gears up and down, so we're good,” described Alonso. 

As for how Alonso's day went on the track, the Aston Martin driver finished FP1 up in P8, and landed P13 on the timing sheets for FP2.

This is not the first time in recent memory a driver has channeled Lynch. Last year at the Singapore Grand Prix Max Verstappen had a Marshawn moment of his own, after being ordered to perform community service after swearing during the FIA Press Conference ahead of the race. Verstappen was tight-lipped during the FIA Press Conference after qualifying, going as far as to say at one point that he would not elaborate for fear of being fined, and then held an impromptu session with the media outside the room.

We'll see if Alonso remains as tight-lipped on Fridays throughout the rest of the season.

Dries Vanthoor got off to a fast start in the Mobil 1 Twelve Hours of Sebring, earning the second consecutive pole position for BMW in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship.

For his qualifying debut at Sebring International Raceway, Vanthoor turned a 1 minute, 47.091-second lap in the No. 24 BMW M Hybrid V8 for Team RLL BMW and backed up the pole position that he won for the Rolex 24 at Daytona season opener.

After Daytona, we knew we had a good qualifying car, but it's the first time here,” Vanthoor told NBC Sports' Kevin Lee on Peacock. “So it's really cool to be on pole the first time here. The comeptition is very hard, so it's never easy to do but very happy we got a lap in and get ourselves on pole.”

The No. 24 BMW, which is co-driven by Vanthoor, Philipp Eng and Kevin Magnussen, finished fourth at Daytona after leading 90 laps. The Sebring pole was another indicator that BMW is emerging as a premier class contender after winning only twice in the past two seasons of Grand Touring Prototype category.

“So far it's looking quite good but still a long ways to go,” said Vanthroor, a 26-year-old from Belgium in his first season of full-time racing in IMSA's top division. “It's a long ways to go tomorrow, that's first on our list, and we can see after that how it goes.”

Tom Blomqvist qualified second at 1:47.116 in the No. 60 Meyer Shank Racing Acura ARX-06, coming up just 0.025 seconds short on his final qualifying lap of knocking Vanthoor off the pole.

Felipe Nasr qualified third in the No. 7 Porsche Penske Motorsport 963 that opened the season with its second consecutive victory in the Rolex 24 at Daytona.

The GTP qualifying session was abbreviated by a 6-minute red flag after the No. 31 Whelen Action Express Cadillac V-Series.R stopped on track. That left Vanthoor and other drivers with one last shot at the bumpy and challenging 17-turn, 3.74-mile road course.

“On a normal qualifying session, you maybe get two chances, now you only had one,” said Vanthoor, whose car is sporting a special livery to celebrate the 50th anniversary of BMW North America and the automaker's 1975 win at Sebring. “It makes a bit more pressure to get that lap together. It makes it a bit more difficult. But yeah, it makes me a bit fired up or nervous at the same time. Looks like it's working.”

Here are the pole-sitters in other categories for the endurance race classic on the 17-turn, 3.74-mile road course:

LMP2: Steven Thomas, No. 11 TDS Racing ORECA LMP2 07, 1:51.804

GTD Pro: Albert Cotsa, No. 81 DragonSpeed Ferrari 296 GT3, 1:59.225

When patients walked into Planned Parenthood clinics, a consumer data company sold their precise locations to anti-abortion groups for targeted ads.

When patients picked up prescriptions for testosterone replacement therapy, law enforcement retrieved their names and addresses without a warrant.

And when a father was arrested by immigration authorities, agents allegedly accessed his personal information from a medical clinic where he received diabetes treatment.

Progressive California lawmakers have proposed a number of bills aimed at bolstering privacy protections for women, transgender people, and immigrants in response to such intrusions by anti-abortion groups, conservative states, and federal law enforcement agencies as President Donald Trump declares the nation ""will be woke no longer"" and flexes his executive power to roll back rights.

Democrats have supermajorities in the state legislature, but even if they pass the proposals, they may first need to lobby one of their own: Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has noticeably tempered his once harsh criticism of Trump.

Last month, the Democratic governor issued a rare veto threat against a bill that would expand the state's sanctuary law to limit cooperation between state prisons and federal immigration agents. And Newsom recently called transgender athletes' participation in women's sports ""deeply unfair"" on his new podcast with guest Charlie Kirk, a founder of the conservative group Turning Point USA. Newsom went on to tell Kirk that he had a ""hard time with"" the way the right talks about transgender people.

Billions of dollars are also on the line for California. Newsom visited the White House last month seeking unconditional aid for wildfire victims in Los Angeles, and the state relies on Washington for over 60% of its Medicaid budget, which is vulnerable to significant cuts under the GOP's budget blueprint.

""California's leaders have not been as aggressive, out of recognition that there are many things that the state needs federal cooperation on,"" said Thad Kousser, a political science professor at the University of California-San Diego.

A Newsom spokesperson declined to comment on pending legislation. He has a track record of supporting abortion, transgender, and immigrant rights.

Since taking office, Trump has granted the Elon Musk-controlled Department of Government Efficiency — created through a Trump executive order — access to previously restricted data, including medical information, raising concerns that sensitive information could be exposed without proper safeguards. 

The White House did not respond to requests for comment.

While most Americans are familiar with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as HIPAA, it offers only narrow protection for patients in health care settings. There's no comprehensive federal law protecting data privacy.

Health care information has increasingly become a tool of surveillance and enforcement, and in states that have banned certain medical treatments or toughened immigration laws, vulnerable populations are at greater risk, said Suzanne Bernstein, a health privacy rights expert with the Electronic Privacy Information Center.

Progressive Democrats are concerned that personal information and people's medical decisions could be used to monitor or criminalize patients, facilitate arrests in or near health care facilities, or jeopardize access to health care services.

They and health privacy advocates say now is the time to shore up protections for the nearly 2 million immigrants living in California without authorization, the more than 200,000 transgender adults in the state, and thousands of people — living in the state or out of state — in need of abortion care in California each year. Some of these laws could take effect immediately if signed.

""This is about making sure that people are able to access critical health care in California and to take the politics out of our hospitals and health clinics,"" said state Sen. Jesse Arreguín, who hopes the governor would sign his bill to protect immigrants.

The bills are expected to be debated in Sacramento in the coming months.

Since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion, anti-abortion groups have purchased location information from consumer data companies to target people seeking abortion care with anti-abortion ads. And authorities in states with abortion bans have used cellphone data to enforce laws beyond their borders.

A bill introduced by state Assembly member Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, AB 45, would make geofencing, the collection of phone location by data brokers, illegal around health care facilities that provide in-person services. It would also prevent reproductive health information collected during research from being disclosed in response to out-of-state requests.

Conservative organizations said the proposal would single them out by restricting their ability to inform women about alternatives to abortion, including services offered by crisis pregnancy centers.

""I think that could very well be a First Amendment violation,"" said Jonathan Keller, president of the California Family Council, a statewide anti-abortion nonprofit. ""It doesn't seem like the bill would be prohibiting or putting any restrictions on a group like Planned Parenthood if they wanted to market or target to a local high school or college.""

So far this year, lawmakers in 49 states have introduced more than 700 anti-transgender bills, seeking to ban gender-affirming care, prohibit gender identity education in schools, or restrict transgender students from participating in sports, according to the Trans Legislation Tracker, a national research organization tracking bills affecting transgender people. Transgender adults represent less than 1% of the U.S. population.

And some states with bans or restrictions on gender-affirming care have been targeting health care data. In 2023, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis requested that Florida universities release data on the number of individuals who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria or received treatment at campus clinics. That same year, Missouri's Republican attorney general, Andrew Bailey, submitted 54 requests to one hospital seeking information about gender-affirming care procedures.

Trump has issued a series of executive orders to ban access to gender-affirming care for minors. Federal judges have temporarily blocked some portions of his orders.

To guard against other states that criminalize or ban gender-affirming care, California state Sen. Scott Wiener wants to expand current protections for minors to include adults.

His bill, SB 497, would require law enforcement to obtain a warrant to access state databases on gender-affirming care and make it a misdemeanor to release the data to unauthorized parties. It would also prohibit health care providers, employers, and insurers from releasing information about a person who seeks or obtains gender-affirming physical and mental health care to an agency or individual from another state.

""We want to make sure that we are as comprehensively as possible shielding trans people from hate emanating from the federal government, other states, and private parties,"" Wiener said.

Keller countered that authorities in states with bans on abortion or gender-affirming care should have access to medical information as they investigate providers who could harm patients or coerce them into procedures against their will. He cited a lawsuit against Kaiser Permanente over a teenager who detransitioned after undergoing gender-affirming care. A 2015 survey found it was uncommon for people undergoing gender-affirming care to decide to permanently detransition.

""The only way that you're able to uncover that level of widespread malpractice and malfeasance is if these health care records are able to be accessed,"" Keller said.

The California Family Council plans to oppose both bills.

Earlier this year, Trump rescinded a long-standing policy of not making immigration arrests near hospitals, schools, or churches. The decision has providers fearful that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents will disrupt their work at health facilities and prompt immigrants to skip medical care — for themselves or, of particular concern, their children.

Anticipating the move, California's Democratic attorney general, Rob Bonta, issued guidance in December advising health care providers how best to respond if ICE comes to their doorstep. But while private entities are encouraged to follow these policies, only state-run facilities are required to adopt them.

""Some health care providers have implemented them, but not everyone has,"" Arreguín said.

Arreguín's SB 81 would require all health care facilities, including hospitals and community-based clinics, to follow state guidance to limit cooperation with immigration authorities. It would also prohibit providers from granting access to private areas or places where a patient is actively receiving treatment or care, unless there's a warrant.

Another immigration bill, AB 421, would limit the sharing of local law enforcement information if agents plan to make an arrest within a one-mile radius of a hospital or medical office, a child care or day care facility, a religious institution, or a place of worship. California law enforcement has some discretion to share information with immigration agents when an individual has been convicted of a serious crime or felony.

Kousser said immigration is more complicated for California politicians than health privacy. Although a February poll by the Public Policy Institute of California found that 7 in 10 Californians think immigrants are a benefit to the state, Kousser said that lawmakers, especially those who won by narrow margins in contested districts, still have to make tough political choices.

Senate Republican leader Brian Jones, who represents a predominantly Democratic district in San Diego, is proposing to change California's sanctuary policies to require law enforcement to share information with ICE when a person has been convicted of a serious crime.

""When these violent felons are released from local custody, they go right back into the communities that they came from to re-victimize those same immigrant communities,"" Jones said.

But Jones acknowledged the need for nuance when it comes to health privacy.

""Look, the bottom line for me on this immigration reform in America is it needs to be humanitarian and it needs to make sense,"" Jones said. ""And so, if there are areas that we need to protect folks, it might make sense.""

California's Medicaid program has borrowed $3.4 billion from the state's general fund — and will likely need even more — to cover ballooning health expenses for 15 million residents with low incomes and disabilities.

The state Department of Finance disclosed the loan to lawmakers in a letter late Wednesday, noting funds were needed to make critical payments to health care providers in Medi-Cal, the state's version of Medicaid. In recent months, Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration has warned of skyrocketing health care costs, including higher prescription drug prices and increased enrollment by newly eligible seniors and immigrants without legal status.

Finance spokesperson H.D. Palmer said the loan will cover Medi-Cal obligations through the end of the month. He declined to specify the total of the program's potential shortfall. However, a document circulated by state Senate leaders warns that additional funding may be needed to cover expenses through June 30, the end of the fiscal year.

The cost overrun adds a new layer of difficulty for Democrats who control the legislature and are already grappling with congressional budget plans that could slash Medicaid funding, which accounts for 60% of Medi-Cal's $174.6 billion budget. President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers have also criticized California Democrats for covering residents regardless of their immigration status.

Newsom spokesperson Izzy Gardon downplayed the loan. ""Rising Medicaid costs are a national challenge, affecting both red and blue states alike,"" Gardon said. ""This is not unique to California.""

Health officials last year said the state would spend roughly $6.4 billion in the 2024-25 fiscal year to cover immigrants without legal status, which the Democratic governor has hailed as a key step toward his goal of providing ""universal coverage"" for Californians. In recent testimony, however, finance staff told legislators that benefits to all income-eligible Californians are projected to cost roughly $9.5 billion, of which $8.4 billion will come from the general fund.

Republicans called for fresh scrutiny of the state's decision to cover residents without legal status. ""This program is out of control,"" Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones posted on the social platform X. ""We are demanding a full hearing and a full cost analysis so the public knows exactly where their tax dollars are going.""

Patient advocates objected to Republicans singling out the expansion for immigrants.

""Health care costs are influenced by many factors including prescription drugs, hospital costs, and more,"" said Rachel Linn Gish, a spokesperson for Health Access California, a consumer health advocacy group.

According to a fall update from the Department of Health Care Services, Medi-Cal spending grew due to higher-than-expected enrollment of seniors, fewer Californians losing Medi-Cal coverage than anticipated, and increased pharmaceutical spending, as well as expanding coverage of immigrants. For instance, the state is spending $1.1 billion more on residents who were expected to lose coverage after the covid-19 pandemic, and an additional $2.7 billion more than anticipated to cover unauthorized residents.

Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas said he's committed to maintaining the state's expansions of Medi-Cal services.

""There are tough choices ahead, and Assembly Democrats will closely examine any proposal from the Governor,"" he said in a statement. ""But let's be clear: We will not roll over and leave our immigrants behind.""

Senate leaders said they were looking closely at the state's estimated costs and caseloads and would recommend cost containment measures as part of their budget proposal in the coming weeks.

Scott Graves, budget director at the California Budget & Policy Center, said it's not unusual for the state government to make adjustments when spending doesn't line up with projections.

Last year, for instance, the state borrowed $1.75 billion against its general fund when revenues from a state provider tax were delayed. Prior to that, Department of Finance officials said, California took out a similar loan in 2018 for $830 million.

""The reality is all of these are just estimates, especially with a very complicated program like Medi-Cal,"" Graves said, noting that $3.4 billion is roughly 2% of the state's overall Medi-Cal budget. ""It seems like we're on the verge of making a mountain out of a molehill.""

Mike Genest, who served as finance director under Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, agreed that adjustments can be routine. But he said the magnitude of Medi-Cal's current overrun was not.

""For this to happen in the middle of the year — we're only in March — I mean, that's pretty astounding,"" Genest said.

California Democrats continue to characterize Trump and congressional Republicans as the biggest threat, pointing to the House budget plan to shrink Medicaid spending by as much as $880 billion. They say cuts of that magnitude would leave millions of residents uninsured, reducing access to preventive care and driving up costlier emergency room services.

They cautioned that some short-term cost increases could be driven by newly eligible residents seeking long-delayed care, which could level off in coming years. However, some acknowledge difficult decisions ahead.

""We definitely have to ensure that those who are our most vulnerable — our kids, those with chronic conditions — continue to have some sort of coverage,"" said Democratic Sen. Akilah Weber Pierson, a San Diego County physician. ""The question is, what will that look like? To be quite honest with you, at this point, I don't know.""

More teenagers report high mental wellbeing - yet at the same time, those who are struggling rate their depressive symptoms significantly higher than previous cohorts did at the same age, according to a study from the University of Gothenburg.

The study, published in Journal of Affective Disorders Reports, examined changes in how young teenagers in Sweden rated their depressive symptoms over two decades.

Researchers compared two groups of 13–16-year-olds: one from 2004 and one from 2019–2020. Both groups rated their depressive symptoms using the internationally established Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), a self-report assessment.

The results show that the overall proportion of adolescents reporting depressive symptoms increased from 21 percent in 2004 to 29 percent in 2019–2020-an increase that is not considered dramatic in this context.

However, a key shift is evident: more adolescents than before report feeling extremely well. In the 2019–2020 group, 33 percent had very low CDI scores, indicating strong mental wellbeing, compared to just 15 percent in 2004.

At the same time, those who are struggling report feeling significantly worse than before. Adolescents with depressive symptoms in 2019–2020 rated themselves higher on self-deprecating and negative thoughts compared to their counterparts in 2004.

Those who report high levels of depressive symptoms today rate themselves significantly higher than those in previous cohorts. We also see notable increases in certain areas, particularly self-deprecation-something that primarily affects young women.""

Carl Wikberg, district nurse and adjunct senior lecturer in community medicine and public health at Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg

The CDI assessment measures various aspects of mental wellbeing, including negative mood, self-esteem, ineffectiveness, and interpersonal problems. In the 2019–2020 group, three statements stood out among those reporting depressive symptoms:

""The fact that some young people report strong self-loathing is concerning and can make us feel despair. However, there is also hope: we are seeing a larger proportion of adolescents at the very lowest end of the scale, meaning their mental wellbeing has improved. So, the trend is not entirely negative,"" says Wikberg.

While the study does not provide definitive answers as to why these changes are occurring, the researchers highlight the role of evolving public discourse on mental health. A more open attitude toward mental health issues and treatment may influence how young people describe their wellbeing in self-report assessments.

At the same time, the study underscores the importance of school health services and primary care in identifying adolescents with high CDI scores. Screening tools like CDI create opportunities to detect and support those in need.The study included 617 adolescents (aged 13–16) from 2019–2020 as part of a larger research project on depression. The comparison group consisted of 80 adolescents of the same age from 2004, who participated in a CDI validation study in a Swedish context.

Fox News host Jessica Tarlov on Thursday summed up Americans' displeasure with President Donald Trump's second term as she argued that Democrats' messaging is “going pretty well” despite some “painful moments.”

“If you look at the latest Quinnipiac poll, there's over 50% disapproval of Trump himself, how he's handling the economy, how he's handling the federal workforce, how he's handling Ukraine-Russia, how he's handling trade with Mexico, how he's handling trade with Canada,” she said on “The Five.”

“So basically, he's underwater on everything.”

The White House has seen brutal polling data in recent days as most Americans disapprove of the president's handling of the economy, per a new CNN poll, while a separate Reuters/Ipsos poll found about 57% of Americans believe Trump's economic moves have been “too erratic.”

Tarlov's remarks arrived as part of a panel discussion on messaging from the left as Democrats are hiring influencers, including some who have advised them to keep things real and “be meaner,” according to a new report by independent journalist Tara Palmeri.

Her comments come just a day after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz told MSNBC that he owns the “mess” that Americans are in following Trump's victory over him and Kamala Harris in November.

Tarlov, who gave the former vice presidential candidate props for the remarks, added that “a lot” of the reason for Trump's disapproval in the polls is due to Democrats holding town halls, like Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), who reportedly spoke to the “highest turnout” of his constituents since taking office in 2019.

“And we know about the Republicans havingtown halls and then having to run away or asking questions like, ‘What do you think of DOGE?' and expecting people to say something positive and then they are screaming,'” she continued.

Tarlov went on to blast conservatives who have claimed that there are “fake” constituents at the town hall events.

“If you don't think that cutting tens of thousands of workers, if you have a plan to take away hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicaid isn't going to animate people, 2026 is going to be pretty bleak,” she said.

U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy informed members of Congress on Thursday he has signed an agreement with the General Services Administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to right-size the Postal Service budget.

The Postal Service moved in January to cut 10,000 jobs cuts through an early retirement offer to eligible workers.

In a letter to Congress, DeJoy lamented that the Postal Service has a ""broken business model that was not financially sustainable without critically necessary and core change.""

""Fixing a broken organization that had experienced close to $100 billion in losses and was projected to lose another $200 billion, without a bankruptcy proceeding, is a daunting task,"" DeJoy wrote. ""Fixing a heavily legislated and overly regulated organization as massive, important, cherished, misunderstood and debated as the United States Postal Service, with such a broken business model, is even more difficult.""

DOGE will assist USPS with addressing ""big problems"" at the $78 billion-a-year agency, which has sometimes struggled in recent years to stay afloat. The agreement aims to help the Postal Service identify and achieve ""further efficiencies.""

USPS listed such issues as mismanagement of the agency's retirement assets and Workers' Compensation Program, as well as an array of regulatory requirements that the letter described as ""restricting normal business practice.""

""This is an effort aligned with our efforts, as while we have accomplished a great deal, there is much more to be done,"" DeJoy wrote.

Critics of the agreement fear negative effects of the cuts will be felt across America. Democratic U.S. Rep. Gerald Connolly, of Virginia, who was sent the letter, said turning over the Postal Service to DOGE would result in it being undermined and privatized.

""The only thing worse for the Postal Service than DeJoy's ‘Delivering for America' plan is turning the service over to Elon Musk and DOGE so they can undermine it, privatize it, and then profit off Americans' loss,"" Connolly said in a statement.

He added: ""This capitulation will have catastrophic consequences for all Americans – especially those in rural and hard to reach areas – who rely on the Postal Service every day to deliver mail, medications, ballots, and more. Reliable mail delivery can't just be reserved for MAGA supporters and Tesla owners.""

Doge And Agencies Cancel 200,000 Federal Credit Cards

The National Association of Letter Carriers President Brian L. Renfroe said in a statement in response to Thursday's letter that they welcome anyone's help with addressing some of the agency's biggest problems but stood firmly against any move to privatize the Postal Service.

""Common-sense solutions are what the Postal Service needs, not privatization efforts that will threaten 640,000 postal employees' jobs, 7.9 million jobs tied to our work, and the universal service every American relies on daily,"" he said.

USPS currently employs about 640,000 workers tasked with making deliveries, from inner cities to rural areas and even far-flung islands.

The service plans to cut 10,000 employees in the next 30 days through a voluntary early-retirement program announced in January, according to the letter.

The agency previously announced plans to cut its operating costs by more than $3.5 billion annually. And this isn't the first time thousands of employees have been cut. In 2021, the agency cut 30,000 workers.

As the service, which has operated as an independent entity since 1970, has struggled to balance the books with the decline of first-class mail, it has fought calls from President Donald Trump and others that it be privatized.

Last month, Trump said he may put USPS under the control of the Department of Commerce in what would be an executive branch takeover.

Lisa Rinna finds it “so fascinating” that people are continuously speculating about her husband Harry Hamlin's sexuality.

“Number one, we're the only Housewife couple to still be married. But you're gay and you have mistresses? … And I'm your beard,” Rinna, 61, quipped during the Friday, March 14, episode of her “Let's Not Talk About the Husband” podcast. “You're f—ing busy. How do you do it all, Harry?”

Hamlin, 73, replied that he's having “the time of my life” currently. “I've got no boundaries,” he added.

“How do you have mistresses in Canada and that are women, but then you're gay and I'm your beard,” Rinna said through laughter. “And we just say, you f—ed the dog to throw everybody off.”



The dog comment was in reference to a recent comment made by Kathy Griffin during a podcast appearance last month. The comedian claimed at the time that she had dinner with Rinna and Hamlin and asked about the infamous Amsterdam fight from Real Housewives of Beverly Hills season 5. Griffin, 64, stated that she asked Hamlin what Kim Richards' “let's talk about the husband” quote was referring to. Hamlin apparently told Griffin that the rumor was that he had “f—ed a dog.”

Rinna and Hamlin responded to Griffin in a statement to Us Weekly at the time.

“Thank you to Kathy for clearing this up,” their rep shared. “It's been really RUFF on the family.”

During Friday's podcast episode, Rinna said that she thinks the rumors are “so funny.”

“I'll never forget. When I was doing the show, when people would get mad at me, you all of a sudden were gay, or you have mistresses in Canada. People have seen you,” Rinna added. “If they liked me, oh, we were such a sweet couple, and they love our relationship, and they love our family. But anytime they got mad at me, you were f—ing gay.”

Hamlin added, “I came out of the closet every time they got mad.”

Rinna then asked her husband for his feelings on the rumors about his sexuality.

“I don't give a s—,” he said. Rinna continued, “I think it's so interesting, though. Like how can you be gay and have mistresses, but they don't call you bi. They don't call you bi. You're not bi. You're gay, and you f— women in Canada all the time.”

Hamlin joked, again, that he “must be very busy” if this is what people are saying about him.

“But not true,” he added. “It sounds kind of exotic, right? But not true.”

Zack Wickham has heard about several Vanderpump Rules alums unfollowing James Kennedy after his recent drama — but The Valley star wants to know what took people so long to publicly cut ties.

“I find it s—ty that the final straw for you all to unfollow him was when he posted a picture with problematic horrible people, not when he was a problematic horrible person to your friend,” Wickham, 31, wrote via X on Thursday, March 13.

Wickham specifically clarified that his post wasn't about a specific person — instead it was about everyone. “And the answer is yes to everyone you think this is about,” he added.

Before Wickham's subtle social media shade, Bravo fans pointed out that Scheana Shay, Katie Maloney and Ariana Madix were no longer following Kennedy, 33, on Instagram. None of them have addressed the online shift, which came days after Kennedy apologized for posting a photo with Andrew and Tristan Tate.



“I regret posting a photo with the Tate brothers at an event last night,” Kennedy wrote via Instagram Stories on Saturday, March 8, about the brothers who have faced multiple accusations of sexual assault and human trafficking charges, which they have denied. “I was unfamiliar with their content and the allegations against them. I only knew them as podcasters [who] had posted a viral clip about Vanderpump.”

Kennedy continued: “I have since educated myself and condemn their beliefs. I am sorry to all that I offended.”

Wickham has been outspoken about not being on good terms with Kennedy because of his friendship with Kennedy's ex Kristen Doute. Their volatile relationship was documented for several seasons when Kennedy joined Vanderpump Rules during season 3. After their split, Kennedy was engaged to Rachel “Raquel” Leviss, who also hinted at a tumultuous relationship when cameras weren't rolling.

In December 2024, Us Weekly confirmed that police were dispatched to Kennedy's home, where he lived with then-girlfriend Ally Lewber. The authorities received a call about an argument between a man and a woman and saw Kennedy allegedly grabbing the woman. Officers who responded to the scene did not see any visible injuries.

According to police records, the woman reportedly told the Burbank Police Department that “her boyfriend lifted her up and threw her to the ground.” Kennedy's legal team subsequently released a statement on his behalf.

“We are in the process of conducting our own investigation into the allegations levied by the Burbank Police Department against James,” his attorneys said in a statement to Us after he was released on $20,000 bail. “We understand that there were no injuries and we are hoping that, after careful review, the city's attorneys will decide not to file formal charges.”

Lewber, 29, broke her silence before Us confirmed their split.

“Thank you to everyone who has reached out with love and support and for checking in on me,” she wrote via her Instagram Story. “I'm OK and taking the time I need right now. I deeply appreciate all the kindness and respect for my privacy during this time.”

After the authorities confirmed they wouldn't be pressing charges, Lewber elaborated on the incident, writing in January, “Thank you all for your support and kindness. I am happy that prosecutors decided not to file against James, as I never desired criminal charges. We had an argument outside of his home related to him drinking again, however, I was not physically hurt.”

She continued: “We are no longer together, but I'll always support James and wish him the best with his sobriety and healing. Thank you for your understanding.”

Most of Kennedy's former VPR costars didn't publicly address his legal problems. Shay, 39, and Lala Kent were the only ones who spoke out despite having concerns about entering the conversation.

“I do hope that James views this as a rock-bottom moment and is serious about just committing to a healing plan vs. just seeing this is something that's gonna, like, ruin the world tour or residency or whatever,” Shay said on her “Scheananigans” podcast in January. “I've noticed his name has been taken off of certain shows and that is a direct consequence to his actions.”

Shay urged Kennedy “to get help,” noting, “And not just to prevent Ally — or some other girl — from being subjected to abusive behavior in the future. But to give himself a chance to live life with healthy relationships. I know he wants those things for himself and he needs to give himself the proper tools to deal with his trauma that doesn't involve projecting it onto others.”

Jarrett “JT” Thomas hit his breaking point during the recent episode of Southern Charm after seemingly being accused of racism toward longtime friend Venita Aspen.

During the Thursday, March 13, episode of the Bravo series, Venita, 31, revealed she was in “shellshock” after hearing something JT, 39, allegedly said about her to his barber.

Venita heard the accusations from newbie Ryan Albert, who claimed the barber said, “JT told him that there is some Black girl that's been coming on to him and his girlfriend is going to be so pissed off.”

While retelling the rumored interaction between JT and his barber to pal Leva Bonaparte, Venita confessed she wasn't sure what to believe. Leva, 45, was taken aback as well, telling Venita, “[That] doesn't seem like JT.”



Leva decided to go straight to JT to clear the air. During their chat, JT admitted that he had been a little “flirtatious” with Venita amid his new romance with girlfriend Ally but was completely surprised by what came next. (Venita and JT were very lovey-dovey all season before Venita learned of JT's new flame.)

“Ryan, I guess, uses the same barber as you. … He said that that barber told him that you verbatim said, ‘There's some Black girl trying to get me to break up with my girlfriend,'” Leva recalled to JT, noting, “Venita is distraught.”

JT was visibly stunned by the accusation, replying, “That sounds racist. I'm not a racist.”

Leva explained that Venita felt “used” by JT after hearing the rumor, which hurt him deeply. “I'm so sorry that she thinks this, but no. This is yet another time that words are being put in my mouth,” JT responded. “I have nothing but respect for Venita.”

JT alleged, “This is absolutely bulls—. That is not how I roll.” He was frustrated as he said, “I have had enough of my name getting shattered and destroyed. I am tired of this friend group.”

JT then decided to call the barber in front of Leva to get to the bottom of the story. The barber confirmed that JT did not say “some Black girl … is trying to ruin my relationship.”

The barber recalled, “You had said that there is an interest with a cute Black girl on the show, Venita. That was really the gist of it. There wasn't really much context [other than] that.”

The stylist was apologetic for being involved in any way, telling JT, “You know, I may have said it because I was not articulate, you know? If it was off, something that I relayed, like, I'm so sorry.”

“That's a big allegation. That's a really big accusation by Ryan,” JT told Leva before getting up to leave. “What did I do to this guy? That's a motherf—!”

Ten minutes later, JT called Venita outraged that anyone would think he would purposely hurt her and speak in such a manner about any woman. “I'm still, like, shaking. … I'm really upset right now. I know you are too. I'm f—ing pissed right now. This is horrible,” JT said on the phone. “I'm upset with him, and I'm upset that he hurt you. I'm upset that he hurt you by insinuating that.”

JT explained that Leva was “hurt” by the accusations as well because her husband, Lamar Bonaparte, is Black. “Now I'm hurt but had no idea you guys were hurting,” JT told Venita. “I'm going, ‘What the f— is going on right now?'”

He then told her that he called the barber and “cleared it” up. JT revealed that he had to call Venita right after to say, “I f—ing love you.” As he spoke, his emotions continued to bubble up and he went off on the rest of the cast.

“I'm done. So done with these people they're f—ing snakes. It's Craig [Conover], it's Austen [Kroll], it's Ryan, it's Salley [Carson],” JT claimed.

Earlier this season, Craig, 36, accused JT of calling Patricia Altschul a “bitch.” Austen, for his part, had been feuding with JT since season 9 when they got into a physical altercation over castmate Taylor Ann Green. Salley, meanwhile, got into a fight with JT after he alleged she had an affair with ex-boyfriend Gaston Rojas.

JT continued to go off on the group, especially Ryan, saying, “This is sick, man. This motherf— just called me [racist] and his husband is also Black. This has all the looks of a f—ing target job by a psychopath.”

He argued that Ryan, who is married to Eddie Irions, “Made me out to be a racist.” JT concluded by calling Ryan a “motherf—” while still on the phone with Venita.

The Southern Charm season 10 finale airs on Bravo Thursday, March 20, at 8 p.m. ET.

Yellowjackets has had its fair share of death by cannibalism — but which character exit was the most brutal and gruesome?

The Showtime series, which premiered in 2021, follows a high school girls soccer team that ends up stranded in the Canadian wilderness after a plane crash. The survivors don't return home for 19 months during which time they are driven to eating each other in order to survive. Yellowjackets also features a present day timeline that reintroduces the survivors more than two decades later.

Despite the story line being heavily teased in the first season, Yellowjackets wasn't in a rush to deliver. In fact, the show didn't give the teenagers their first meal until season 2 when Jackie's (Ella Purnell) body was literally cooked for them by the elements in the wilderness.



“For us, it's never been about if [there will be] cannibalism,” creator Ashley Lyle told IndieWire in 2023. “It has always been why and how, and then what happens after that. It sounds like a weird thing to say, but you've got to earn cannibalism.”

Fellow showrunner Jonathan Lisco called the reveal a “muscular, bold move” that was meant to shock and surprise the audience.

“Once flesh has been tasted, it's a slippery slope,” he noted at the time. “When they wake up with the Jackie hangover, the next episode, are they so filled with guilt and shame that they actually would do anything not to do it again?”

Lisco continued: “We're going to make the choices that they make much more ambiguous and much more morally fraught than just the eating of a person to survive.”

Keep scrolling for a breakdown of each death by most gruesome to least:


As the younger group got more hungry, they also got more motivated for their next meal. The second season put cannibalism on the table with Jackie's death but Javi's (Luciano Leroux) was much more emotionally gruesome after he accidentally drowned when trying to save Natalie (Sophie Thatcher).

The aftermath resulted in the group preparing to have him as their next meal. Javi's brother Travis (Kevin Alves) ultimately gave his permission for the others to eat his sibling by biting off a piece of Javi's heart.

Between the plot twist, the decision to play Radiohead's “Climbing Up the Walls,” and Travis' heartbreak, Javi's death was the most emotionally brutal by far.

After the wilderness group discovered that Shauna was dressing up Jackie's corpse, they decided that they would cremate her to help Shauna move on. Shauna initially parted ways with Jackie until a mysterious gust of wind blew a ton of snow on top of Jackie's body — just as it was perfectly cooked by the fire.

The girls — and Travis — realized that the smell was calling to them to feast on their friend. Yellowjackets subsequently introduced a sequence that shifted back and forth between the group's brutal meal and a hallucination of the girls decked out in Renaissance attire enjoying fruit and wine.

All thing considered, Coach Ben Scott (Steven Krueger) had a more tame death after being tortured by the girls. He ultimately didn't want to keep fighting to survive and got Natalie to help him. She was then punished for Ben's death by being forced to prepare him as their next meal, which the audience didn't see.

Fans did, however, watch how the meal created a shocking twist when random people stumbled onto the girls eating Ben while his head was on a spike by the fire.

The series premiere introduced Us to the horror yet to come when a girl with black hair was chased out in the wilderness. She got caught in a trap and from there she became the group's next meal. The lack of context kept the scene from feeling too grotesque but something tells Us there's plenty more death by cannibalism to come.

Southern Charm star Venita Aspen offered further insight on her relationship — or lack thereof — with Jarret “JT” Thomas.

“I'm on a walk and I call JT and I say, ‘Hey, listen, I want you to come with me to this event as my date.' He goes, ‘You know, I don't think my girlfriend's gonna like that.' I literally throw my phone on my porch and slam my door,” Venita, 31, shared during the Southern Charm after show on Thursday, March 14, noting that she didn't want to look like “a f—ing homewrecker.”

The phone call Ventia was referring to took place during the episode of Southern Charm which premiered on Thursday. The event in question was a summer party hosted by costar Madison LeCroy and Ryan Albert.

“Imagine having a girlfriend and then having your best friend spend $5,000 on you at Dumas,” Venita continued, referencing a scene from earlier in the season when she and JT, 39, went shopping together. “And you get it tailored, same day turnaround. They don't do that for anybody else.”



Costar Leva Bonaparte was confused about Venita spending the money on JT.

“That was my best friend first,” Venita continued, noting that her mother — who had met JT — was “very upset” about what went down.

The most recent season of Southern Charm teased what appeared to be romantic tension between JT and Venita. One episode, which aired last month, showed JT revealing to Venita that he was dating someone else. Several episodes later, the cast headed on a trip to the Bahamas where Venita went to JT's room in the middle of the night.

According to an Instagram Story posted by Venita earlier this month, these two episodes were not shown in chronological order of when the events actually went down.

“Let me make something VERY CLEAR. That dinner JT and I had after I made a Branzino was AFTER the Bahamas yall as an audience saw it BEFORE,” she wrote. “So this weeks episode is now making me look like I'm a home wrecker when I'm not. I know what I signed up for but I also will not allow the world to think I'm that woman when I'm not.”

Thursday's Southern Charm after show also featured fellow cast member Salley Carson weighing in on the Venita and JT situation.

“He pretended to want Venita and he had a girlfriend the whole f—ing time,” she said. “I will f— you up if you f— with one of my girls, and he f—ed with Venita. He's dead to me.”

The Southern Charm season 10 finale airs on Bravo Thursday, March 20, at 8 p.m. ET.

MrBeast handed out the biggest game show prize in history on his Prime Video reality competition series Beast Games and now we're learning some behind-the-scenes secrets.

1,000 players kicked off the competition to win a whopping $5 million dollar cash prize, which was later doubled to be a $10 million prize. Week by week, players used their strength and wit to stay in the game, with the hope of being the multi-million-dollar winner.

Season one winner Gage Gallagher, aka Player 947, is opening up about some rules that the producers made that prevented contestants from supporting each other.

Keep reading to find out more...

In a new interview on the Iced Coffee Hour podcast, Gage was asked why the final three contestants didn't make a deal to split the $10 million and walk away with a little more than $3 million each.

""There was no negotiation. It was in our contract that we weren't allowed to and then in certain challenges, they'd kind of reiterate that. It's like, 'By the way, you can't make any deals.' You can't say, 'Hey, if you help me get to this, I will give you 10% if I win,'"" Gage revealed.

""If we could have, we probably would have, with those three people, but there was no ability to negotiate a split,"" he said.

Gage said that he couldn't even give money to other contestants at this point, even if he wanted to.

""And there's some pretty severe clawbacks in the agreement we signed, if they find that someone is splitting after the fact,"" Gage revealed.

Amid all of the chatter surrounding Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner spending time together recently, you might not be expecting to hear this update about Jennifer's relationship with Ben's other ex-wife Jennifer Lopez.

For those who don't know, Ben was engaged to Lopez in the early 2000s, but they called off the wedding. He was then married to Garner from 2005 to 2018, though they split in 2015. He later reunited with Lopez and they were married from 2022 to 2024. 

Following his split from Lopez, Ben has been spending more time with Garner while raising the three children they share from their marriage. The former couple was seen together at their son Samuel's 13th birthday party in early March. 

Now, an insider is opening up about Garner and Lopez's relationship these days.

""We're always pitting women against women. In this case, it's just not the truth,"" the source added.

The source said that Lopez ""isn't bothered"" by the photos of Garner and Affleck at the birthday party, adding that, “People are reading into it in a way to create drama where there is none.""

Garner is still linked to longtime boyfriend John Miller and a source said there's no chance she'll ever get back with Ben.

Eiza Gonzalez is looking back at her time on the children's program Sesame Street. 

The 35-year-old actress was on just one episode of Plaza Sésamo, the Mexican version of the long-running series when she was just five years old. 

During an appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show this week, Eiza recalled how her time was cut short as she got fired from the job. 

Keep reading to find out more...

""I was on Sesame Street for a blink of an eye because I got kicked out,"" she told guest host Brooke Shields. “It was my first ‘getting fired' moment.”

“I was a hyperactive child and I also liked to rile up people. Like, I was a complete menace,” Eiza noted. “I made sure to rile up the entire kid team of children. I convinced them to break into the office and they had a mock-up of the entire set, and we were jumping on it and we broke it.”

""It was me and I got completely fired from my first job because I was a complete menace. My mom said, ‘You can't do this for a living. You are just so naughty,'” she said. 

Of course, Eiza did find her way back to acting. She'll next be seen in the sci-fi horror thriller Ash alongside Aaron Paul, Tessa Thompson and more.

Kim Kardashian was denied a purchase on a bible her late father Robert gifted. 

The 44-year-old The Kardashians star put out a bid of $15k for a bible her father inscribed before gave it to OJ Simpson after he was arrested in the 1990s. If you didn't know, Robert was OJ's close friend and his lawyer in his murder case.

While Kim made an offer to get the bible back, it was denied by the OJ Simpson Estate's executor Malcolm LaVergne, and he revealed why. 

Keep reading to find out more...

Malcolm has been selling the late OJ's assets to pay off leftover debts and while Kim made a sizeable offer, it was turned down as the bible was already under contract to be auctioned off.

“The amount is why I had no choice, because why would I spend $15,000 of estate money — why would I spend $15,000 in attorney's fees — to sell it to Kim for $15,000?” he told People. “That's a zero-sum game. That's a bad business model. If Kim had offered $150,000 for it, we would've been in court getting this approved outside of the auction.”

""Kim can bid on it online,” he added. “She may even get it cheaper than the 15 grand, so who knows.”

The bible currently has a lead bid of $9,800 online. 

While the bible has sentimental value for the Kardashians, it also has a handwritten note from Robert to OJ, dated June 18, 1994, the day after his arrest. 

""O.J., this book will help,” the note reads. “God loves and he will speak to you with his words. Read this book everyday. God has a definite plan for your life. You are his child and he will use you again. I love you and God loves you.""

Kim has been following in her dad's footsteps by trying to become a lawyer, and she's been working with others on prison form. On a recent episode of her family's Hulu reality series, The Kardashians, Kim visited the White House.

Sydney Sweeney's relationship with fiance Jonathan Davino has been under scrutiny in recent weeks amid rumors that they may have split up.

TMZ reported on February 21 that the longtime couple had pushed back their wedding because of their busy schedules. While the wedding date had reportedly been set for May 2025, it's unclear when the wedding will now be.

A new report surfaced this week about Sydney spending time away from Jonathan, but a new sighting seems to paint a different story.

Keep reading to find out more...

On March 11, TMZ claimed that Sydney has been staying at the Beverly Hills Hotel for weeks and that Jonathan has been nowhere in sight. The outlet claims that she has been spending time with ""a couple of girlfriends and a bodyguard."" She also was just in Paris for fashion week without him.

Photos snapped on March 12 might give a clue to what's going on though. Jonathan was spotted at Sydney's $6 million Los Angeles mansion on Wednesday to oversee construction with their contractors. 

It's possible that Sydney has been staying at the hotel amid construction on their home and Jonathan could perhaps be staying at the house to oversee the work. TMZ reports that property records show that the home was purchased by Sydney's trust and that she didn't buy it with Jonathan. It seems like he'd have no interest in overseeing the construction if they had broken up recently. 

We have cute photos of the couple having a snowball fight in New York back in January 2025.

Connie Britton is opening up about her decision to pursue adoption as single mom.

If you were unaware, the 58-year-old Friday Night Lights actress adopted son Yoby, now, 14, from Ethiopia in 2011 after previously traveling to the country in the early 2000s for a documentary about Ethiopia's orphan population. 

In a new interview, Connie explained why she pursued adoption as a single mom.

Keep reading to find out more...""I always wanted to be a mom,"" Connie recalled to Parade. ""I thought that maybe I would have a biological child first, perhaps. I didn't know."" 

However, there came a moment when Connie, who was single at the time, asked herself, ""What am I waiting for?"" She has been dating boyfriend David Windsor since 2019.

""I know that I hadn't achieved the kind of partnership that I was looking for to have a spouse and a child together,"" Connie explained. ""And so I thought, 'This is the time, I'm going to start the adoption process.'"" 

While talking about becoming a mother, the American Horror Story alum said that she ""went into [that chapter of my life] a little bit blindly, not really fully anticipating what it is to be a single mom and how difficult that is, and what you're taking on in doing that.""

""I had a stay-at-home nanny. So I realized, 'Oh my gosh, at least I have help,'"" she added of being a single mom.

Connie is now focusing on the topic of motherhood in her new Hallmark Channel unscripted series, The Motherhood, which she created and executive produced. In the series, Connie teams up home design specialist, a parenting coach and a stylist who will help single moms improve their lives.

""I hope that it will change the narrative about single moms, and actually put single moms more in the forefront of our cultural understanding and our cultural empathy,"" Connie said of her new show.

""Because we all know and have been inspired by single moms,"" she continued, ""and I really want to lift them up and give them the respect, dignity and understanding that they deserve."" 

Back in 2023, Connie shared some rare comments about David and revealed how they met.

Wendy Williams is sharing an update on her health in a very rare interview.

On Friday morning (March 14), the 60-year-old former talk show host called into The View where she provided an update on how she's doing after she was taken from her assisted living facility to a New York hospital for an evaluation during a welfare check earlier this week.

Keep reading to find out more...“It was my choice to get an independent evaluation on my incapacitation, which I don't have it,” Wendy shared. “How dare they say I have incapacitation. I do not.”

Following the hospital stay, Wendy went out to dinner with her niece Alex Finnie for which she had to get permission by her guardian, Sabrina E. Morrissey. 

“It was great at first,” Wendy recalled, before noting that her guardians were waiting for her when she got back to the facility where she has been living.

“I'm not permitted to do anything, but stay on this floor, memory unit,” Wendy said, before questioning, “Why am I here?”

Wendy went on to say that her guardians and the case judge need to ""get off my neck,"" adding, “These two people don't look like me, they don't talk like me, they don't act like me, and venture to say, they will never be me...I need a new guardian.”

After noting that she is currently ""alcohol-free,"" Wendy said that her end goal is get out of her guardianship.

“I don't want Sabrina, period,” Wendy declared. “But I also don't want a guardian. I want to get out of guardian[ship]. It's been over three years. It's time for my money and my life to get back to status quo.”

Wendy's diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia & aphasia was revealed in February 2024, and she has been in an ongoing legal battle with Sabrina, her court-appointed guardian for years.

Sabrina has claimed Wendy is “cognitively impaired, permanently disabled and legally incapacitated,"" a statement which Wendy has repeatedly denied.

Keep reading to find out more...

The actress revealed she started taking GLP-1, a weight loss injectable similar to Ozempic, Mounjaro and more, after she was ""diagnosed as pre-diabetic a couple of years ago.""

“I was able to get together with my doctor and endocrinologist, and I'm very grateful that I'm at a point now where I have access to levels of healthcare that I didn't have before,” she told Page Six.

Peppermint shared that she started to notice her weight loss because her ""clothes are fitting differently"" and she ""had to buy some new"" clothes. 

Now, after losing 100lbs, she's no longer pre-diabetic. 

""I was really worried that my life was going to change irreversibly once I crossed that threshold,” Peppermint shared. “I was hovering around that threshold for so long, and I'm happy that I'm not now.”

""I feel like the same person,” she adds, along with feeling younger. “I feel like I can walk up the steps a little easier and not be like, ‘Oh, my knee!'”

Many other celebrities have opened up about using weight loss drugs like GLP-1, Ozempic and more, while others have also denied using any.

Donald Trump ""doesn't do plans"" and that won't be any different as he tries to negotiate peace, his former national security adviser John Bolton has said.

""What we're seeing now is Vladimir Putin manoeuvring to get to the point where he has a one-on-one phone conversation with Trump,"" he told our presenter Jonathan Samuels.

Asked whether he thinks Russia's president is manipulating Trump, Bolton said: ""I think so.

""If you look at the American position on the war, the only regret in the Kremlin is they didn't ask for more.""

He said that leaves Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a ""difficult place"" to have the US negotiate with him and then separately negotiate with Russia.

But when asked whether Trump could be hiding a plan that we're all unaware of as he tries to secure peace, Bolton said: ""No, of course not.

""He doesn't do plans. He thinks relations between states are the real equivalent of the personal relationships between the leaders.""

Bolton added that while Trump is looking forward to his call with Putin, he explained ""that's not Putin's view"" and that the Russian president views Trump as an ""easy mark"".

Earlier, we brought you comments from US secretary of state Marco Rubio who was speaking about the ceasefire deal from the G7 meeting in Canada.

Watch what we had to say below...

Vladimir Putin believes it is impossible to accept the ceasefire right now despite knowing Donald Trump ""will not wait forever,"" a former Russian deputy foreign minister has said.

Speaking to our presenter Jonathan Samuels, Andrey Fedorov said: ""For Putin to make this step, to accept this proposal, it is only possible if some of the conditions will be fulfilled.

""Yesterday, Steve Witkoff received a list of questions without answering them. Any move forward is not possible, of course it will take time.""

Fedorov said Putin can't have a ceasefire right away after the Russian president said he still had ""lots of questions"" yesterday.

When asked to outline Putin's main demands for ending the war, Fedorov said Russia's president wants guarantees for ""lasting peace"" and is demanding that during the ceasefire, all weapon deliveries to Ukraine are stopped.

But Fedorov described this demand as ""very hard to realise"".

We've now heard from French president Emmanuel Macron, who said he had spoken to Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Sir Keir Starmer today to discuss the ceasefire proposal.

In an online post, Macron followed in the footsteps of Ukraine's allies calling on Russia to accept the proposal, saying ""Russian aggression in Ukraine must end"".

He also said there must also be a stop to ""delaying tactics""  - something Vladimir Putin has been accused of after saying there were ""nuances"" and ""lots of questions"" remaining over a deal yesterday.

In contrast with Trump, Macron's comments echo those of Zelenskyy (see 16.38 post). 

The French president will join a virtual meeting of world leaders tomorrow, hosted by Starmer, aimed at building on the ""coalition of the willing"" - the countries which have pledged their support to Ukraine.

Throughout the day, we've been keeping you across what the US and Russia have been saying about Kursk as Ukraine continues to lose its foothold in the region.

Echoing Vladimir Putin's claims, Donald Trump said ""thousands"" of Ukrainian troops were being cut off - something that was disputed by our security and defence analyst Michael Clarke (see 2.15pm post).

He also called on Putin to spare the lives of the Ukrainian troops, something Russia's president has said he will only do if Ukraine gives orders to surrender.

Ukraine has also rejected the claims, with a number of analysts suggesting the picture being presented by Putin - and, in turn, Trump - is not entirely accurate.

Ukrainians are in some difficulty in some places, Oliver Carroll, foreign correspondent at The Economist has said.

""Some small groups are in Russian pockets,"" he wrote in a post on X, but says their number is ""not 1000s"".

He explains it is in part because troops are being withdrawn in a staggered way in an attempt not to open up the Sumy region to a Russian offensive.

""Some can't retreat on vehicles, so are going on foot,"" he added.

While US secretary of state Marco Rubio was addressing the media at the G7 meeting in Canada, Vladimir Putin has also been speaking.

He says the situation is starting to move following talks with Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff in Moscow, adding ""let's see what comes of it"".

And in a continuation of his policy of flattery towards Trump, Putin said: ""We know that the new administration headed by President Trump is doing everything to restore at least something of what was basically destroyed by the previous US administration.""

Putin also addressed Trump's request to spare the lives of Ukrainian troops (see 1.40pm post).

In a post on Truth Social, the US president said: ""I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared. 

""This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II.""

Responding to Trump's comments, Putin called on Ukrainian authorities to give an order for their soldiers to surrender.

He says in the case that they surrender, Russia will guarantee their lives will be saved.

As previously noted, Ukraine has said claims its troops are surrounded in Kursk are untrue - and neither Putin nor Trump have offered any evidence to support their claim that large numbers have been encircled by Russian forces.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he sees a ""good chance"" to end the war with Russia.

The Ukrainian president repeated his assertion that Vladimir Putin would try to drag the ceasefire proposal into endless discussions, and urged the US and Kyiv's other allies to apply pressure on Russia.

In a similar vein, a Ukrainian government source has told Sky News: ""The Americans offered  an unconditional ceasefire for 30 days, and we agreed to it.

""So there should be  a mirror agreement from Russia's side.  What Putin said publicly yesterday and what we heard Putin said to American side are additional conditions to Ukraine for a ceasefire, in particular, stop recruitment into the army,  stop supply of defence aid.

""Any attempt to add conditions for ceasefire we see as an attempt by Russia to drag things on.""

'We don't want to play games with war', Zelenskyy says

The Ukrainian president repeated his call for pressure to be ramped up on Russia to force Putin into ending the war, adding Ukraine was ""ready to act quickly and constructively"".

Referring to Putin's non-committal answers on the ceasefire, Zelenskyy said: ""We don't want to play games with war"".

He also hit out at Russia's president for ""lying"" about the situation on the battlefield and the state of the Russian economy.

""Putin cannot exit this war because that would leave him with nothing,"" he said. 

""That is why he is now doing everything he can to sabotage diplomacy by setting extremely difficult and unacceptable conditions right from the start, even before a ceasefire.""

US secretary of state Marco Rubio has been speaking at the G7 meeting in Canada. 

He said there was a ""positive interaction"" between White House envoy Steve Witkoff and Vladimir Putin, who met in Moscow yesterday.

He said that once Witkoff returned, the team would examine the Russian position more closely and Donald Trump ""will determine the next steps"".

""I think there's reason to be cautiously optimistic,"" he said.

""But by the same token, we continue to recognise this is a difficult and complex situation.""

Asked if he trusts Putin, Rubio markedly declines to answer directly, saying he thinks that is ""an irrelevant question"".

""Foreign policy is not about trusting, it's about actions,"" he says.

""In the end, on something like this, you can't just say you want peace, you have to do peace, and that's true for both sides in any conflict.""

But Rubio did say both sides will have to make concessions in their talks to end the war in Ukraine.

""That'll have to be part of the negotiation, but it's not going to be helpful to enter into those negotiations making blanket statements that may give an excuse for one side or the other not to participate in it,"" he added.

Ukraine is ""ready to sign"" a minerals deal with America but the US has ""not decided yet on the terms"", according to the country's deputy prime minister. 

Olha Stefanishyna said today: ""The agreement is ready. There are no changes in the text.""

She added in comments to the media: ""The American side has not decided
yet on the terms on which they want to sign it. Ukraine is ready
to sign."" 

Donald Trump has made a minerals deal a key part of continuing US support for Ukraine, as he seeks a ceasefire in the war.

There has been plenty of uncertainty about whether the deal would come with US ""security guarantees"" - with Ukraine and Europe saying they would be necessary to deter Russia and enforce any peace deal.

Trump, however, has repeatedly suggested having American companies in Ukraine to make the most of a minerals deal would be enough protection - his reasoning being Russia would not risk putting US workers in harm's way.

In the past hour, our US correspondents have been answering questions from readers and viewers - including whether Vladimir Putin has some kind of hold on Donald Trump.

It was one of the most popular questions people got in touch with for our weekly Q&A, as part of the Trump 100 podcast, looking at the first 100 days of the Republican's second term in the White House.

Obviously, Trump's leadership and policies have already impacted Ukraine enormously. So if you're interested in catching up on the latest questions and answers, click the link below.

UNITED NATIONS — The conflict in Sudan has created the “largest and the most devastating humanitarian crisis in the world” as the warring parties lay siege to towns and block aid deliveries, top aid officials told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday.

The war erupted in April 2023 amid a power struggle between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) ahead of a planned transition to civilian rule. The United Nations says that nearly two-thirds of Sudan's population – more than 30 million people – will need aid this year.



“The Rapid Support Forces, the Sudanese Armed Forces, and other parties to the conflict are not only failing to protect civilians – they are actively compounding their suffering,” said Christopher Lockyear, head of MSF (Doctors Without Borders).

The RSF denies blocking aid or harming civilians and attributes the activity to rogue actors. The RSF has said it would investigate allegations and bring perpetrators to justice.

The SAF also denies blocking aid or harming civilians. Sudan's U.N. Ambassador Al-Harith Idriss Al-Harith Mohamed told the Security Council that the Sudanese government has a national plan for the protection of civilians and added Lockyear did not raise any issues with him when they met privately.

Famine has taken hold in at least five locations in Sudan, where an estimated 1.3 million children under five live, the head of the U.N. children's agency UNICEF, Catherine Russell, told the Security Council.

“Over 3 million children under five are at imminent risk of deadly disease outbreaks, including cholera, malaria, and dengue, due to a failing health system,” she said.

Sudan's U.N. ambassador said the country's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry confirmed this week the stability of the food situation.

Hundreds of boys and girls were also raped in 2024, Russell said, noting that in 16 recorded cases the children were under the age of five. She paused before adding: “Four were babies under the age of one.”

“The data only gives us a glimpse into what we know is a far larger, more devastating crisis,” Russell said, citing a database the UN said was compiled by Sudan-based groups helping survivors of sexual violence.

Lockyear said MSF teams had provided support for 385 survivors of sexual violence in 2024.

“The vast majority — including some younger than 5 — had been raped, often by armed men. Nearly half were assaulted while working in the fields. Women and girls are not merely unprotected; they are being brutally targeted,” he said.

A U.N. fact-finding mission reported in October that the RSF and allies have committed “staggering” levels of sexual abuse. The RSF has previously said it would investigate allegations and bring perpetrators to justice.

The U.S. determined in January that members of the RSF and allied militias committed genocide in Sudan.

Flying over the massive iceberg, it's indistinguishable from the horizon. But as it melts, chunks of ice risk floating towards South Georgia, presenting a problem for some of its penguins, seals and seabirds.

One thousand feet above the world's largest iceberg, it's hard to believe what you're seeing.

It stretches all the way to the horizon - a field of white as far as the eye can see.

Its edge looks thin in comparison, until you make out a bird flying alongside and realise it is, in fact, a cliff of ice hundreds of feet high.

Scientists who have used satellites to track the iceberg's decades-long meanderings north from Antarctica have codenamed the iceberg A23a.

But up close, numbers and letters don't do it justice.

Watch iceberg Q&A with Tom Clarke

It's a seemingly endless slab of white, fringed by an aquamarine glow - the ocean at its base backlit by a sill of reflective ice below.

Monotonous yet magnificent; we're flying along the coastline of a nation of ice.

And it's also hard to believe you're seeing it at all.

Where it has run aground - 50 miles off the small island of South Georgia - seems impossibly remote.

We're 800 miles from the Falkland Islands and 900 miles from the icy wastes of Antarctica.

With no runway on South Georgia, there's only one aircraft that ever flies here.

Once a month or so, a Royal Air Force A400 transport plane based in the Falklands carries out Operation Cold Stare - a maritime surveillance and enforcement flight over the British Overseas Territory that includes the neighbouring South Sandwich Islands.

It's a smooth, albeit noisy, two-hour flight to South Georgia.

But as the dramatic peaks of the island come into view, the ride - for us inexperienced passengers at least - gets scary.

Gusts off the mountains and steep terrain throw the plane and its occupants around.

Not that that stops the pilots completing their circuit of the island.

We fly over some of its 500,000 square mile marine protected zone designed to protect the greatest concentration of marine mammals and birds on the planet that is found on South Georgia.

Only then do we head out to the iceberg, and even though it's only a few minutes flying from South Georgia it's at first hard to see. It's so big and white it's indistinguishable from the horizon through the haze.

Until suddenly, its edge comes into view.

It's immediately apparent the A23a is not too long for this world. Large icebergs hundreds of metres across have already broken off and are drifting closer to South Georgia.

All along its edges, cracks are appearing and arches at its base caverns are being eroded by the warmer ocean here, undercutting the ice, weakening it further.

The iceberg might present a problem for some of South Georgia's super-abundant penguins, seals and seabirds. A jumble of rapidly fragmenting ice could choke up certain bays and beaches in which colonies of the animals breed.

Follow our channel and never miss an update.

The trillion tonnes of fresh water melting out of the iceberg could also interfere with the food webs that sustain marine life.

However, the breeding season is coming to an end and icebergs are also known to fertilise oceans with sediment carried from the Antarctic continent.

The impact on shipping is more relevant. There's not much of it down here. But fishing vessels, cruise ships and research teams ply these waters and smaller lumps of ice called ""growlers"" are a regular risk.

A23a will create many.

Icebergs this big are too few for scientists to know if they are becoming more frequent or not.

But they are symptomatic of a clearly emerging trend. As our climate warms, Antarctica is slowly melting.

It's losing around 150 billion tonnes of ice a year - half of it breaking off the continent in the form of icebergs calving from glaciers, the rest melting directly from its vast ice sheets as temperatures gradually rise.

The pace of A23a's disintegration is far, far faster. It will disappear in months, not millennia.

But watching its edges crumble and slide into the South Atlantic, you can't help seeing it as the fate of a whole continent in miniature.","{'href': 'https://news.sky.com', 'title': 'Sky News'}"

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday called on Ukrainian troops fighting in the Kursk region to surrender, after US President Donald Trump urged him to ""spare"" the lives of Ukrainian soldiers.

Trump and Putin said that the Russian army had Ukrainian forces surrounded there -- claims rejected by Kyiv, even as President Volodymyr Zelensky conceded that his forces were coming under increasing pressure.

Russia has mounted a rapid counteroffensive over the last week, recapturing swathes of land and settlements in the western border region from Ukraine.

""We are sympathetic to President Trump's call,"" Putin said in televised remarks.

""If they lay down their arms and surrender, they will be guaranteed life and dignified treatment,"" he added.

""In order to effectively implement the US president's call, (there needs to be) a corresponding order from Ukraine's military-political leadership to its military to lay down their arms and surrender,"" Putin added.

In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump had appealed to Putin over what he said were ""thousands"" of Ukrainian troops ""completely surrounded by the Russian military, and in a very bad and vulnerable position"".

""I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared. This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II,"" he said.

Moscow has recaptured the vast majority of territory Kyiv seized in its cross-border assault into Kursk last August, including in a rapid counteroffensive over the last week.

Ukraine denied Trump's and Putin's claims and said it was holding on to territory there.

""There is no threat of our units being encircled,"" the General Staff wrote in a statement on social media.

But Zelensky admitted his troops were under intense Russian pressure.

""The situation in the Kursk region is obviously very difficult,"" Zelensky told reporters -- including AFP journalists -- in Kyiv.

He said, however, that Ukraine's offensive there had forced Russia to pull its troops from other embattled areas of the front, easing pressure on Ukrainian troops fighting to keep control of the eastern logistics hub of Pokrovsk.

""I think the situation in the Pokrovsk sector is now stable, and it will be very difficult to find an opportunity to occupy Pokrovsk again,"" Zelensky said.

Group of Seven foreign ministers reached a unified statement backing US-led calls for a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia, host Canada said Friday, despite friction with President Donald Trump.

""Through our long conversations, we were able to find strong G7 unity on a variety of issues that were discussed and one that I would like to highlight in particular is the one linked to Ukraine,"" Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly told reporters on the last day of the talks in Quebec.

""All G7 foreign ministers agree with the US proposal of a ceasefire that is supported by Ukrainians and we are now studying and looking at the Russian reaction,"" she said.

""So, ultimately, the ball is now in Russia's court when it comes to Ukraine.""

The club of wealthy democracies -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- has been rattled by Trump's outreach to Russia since returning to office and his heavy pressure on Ukraine, which Moscow invaded in 2022.

But diplomacy dramatically shifted Tuesday when Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was taking part in the Quebec talks, met Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia, with Kyiv backing a proposal for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire.

 Defiantly flipping off both middle fingers, a mermaid made of recovered metal scraps with hair fashioned out of red plastic tubes was lowered into murky green waters outside Stockholm on a recent windy spring day. 

 Made to look like ""The Little Mermaid"" from Hans Christian Andersen's fairytale with a nod to Disney's 1989 adaptation, the sculpture is joined underwater by artworks inspired by famous landmarks from around the world, including the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Rio de Janeiro's Christ the Redeemer and the Statue of Liberty in New York. 

 The are all part of the ""Atlantis"" art project, which aims to ""create an underwater city of the world's most famous buildings"", project manager Fredrik Johansson told AFP. 

 All the sculptures are made from scrap recovered by his organisation Hands 2 Oceans, which picks up garbage dropped in the waters around Stockholm. 

 ""In the six years we've been doing Hands 2 Ocean, we've picked up 43 tonnes of batteries. We have collected 44 tonnes of electric scooters, 180 tonnes of tyres, etc. So that's 400 tonnes in total that we've picked up,"" Johansson explained. 

 But the Atlantis project mainly seeks to bring attention to the threat posed by rising ocean levels. 

 ""All forecasts today say that the water will rise. When the glaciers melt, the water will rise 1.2 metres in 80 years. Then the Seychelles will be gone, the Maldives are gone, Bangladesh is gone. We don't want to go that way,"" Johansson said. 

 ""Atlantis symbolises for me where we are heading today,"" he added. ""When all these cities are under water, then we have a new Atlantis,"" he said, referring to the submerged island from Greek mythology. 

 The artworks also include pieces inspired by London's Big Ben and New York's Empire State Building complete with King Kong climbing the top, and will be submerged for a year to get an underwater patina. 

 ""Then we take them up to an auction where the money goes to continue this work,"" Johansson said. 

 One of the artists, Paul Svensson, made a replica of Dubai's Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building. 

 ""Only this one will be called Beer Can Khalifa,"" Svensson told AFP with a smile as he stacked beer cans in a Stockholm studio as he prepared his sculpture. 

 ""I think the symbolism is very funny. It's the biggest bling-bling property we have in the world, and in the ocean the bling-bling we can find are beer cans flashing back at us,"" he said. 

 The artworks are visible on the project's website and for divers.

Former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte failed to attend in person at the International Criminal Court on Friday at the opening of the crimes against humanity hearing over his deadly crackdown on narcotics.

The 79-year-old, the first ex-Asian head of state to face charges at the ICC, followed by videolink during a short hearing to inform him of the crimes he is alleged to have committed, as well as his rights as a defendant.

Sounding frail and wearing a blue suit and tie, he spoke briefly to confirm his name and date of birth. Presiding Judge Iulia Motoc allowed him to follow proceedings in absentia due to his long flight to The Hague.

His lawyer Salvador Medialdea told the court his client had been ""abducted from his country.""

""He was summarily transported to The Hague. To lawyers it's extrajudicial rendition. For less legal minds it's pure and simple kidnapping,"" said Medialdea.

Medialdea also said Duterte was suffering ""debilitating medical issues,"" adding: ""Other than to identify himself, he is not able to contribute to this hearing.""

Duterte appeared sleepy during the proceedings, closing his eyes frequently for long periods.

But Motoc told Duterte: ""The court doctor was of the opinion that you were fully mentally aware and fit"". She set a date of September 23 for the next stage of the process, a hearing to confirm the charges.

Duterte stands accused of the crime against humanity of murder over his years-long campaign against drug users and dealers that rights groups said killed thousands.

In the prosecutor's application for his arrest, he said Duterte's alleged crimes were ""part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the civilian population in the Philippines.""

""Potentially tens of thousands of killings were perpetrated,"" the prosecutor alleged of the campaign that targeted mostly poor men, often without proof they were linked to drugs.

Victims' families have welcomed the trial as a chance for justice, while Duterte supporters believe he was ""kidnapped"" and sent to The Hague amid a spectacular fall-out with the ruling Marcos family.

A group of family members, lawyers and human rights activists was to gather in Manila to watch a livestream of the ICC hearing, said organisers Rise Up and the Duterte Accountability Campaign Network.

- 'Kill all of you' -

According to international law experts, his whirlwind arrest and surrender to the ICC offers a welcome boon to the embattled court, which is being attacked from all sides and sanctioned by the United States.

""I see the arrest and handing over of Duterte as a gift at an important moment in time,"" Willem van Genugten, Professor of International Law at Tilburg University in The Netherlands, told AFP.

Earlier Friday, his daughter Sara Duterte, vice president of the Philippines, said she had submitted a last-minute bid to get the hearing moved.

""We are praying and hoping that the court will grant our request to move the initial appearance just so that we can properly sit down with the former president and discuss the legal strategies since we haven't talked to him yet,"" she told AFP outside the court.

Duterte supporters gathered outside the hulking glass building in the Hague shouting ""bring him home.""

But Ecel Sandalo, an anti-Duterte demonstrator, told AFP the fact the former president was on trial had given him ""hope that despite all the injustices in the world, there are still small victories that we can celebrate.""

As he landed in The Hague, the former leader appeared to accept responsibility for his actions, saying in a Facebook video: ""I have been telling the police, the military, that it was my job and I am responsible.""

In his application for arrest, the prosecutor quotes from some of Duterte's pronouncements when he was running for president.

He is cited as saying the number of criminal suspects killed ""will become 100,000... I will kill all of you"" and the fish in Manila Bay ""will become fat because that's where I will throw you.""

At the confirming of charges hearing, a suspect can challenge the prosecutor's evidence.

Only after that will the court decide whether to press ahead with a trial, a process that could take several months or even years.

G7 nations emphasised on Friday the need for robust ""security arrangements"" to ensure a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia, warning Moscow to follow Kyiv in agreeing a ceasefire or face further sanctions, according to a final draft statement.

""G7 members called for Russia to reciprocate by agreeing to a ceasefire on equal terms and implementing it fully,"" the G7 nations, comprising Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, said in a final draft statement seen by Reuters.

The draft, approved by senior diplomats, still needs a green light from ministers, G7 officials said.

""They emphasised that any ceasefire must be respected and underscored the need for robust and credible security arrangements to ensure that Ukraine can deter and defend against any renewed acts of aggression,"" they said.

A recent investigation into a fire that ravaged a passenger plane in South Korea has shed light on the potential dangers of portable power banks. On January 28, an Air Busan plane caught fire at Gimhae International Airport, resulting in three passengers sustaining minor injuries. Following an interim investigation, South Korea's transport ministry revealed that the fire may have been sparked by a power bank, specifically a breakdown in the insulation inside the battery.The power bank in question was discovered in an overhead luggage compartment, where the fire initially broke out. Scorch marks were found on the device's debris, further implicating it as the potential source of the blaze. While investigators were unable to determine the cause of the battery breakdown, the findings are interim and not a final report on the accident.

The incident serves as a stark reminder of the safety concerns surrounding power banks, particularly those containing lithium-ion batteries. These batteries can generate extreme heat and ignite if damaged or faulty, posing a significant threat to aviation safety. In response to these concerns, airlines worldwide have prohibited power banks from checked luggage for several years.

The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has also taken steps to mitigate the risks, banning lithium-ion batteries from passenger plane cargo holds since 2016. In the aftermath of the Air Busan fire, the airline strengthened its policies, announcing a ban on power banks in onboard luggage due to an increase in overheating incidents.

Other carriers, such as China Airlines and Thai Airways, are following suit, implementing similar restrictions. Singapore Airlines and its subsidiary Scoot are set to introduce a ban on the use and charging of power banks onboard starting April 1. The South Korean government has also taken action, mandating that passengers carry portable batteries and chargers on their person, rather than storing them in overhead compartments.

Diplomats from the G7 nations reached a deal on a joint statement aimed at showing unity on Friday after weeks of tension between US allies and President Donald Trump over his upending of Western trade, security and Ukraine-related policy, three G7 officials said.

The diplomats said the statement, an all-encompassing document touching on geopolitical issues from across the world, still needed to get the green light from ministers before they wrap up talks on Friday morning.

The Group of Seven ministers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, along with the European Union, convened in the remote tourist town of La Malbaie, nestled in the Quebec hills, for meetings on Thursday and Friday that in the past have been broadly consensual.

But in the run-up to the first G7 meeting of Canada's presidency, the crafting of an agreed final statement had been difficult with wranglings over the language regarding Ukraine, the Middle East and Washington's desire for tougher wording on China.

The leader of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has been killed, Iraq's prime minister said on Friday, describing him as ""one of the most dangerous terrorists in Iraq and the world.""

Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said Abdallah Makki Muslih al-Rufay'i, also known as Abu Khadija, had been killed by Iraqi security forces, with the support of the US-led coalition fighting Islamic State.

Islamic State imposed hardline Islamist rule over millions of people in Syria and Iraq for years, and has been trying to stage a comeback in the Middle East, the West and Asia.

Former Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared a caliphate over a quarter of Iraq and Syria in 2014 before he was killed in a raid by US special forces in northwest Syria in 2019 as the group collapsed.

The US Central Command said last July that the group was been attempting to ""reconstitute following several years of decreased capability.""

The command based its assessment on Islamic State claims of mounting 153 attacks in Iraq and Syria in the first half of 2024, a rate that would put the group ""on pace to more than double the number of attacks"" claimed the year before.

European territory annexed, democracies stunned into paralysis and Nazi salutes -- Donald Trump's shock re-engagement with Russia looms over a geopolitical landscape that, for many, has dangerous parallels with the rise of fascism and the West's feeble response in the 1930s.

Though a century separates the two eras, historians on both sides of the Atlantic are plumbing the depths of Trump's break with decades of US and European doctrine, at a time of military escalation worldwide.

""We go back to the 1930s because it was a crucial period, when democracies were put to the test and failed to stop dictators,"" said John Connelly, a historian at the University of California, Berkeley.

""These days it's acknowledged that they could have formed a united front against Hitler and avoid the war,"" he told AFP.

As a case in point, for many, was Trump's public slapdown of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House, and his conciliatory tone with Russian leader Vladimir Putin despite three years of invasion, evoke Germany's 1938 annexation of Sudetenland.

Hitler's seizure of the territory in then-Czechoslovakia was contested but eventually accepted by European powers with the Munich Agreement -- which failed to blunt the Fuhrer's military aspirations.

Zelensky has voiced the same fear: that letting Putin keep seized Ukrainian territory will only embolden him to take other lands, such as in Moldova or even NATO- and EU-member Romania.

And Trump himself is insisting that he will take over Greenland ""one way or another"" -- even though the island is part of Denmark, a founding NATO member along with the United States.

'Inescapable' comparison

""The comparison is inescapable because the major political players -- in short, the rulers of the world -- themselves refer to the development that led to the Second World War, which is Nazism,"" said Johann Chapoutot, a French specialist in Nazi Germany.

Even before a suspected Nazi salute by Trump's new billionaire advisor Elon Musk, the president's firm term had already sparked intense debate over a fascist nature of his power.

Trump's chief of staff in his first term, John Kelly, said Trump fits ""the general definition of fascist"". Other ex-aides, including the head of the US military's joint chiefs of staff under Trump's first term, Mark Milley, agreed.

The debate has only grown with Trump's disregard of congressional conventions since returning to the White House and moves to unilaterally upend public administrations as well as foreign policy.

Robert Paxton, an American political scientist and historian, has long resisted the use of ""fascism"", saying it's ""a word that generates more heat than light"".

But he reversed his position with regards to Trump even before his re-election by just over half the American electorate last November.

Paxton pointed to Trump spurring his supporters on to assault the US Capitol in January 2021, as he sought to wrest power despite losing the election weeks earlier.

""It's bubbling up from below in very worrisome ways, and that's very much like the original fascisms,"" Paxton told The New York Times in October.

""It's the real thing. It really is.""

Brute force

Since returning to power, Trump's dismissal of international law, his trade war with allies and foes alike, and his scorn of national sovereignty all evoke for some historians the ""might makes right"" mentality that dominated between the two World Wars.

""There are lots of identical boxes being ticked in terms of political inertia, the fragility of some accepted ideas, the trampling of international law, and the uninhibited use of force, of brutalness against his allies,"" said Tal Bruttmann, a French historian and Holocaust expert.

""There are several definitions of fascism, but if they all have a cardinal virtue: it's brute force,"" he said.

But much has also changed over the past 100 years. Both the United States and Europe enjoy economic prosperity unimaginable in the aftermath of World War I and the Great Depression, which provided fertile ground for the authoritarian regimes of Germany and Italy.

""The strange thing is that the United States elected a man hostile to democracy even as the economy is growing,"" Connelly noted.

And after World War II, the international community forged institutions to ensure cooperation and avoid bloodshed including the United Nations and the World Bank.

The International Criminal Court and the European Court of Human Rights were also bolstered to encourage respect of the rule of law.

""After 1945, we decided to literally civilise the world, to make the world a 'city' were we would respect the law instead of killing each other,"" Chapoutot said.

But these guardrails now appear to have taken a beating.

""These laws exist but the problem is that the Trump adminstration, to everyone's surprise, has no respect for them,"" Connelly said.

""The United States has not learned the lessons of history.""

The UN migration agency, which has been hit hard by US foreign aid cuts, has launched more mass layoffs, impacting around a fifth of staff at its Geneva headquarters, employees said Friday.

Fresh cuts at the International Organization for Migration are expected to impact at least 20 percent of the more than 1,000 current headquarters staff, according to several sources familiar with the situation.

""This would mean over 200 staff. I believe it's more,"" a current IOM employee told AFP on condition of anonymity.

The news comes just weeks after the United Nations agency, which at the end of last year employed around 22,000 people, sent out pink slips to some 3,000 staff.

They were among around 5,000 who had been working with the US refugee resettlement programme, which has been halted by President Donald Trump's administration.

""I can't really describe the mood,"" the employee said.

Earlier this week, staff in IOM's media department were ""lined up (for) 15-minute individual meetings to announce they were sacked"", which ""turned into less than five-minute meetings"", the employee said.

People were ""coming out crying"".

A former employee, who also asked not to be named, said ""dozens of staff"" received notice on Thursday, ""and more to follow"", adding that ""entire functional units have been cut"".

'Necessary adjustments' 

According to sources on the inside, IOM's partnership programme and its information and communications technology section were among the hard-hit divisions.

Contacted by AFP, the IOM did not confirm the extent of the fresh layoffs.

But a spokesperson acknowledged the agency was ""making necessary adjustments, including proportional and balanced workplace reductions and operational efficiencies"".

""We fully recognise the profound impact this is having on both the communities we serve and our staff, and we are closely monitoring these changes and making sure that our capacity is fit for purpose,"" the spokesperson said.

A current employee said that informal internal communication being sent around to headquarters staff informed employees that those with fixed-term contracts would be let go in June, while other contract types would be given a minimum of 30 days' notice.

The latest layoffs come after Trump's campaign to dismantle US foreign aid contributions has put the entire humanitarian community into a tailspin.

The sudden about-face on aid funding by the country that traditionally has by far given most has hit the IOM particularly hard.

'Angry'

The agency, which serves more than 280 million migrants globally, has been relying on the United States for more than 40 percent of its annual budget.

Nearly all of its funding comes in the form of voluntary contributions earmarked for specific programmes, meaning that a donor that halts the flow of cash can swiftly cripple an entire programme, as happened with the IOM's cooperation with the US Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP).

""We have to make some really hard decisions about staff because we simply can't afford to pay staff when we're not actually being paid for our work,"" IOM director general Amy Pope told AFP in a recent interview.

IOM employees meanwhile expressed anger over the way the layoffs were being carried out, with one staff member charging that they appeared to target ""mostly junior positions"".

Staff were meanwhile sending around a video Friday apparently shot during Pope's visit to Guatemala this week, showing her happily dancing with the team there.

""The DG dancing while people are being sacked,"" said an employee who shared the video.

""We absolutely are angry!""

 By Kate Holton and Dylan Martinez 

 LYME BAY, England, - Beneath the gloomy seas off southern England, 400 million mussels encrust ropes hanging from buoys dotted over an area the size of the country's biggest airport. 

 Almost 5 km from shore at its nearest point, Europe's largest offshore mussel farm was built by the Holmyard family in Lyme Bay, where they believed it would be free of the millions of gallons of sewage pumped into UK waters each year. 

 But even this far offshore, harmful bacteria such as E.coli can pollute the water, blocking exports to continental Europe for weeks and damaging the prospects of a business producing sustainable food. 

 ""It's criminal that they're allowed to dump what they dump in the seas and get away with it,"" sales manager Sarah Holmyard said during a visit to the farm. ""It's affecting all sorts of businesses, including us."" 

 While Britain's shellfish industry is small, the problems faced by the Holmyards underscore how failings with the most basic services in British society such as water and sewage can harm the broader economy. 

 Reuters interviews with 20 people and data analysis show how polluted water has also hit tourism and delayed construction projects, acting as a drag on the economy at a time when the new Labour government is trying to kick start growth. 

 In the five years to October 2024, the Environment Agency intervened on 60 occasions to object to planning applications due to the pressures they would place on local sewerage systems, according to a Freedom of Information request. 

 Clean water campaigners have started to marshal opposition against planning applications, believing that's more likely to pressure the government into fixing the sewage system than current efforts focusing on the harm caused to biodiversity. 

 ""Money talks,"" said Ash Smith at campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution. Standing knee deep in grey, untreated sewage water in a local brook in Oxfordshire, he explained how they were objecting to house building to show how the water system had broken the country's infrastructure more broadly. 

 The pumping of sewage into rivers and seas has become a major scandal in Britain. Privatised water companies have been accused of prioritising dividends over investment and dumping sewage in waterways when its ailing infrastructure cannot cope. 

 The pollution has deterred wild water swimmers, angered surfers, prompted warnings about toxic blue-green algal blooms in lakes and created an army of people who have become experts on water quality after they noticed changes in waterways. 

 In England, water companies discharged sewage for 3.6 million hours in 2023, polluting streams, rivers and coastlines, littering them with sanitary products and condoms, damaging ecosystems and habitats, and scaring away tourists. 

 SEWAGE SPILLS 

 British sewers mostly combine rainwater with wastewater. During exceptional rainfalls, water companies can make ""spills"" into waterways to prevent sewers from becoming overwhelmed. But many have been fined for releasing sewage too regularly. 

 South West Water, which provides water and sewerage services in the county of Devon by the Holmyard's farm, discharged sewage for 530,737 hours in 2023 - an 83% jump on 2022 making it one of the worst performers in England, Environment Agency data show. 

 South West Water said it was looking for ways to improve water quality at Lyme Bay. 

 ""We are making sure that every designated shellfish water in the region will meet the government's target of less than 10 spills per year – 10 years ahead of deadline – as we plan to nearly double investment to 2.5 billion pounds from 2025-30."" 

 When John Holmyard and his wife Nicki started to plan their mussel farm, they had a lot to factor in. 

 Having farmed mussels in colder waters off Scotland for years, they decided to find a site with warmer water, the right sea depth and abundance of nutrients they believed would help mussels grow faster. It had to be far enough offshore to avoid runoff, but with some protection to limit the swell of the sea. 

 They settled on Lyme Bay after visiting similar sites around Britain, Europe, China and New Zealand and spent seven years securing planning and regulatory approval - without knowing whether their hunch would pay off. 

 Eleven years on, the farm produces about 3,000 tonnes of mussels a year and the Holmyards hope to hit 10,000 to 12,000 tonnes once it is completed. 

 John Holmyard, who runs the business with Nicki, their daughter Sarah and son George, said they never expected sewage to affect their farm: ""But it's not worked out like that."" 

 For shellfish producers, dumped sewage has been toxic. 

 Before Britain left the European Union, mussels and oysters could be shipped to the continent prior to purification. Post Brexit, the EU only accepts purified goods or those from the cleanest British waters, rated Class A. 

 That change has all but destroyed mussel farming in north Wales on Britain's west coast. The region once produced the bulk of Britain's exports to Europe but now rarely sells to the continent due to poor water and a lack of bulk purification facilities in the country. 

 The Shellfish Association of Great Britain says British exports would double if the seas were cleaner. 

 James Green, who harvests and sells oysters in Whitstable, a town in southeast England famed for shellfish since Roman times, used to send about half of his produce to markets such as Hong Kong and Europe, but Brexit and water quality issues mean he now only sells purified oysters domestically. 

 His water supplier, Southern Water, was fined 90 million pounds in 2021 for dumping sewage in the five years to 2015, disrupting harvests and exports. He did not get any compensation and says it is hard to wait for improvements. 

 ""I've got a business,"" he said. ""Can you wait for the changes to kick in, in five, six, seven years' time?"" 

 To protect his oysters, Green monitors for E.coli, salmonella and Norovirus, and tracks rainfall and sewer overflows to assess risks before harvesting. 

 Southern Water said it was investing heavily to ensure the continued high quality of shellfish beds around its coast. 

 ""The 2021 court case regarding events between 2010 and 2015 found no evidence of impact on shellfish beds, which are affected by many factors,"" it said. 

 DRIVEN TO DESPAIR 

 The Holmyards say their mussels are tested for E.coli in the Netherlands on an almost daily basis - and they have always been within the limits for a Class A designation. 

 But high numbers of E.coli have occasionally been reported by British authorities in similar monthly tests, designating parts of the farm Class B. 

 In the British system, negative readings can have different outcomes for future harvests. For the Holmyards, it stopped them from exporting mussels for several weeks from that part of the farm - and also designated the same area as Class B the same time the following year. 

 The family say they find it baffling, as bacteria coming from the shore should be heavily diluted by the time they reach the farm - and because the British readings don't tally with the more frequent Dutch tests. 

 John said they had been unable to raise fresh capital since Brexit due to the risk of export bans. 

 The British body responsible for classifying shellfish harvesting areas, the Food Standards Agency, said it had tried to be flexible, but it had to protect public health and classifications would only improve with better water. 

 As Sarah and George plucked predatory starfish off the mussels, they explained how an annual survey showed the farm had spawned an abundance of species, such as crab and lobster. 

 Their blue mussels, known for their rich, sweet flavour, are sold as a premium product in Europe. Notwithstanding the bans, the Holmyards still export about 95% of their mussels to the EU, with the rest sold in Britain. 

 Tourism bosses say this is the kind of high-quality, locally produced food they need to promote to prospective holidaymakers. 

 Alistair Handyside, chairman of the South West Tourism Alliance, said while tourism was mainly affected by weather and cost, talk of sewage had damaged the appeal of many locations. 

 ""It drives you to despair,"" he said. 

 TOXIC OUTPUT 

 The sight of sewage and litter on beaches and in rivers has also driven thousands of people to protest. 

 Sally Burtt-Jones was one of the founders of SOS Whitstable, part of a network of groups that stage protests, test local water and campaign for legislative change. 

 She said she was most proud of her campaigning work. ""We care about the community and the sea,"" she said. ""When we get together we can make change happen."" 

 John Reeve, a Surfers Against Sewage representative in the northeastern seaside town of Saltburn, has worked with local officials and studied the geology to understand how to control rainwater as storms become heavier due to climate change. 

 ""We are making a difference over time,"" he said. 

 The water industry says it has invested heavily in infrastructure since privatisation in 1989, but population growth and climate change have imposed new pressures at a time when it says successive governments - and regulator Ofwat - were focused on keeping customer's bills low. 

 Ofwat said water companies in England and Wales had paid out 53 billion pounds in dividends since privatisation - and had collective net debt of 69.5 billion in 2024. 

 It has proposed letting customer bills rise by an average of 36% before inflation over the next five years to fund infrastructure upgrades and has gained new powers to link dividends to performance. The government is also reviewing the sector. 

 An Ofwat spokesperson said customers wanted change: ""We need to see a transformation in companies' culture and performance. We will monitor and hold companies to account."" 

 Failures around sewage have also bedevilled construction, with the Environment Agency objecting to planning applications when it thinks existing systems will not cope. 

 The objections, for everything from housing to retail sites, offices, schools, a science business park and leisure centre, are typically overcome with ways to mitigate the impact. 

 But the objections add time, cost and complexity to building projects, a serious challenge for the government as it seeks to trigger a boom in housing and infrastructure construction. 

 Water pollution has also damaged biodiversity. 

 Stocks of Atlantic salmon, which hatch in freshwater breeding grounds in Britain, have hit new lows. The provisional declared rod catch in 2023 was the worst since records began in 1988. 

 The Environment Agency attributed the fall to pollution and sedimentation - just the type of environment the Holmyards had sought to avoid. 

 Sarah said the potential for the business being replicated elsewhere was huge. ""But if you've got the same issues of not being able to export because of the water quality, then it's just not going to work.""

	More than 50 universities are being investigated for alleged racial discrimination as part of President Donald Trump's campaign to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs that his officials say exclude white and Asian American students.


	The Education Department announced the new investigations on Friday, one month after issuing a memo warning America's schools and colleges that they could lose federal money over race-based preferences in admissions, scholarships or any aspect of student life.


	Students must be assessed according to merit and accomplishment, not prejudged by the colour of their skin, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement. We will not yield on this commitment.


	Most of the new inquiries are focused on colleges' partnerships with the PhD Project, a nonprofit that helps students from under-represented groups get degrees in business with the goal of diversifying the business world.


	Department officials said that the group limits eligibility based on race and that colleges that partner with it are engaging in race-exclusionary practices in their graduate programmes.


	The group of 45 colleges facing scrutiny over ties to the PhD Project include major public universities such as Arizona State, Ohio State and Rutgers, along with prestigious private schools like Yale, Cornell, Duke and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.


	A message sent to the PhD Project was not immediately returned.


	Six other colleges are being investigated for awarding impermissible race-based scholarships, the department said, and another is accused of running a programme that segregates students on the basis of race.


	Those seven are: Grand Valley State University, Ithaca College, the New England College of Optometry, the University of Alabama, the University of Minnesota, the University of South Florida and the University of Tulsa School of Medicine.


	The department did not say which of the seven was being investigated for allegations of segregation.


	The February 14 memo from Trump's Republican administration was a sweeping expansion of a 2023 Supreme Court decision that barred colleges from using race as a factor in admissions.

Kenyan church leaders call for regulations to curb disease

A REGIONAL division of the National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) has called for regulations on the marketing of unhealthy food as part of efforts to tackle non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes and heart disease. In a statement, the chairman of the NCCK South Rift Region, the Pentecostal Bishop Peter Muiruri, describes NCDs as an “emerging pandemic” that is increasingly affecting young Kenyans. The pronouncement followed a two-day forum at the start of March, in which representatives of member Churches discussed the issues, and called on politicians to pay more attention to public health. Broader economic issues are highlighted in the statement, along with a call for politicians to stop early campaigning for the 2027 Kenyan and elections, and instead “focus on service delivery”, including reforms to medical provision.

 

Anglican Church of Canada urged to cut governance structures

“THIS is not just tweaks: this is big change,” the chair of a commission recommending changes to the governance structures of the Anglican Church of Canada said last week, as she delivered a report to the executive body of the Church's General Synod. The Archdeacon of West Ottawa, the Ven. Monique Stone, said that the Church was about one quarter of the size it had been in 1967, but governance groups remained the same size, and she recommended that its structures be overhauled, the Anglican Journal reported this week. The general secretary of the Synod, the Ven. Alan Perry, said, however, that governance structures had shrunk since the 1960s. “They have evolved, are evolving, and will evolve,” he told the Journal.

 

Cuba releases prisoners in Vatican deal

AN AGREEMENT, reached in the final days of the Biden administration, for the release of political prisoners in Cuba has been completed, it was announced on Monday. When the deal was announced in January, the President of Cuba, Miguel Díaz-Canel, said that the decision to free more than 500 demonstrators imprisoned after anti-government protests in 2021 had been made “in the spirit of” the Vatican Jubilee. As a result of the deal, Cuba was removed from the White House's list of state sponsors of terrorism, but, within a week of Donald Trump's return to power, the deal was rescinded. Prisoners have continued to be released, however, and, on Monday, the vice-president of the highest court in Cuba said that the process had been completed, Vatican News reports. Human-rights groups, however, have said that some of those imprisoned during the protests remain incarcerated.

 

RC pastoral centre bombed by Burmese military

A PASTORAL centre run by the Roman Catholic diocese of Banmaw, in Myanmar, was destroyed by the Burmese army on 3 March, the Fides news agency reports. The bombing occurred amid fighting in Kachin State between the army of the military junta, which has run Myanmar since a coup in 2021, and the Kachin Independence Army. A local priest, Fr Wilbert Mireh, told Fides that he had to travel a long distance just to report the bombing, as electricity and phones had been cut off since the summer. “Despite the suffering and harsh conditions,” he said, “our faith and spirit remain strong.” The population of Banmaw has reportedly been reduced from more than 50,000, in 2019, to about 20,000, as people flee the fighting.

 

University loses accreditation appeal

A HISTORICALLY Black college in North Carolina, Saint Augustine's University, has lost an appeal to keep its accreditation over concerns about its financial viability. Saint Augustine's is one of only two remaining historically Black colleges with roots in the Episcopal Church in the United States. It was founded by church members in 1867, and, while it now operates as an independent institution, it continues to receive financial support and guidance from the Church, the Episcopal News Service reports. Losing its accreditation would affect the university's ability to attract students, but, having lost its appeal against the decision of its accrediting agency, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, the college is able to enter a 90-day arbitration process in an attempt to retain its status.

The AP Top 25 men's college basketball poll is back every week throughout the season!

WASHINGTON (AP) — John Feinstein, one of the country's foremost sports writers and the author of numerous bestselling books, including the groundbreaking “A Season on the Brink” about college basketball coach Bob Knight, died unexpectedly Thursday. Feinstein was 69.

He died of natural causes at his brother's home in McLean, Virginia, according to Robert Feinstein, who said he discovered John's body.

John Feinstein was a full-time reporter for The Washington Post from 1977 to 1991, a commentator for outlets such as ESPN — where he made regular appearances on “The Sports Reporters” — and the Golf Channel, and a voter for more than 20 years in the AP Top 25 men's college basketball poll. He remained with the Post as a contributing columnist, and he also hosted satellite radio programs on SiriusXM.

“He was very passionate about things,” Robert Feinstein said in a telephone interview. “People either loved him or hated him — and equally strongly.”

John Feinstein — always a storyteller, whether via the written word or when chatting with other journalists in an arena's media room or press box — was working until the time of his death. He was in the Washington area this week to cover the Atlantic 10 Tournament ahead of March Madness, and he filed a column for the Post about Michigan State coach Tom Izzo that appeared online Thursday.

“He was strong with his opinions,” Izzo said Thursday, “but very interesting to talk to.”




Feinstein was comfortable writing fiction and nonfiction, and took on an array of sports, including golf and tennis, but he was known most for his connection to college basketball because of “A Season on the Brink.” He took a leave of absence from the Post in 1985 to embed with Knight's Indiana team.

Knight's reputation for having a hot temper was well-established by then, and Feinstein relayed behind-the-scenes evidence in a way that was uncommon in sports writing at the time. Feinstein also effectively portrayed the personal relationships Knight had with his players, which alternated between warm and abusive.

“I can't possibly overstate how important Knight was in my life,” Feinstein wrote in the Post after the coach's death in 2023. 

“Not once did Knight back away from the access, even during some difficult moments for his team,” Feinstein wrote. “Although he didn't speak to me for eight years after the book's publication — upset, of all things, with seeing profanity in the book — he eventually decided to ‘forgive' me, and we had a distant though cordial relationship for the rest of his life.”

Praise for Feinstein's work — and the sort of access and skilled reporting that were its hallmarks — was all over social media on Thursday, including from others in the business of writing or speaking about college basketball.

And, of course, the news reverberated around college basketball as its season approaches its crescendo. Feinstein seemed to know every coach in the sport — and they all seemed to know him.

Marquette coach Shaka Smart learned about Feinstein's death from a reporter at Madison Square Garden after the Golden Eagles beat Xavier in the Big East Tournament.

“Oh, wow,” Smart said. “I've known him for a long time. He's one of the best sports writers ever. I got to know him as a writer before I got to know him as a person, reading some of his stuff when I was in high school. He cared about the teams and he cared about the players and he cared about the coaches — which is not as common these days.”

Feinstein wrote more than 40 books, including “A Good Walk Spoiled” (1995), about professional golf, and “A Civil War” (1996), about the Army-Navy football game. After that book's publication, he worked for many years as a radio commentator for Navy football.

“The Ancient Eight,” about Ivy League football, was published last year. Feinstein also wrote sports novels aimed at younger readers.

Feinstein graduated from Duke University and later taught there. He began teaching — and was a writer-in-residence — at Longwood University in Virginia during this school year.

Barry Svrluga, a Washington Post columnist who said he took Feinstein's sports journalism course as a senior at Duke, recalled the experience Thursday.

“He got whoever he could to talk to the class — Gary Williams on a game day when Maryland was in town, Billy Packer, Bud Collins. Bob Woodward called in,” Svrluga said. “And you could just tell that part of his reporting prowess — how he got into locker rooms and front offices and onto the range and in clubhouses at PGA Tour events — is because he could really develop relationships, and people just liked to talk to him. Part of that had to be because he didn't pander. You knew exactly where he stood. And that gained respect.”

Another Post colleague, Dan Steinberg, Feinstein's editor in recent years, said: “He would tell me, ‘Oh, yeah, I'm going downtown to meet Steve Kerr for lunch today,' or ‘Oh, yeah, Jim Larrañaga called me a few months ago and asked me how we could fix basketball.' He loved sports, adored them, watched them constantly even when he wasn't writing about them, had an opinion about everything and everyone. ... He loved Wimbledon, swimming, the Olympics, college basketball, the Naval Academy, West Point, the Mets, and people who returned his calls.”

In addition to Robert, John Feinstein is survived by his wife, Christine, daughters Brigid and Jane, and son Danny, as well as a sister, Margaret.

In a story published March 13, 2025, about John Feinstein's death, The Associated Press misspelled the first name of one of John Feinstein's children. It is Jane, not Jayne.

AP Sports Writers Mike Fitzpatrick in New York, Larry Lage in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Eric Olson in Omaha, Nebraska, contributed to this report.

There is a huge League Cup final on Sunday but there are also plenty of Premier League matches taking place this weekend. Here are the games fans have coming up (all times in GMT):

Saturday, 15 March

Everton v West Ham, 15:00

Southampton v Wolves, 15:00

Ipswich Town v Nottingham Forest, 15:00

Manchester City v Brighton, 15:00

Bournemouth v Brentford, 17:30

Sunday, 16 March

Arsenal v Chelsea, 13:30

Fulham v Tottenham, 13:30

Leicester City v Manchester United, 19:00

Fulham v Tottenham (Sun, 13:30 GMT)

Tottenham Hotspur

Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou said his squad is looking ""pretty good"" before the trip to Craven Cottage on Sunday.

He said: ""Nothing (to report) from last night. Everyone got through it well,"" he said on Thursday's Europa League win over AZ Alkmaar.""

Rodrigo Bentancur is available for selection after being suspended on Thursday, while Fraser Forster, Antonin Kinsky, Sergio Reguilon and Timo Werner are also all back after being ineligible in Europe.

Kevin Danso, Dejan Kulusevski and Richarlison remain sidelined through injury.

Fulham v Tottenham (Sun, 13:30 GMT)

Tottenham Hotspur

Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou on whether Spurs are returning to playing in the style he wants: ""I think so. That's coincided with a couple of significant things. 

""One is getting some players back and also the ability to rotate the team and keep the team fresh.

""I thought we saw evidence of that last night because our pressing was a lot better. That's because players like Sonny [Son] and Madders [Maddison] didn't play 90 at the weekend and we've got guys coming back into the team who help us with those kind of things.

""I think Dom [Solanke] is a massive part of our press because of the way he works in that number nine position, we don't have anyone else who is like him really.

""Then, we're getting our good ball players on the ball and looking shard in the final third. Great to get Wilson [Odebert] in there.

""Those things help us play the football we want to play and hopefully we can do it more consistently now.""



Everton v West Ham (Sat, 15:00 GMT)

Everton

A final word from Everton manager David Moyes on facing his old club West Ham United: ""I left a club that I really enjoyed and I had a great time at. After winning the European trophy and coming back - to see what the east end of London was like was fantastic.

""To be fair, I haven't brought all the players into West Ham but the bulk of them were probably on my watch so I have a lot of close bonds with the players there. It will be great to see them all but a really difficult situation to be coming up against them."" 

Everton v West Ham (Sat, 15:00 GMT)

Everton

Everton manager David Moyes on team news: ""Armando [Broja] is in and around it. It's a bit like Youssef Chermiti and Seamus Coleman. They've had another 5/6 days training whereas Broja is just back amongst it so he's getting closer. Hopefully we will be able to get him on the bench for tomorrow's game.""

Everton v West Ham (Sat, 15:00 GMT)

Everton

Everton manager David Moyes on Jarrad Branthwaite not receiving an England call-up: ""I don't pick the England squad so I can only say that if you're looking across the last six/seven weeks then Jarrad Branthwaite would be up there playing as well as any English centre-back in the country, that's for sure.

""But, the big thing he needs to do is go and play for England under-21s and be the best player again and get selected for the big team. That is the instructions that I will be giving him. Lee Carsley will pass good information back to the manager and hopefully that will get him back in the big squad.

""He doesn't need picking up because he's a young centre-back in the early stages of his career. He has to learn his trade, keep improving and I've told him to go and play really well for the Under-21s and show Thomas [Tuchel] that he should have taken him into the squad."" 

The announcement of Thomas Tuchel's first England squad dominated the news earlier today.

We may have moved away from that now but we had a big live on that earlier on which you can recap here. 

However, sticking with that theme for a moment, Everton manager David Moyes' news conference today started with a question on the omission of Jarrad Branthwaite. 

Southampton v Wolves (Sat, 15:00 GMT)

Wolverhampton Wanderers

Wolves boss Vitor Pereira said midfielder Marshall Munetsi is ""ok for the game.""

He added: ""He's training with the team, it means that he is ready to help.""

Pereira said there are no other injury concerns. 

On the importance of having a full squad, besides Matheus Cunha who is suspended: ""Very important. We have more solutions and we can do something from the bench. This is important for us.""

Southampton v Wolves (Sat, 15:00 GMT)

Southampton

Southampton boss Ivan Juric has updated fans with team news: ""[Jan] Bednarek won't be at the game because the protocol is very strict. ""He hasn't recovered as quick as I hoped, as you have to be good every day for protocol. It was Tuesday and he didn't feel good. In England they are really strict.""

Southampton will also be without Will Smallbone, who has a groin injury.

Ipswich v Nottingham Forest

Ipswich Town

Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola on the fact they are three Premier League games without a win: “I think we're in a good moment, the worst game [Wolves] was different because we had 10 players.

""Brighton and Spurs we played very good games against good opposition - we only got one point, but we kept the same level of performance. To win games we have to change things but I think we're in a good moment.""

On his own future: ""I'm very happy - I've said it a lot of times.""

Bournemouth v Brentford (Sat, 17:30 GMT)

Bournemouth

Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola has given an update on team news ahead of their game with Brentford on Saturday evening, Julian Araujo and Marcos Senesi both haven't played since November.

“Julian,and Marcos have been cleared to train with us.

“They've been to Finland to see the surgeon, they are doing well and they have started training with us.

“It's now going to be a matter of the feelings, the shape and when we think they are ready to play with the team - both are on the right path.”

On Illia Zabarnyi who has returned from his suspension: “It's really nice for me to have the options.

“The team has done well without him but it is always an extra to have a player like Zaba.

“I hope for him, it's been some rest that he normally never gets, and that it has been good for him.”

Despite Palace's letter, the commission - which agreed the three-match ban was insufficient - questioned the FA's reliance on it.

The commission felt the letter did not help them and it needed to be treated with ""considerable caution"".

It wrote: ""The hyperbole within CPFC letter does not assist the Commission in assessing the evidence in an unemotional, rational and impartial manner, as “the vast majority of the CPFC letter must be treated with considerable caution as an exaggerated and partial account of events.

""The FA's reliance of the CPFC letter is, therefore, somewhat troubling.""

Crystal Palace accused Millwall goalkeeper Liam Roberts of injuring Jean-Philippe Mateta with ""the most extreme and violent force"", it has been revealed. 

The 30-year-old was banned for six games after he was sent off eight minutes into his side's 3-1 FA Cup fifth-round defeat at Selhurst Park for kicking Mateta in the head as he rushed out of goal. 

In the written reasons in relation to the Football Association's appeal to increase Roberts' initial three-match ban, the Premier League club submitted an emotional letter to FA which was viewed by the regulatory commission overseeing the case.

Part of it read: ""LR [Roberts] was fully aware of JPM [Mateta]; had time to pull out of the challenge but proceeded “with the most extreme and violent force he could possibly have mustered."" 

Palace's French striker was given oxygen before being taken to hospital and needed 25 stitches for a severe laceration to his left ear.

Leicester v Man Utd (Sun, 19:00 GMT)

Manchester United

The Europa League, and winning it, now represents Manchester United's best chance of securing Champions League football next season.

But there will also be pressure on Ruben Amorim to improve the club's league position, with United 14th with 10 games to go.

""Everything is important. And we need to continue with this feeling that we can win games and then games after games. It doesn't matter what rest or the times to prepare the next game, we can do it and showed it against Arsenal,"" said Amorim.

""We have to be humble and forget the table and face Leicester like we faced Real Sociedad. We just need to win to improve our position in the table and the most important thing is continuing with this feeling of winning and that we are improving as a team.""

Leicester v Man Utd (Sun, 19:00 GMT)

Manchester United

Asked about how he will balance selection for the rest of the season, with Manchester United still competing for the Europa League, Ruben Amorim said: ""With different competitions we have to rotate because are risking a little bit, for example Casemiro was so tired.

""We didn't want to risk [Manuel] Ugarte and that was a decision and he wanted to stay here. Mason Mount is going to return really slowly. Kobbie maybe will return in a few weeks, I am not sure. Harry Maguire we tried not to risk, we will see for Sunday. We need all the players. 

""Against Lyon it is going to be a different type of game, the physicality is more demanding in that aspect and we have a lot of difficult games in the Premier League.""

A University of Texas golfer was removed from the grounds at TPC Sawgrass during a Players Championship practice round on Tuesday at TPC Sawgrass in a moment that has since gone viral on social media involving PGA Tour star Rory McIlroy.

Luke Potter, a junior in the Longhorns' golf program, went viral after McIlroy walked over to him after the young golfer seemed to say something to the four-time major champion just after his drive went into the water on Hole 18. 

While it's unknown what Potter said, McIlroy clearly didn't like it, as he immediately turned around and walked over to him. McIlroy then asked for Potter's cell phone and took it.

McIlroy started to walk with Potter's phone, seemingly looking for whatever video he believed Potter had taken during that moment. 

Golf.com reported that Potter referenced McIlroy's 2011 Masters, where he infamously had a meltdown during the final round on Sunday that year, ultimately shooting an 80 and losing the tournament to Charl Schwartzel. 

As McIlroy looked through Potter's phone, the Texas golfer was reportedly escorted off the course. His phone was later given back to him.

""Look, I just made a mistake, and I take ownership for it,"" Potter said, according to the Golf Channel, about what had happened with McIlroy. ""I apologize for it. That's about all that needs to be said. . . . It's just a good learning experience. Yeah, I apologize.""

Potter was riding high in his collegiate career at the time of the incident, having won his first NCAA individual tournament, as he won the John Hayt Collegiate Invitational at Sawgrass Country Club. That course is very close to TPC Sawgrass, where the Players is held every year. 

John Fields, Potter's golf coach at Texas, also spoke to Golf.com about the incident.

""He had no idea that what was coming out of his mouth was going to result in this fashion,"" Fields said. 

""With regards to our University of Texas program, I mean, it's an embarrassing moment. It is particularly sensitive to me, because our program is built on respect for the game, and I would tell you that we coach 18- to 22-year-olds on a normal basis, and they don't always make the right call, and that's my responsibility as a coach, and when they do make a mistake, it's a learning moment.""

McIlroy wasn't fazed by the moment, though, as he started off the tournament with a 5-under first round on Thursday. He is one shot off the leaders, Lucas Glover, J.J. Spaun and Camilo Villegas, who all finished 6-under. 

However, McIlroy wouldn't respond to two different questions about the incident after his round.

Fields noted that Potter had sent a written letter of apology to McIlroy, PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan and others.

By SportsDay Staff



The University of Texas' athletic department self-reported five people for NCAA violations related to impermissible sports gambling last year, according to a report from the Austin American-Statesman.

The violations, which occurred between July 11 and Nov. 4 of 2024, were detailed in documents obtained by the American-Statesman via public records request. While names were redacted, the documents tied two football players, a student assistant, a non-student athlete with connections to the women's tennis team and an uncategorized athletic department employee to the transgressions.

The report says that those five individuals placed nearly $15,000 in wagers which were in violation of NCAA rules stating that players, coaches and staff are not allowed to gamble on any sport in which the NCAA sponsors a championship. 

While traditional sports bets are still illegal in Texas, the wagers were placed on a daily fantasy site which is legal in the state.

One of the implicated football players was ruled ineligible, but later reinstated. He was also required to pay out the value of his gambling winnings to a charity of his choice. 

The other player is described as having a previous “problem” with sports wagering and sought parental help to quit, according to the report. He placed 67 impermissible wagers totaling about $9,600, including two on Texas basketball games. He was not penalized because he left the program and stopped playing college football. 

The student assistant, who had placed wagers on Longhorns games, was terminated by the athletic department. The other two non-student athletes received warnings and additional sports betting education. 

According to the report, the violations were identified by the athletic department using a wagering monitoring service called ProhiBet which has been mandated by the SEC since the 2023-2024 academic year. In total, about 100 sports wagering violations were reported to the NCAA in 2024, up from around 50 in 2023.

CNBC Sport will add a weekly TV series and launch CNBC Sport-branded productions (starting with a Steph Curry special) in the coming weeks.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Media & Business Writer


CNBC is throwing its weight behind its nascent CNBC Sport brand, bringing its sports business coverage to CNBC TV and live events in a significant way.


	The company will launch a CNBC Sport weekend show CNBC Sport: On The Record, that features interview with sports business executives and newsmakers, and is planning a series of long-form CNBC Sport-branded productions that explore the intersection of sports and business, with NBA superstar Steph Curry's off-court endeavors set to be the focus of the first such project.




	“In an era where everything is time shifted or time delayed, sports is the one sort of appointment type viewing — that and the live market, by the way — so you have to be engaged,” says Max Meyers, VP & senior executive producer of strategic verticals & audience development, in an interview. “And that has inflated the value of these franchises, and there's a natural scarcity to them as well.

	“That has brought a torrent of money from all around the world, whether it be from sovereign wealth funds, whether it be from private equity funds, whether it be from other types of Wall Street type, traditional investment houses into this space,” he adds. “And as a result of that, there's a lot of money going back and forth. CNBC tells the story of money better than any network or any news outlet in all of its forms, so it made sense that we did it.”

	According to CNBC Sport reporter Alex Sherman, the idea came from CNBC president KC Sullivan: “His pitch was ‘look, sports is like a very large investable asset now.'”


	“But in addition to that, the people that are the owners of these teams are largely already on CNBC, and so we talk to them about the markets, or whatever their main business is, and then we shoehorn in a sports question or two when they're up on air,” Sherman adds. “We've shoehorned it in the past to some degree so his his idea was like, look, this is already here, we should have a platform for all this where we really dive in, because there's so much appetite for it, and there's so much crossover with what we already do.”


	In addition to the CNBC Sport newsletter, CNBC has increased the amount of sports business coverage sevenfold since it launched, the business outlet says. And it has pushed into a weekly sports business podcast, which in turn will form the basis of its upcoming weekend show beginning March 29. Interviews filmed for the video podcast will be repurposed for the weekly series.

	











	“If you think about the amount of wrings you get out of that media, it's remarkably efficient, and it looks modern, it doesn't look like cable news,” Meyers says.


	As for the longer-form video docs, Sherman frames them as an extension of something he was doing previously, with YouTube and ESPN already being the focus of some of those efforts.


	“The process of this thing that we're going to do with Steph Curry will be quite similar,” Sherman says, adding that his crew followed Curry around for a few days around the NBA All Star weekend, with an extended interview taking place on a boat.


	“The original conceit of it was that we were going to follow him into the Chase Center for the three point contest,” he added. “But then at the last minute, he pulled out of the three point contest with [WNBA star] Sabrina Ionescu, and they scrapped that plan. But we kept the boat ride.”


	The first branded live event, CNBC Sport: Inside the Business of Women's Basketball, is set for April 5, and will be sponsored by JPMorganChase.


	“There's a real desire on the part of the marketplace to partner and be associated with this content and this brand and how it lives in this space, and that was the goal,” Meyers says, adding that they are reaching the audience they intended to reach when they launched. “I think the thing that is sort of most interesting to me is the engagement that we're finding with our content … we can see the email addresses of the people who are signing up for these and it's all the people that we hoped to attract when we talked about this endeavor. It's the commissioners, it's the agents, it's the sports bankers.”

In addition to watching the games over the next few weeks, millions of Americans will be betting on them. 

Since the U.S. Supreme Court legalized sports betting in 2018, nearly 40 states have legalized some form of sports wagering. It's not legal in Minnesota, but many people in the state still stake money on office pools, in online fantasy sports or by driving to a border state to place a bet.

NFL free agency is basically a wild transactional party which rages for several days and ultimately leaves all attendees feeling disoriented and moderately regretful.

It's awesome. We are now entering the hangover phase. Everyone's head is pounding. Each franchise is blinking its eyes, lifting itself slowly off the sofa, checking pockets for wallets and phones. What a week.

Unfortunately, not all the work is done — at least, not everywhere. Various NFL teams still have glaring needs to be addressed in the days ahead, or in next month's draft.

[Yahoo Fantasy Bracket Mayhem is back: Enter for a shot to win up to $50K]

Today, the mission is to flag the most fantasy-friendly landing spots across the league that remain unfilled. We tried to do a little free agent and rookie matchmaking last week, and, well … it's just a big 0-fer to this point.

Perhaps this first team can finally get us on the board.

The Bears have nicely fortified (if not fully fixed) their interior offensive line over the past week, so the draft board has opened up in a way that allows us to reasonably hope Ashton Jeanty might actually land in Chicago. It's what the man himself wants. Here's hoping it happens. Let's get Jeanty into Ben Johnson's offense and spend the next six months arguing about whether a rookie belongs inside the first round in fantasy drafts.

Even if we don't get Jeanty to Chicago, this year's draft class is loaded with talented backs and the Bears have a pair of second-round picks.

It's been an underwhelming offseason to this point for the Chargers, a team with a talented quarterback and a screaming need for offensive playmakers. To this point, they have signed Najee Harris, Mike Williams and Jalen Reagor. The previous sentence might have excited us five years ago, but not today.

This season's incoming rookie tight end class is a spicy group, headlined by Penn State's Tyler Warren and Michigan's Colston Loveland, a former Jim Harbaugh recruit. Either would be a welcome addition to the Chargers offense.

The Raiders have a run-obsessed head coach and an alarming lack of rushing talent on the roster aside from new addition Raheem Mostert, who turns 33 in April. This might be the team that detonates our Jeanty-to-Chicago plan.

Vegas has plenty of other team needs, however, and 10 draft picks with which to address them. If it passes on Jeanty with the sixth-overall selection (arguably the prudent move), it can still plausibly snag one of the Ohio State rookie backs on Day 2. New Raiders OC Chip Kelly coached them both last season.

Everything about the recent history of this franchise suggests they will add a talented runner to the backfield, then feed 240 carries to Williams, who will rush for like 825 yards. It's just too obvious.

Williams only signed a modest one-year deal, so he shouldn't be a long-term problem for whichever back is eventually drafted by Dallas. He will definitely be a nuisance in 2025, however. Weeks ago, the Cowboys seemed like a clear favorite to land Jeanty, but various other teams have entered that particular chat.

Green Bay has famously not drafted a first-round wide receiver in nearly a quarter-century — even when the team was one playmaking receiver away from being a Super Bowl favorite — so it's probably not happening this year, either. But it seems pretty apparent this roster could use a dominant perimeter threat, particularly with Christian Watson likely lost for the year after tearing his ACL in January. The team made inquiries regarding DK Metcalf, but ultimately the Steelers actually met Seattle's asking price (and Metcalf's).

If Green Bay decides to shop for receiving talent in their usual draft pocket, Iowa State's Jayden Higgins could be the fit. He's 6-foot-4 with a 39-inch vertical, crazy wingspan and respectable speed for his size (4.47). He delivered two excellent collegiate seasons despite inconsistent/chaotic quarterback play.

It seems unlikely Jeanty will slide to Denver's pick at No. 20, so we're probably looking at one of the next-tier backs landing in Sean Payton's offense — and that's perfectly fine. Again, loaded class.

If it's Omarion Hampton or TreVeyon Henderson to the Broncos, that guy is gonna be the locked-in second overall selection in rookie dynasty drafts. Denver offers an ascending offense, a creative coach, a terrific offensive line and almost unlimited touches. This might very well be the prime spot for a first-year running back.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

It's Not Just Jamaica With a 'Cool Runnings' Story. There Are Sliders From All Over the World Now

Julia Demaree Nikhinson

LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) — It doesn't snow in Jamaica. Or Malta. Or Ghana. There's been a maybe dusting reported on rare occasions in parts of Thailand and Malaysia. And nobody thinks of Spain, Colombia, Israel, Brazil and Taiwan as winter sports superpowers.

They're all sliding anyway.

Those 10 nations — with a combined five Winter Olympic medals between them over the years, all won by Spain — were part of a record turnout of 38 nations over the last two weeks at the world bobsled and skeleton championships in Lake Placid, a sign that the sports are still growing. It's expected that some of the athletes from those nations, even without a sliding track in their homelands and not within thousands of miles of those countries in some cases, will compete at the Olympics next winter.

“I'm really happy that more nations are here, and this sport is growing,” said Adanna Johnson, a 17-year-old women's bobsled pilot from Jamaica after she finished the monobob race in Lake Placid last week. “I think one of the reasons is for the Olympics, they only allow for three sleds from the bigger nations to compete and that kind of allows smaller nations to get bumped up in the rankings.”

True, there are spots set aside at the Olympics for nations that are developing teams to compete on the sport's biggest stage. That's why there have been sliders from American Samoa, Bermuda, Greece, India, Ireland, Nigeria, Puerto Rico, Trinidad and Tobago, Tonga and the Virgin Islands in the games over the years.

Skeleton athlete Jonathan Yaw wants to add Malaysia to that list. He's a former handball player from Australia who slides for Malaysia — the country where he was born and his father's homeland — in large part because of a legacy program established in southeast Asia to promote winter sports after the 2018 Pyeongchang Games.

Yaw finished 29th at the world championships last week. Out of 29 sleds, that is. He wasn't bothered and showed some progress; for example, he beat 2018 Olympian and 2026 hopeful Akwasi Frimpong of Ghana in their final run of the event.

“We have some good ambassadors for our sport,” Yaw said. “And, you know, in sport, sometimes you get the arrogance and the cockiness. I want to show people that you can be humble. You can just put your head down and work hard and still achieve good results and be a good role model for kids.”

Yaw has had some success, and there's a young girl in Lake Placid who has proof of that. She's the owner of the first medal Yaw ever won in a North American Cup race and wore it to the event's opening ceremony last week. He gave it to her to plant a seed, he hopes.

“She actually started skeleton in Lake Placid because of that medal and because she met me,” Yaw said. “That brings me to tears. If I can do that for one kid, then on a platform like the Olympics or world championships hopefully I'll be able to do much more.”

Shannon Galea — who works for the Canadian Olympic Committee — is now a skeleton slider representing Malta through the heritage of her father and grandparents. She trains when she can in Lake Placid now and has athletes from Malta and other places reaching out for guidance on how they can try to become Olympians.

Like Yaw, she was last in the women's worlds race.

“Last place is not fun,” Galea said. “But I'm fortunate. A lot of athletes in the field are supportive.”

She was a star athlete in a slew of sports growing up. Softball was probably her best game; she was a pitcher throwing at high speeds, and now she finds herself sliding headfirst down mountains at even faster speeds — she topped out in Lake Placid last week around 72 mph — to chase that Olympic hope.

“I played five varsity sports,” Galea said. “This is not a varsity sport. This is, ‘go out there and be psycho.'”

The sliding sports have some traditional powers. Germany has long been the world's most successful nation, whether the sport is bobsled, skeleton or luge. The U.S. — with Kaysha Love in monobob and the mixed skeleton team of Austin Florian and Mystique Ro — was the lone nation to win more than one gold in Week 1 of the world championships. Austria, Italy, Britain, Switzerland, Latvia and Canada are also among the nations that are traditionally strong.

China is coming, bolstered by massive investment in its programs around the 2022 Beijing Games. Brazil had a slider — Nicole Rocha Silveira — win two women's skeleton World Cup medals this season and finish fourth at the world championships. Ukraine nearly got its first skeleton medal at a world championships this year as well, with Vladyslav Heraskevych finishing fourth.

“We're showing what can happen if you believe,” Heraskevych said. “And if you fight.”

This phenomenon of sliding-sport dreamers might have really taken off as a novelty when Jamaica sent a bobsled team to the 1988 Calgary Olympics — a story that was turned into the 1993 movie “Cool Runnings.” The movie is largely fictionalized but is still the most recognizable part of the Jamaica bobsled story.

Johnson was a gymnast when she was recruited into sliding. She didn't know what “Cool Runnings” was. And now she's living her own version of the story, after finally seeing the movie.

“They made us watch it,” Johnson said. “I had no idea what it was like.”

Los Angeles Chargers linebacker Joey Bosa hopes to reestablish himself as a premier pass rusher in the NFL when he joins the Buffalo Bills next season.

ORCHARD PARK — Joey Bosa doesn't need to be reminded he's getting older.

What he doesn't consider himself is “old news,” as Bosa put it during a news conference Thursday after signing his one-year, $12.6 million contract with the Bills.

Four months shy of turning 30, and coming off three injury-slowed seasons, Bosa arrived in Buffalo hoping to reestablish himself as one of the NFL's premier pass rushers.

“I'm running out of time here. It's going fast. I'm in year 10 already coming up, and I just don't have that many moments left,” Bosa said. “So I have to grasp them while I can. And I think all that's on my mind is going to be football this year and helping the team.”

That team now is the Bills, following nine seasons with the Chargers.

It was in Southern California where he was named the NFL's defensive rookie of the year in 2016 and signed one the league's richest contracts in 2020. The low point was realizing that he, too, can be expendable after being cut by LA last week.

“It's gone in a blink of an eye,” said Bosa, who said he holds no grudges toward the Chargers.

“But I'm just ready for a clean slate, leave that stuff behind me,” he added. “I know it's been a tough last few years, but I know when I'm healthy and I'm on the field, I play really well, and I'm at a high level.”

Bosa is being asked to fill the edge-rushing role left open after the Bills released Von Miller on Sunday. Bosa is six years younger than Miller, though both have seen their production dip in recent years.

Bosa's 72 sacks are tied for 10th most in the league since 2016. But he has just 14 sacks over the past three seasons, during which he was limited to 28 games due to groin, foot, hip and back injuries.

On the plus side, Bosa's time in the AFC West makes him familiar with facing Patrick Mahomes. The Chiefs quarterback has become a Bills nemesis after improving his playoff record to 4-0 against Buffalo following Kansas City's 32-29 win in the AFC championship game in January.

“I'd like to think that I could help on that front a little bit,” Bosa said.

Bosa said he feels healthy. Thanks to his fiancee, he's already found a place to live in Buffalo. And he looks forward being back in what he called a “football town,” similar to his college days at Ohio State.

“It's been nine years, which I'm really thankful for my career and how it's played out. But I'm ready to experience something different,” Bosa said.

“What I'm going to try to do is really enjoy the moment … and really try to get back to enjoying football and having fun again,” he added. “I'm getting old and I'm ready to win. And I think this team is primed to do that.”

Joining Bosa in Buffalo is a former Chargers teammate, receiver Joshua Palmer, who signed a three-year contract after spending his first four seasons in LA

“A monster” is how Palmer described Bosa.

Signing with the Bills is a homecoming of sorts for the 25-year-old Palmer, who's from Toronto, about a two-hour drive from Buffalo. His parents still live there.

Palmer was more of a basketball fan growing up, and rooted for the Raptors. And he's aware that two former Raptors, hall of famers Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady, recently bought a stake in the Bills.

“I'm more interested in Josh,” Palmer said, referring to Bills quarterback and NFL MVP Josh Allen. “But those guys will definitely be good to meet and they're Toronto greats.”

The Bills also announced signing former Washington Commanders safety Darrick Forrest to a one-year contract. Forrest spent his first four NFL seasons in Washington, where had four interceptions and also played a special teams role in 40 games, including 17 starts.

🏀 Flagg injures ankle: Duke lost Cooper Flagg to an ankle injury during their win over Georgia Tech. Fortunately for the Blue Devils, X-rays were negative, but the presumptive No. 1 pick is unlikely to play the rest of the ACC tournament. ""It's not worth it,"" said head coach Jon Scheyer.

🎾 Keys can't lose: Madison Keys dominated Belinda Bencic at Indian Wells for her 16th straight win, the second-longest streak this century by any woman over 30 (Serena Williams). Next up: a semifinal meeting with No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, whom she beat in the Australian Open final.

🏀 Curry hits No. 4,000: Stephen Curry reached another milestone in the Warriors' blowout win over the Kings, becoming the first player to make 4,000 career three-pointers. In fact, only one other player has hit even 3,000 threes (James Harden, 3,127).

🏀 Automatic bid: Stephen F. Austin secured their spot in the women's NCAA tournament with a victory in Thursday's lone conference title game (Southland).

👟 Grand Slam Track: The 96 competitors for April's inaugural Grand Slam Track event in Jamaica include Paris 2024 gold medalists Gabby Thomas, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, Quincy Hall and Cole Hocker.

There's nothing quite like attending a sporting event in person, but watching on TV does often provide a better view. What if you could combine the best of both worlds? That's the promise of Cosm, an immersive entertainment company that hopes to bring ""Shared Reality"" to the masses.

The company: Cosm was founded in 2020 and built through the acquisition of Evans & Sutherland, one of the world's biggest planetarium companies, and LiveLike VR, which delivers immersive experiences to fans. In 2024, the company opened two venues in Los Angeles and Dallas and instantly went viral (watch this video and you'll see why).

The best way to describe Cosm? A smaller version of the Vegas Sphere — coming soon to a city near you. Atlanta and Detroit locations have already been announced, and the company raised $250 million last July (at a $1 billion valuation) with the goal of going global. ""I fully expect to be overseas in the next 2-3 years,"" says President and CEO Jeb Terry, a former NFL player.

""The planetarium was the first immersive venue ever created, in our opinion. It takes you to space. So we were able to leverage a lot of that backbone and say, 'Let's take you to the sidelines. Let's take you courtside.'""

""We will never replace the in-stadium experience. There's nothing like it. But how do we deliver something close to that and give fans another option when their teams are on the road, or when they're in L.A. and they want the experience of watching Liverpool at Anfield? That's the opportunity, and that's what we push to deliver.""

— Jeb Terry, Cosm President and CEO

What's inside: Cosm's main attraction is ""The Dome,"" an 87-foot, 12K resolution dome display with three levels of seating. The Cosm-produced broadcasts are designed specifically for the monstrous screen, creating an experience akin to sitting courtside. Each venue also has a sports bar-like area with wall-to-wall LED displays (""The Hall"") and a rooftop terrace (""The Deck"").

""We call it 'Shared Reality' — the convergence of all this immersive technology with the energy in the room, the collective of the fans, the high-fiving and cheering. People stand up for the national anthem in Cosm. They do the wave. And that's really what we're offering.""

Production: One important thing to understand is that Cosm isn't simply taking the TV feed and displaying it on a massive screen. The company installs their own immersive cameras on-site to capture the action and produces the broadcasts themselves.

""It's typically a 4-6 camera set up, and our goal is to stay out of the way of the linear production. These are unmanned, loaf of bread-sized cameras, so that's how we're able to get them under the goalposts, under the basket and in these unique positions. You know the pylon cameras you see during football games on Saturdays and Sundays? That's us. We do a lot of that work.""

Programming: Sports is a big part of Cosm's strategy, and the company has partnerships with all the major leagues and broadcasters (including CBS Sports and TNT Sports, which means they'll have March Madness). But the Los Angeles and Dallas venues offer other kinds of content, too.

""We think about programming like a TV channel might, where live sports is that anchor, but then you fill in the rest. That means entertainment. That means music. We have an incredible Cirque de Soleil program that puts you on stage, underwater, on trapeze. We have studios programming immersive, experiential art.""

Looking ahead: ""The goal within the next five years is wherever we travel in the world, fans have heard of Cosm,"" says Terry. ""I don't know the upward limit of how many venues we can have, but I know there are certain markets where we could have three or four. So I do feel like there's a long runway here, and that's our race right now: get that scale. And we're moving as fast as we can.""

Cosm partnered with the PGA Tour to present this week's Players Championship in ""Shared Reality"" at its two venues, where attendees will get the full TPC Sawgrass experience from thousands of miles away.

Golf on the big screen: ""The Dome"" features unique camera positions on the 16th, 17th and 18th holes, including a never-before-seen perspective of the iconic Island Green (thanks to the camera rig above). For those wanting hole-by-hole coverage, live feeds of every group are broadcast on the wall-to-wall LED displays in ""The Hall.""

To enhance the experience, Cosm has concession options that mirror the refreshments at TPC Sawgrass, including the event's flagship cocktail, the ""Sawgrass Splash."" The PGA Tour Superstore is also on-site selling The Players merchandise and apparel.

Cosm has mobile gaming stations at both venues where attendees can play PGA Tour 2K25, and TGL's Los Angeles Golf Club set up a mobile Dryvebox simulator at the L.A. location to give fans the chance to play the Island Green on No. 17 themselves.

What they're saying: ""Part of the thesis of what we do is transporting people to places they otherwise couldn't get to and democratizing access to events,"" says Peter Murphy, Cosm's SVP of Content & Media. ""Not everyone can get over to Sawgrass, so we want to export that experience to Dallas and L.A. and make attendees feel like they're in Florida watching golf.""

Sunday should be epic: The last three holes at Sawgrass are among the most famous in golf, and Cosm will be delivering the final round drama in a way that's never been seen before. ""I can't wait for Sunday in The Dome,"" says Tom Jeffs, the PGA Tour's VP of Media Business Development.

""The buzz of electricity on those last three holes is really compelling, and the immersive broadcast and unique camera positions will only add to the excitement and fear as you watch players take on the 17th hole with birdie on the line — but also triple-bogey in play,"" says Jeffs.

""When you're in The Dome, it's going to feel like you're on the green with Scottie Scheffler as he stands over a putt to take the lead. The scale makes him look like he's 6-foot-3, which is what he is in real life. And the mic system we have plugged into the Cosm cameras will provide a sense of presence as you hear the nervous murmur of the crowd as guys debate what shot to hit.""

Pricing: If you wanted to watch The Players today at Cosm Los Angeles, tickets currently start at $25 for Dome Reserved and $11 for General Admission, which gets you access to standing room areas and first-come, first-served seating in The Hall and on The Deck.

First of many? We'll see how this weekend goes, but it certainly sounds like this partnership could expand far beyond The Players. ""There's a lot of enthusiasm on both sides to extend this to additional events,"" says Jeffs. ""We're exploring future golf tournaments,"" added Murphy.

From Yahoo Sports' Jeff Eisenberg:

With the NCAA tournament tipping off in less than a week and the landscape of college athletics evolving so rapidly, Yahoo Sports sought to tackle an intriguing question: Which past men's college basketball legends would have earned the most money in the modern NIL era?

To answer that, we asked eight experts in the NIL space to rank their top candidates. The only rules were to keep it strictly to men's basketball players from after the NCAA tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985.

The top 8:

Zion Williamson, Duke (2018-19)

The Fab Five, Michigan (1991-93)

Shaquille O'Neal, LSU (1989-92)

Christian Laettner, Duke (1988-92)

Anthony Davis, Kentucky (2011-12)

Joakim Noah, Florida (2004-07)

Stephen Curry, Davidson (2006-09)

Jimmer Fredette, BYU (2007-11)

Read the full story.

Get your brackets ready. The final 17 men's and 14 women's automatic bids will be determined this weekend ahead of Selection Sunday. The men's bracket will be revealed first (6pm ET, CBS), followed by the women's bracket (8pm, ESPN).

Question: Who was the last driver not named Max Verstappen or Lewis Hamilton to win the Formula 1 championship?

Hint: 2016, Mercedes.

Answer at the bottom.

Will MacKinnon was traded from the Utica Comets (Devils AHL affiliate) to the Cleveland Monsters (Blue Jackets AHL affiliate) on Thursday.

Why am I telling you about a minor league hockey trade? Because he was traded by his father, Dan, who is the Comets general manager. And he was traded for future considerations, which could ultimately mean that he was traded for nothing in return. Brutal!

Trivia answer: Nico Rosberg

The 1962-63 Illinois men's basketball team. The Illini, coached by Harry Combes that season, finished with a 20-6 record, tied for the Big Ten title and became the first Illinois team to reach the NCAA tournament in 11 years.

Sixty-two years ago on Saturday — March 15, 1963 — trailing by double figures to a Bowling Green team featuring two future NBA stars, Illinois used a massive effort off the bench from sophomore Skip Thoren and a crucial mistake by Bowling Green in the final two seconds to win its opening-round NCAA tournament game in East Lansing, Mich.

Thanks to 18-first-half points from all-star guard Howard Komives, the Mid-American Conference champions raced away to an early 11-point lead. That's when Illini coach Harry Combes called the 19-year-old, 6-foot-8 Thoren into the game. Teaming him up with big man Bill Burwell to form a double post offense turned out to be a brilliant strategy. That took the play away from Bowling Green's 6-11 center Nate Thurmond, who was held well below his 20 points per game average.

In the final 30 seconds, with Illinois stalling to protect a one-point lead, the Falcons were forced to foul Bill Small. He made both free throws, expanding the Illini lead to three points. A Bowling Green field goal moments later once again narrowed the margin to one. With 10 seconds left, the Falcons got the ball back after forcing an Illinois turnover, but after the Illini applied a full-court press and forced a 70-foot desperation pass, the Bowling Green receiver stepped out of bounds. Small made a pair of free throws in the last second to make the final score, Illinois 70, Bowling Green 67.

Other memorable Illini moments that have happened on March 15:

➜ March 15, 1924: Illini pole vaulter Dean Brownell set a world record at the Big Ten meet with a leap of 13 feet, 5/8 inches. Illinois doubled up Michigan for the conference team title, 381/3 points to 19.

➜ March 15, 1930: Individual championships by Joe Sapora (115 pounds), Lou Bauerle (135) and Lloyd Burdick (heavyweight) led Illinois to the Big Ten wrestling team title.

➜ March 15, 1966: University of Illinois graduate and Harlem Globetrotters' founder Abe Saperstein died at age 63.

➜ March 15, 1985: Ken Norman scored 23 points and grabbed nine rebounds to lead Illinois past Northeastern, 76-57, in NCAA tournament first-round play in Atlanta.

➜ March 15, 2003: The 13th-ranked Illinois men's basketball withstood a late charge by Indiana to win 73-72 in the semifinals of the Big Ten tournament at Chicago's United Center. Brian Cook's two free throws for the Illini with just 5.2 seconds left were the difference.

➜ March 15, 2008: Illini men's basketball defeated Minnesota for a 20th consecutive time, beating the Gophers, 54-50, in the Big Ten tournament semifinals. Shaun Pruitt paced Illinois with 16 points.

➜ March 15, 2022: Illini junior center Kofi Cockburn was selected as a first-team All-American by the Associated Press. The balance of the first teamers were Ochai Agbaji (Kansas), Johnny Davis (Wisconsin), Keegan Murray (Iowa) and Oscar Tshiebwe (Kentucky).

➜ March 15, 2023: Illini women's track and field miler Olivia Howell was named the Big Ten Indoor Track Athlete of the Year.

➜ March 15, 2024: Illinois scored the final six points of the game to secure a come-from-behind 77-74 victory against Ohio State in the Big Ten tournament quarterfinals. Terrence Shannon Jr. tallied a game-high 28 points.

NFL Draft: How to Watch, Dates, Draft Order and Potential Top Picks

Quarterbacks Cam Ward and Shedeur Sanders figure to be among the top picks in next month's NFL draft, though there's no current consensus that either player — or any quarterback — will be the No. 1 overall selection.

The three-day draft is scheduled for April 24-26 at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin, which is the home of the Green Bay Packers. Here are a few things to know about the upcoming draft:



  When is the NFL draft?
 

The first round of the draft will be on Thursday, April 24, beginning at 8 p.m. ET. 

The second and third rounds are on Friday, April 25, beginning at 7 p.m. ET.

The fourth through seventh rounds are on Saturday, April 26, beginning at noon ET.



  How do I watch the NFL draft?
 

All three days will be televised on ESPN, ABC and NFL Network.



  Who will be the top picks in the NFL draft?
 

Ward and Sanders are the top quarterback prospects, though they won't necessarily be the first two picks like Caleb Williams and Jayden Daniels in 2024 and Bryce Young and C.J. Stroud in 2023.

Edge rusher Abdul Carter and two-way star Travis Hunter are also highly rated prospects, meaning that a non-QB could be the No. 1 overall selection for the first time since defensive end Travon Walker was the top pick by the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2022.

For more information on the top picks, here is the mock draft by AP Pro Football Writer Rob Maaddi.



  What is the NFL draft order?
 

Here are the teams that currently possess the top 10 picks of the upcoming draft. These were the selections in the first round of the 2024 draft.

1. Tennessee Titans

2. Cleveland Browns

3. New York Giants

4. New England Patriots

5. Jacksonville Jaguars

6. Las Vegas Raiders

7. New York Jets

8. Carolina Panthers

9. New Orleans Saints

10. Chicago Bears

Let the NBA Draft Lottery tanking COMMENCE! De'Aaron Fox of the San Antonio Spurs, out for the year. Paul George, likely done for the year. The Mavs, well they're not TRYING to tank but it's happening anyway because DuMont and Nico Harrison's respective visions for the Dallas Mavericks continue to blow up in their face. The Miami Heat, we can't tell if they're tanking or just plain stink. The Utah Jazz are tanking in plain sight (and getting fined for it). But there's plenty of good too — Tom Haberstroh tells Kevin O'Connor that the Golden State Warriors are officially a ""top-tier"" title contender, right up there with the Cavs, Thunder and Celtics. It's all on this fresh new episode of The KOC Show.

Plus, former NBA star Gordon Hayward joins Kevin O'Connor to break down Cooper Flagg's injury, and what this could mean for #1-ranked Duke's immediate future with The Tournament looming. Hayward explains how after he saw the Flagg injury, the first thing he thought of was his own gruesome ankle injury. KOC and Gordon also talk about which players for Duke will now need to step up, including Kon Knueppel. Gordon also reacts to his alma mater Butler losing on Thursday to #6 St. John's.

Bid to Launch Women's DI Hockey at Michigan Moving Forward, Regent Denise Ilitch Tells the AP

University of Michigan regent Denise Ilitch told The Associated Press she believes there's enough support for the Big Ten school to launch a Division I women's hockey program that it's only a matter of when, not if, it will happen.

“I think that the decision to have a DI team is positive, so that would be a yes,” Ilitch said by phone on Thursday. “I think now, it's a matter of how do we get there.”

Several issues still need to be resolved, headed by determining whether to build a new facility to house both the men's and women's teams under one roof and how to pay for a project with a projected cost of at least $300 million.

Ilitch, however, expressed confidence in saying she is eager to jumpstart the women's program's launch by identifying an off-campus arena to host the team in the interim.

“All I can say is those that are the supporters and the board and the president all want the same thing,” said Ilitch, the daughter of Detroit Red Wings owner Marian Ilitch.

“So I think we'll move as quickly as we can,” she added. “I don't want to put a date on it though but, boy, I'm hoping within the next few months we're able to have at least a direction on whether it'll be Yost or new arena.”

The 102-year-old Yost Arena has been the long-time home of the Wolverines men's program, but considered too small to accommodate two varsity teams.

A feasibility study commissioned by the school last year outlined several options, with the cheapest projected to cost about $50 million to expand Yost's footprint. The cons of such a venture are reducing campus and community ice-time availability and valuable parking spaces.

Otherwise, the study's author, Collegiate Sports Associates, estimated it would cost $300 million to build a new one-rink facility with an 8,000-10,000 seating capacity. CSA also priced out a new two-rink facility at $330 million — with the second ice sheet providing more revenue-generating potential.

The study placed “a conservative estimate” in anticipating it would cost Michigan $4.1 million annually to fund a women's program, while noting there are various partnership options — including arena naming rights — to offset the losses.

Ilitch has been a long-time proponent for Michigan adding a women's program in a bid to fill a major void in the state. Despite producing numerous national team-caliber players, Michigan has lacked a Division 1 team since Detroit's Wayne State disbanded its in 2011.

Her comments come at a time women's hockey registration has jumped by nearly 43% nationally over the past decade, a jump in Division III teams, and the sport gaining further traction with last year's launch of the six-team PWHL.

On Sunday, Detroit will host its second PWHL neutral site game in two years, with the defending champion Minnesota Frost playing the New York Sirens at the Red Wings home. And Detroit is also a candidate for expansion, with the PWHL considering adding as many as two teams for next season.

“Detroit calls itself Hockeytown, so it's kind of bizarre to me that there isn't a college team,” said New York forward Elle Hartje, who is from Detroit, and played collegiately at Yale. “I'm appreciative that the PWHL recognizes it as a viable market to expand to. And hopefully, if that does happen it'll have a trickle-down effect into the NCAA.”

Sirens teammate Abby Roque is from Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and said she would have considered staying in state had there been a program, while also cherishing her career at Wisconsin.

“Having something there for young girls in Michigan now would be incredible, because when you can see it, it really does feel so much more attainable,” Roque said.

The CSA study found 45 Michiganders played on women's college rosters during the 2023-24 season. Overall, Michigan ranked fourth that year in the U.S. with 5,327 female hockey registrants behind Minnesota (15,723), Massachusetts (11,763) and New York (6,795).

The Wolverines currently feature a women's club hockey team, which was coached by Jenna Trubiano, who has taken over a strategic advisory role in working with Ilitch to launch a DI program.

Too often, Trubiano said, Michigan-born players leave the state to pursue hockey and never return, leading to a talent drain at the youth girls hockey coaching levels.

Trubiano said what helped spur the women's hockey push at Michigan was arch-rival Ohio State winning two of the past three NCAA titles.

“It was really something that put it on the radar for people at Michigan because it was like, ‘OK, Ohio State just won a national championship and how did we do? Well, we don't have a program,'” she said.

“So I was actually rooting for Ohio State. Hey, that's the business right,” Trubiano added with a laugh. “I see them as a competitor, and Michigan faithful, I believe they want to beat Ohio State in everything.”

TRIMONT – Martin County West's Emily Anderson's dynamic offensive skill set paired with drastic defensive improvement were the key factors in why the Mavericks were two wins shy of the state tournament this year.

They're also a reason why she is this season's All-Sentinel Girls Basketball Player of the Year.

“She has the height that gives teams problems in the post,” said MCW head coach Cliff Anderson. “She can shoot the outside shot pretty well. So she's a tough matchup for certain teams.”

Emily Anderson's skill set continued to improve throughout her senior season under the tutelage of her coaching staff, with massive improvements in ball handling and finding her way inside the paint.

“I thought her ball handling was much more improved this year than in the past,” said Cliff Anderson. “Then getting her down in the post has always been a challenge for us, but I think we were able to get her down into the post a little bit more this year, that helped our offense a little bit too.”

Emily Anderson ended the season with 587 points, 275 rebounds, 92 assists, 123 deflections, and 68 steals, giving her averages of 19.6 points, 9.1 rebounds, three assists, and 2.3 steals per game. Anderson's play and numbers show what a massive part she played in the Mavericks' 23-7 season.

She made the jump to varsity in her seventh-grade year, and her progression since then has been nothing short of impressive.

“Looking back, in seventh grade when I got moved up, I was more of a just sit in the corner and kind of shoot person,” said Emily Anderson. “Now I've definitely moved into a scorer on all three levels and that didn't come easy. That's coming in and putting in my own time in the gym. Working with my family in the gym. Working extra workouts in AAU. Lifting weights and all those different things that not everyone sees.”

Emily Anderson focused on the team this year and just taking in her season. All of the goals set were team goals, which, according to her, had more than been achieved.

“I didn't really have too many personal goals,” she said. “Just a lot of team goals because that's what it's all about. We just wanted to have fun. And we wanted to win a lot of games because in the previous year we did win quite a few. We knew that we'd be pretty decent coming into this year. We just wanted to continue that.

“We got in the locker room and we set some original goals and we did meet a lot of those. Winning the Valley Conference, getting a home playoff game. We met a lot of those team goals that we established right away.”

She feels that her communication is where she developed the most this season.

“Just talking and helping my teammates out,” she said. “More so like on the defensive end. We definitely run a unique type of defense, and so the ability to talk to my teammates on defense is really important. I think I've come a long way in that and so helping my teammates on the defensive end, and definitely on the offensive end. I think I've come a long way.”

For the senior leader, though, it wasn't all about the wins, rather the special moments shared with teammates and coaching staff that stood out to her as favorites.

“We have a lot of good moments in practice,” said Emily Anderson. “Where we're doing things, just like little things. Either with my teammates or even with all of our coaches. They just give us a good little laugh. It's those moments that maybe not everyone sees. It's like the behind-the-scenes stuff. Which are probably all my favorite things.”

This year's All-Sentinel Player of the Year is now focused on her final season of softball for the Mavericks, after which she will resume her basketball career at University of Wisconsin, River Falls.

Each week during the 2024-25 NBA season, we will take a deeper dive into some of the league's biggest storylines in an attempt to determine whether trends are based more in fact or fiction moving forward.

[Last time: Is the NBA without a future face?]

How ridiculous is the NBA? Let us count the ways. Over the past week or so ...

• Two former players, stretching nearly 14 feet and weighing close to a combined 600 pounds, challenged each other to a fight over the way they believe the game should be covered from a media perspective.

That is what happened when TNT's Charles Barkley said, ""I want all the smoke,"" calling ESPN's Kendrick Perkins a ""fool"" and an ""idiot."" To which Perkins said, ""I will address his a** like the numbers on a house.""

[Yahoo Fantasy Bracket Mayhem is back: Enter for a shot to win up to $50K]

And what, pray tell, could possibly be the reason for these two behemoths to be so angry at each other? Barkley believes Perkins dedicates too much time to the Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors. That is it. That is the entirety of their latest beef, at least so far as I read it. A Hall of Famer is upset because a guy who averaged 5.4 points per game for his career is not talking about the Cleveland Cavaliers enough.

• One of the greatest players in the history of the league personally and very publicly admonished a media member for daring to talk about his son's ability to play basketball, even though his son plays basketball professionally. And one of those people is somewhat seriously being discussed as a potential candidate for President of the United States, and it is not LeBron James or his son. It is Stephen A. Smith.

James, who tweeted last season how ""hilarious"" it was how much better Bronny is than some NBA peers, is essentially big mad that Smith has called him out on it, saying, ""I am pleading with LeBron James as a father: Stop this."" ""This,"" we assume, is the dog-and-pony show of pretending that Bronny James would be in the NBA, earning $8 million from those very Lakers through 2028, if his name were Jonny Brames.

(Actually Jonny Brames is a great name. That dude probably would be in the NBA.)

And of course Smith took every opportunity after the confrontation to call it ""weak"" and ""some bulls***,"" as if James cannot possibly take issue with something he said. Bodes well for his presidential campaign.

Has anyone stopped to ask Bronny how he feels about all of this? He is a 20-year-old working professional who, by all indications, is fully capable of speaking for himself in these situations. Having his father, who set him up for all of it, fighting his battles for him makes the nepotism feel more nepotism-y.

• One active player accused another of ducking a third because two of them had a heated practice in 2018, even though the accused was not ducking anyone; he was attending a funeral for a personal friend.

Confounding, right? Draymond Green did actually say on his podcast that New York Knicks center Karl-Anthony Towns would not play his Warriors because Jimmy Butler was on the opposite side. When it turned out that Towns was dealing with the death of someone close to his family, did Green apologize?

No, he did not. He plugged his podcast instead. (Although Towns did address the issue.) What fresh hell are we living in, where Green is serving up his signature dish. You can guess what is on the menu. (Hint: It's something Stephen A. Smith said earlier.)

• The guys who made the dumbest trade in the history of the NBA are, a month later, still defending the dumbest trade in the history of the NBA as if it were not the dumbest trade in the history of the NBA.

That is right: Dallas Mavericks governor Patrick Dumont is still talking about the Luka Dončić trade.

“This was a decision about the future,"" Dumont recently said. ""If you look at our roster today and who we have, we feel like we position ourselves to be incredibly competitive against the best teams in the NBA.”

Weird. Your general manager, Nico Harrison, said it was a win-now decision, and you kind of just said it was one, too. And your team is in absolute shambles only weeks from trading the 25-year-old superstar who led you to the NBA Finals last year. There is no future to speak of in Dallas. And no present, either.

I would tell them to stop speaking if it were not so morbidly fun to watch them dig their hole deeper. Even Mark Cuban is out here telling people that he sold the Mavericks because he did not want his kids to make a trade so dumb. That is not the reason he sold the team, but it is hilarious he is saying it is.

• One team was fined $100,000 for violating the NBA's player participation policy in its efforts to tank the season, while another is more deftly — if not accidentally — driving its campaign into the ground.

The NBA fined the Utah Jazz for ""failing to make Lauri Markkanen available"" against the Washington Wizards in a battle of the league's two worst teams on March 5. The Jazz must have figured no one was watching, even the league office.

Meanwhile, have you seen the Philadelphia 76ers' rotation on their current run of misery? On Wednesday they started Jared Butler, Quentin Grimes, Kelly Oubre Jr., Andre Drummond and Justin Edwards. We will wait as you search ""Jared Butler"" and ""Justin Edwards"" to ensure that they are indeed actual NBA players.

It is not Philadelphia's fault that Joel Embiid, Paul George and Tyrese Maxey are all nursing loosely defined injuries on undisclosed recovery timelines. But if I were a team that needed to win a top-six draft slot in order to not lose its first-round pick, and I owned the NBA's sixth-worst record, I would ensure that all of my best players were nursing loosely defined injuries on undisclosed recovery timelines.

• Two incredible MVP candidates played two incredible games, each enjoying a sublime performance in a win over the other, and some folks instead wanted to talk about why one of them is ""a foul merchant.""

Why can't we just have nice things? Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Nikola Jokić are very nice things. In my opinion, it is wild that Gilgeous-Alexander is enjoying one of the greatest seasons for a guard in history, and yet Jokić is in a class of his own, because his statistics are (arguably) the greatest we have ever seen.

But the debate cannot end there. We must label one of them with a moniker that gives people who have not yet been introduced to SGA a reason not to like him. Here is a counter: If Gilgeous-Alexander is not actually earning his many trips to the free-throw line, why, then, are coaches not challenging those calls?

This is the way the NBA works. Do not like something? Manufacture reasons why everybody should not like that something, so we can all enjoy it less. Or challenge someone to a fight. It is all the same show.

Determination: Fact. The NBA is ridiculous. Where else can you find this drama but reality television.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

Fish, sharks, turtles, frogs and much more were on display. Sports editor Zach Carter enjoyed the moment, but as an avid fisherman, wished he had packed a fishing rod when seeing a few largemouth bass and channel catfish in a tank.

Following that, the six made their way around Progressive Field, the home of the MLB's Cleveland Guardians. MLB fan Logan Connor was excited to see the park and was interested to see the statues of Cleveland legends at the front of the ballpark. After that, the team walked around a bit more while Andrew Berger and Titus Slaughter took many photos and captured the moments for our postcard. For lunch, the team stopped by the Harry Buffalo and watched other conference college basketball games.  Once they finished their lunch, the team went to Rocket Arena to watch some of the men's MAC Tournament while Berger and Slaughter took some game shots. After leaving the arena, Elijah Poe, Logan Connor, and Carter worked on feature work while Derran Cobb kept the social accounts running.

Near the day's conclusion, the group went to Flannery's for dinner. Following that, it was time to prepare and get some rest for Ball State's second game of the week. They will play No. 4 Kent State Friday at 10 a.m.

There aren't many girls basketball teams remaining in New York state that sport a better record than Sherman's 21-1 mark.

One that does is undefeated Elba, which will be the Wildcats' opponent in Saturday's 6 p.m. New York State Public High School Athletic Association Class D Far West Regional at Buffalo State University's Sports Arena.

The Lancers (21-0) are the defending Far West Regional champions after beating 2024 Section VI champion Panama 58-47 in last year's state quarterfinal at Finger Lakes Community College.

Elba's season came to an end a week later with a 42-34 loss to Section II's Northville in the state semifinals at Hudson Valley CC in Troy.

“At the beginning of the week we focused on things we need to do better no matter who we play,” Sherman head coach Emily Eckwahl said Wednesday evening, “and we dug into Elba the last couple of days.”

The Lancers — the New York State Sportswriters Association's top-ranked team — graduated four girls from that team, but haven't lost since.

The main components are back for Elba.

Senior Sydney Reilly is averaging 18 points, nine rebounds and five assists per game; senior Mariah Ognibene is averaging 10 points, five rebounds and a blocked shot; and senior Maddie Hall is averaging 6 points and three steals per game.

The Lancers also have a pair of contributing juniors in Lydia Ross (10 points, three assists, three steals per game) and Brea Smith (11 points, 10 rebounds per game).

“Sydney Reilly is a handful for everybody they play. She is a really powerful guard,” Eckwahl said. “They have a center, who plays a lot like Panama's Kaitlyn Horton. She has a really solid inside-outside game. Overall, they have a really balanced attack.”

Elba has averaged 63.9 points per game offensively while allowing just 38.8 points per game en route to its unblemished record this winter.

“One of the obvious things you notice really quickly watching them play is that their experience is going to be a definite advantage,” Eckwahl said. “They've been in this game, they've won this game and they return four out of five starters with a six-man who is starting now.”

After winning Genesee County Division 2, the top-seeded Lancers had a bye into the Section V quarterfinals where they beat Avoca-Prattsburgh 71-36. In the semifinals at Mount Morris High School, Elba topped No. 4 Batavia-Notre Dame 52-36.

The Lancers then clinched the 17th sectional title in program history with a 54-36 win over Fillmore last Saturday at Finger Lakes CC. Elba won a state title in 2012.

Sherman — the state's fourth-ranked team — has an equally impressive history as Elba.

The Wildcats rallied from 11 points down with 3:59 remaining Saturday at Jamestown CC to beat Panama 45-41 for the 13th sectional crown in program history.

“I think it was just the mindset the girls had. The girls themselves kept commenting, “I can't believe how calm we stayed,” Eckwahl said about what she saw after rewatching Saturday's game. “Looking back it really is unbelievable, down 11 in the fourth quarter they weren't the least bit discouraged; they might have been the only 11 in the gym that felt that way.”

Senior Kelsey Wagner leads Sherman with 14.6 points per game to go along with 3.1 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 2.8 steals. Freshman Emmersen Crawford averages 11.4 points, 5.6 rebounds, 4.0 steals and 2.3 assists per game; senior Teagan Gratto averages 9.9 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.5 steals per game; and freshman Baya Oehlbeck averages 9.0 points and 2.0 steals per game.

“We were banking on them being big contributors, but they've all certainly exceeded expectations in a lot of ways, not only in stats, but their attitude and willingness to learn,” Eckwahl said of the Wildcats' underclassmen, which includes sophomores Carlie Gable and Madison Emory. “They all play a lot of basketball and put in hours, but we've asked them to think the game a lot sooner than freshman and sophomores. They've really risen to the challenge.”

Sherman advanced to the state final two years ago, beating Section IV's Franklin 49-43 in the state semifinal before losing to Section III's Copenhagen 47-39 in the championship game.

Wagner and Gratto were players on that team and are looking for a return trip.

“The beauty of Kelsey and Tegan having been in this game before, we can draw from their experience and the young ones can pull from their guidance,” Eckwahl said. “The young ones get to go out there fearless. They don't have the sting of old losses haunting them. They go out fearlessly and play for the day because they don't know any differently. … It's a benefit for our team that we have a wealth of that on both sides.”

BATON ROUGE, La. — Days before Thanksgiving, perhaps hours after quarterback recruit Bryce Underwood's stunning decision to shift his commitment from LSU to Michigan, a 50-year-old private equity executive in San Francisco worth billions fielded a phone call from someone in South Louisiana.

“Holden,” the voice on the other side said, “Can you help?”

Every fundraising effort has to start somewhere.

This one, in particular, began with Holden Spaht, a Harvard Business School graduate, Baton Rouge native and a mostly unknown figure who has worked in the shadows for years, with a small handful of others, to fund LSU football's name, image and likeness (NIL) efforts.

In late November, the Tigers saddled with a third straight season of at least three losses, their five-star quarterback commitment jettisoned for more cash and their football NIL fund below many SEC peers, coach Brian Kelly and administrators orchestrated a fundraising effort intended to aggressively pursue transfers and retain top players.

In less than two weeks last December, they needed to raise at least half of their springtime NIL goal of $13 million, which, in itself, was an already lofty objective given a startling fact: Despite its reputation as an NIL juggernaut — featuring stars of authentic endorsement deals like gymnast Livvy Dunne and women's basketball player Angel Reese — the football program's booster-backed NIL collective budget trailed many within its own conference.

LSU's collective spent roughly $12 million on its football roster over the last three seasons — combined. For comparison's sake, the Ole Miss collective spent about $13 million on its roster — last season.

Even athletic director Scott Woodward acknowledges that the program wasn't “at the top of the heap early on.”

But this winter, a sea change happened here on the bayou.

A program whose coach only last May announced at a news conference that he wasn't “in the market of buying players” mobilized like never before. The fundraising blitzkrieg, starting with that phone call out West, featured presentations to donors of the program's new, NFL-like roster valuation system. Kelly, himself, made visits to Baton Rouge offices of business owners and pledged to match up to $1 million in LSU NIL contributions with a donation to the school's athletics fund.

The result? Multiple seven-figure gifts arrived. It was a last gasp to cap off the industry's four-year NIL era of boosters funding rosters before the arrival in July of a revenue-sharing concept that permits schools to directly pay players.

The cash flow — a majority of it from three to five donors — helped deliver a 16-man, top-ranked transfer portal class in the country, retain stars like edge rusher Harold Perkins, land a top-10 ranked group of high school signees and, perhaps, avoid a cataclysmic and historic happening: LSU, of all programs, being left behind.

“We've contributed donations because I have felt, to be honest with you, that there will be change,” said Pepper Rutland, who gave a seven-figure gift for the portal push. “I wouldn't be surprised to see major college football leave the NCAA, and I'm afraid if you don't do this and stay in the mix, you may be irrelevant when that change happens. You may be a school that doesn't come back from it.

“It's a money game now.”

LSU is not alone in its campaign this winter.

Dozens of power conference programs are hustling to reach eight-figure donation goals or are exhausting their collective bank accounts in an effort to distribute funds to athletes before the arrival in July of the new revenue-sharing era and its more stringent enforcement arm. All payments made to athletes starting July 1 are subject to a new enforcement entity that is expected to reject many of these lucrative booster-backed deals so prevalent over the last four years.

As a result, schools and their affiliated collectives have designed contracts for players that distribute all or a large portion of compensation to them before July 1 — a concept described as “frontloading.” This is a way to not only avoid the new enforcement arm but to create flexibility with a school's revenue-share pool next year. The cash distributed before July does not count against a program's revenue-share pool cap.

“It's the one year you can manipulate the cap,” acknowledged Michael Alford, the FSU athletic director.

Some programs are frontloading as much as $16 million, according to those with knowledge of the plans. They then have an additional $20.5 million in revenue-share pool to spend starting July 1, carrying over much of that cash to the 2026 roster. The revenue-share pool cap is based on the academic calendar. Year 1, for instance, runs from July 2025 through June 2026 before a new cap year begins.

“Schools are getting as much money off the books as they can,” said Russell White, the president of The Collective Association, a group of the most lucrative booster collectives. “There will be some big paydays.”

In Baton Rouge, the specific figure has been established.

“We are frontloading at a level where we are trying to get to or above $13 million,” Kelly told Yahoo Sports last month in an interview from his office. A portion of that $13 was used to support last season's team. LSU expects to frontload roughly $10 million of it before July 1 for members of the 2025 roster.

The $13 million is more than the collective distributed the past three football rosters combined: $5.5 million last year, about $4 million in 2023 and $2 million in 2022.

“We thought, ‘Let's push all the chips in,'” said Carlos Spaht, general counsel and former co-manager of the LSU collective Bayou Traditions. “It's not just because we want to perform better on the field and win a national championship, but the back-counting of these collective dollars will essentially allow revenue-share dollars to go further.”

Blake Lawrence, the CEO of the NIL platform Opendorse, estimates that at least one-third of power conference programs are, in some fashion, frontloading payments this spring. Most if not all of the major NIL brands are believed to be in that group, including Georgia, FSU, Miami, Michigan, Clemson, Ohio State, Florida, Tennessee, etc.

However, schools that are frontloading are taking an inherent risk, said Jason Belzer, founder of SANIL (Student Athlete NIL), an organization that manages more than 50 collectives across the nation. Receiving a majority of their salaries before even summer workouts are complete, will players be incentivized to compete at a high enough level during the season? Will some take the cash received January-March and enter the spring portal in April?

Also, what happens after the impacts of the frontloading are over in Year 2 of the revenue-sharing calendar?

“The market is going to be overinflated,” Belzer answers. “Kids are going to say, ‘You paid the previous kid two times more than me?!'”

Seated at his desk within LSU's newly renovated football operations building, Austin Thomas, the program's general manager, gestures at the computer before him.

It holds his secret weapon: a software database system that assigns monetary values to each of LSU's roster positions and each player at that position (starter, rotational player, backup, etc.). It's an NFL-like model that he and athletic director Scott Woodward refined during visits this summer to NFL franchises like the Seattle Seahawks.

As Thomas inputs new values at one position, all other position values change so that LSU will remain under the revenue-share cap. For example, if a program decides on a given year to spend 15 percent of their pool on the quarterback position — about the going rate in the NFL — it means all other positions cannot exceed 85%.

According to Kelly, LSU is assigning a hierarchy pay system based on experience and playing time.

“It's fascinating,” Kelly says. “You start with your initial capital outlay at key positions: quarterback, cornerback, defensive end. You can track a freshman who is going to be your third stringer. Well, he's only getting $125,000 or $85,000. So if he's getting offered $1 million to transfer, there's nothing to talk about. If Miami wants to give our third-stringer $1 million, good luck to them.”

The system was essential in both recruiting the portal class and retaining (or not retaining) players.

“We said, ‘If Player X goes through this threshold, we've got to let him go,'” Thomas says.

“It's about discipline,” Woodward says. “If you deviate from your plan, you sink your ship.”

Thomas, on his third stint at LSU, is one of the most notable general managers in college football because, in many ways, he was the first. Ed Orgeron named him general manager in 2016, and he's believed to be the first staff member to hold such a title in major college football.

He helped construct the talent-laden 2019 LSU team that won the national title, left for Texas A&M to help build the Aggies' 2020 Orange Bowl squad and, most recently, worked with Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin to sign two of the best back-to-back portal classes in college football history.

He's an analytical nerd, a father of three boys and the behind-the-scenes engine of LSU's latest aggressive NIL attack since Woodward hired him last January.

Here in Baton Rouge, especially lately, Thomas evolved from a numbers-crunching, talent evaluator to a blistering fundraiser. He assembled a two-hour presentation — his database included — that he showed to more than a dozen of the school's top donors last fall, many of them hesitant to give significant amounts to NIL.

He and Woodward educated them on NIL's importance, walked them through the program's monetary value system and, in the end, delivered a clear message: We need your help financially to make this all happen.

“There have been some programs that have spent at a very high level, much higher than the traditional powers like us, Georgia, Alabama,” Woodward acknowledges. “There have been some that have spent two and three times us.”

As part of the presentation, Woodward and Thomas showed boosters the spending from those other programs, including Thomas' former place of employment.

“Well,” remembers Rutland, the LSU donor who saw the presentation, “we were trailing Ole Miss.”

In Kelly's first season in 2022, LSU's football roster earned about $2 million from its collective as part of a plan to pay players each a similar, low five-figure amount — it was a way to preserve and maintain team culture and unity. To that end, Kelly accepted few transfers.

In their last 24 power conference games, dating back to November 2022, the Tigers are 15-9 — a lowly mark for a program with three national titles since 2003 and one paying its coach $10 million a year.

In an interview from his office last month, Kelly says he intentionally built the program with high school players to avoid “resetting” the team each season with transfers.

“After Year 3, we had enough foundation and young players in our program that we could really now, this year, invest into the portal,” he said.

However, as Thomas, staff members and coaches pursued possible transfers late in the fall last year, a problem emerged.

They didn't have enough money.

Kelly, one of the more blunt and honest coaches in college football, details the conversations with players, agents and their families.

“The NFL salary cap is $252 million,” he says. “Let's say conservatively that we at LSU are operating on a $14 million (roster budget). That's $252 million to $14 million and we were told that a linebacker should be getting the same in the NFL as he is at LSU?”

This elicits a chuckle from a reporter.

“Glad you're laughing,” Kelly replied. “We laughed until we had to cry. Those numbers are real. What was hard to navigate: professional agents with that mindset. They knew NIL was ending. They knew it. It's over. So, they were going to get their shot.”

Thus, in December, the fundraising effort began in earnest with a group of three to five high-level donors followed by another group of about a dozen.

Kelly visited at least one of them, Rutland, at his Baton Rouge office.

“I do remember telling Coach Kelly when he came to our office,” Rutland said, “‘I bet you'd never thought you'd be in a situation like this when you came to LSU.'”

Replied Kelly: “You're right.”

The cash dash got started with a call to Holden Spaht, a California-based private equity investment executive and brother to Carlos, the collective's attorney. The Spahts grew up in Baton Rouge, attended high school here and their grandfather even served years ago on the university's board of supervisors.

Holden graduated from Dartmouth and received his master's at Harvard before launching into a private equity career that, in an understatement, has been quite successful.

Holden Spaht's net worth, according to Forbes, is $3.7 billion.

Reached by phone earlier this week, Holden politely declined comment. Carlos describes Holden as an obsessive LSU football fan despite not attending the school. He's delivered multiple seven-figure gifts toward the football team's NIL efforts, according to those with knowledge of the donations.

“He loves LSU football. He's led the charge,” said Carlos.

He's gotten others involved too at a high level, such as Todd Graves, the founder of Raising Cane's, a native of New Orleans who grew up in Baton Rouge and a man valued at $9.6 billion.

The list goes on. It includes Gordon McKernan, an attorney in Baton Rouge who first led LSU's NIL efforts in 2021 by signing dozens of players to endorsement and commercial contracts. He has spent more than $2 million on LSU's NIL efforts and was part of the fundraising effort last December.

Reached this week, McKernan expressed concern about the sustainability of such giving. Sure, LSU donors hit their mark this time around. But what about next year and the next? He expects NIL to continue to exist in the revenue-share era as programs attempt to exceed the revenue-share cap by finding authentic deals for their athletes.

Can LSU keep pace?

“Louisiana, from an economic standpoint, isn't as robust as the state of Texas or Florida where they have a much bigger population pool with more wealthy people,” he said. “If we have $20 million and Texas has $20 million, as long as you have legitimate deals, Texas could go up to $24 or $26 million.”

Woodward acknowledges that LSU does not have “one guy who writes the whole big check” like some schools. But it does have a legion of fans who have recently sprung into action with donations through the Tiger Athletic Foundation, the school's non-profit fundraising arm that provides LSU millions annually to fund scholarships, facilities renovation and construction and, now, NIL to athletes.

In July, the foundation struck an agreement with the school's collective to assume NIL fundraising, using its staff of nine frontline fundraisers to generate immediate cash for Bayou Traditions and provide TAF benefits — seat licensing and priority points — to donors. More than 3,500 donors have made 4,000 individual NIL-specific donations since July, said Matt Borman, TAF's president and chief executive officer.

According to those familiar with the financials, the collective is receiving an average of nearly $2 million a month in NIL-specific gifts, many of those the large, seven-figure donations made in December.

“At 8-4, we needed to pay more. There's no other way to say it,” said Russell Mosely, a Baton Rouge business owner and one of the original founders of Bayou Traditions. “And if we don't pay more, we're going to get stuck at 8-4.”

Within LSU's football operations building, just down the hall from Austin Thomas' office is a room full of recruiting staff members working diligently.

They're performing reconnaissance on LSU's next transfer portal class.

“You have to be ready when guys enter the portal and be one of the first people to communicate with them,” Thomas says.

With this year's portal class, LSU valued production more than anything. The group of 16 players started a combined 104 power conference games last season — the most of any transfer class in the SEC and, perhaps, in the country.

The group includes former starting receivers at Kentucky (Barion Brown) and Oklahoma (Nic Anderson), starting offensive linemen at Northwestern (Josh Thompson) and Virginia Tech (Braelin Moore) and three defensive ends with more than 200 career tackles at FSU, Florida and Nebraska (Patrick Payton, Jack Pyburn and Jimari Butler).

It's a high number of transfers for Thomas' liking. The sweet spot is more in the six to 10 range, according to metrics that Thomas acquired from visiting NFL staffs.

During one of the visits, Woodward describes an “aha moment” as front office personnel described their three personnel groups: drafted players (developmental group), current players (retainment group) and free agents (new group). LSU has divided its team into three similar buckets. High school players are their developmental crew, the current roster are older guys they wish to retain and the portal provides free agents.

Thomas wants the team to be made up mostly of retained players (55-60%) — the stability and culture center of the team, he says — with high school players next (25-30%) and then, finally, players from the portal (10-15%).

Building a roster isn't necessarily about how much money you have, Thomas says. It's how wisely you use those funds.

“It's an art,” he says. “Some of it is gut and intuition and feel and some is momentum and data.”

Once the revenue-share era arrives — if the House settlement is approved this spring — Thomas and Kelly will have about $13.5 million to spend starting July 1, Woodward said. Like many other schools, LSU plans to divide its revenue share pool of $20.5 million based on the House settlement's back-damage distribution formula: 75% to football ($13.5 million); 15% to men's basketball ($2.7 million); 5% to women's basketball ($900,000); and 5% to all other sports ($900,000).

The school will add an unspecified number of new scholarships that will, at the very least, total $2.5 million in additional aid. That amount is then reduced from the revenue-sharing cap, dropping it to $18 million — a reason for the sport-specific amounts listed above.

“We are talking about the edges now: Who gets the last 5 percent?” Woodward said. “We are going to balance that with teams' abilities to attract real NIL deals. That's going to be part of the gross package.”

The future of collectives under the revenue-sharing concept is uncertain. It's the “$1 million question,” said Bayou Traditions president Jared Wilson.

Many of them are remaining alive to operate as marketing agencies, arranging third-party NIL deals for athletes that allow a school to exceed the cap. Others are being shut down or rolled into the athletic department as a marketing wing.

Whether Bayou Traditions closes or not, donations are still necessary to the athletic department, perhaps more necessary than ever, LSU officials contend. Starting next year, schools will have an $18-20 million hole in their budget. It will grow. The revenue-share cap features built-in escalators. Within five years, the cap is expected to be closer to $30 million.

The money game is far from over.

And the pressure to win is now greater than ever.

“I'm a big Brian Kelly fan and supporter,” said Mosely, one of the LSU donors. “We've pushed to get the resources we need from a roster standpoint and to attract a good coaching staff. Everything is lined up for a good year. I think it's an important year. When you make an investment — like our business owners have made — you want to see that success pay off.

“I think success in our mind is nothing short of the playoff.”

DES MOINES — The St. Edmond boys didn't just take a small step back in the direction of being a premier team in Class 1A this year.

The Gaels took a giant one.

On Thursday night in the semifinal round, though, they ran into a Madrid squad with just a little too much Toryn Severson. The undefeated Tigers prevailed inside Wells Fargo Arena by a final score of 71-58.

The Tigers (27-0 overall) will now put their perfect record on the line Friday night versus top-seed Bellevue Marquette, in search of the first boys basketball title in school history. Severson finished with a game-high 32 points against St. Edmond, knocking down six 3-pointers. 

Three other Madrid players scored 11, including several key late buckets by Fabian Ortiz-Alaniz and Brody Buck that kept the Gaels (23-4) from getting closer than seven points.

Hunter Horn had 23 points — including nine in the fourth — while Carson Bargfrede finished with 17 for St. Edmond. The junior duo knocked down a combined six 3-pointers and grabbed 11 rebounds with three assists.

“We just needed one more big stop or a big rebound (in the fourth) to really get back into it,” Horn said. “We came out in the fourth and put pressure on them, but we just couldn't quite get (the deficit) back down.

“We know what it takes to get down here now, and we'll be working to make sure we don't come up one game short of where we want to be again.”

To start the fourth period, the Gaels quickly cut into the Madrid lead thanks to four quick points for Horn. Buck, though, answered and Jevyn Severson — a freshman — had another putback to push the advantage back to double digits.

Horn, who played with Toryn Severson in Ames at All-Iowa Attack, recorded a slick block at the rim against the future Waldorf Warrior.

“Yeah, I've played with or against all five of their starters,” he said. “I knew we would have to try and contain him, but he did a great job finding his shot.”

Madrid finished the game shooting 51 percent from the field and buried seven 3-pointers while holding a plus-eight advantage on the glass. They also committed just nine tunrovers and were 80 percent at the free throw line.

“We knew they were tough,” Bargfrede said. “I knew guarding Severson I was in for a treat. He showed me what he could do. 

“I think we were ready for it, but with all they throw at you, it's hard to defend.”

Bargfrede, put into the starting lineup after Jakob Koopman was injured in the substate final, had 10 points in the opening quarter as the Tiger defense focused on taking away Horn.

“I'm really proud of all of us for pushing through the final second,” Bargfrede said. “I had four games at Webster City before getting injured (a year ago as a sophomore), so I didn't have that experience on varsity. I knew I wasn't going to start every game, but once I got into the rotation, I had to personally step up.

“We've taken a giant step in the right direction, and we'll bring back four starters with myself off the bench. I'm just really proud right now.”

Koopman, who had an 18-point game in the quarterfinal win over Woodbine, was limited after coming down on his injured knee. That not only impacted the depth St. Edmond had, but the size they could throw at Madrid.

“Without Jakob, we had to change what we were doing on defense,” Horn said. “We didn't have that extra guy we could use and we lost some key strength inside.”

St. Edmond ended a lengthy state drought while placing second in the North Central Conference to 3A finalist Clear Lake. This marked the first loss in nine games against a 1A school this year for the Gaels, who had last visited Des Moines in 2012 to cap a magical 13-year run.

“Madrid is the real deal,” SEHS head coach Adolph Kochendorfer said. “They are one of those teams that if you try to help, the kid you help off of can hurt you. They have shooters, kids who can drive, and a very talented player (in Toryn Severson) who can take over.

“I'm just so proud of these kids. They are a great bunch and fun to work with. They all listen and are coachable.

“Our team should be proud of what (it) accomplished this year. They kept getting better and better.”

Andrew Clavey is the lone senior on this year's roster. Everyone else who saw the court this week is slated to be back in the fold.

“Andrew was a great kid who will be tough to replace,” Kochendorfer said. “He stuck it out for four years, and honestly, those first couple were not very fun. He was a great leader and someone who helped put the team together.”

MANKATO — The Madelia Blackhawks' spirited season that saw a program record 23 wins came to a close Thursday as the BOLD Warriors were too tough to handle on both ends of the court.

With a barrage of buckets in the paint, the second-seeded Warriors muscled their way to a 76-49 win over the fourth-seeded Blackhawks in the Section 2A Boys Basketball Tournament title game Thursday at Bresnan Arena.

Madelia's Josiah DeMaris looks for an opening on offense while guarded by BOLD's Owen Flann in Thursday's Section 2A boys basketball title game against BOLD at Bresnan Arena in Mankato.

The win for the Warriors (20-10) gave BOLD it's first state tournament berth in program history.

The Blackhawks finished their season 23-7.

Despite falling short to the Warriors, Madelia head coach Jeff Van Hee said he was proud of his players for getting to this point and let them know in the post-game huddle.

“[I told them], ‘Be proud of everything you accomplished,'” Van Hee said. “‘You've done it the right way. You played together, supported each other. I know it's tough right now, but you'll always have this memory of the season, this game.' The seniors, they left a legacy and that's what we can do. You go from that. The guys, I'm really proud. I felt coming in we were prepared, we were ready to go, we just couldn't get it done.”

Jack Gross led the Warriors with 24 points, while Owem Baumgartner added 19 points and Will Penkert had 14. Hudson Vosika was the fourth Warrior in double figures with 11.

Madelia's Kyle Pietsch puts up a hook shot during the second half of the Section 2A boys basketball championship game against BOLD on Thursday at Bresnan Arena in Mankato.

Madelia was led by senior Hayden Jones' 13 points, while Kaydon Firchau had 12 points and Dalton Tatro had 8 points. Tate Becker added 6 points, while Madelia's other starting seniors Kyle Pietsch and Josiah DeMaris scored 6 and 4 points, respectively.

After Gross won the opening tip-off, he quickly got the ball back in his hands and buried a 3 to put the Warriors up before Becker scored inside on the other end. A 7-0 BOLD run followed to put the Warriors up 10-2 and force Van Hee to burn a timeout with 15:08 left in the first half.

A Baumgartner steal for a layup and a one-handed slam dunk by Gross had BOLD up 15-6 moments later. A Becker steal for a layup cut the Blackhawks' deficit to 15-8, but Penkert hit a 3 to give his team a double-digit lead for the first time of the night. BOLD ended up hitting seven 3s in the first half but the Warriors didn't really need it as they controlled the paint and scored regularly inside while forcing Madelia's post players to take numerous tough hook shots near the low block but outside of the paint.

“They'll hit a few 3s, but they like to penetrate,” Van Hee said. “We were out on Vosika or on Penkert, but he hit some shots early. We didn't do a great job taking away Gross' left hand like we had planned. But they hit shots early and that's such a momentum thing. Then we come down and our shooters were shooting and not knocking shots down. We just couldn't weather the storm. 

“Hats off to them, they played well, they played really well and did what they needed to do to get out on us. They made it really tough for Kaydon to get downhill. Our game is to be able to go and pressure defensively and hit shots. We just didn't knock them down.”

Madelia's Kaydon Firchau drives to the basket during the first half of Thursday's Section 2A boys basketball title game against BOLD at Bresnan Arena in Mankato.

Baumgartner scored back-to-back buckets in the paint minutes later as the Blackhawks went cold, giving BOLD a 30-15 lead. BOLD stretched its lead to 34-17 before Tatro hit a much-needed 3 to have his team down 34-20. Moments later after BOLD increased its lead to 41-22, Tatro hit another key 3 for the Blackhawks to have them down 41-25, but another bucket inside by Baumgartner had BOLD up 43-25 at the half.

Jones opened the second half with a bucket, but Penkert got it back inside before Vosika drove the baseline for a 20-point BOLD lead, 47-27. The Warriors grew their lead to as much as 28, 67-39, after a 3 from Tyler Ruschen. Firchau, Jones and Pietsch all scored to give Madelia a quick 6-0 run and trail 67-45, but the Warriors remained in control after that as substitutions were made.

The Montoursville Area School Board at its recent meeting approved girls' volleyball as a PIAA team sport at the varsity level.

For the past year, Montoursville has had volleyball as a club sport with reportedly many participants.

“Now that it is official, it's an exciting time for Montoursville,” Tom Kuuipo, club volleyball coach, told the board. “You have a special group of girls here. These girls are really dedicated.”

District Superintendent Dan Taormina said having the club team in place for one year was the first step toward competing at the PIAA level.

 Board President Todd Badger said, “I'm really excited to go to game one.”

Board member Sharon Meyer thanked everyone involved for helping start and grow the volleyball program.

In other matters, Taormina reported that the ZeroEyes security system is operating in each of the district's school buildings.

He noted the system serves as another layer of protection for students and personnel.

“Hopefully, we never need it, but if we need it, it is there,” he said.

ZeroEyes uses artificial intelligence to detect firearms in security video feeds with the ability to alert authorities immediately.

Taormina also reported that the district may lose its ability to offer free lunches for district students.

The Trump Administration has targeted the Department of Agriculture with drastic funding cuts which could impact the Local Food for Schools Cooperative Agreement Program.

Taormina said he doesn't expect the district's free lunches to be cut this school year.

In personnel action, the board approved Laura Freshouer and Lauren O'Malley as track & field assistant coaches at stipends of $2,600 each.

The board also approved Robert Nolan, boys soccer, and Brian Stetts, softball, as volunteer coaches.

A two-year agreement with Community Services Group was approved.

The next school board meeting is set for 7 p.m. Tuesday, March 25 at the high school.

GENEVA (AP) — The impact of climate change on the global sports calendar will be a priority issue for Sebastian Coe if he wins the IOC's presidential election, the former runner said Friday

“If I'm successful next week that is very high in my in-tray,” Coe told reporters in an online call ahead of the vote in Greece next Thursday, where he is one of seven candidates to succeed IOC President Thomas Bach.

Coe said he stood “full square” with the 400 Olympic athletes who on Friday urged the IOC candidates to treat climate change as a priority.

“There is for me an unmistakable need to have a really sensible revisit of what the global calendar looks like,” said the two-time Olympic gold medalist, who leads track and field body World Athletics.

There is a broad consensus among the Olympic body's leadership candidates to be more flexible in scheduling future Summer Games and other international events while continuing to promote sustainable environmental policies.

The next Summer Olympics are in July 2028 in Los Angeles, which was ravaged by deadly wildfires in January, though Olympic venues were spared.

“The reality of it is our oceans by the week are getting warmer, the climate is getting warmer,” Coe said. “Man-made crises — whether they are fires, floods, whatever it happens to be — are causing major disruptions.”

Every Summer Games from 2004 in Athens through to 2032 in Brisbane, Australia have been scheduled in July and August, which is the prime slot for broadcasters, including NBC in the United States.




World Athletics has already seen how heat can affect athletes, at its 2019 world championships in Doha, Qatar held in late-September and in August 2023 in Budapest, Hungary.

Marathons at the Tokyo Olympics held in 2021 were moved to Sapporo to avoid the kind of extreme heat that was experienced in Qatar even when races were held around midnight.

“That's not just about the Gulf or Africa, it's everywhere,” said Coe, who has previously cited severe heat in Los Angeles at the 1984 Summer Games where he retained his 1,500 meters title.

Asked Friday if the concerned Olympics athletes and officials would be listened to, Coe said: “I'm not sure any of our voices are being heard at this moment.”

Coe, a former elected member of the British parliament, suggested “there has been a lot of backsliding” by governments worldwide in trying to meet targets to slow the effects of climate change.

The 2036 Summer Games — which NBC's parent company Comcast signed for Thursday as part of a $3 billion deal with the IOC — likely could be held outside of July and August.

The 2036 host has not been selected, though countries where Olympic officials are in early talks with the IOC include Qatar, Hungary and India.

Submitted photo: The Fort Dodge Country Club opened both its golf course and clubhouse in May of 1912.

As the pace of the world intensifies and our attention spans continue to wane, finding people willing to balance this hyperactivity with thorough research and historic preservation suddenly feels more imperative than ever.

Fort Dodge lost one of those stalwarts recently with the death of Al Nelson.

For at least the last quarter-century of his life — from the time he retired and moved back to his hometown — Nelson closely studied the ins and outs of our community's 156-year track record. The 1963 Fort Dodge Senior High graduate poured his heart and soul into learning more about the connections and stories that make us unique.

From a sports perspective, Nelson's impact was quietly immense. A high school teammate and classmate of Fort Dodge's Dave Sergeant, Nelson developed a keen eye for one of the sports he had always been most passionate about: golf. Nelson developed patents on putters and bags he'd worked on as an inventor living in the Arizona area, and when he returned to Fort Dodge, he spent over two decades unveiling just how much the game had deeply impacted our town for well over 100 years.

Sergeant, an amateur history buff and long-time Fort Dodge loyalist himself, admits Nelson never ceased to amaze. The two often met in Sergeant's local law office, where Nelson would reveal the fruits of his research labor.

Nelson told Sergeant about old golf courses that even pre-dated the Fort Dodge Country Club, which was founded in 1911. Around the turn of the century, there were tracks just west of town; by the old Expo Pool area; in Round Prairie; near what is now the hospital and Friendship Haven grounds; and the “River View Golf Club” next to the Des Moines River on the northwest side.

“Al kept coming up with this stuff, and I'm just shaking my head thinking, ‘how in the hell does he find this?'” Sergeant laughed. “He'd sit with me in my office and go over his latest batch of Fort Dodge history. He'd methodically sift through newspaper articles and other bits of information and piece it all together like a puzzle. 

“The time he put into it and his attention to detail was incredible.”

Nelson delved deep into the archives for the FDCC, and most modern-day understanding of its rich heritage originated from his legwork. Sergeant said Nelson didn't stop with just the general information, like the year it was built or when it opened for play. Nelson found the list of original members; the failed plans to contract from nine holes to seven in 1918, followed by the expansion to 18 in 1926; the fact that a stage coach used to reside where the clubhouse now stands; and that human bones, believe it or not, were discovered where the 18th green was first being constructed.

“That was an interesting one,” Sergeant noted.

Nelson also dusted off and shared with Sergeant stories of professional golf legends and future Hall of Famers Walter Hagen, Tommy Armour and Gene Sarazen visiting town and playing exhibition matches at the FDCC in the 1920s and 30s.

Nelson's devotion to history and golf gave Sergeant an idea a little over 20 years ago that changed the trajectory of the Iowa Golf Association.

“The Iowa Golf Hall of Fame was going to be revitalized around 2002 or 2003,” Sergeant said. “It had been dormant for six or seven years prior. We needed help with the archives, and getting everything back in line with where it needed to be.

“I talked to (then-IGA executive director) Bill Dickens about getting Al on the (Hall of Fame) committee. It ended up being the smartest thing we could have done. He served for over 20 years, and was just so invaluable with his commitment to research and accuracy. It's safe to say the IGA Hall of Fame wouldn't be what it is today without him.”

Sergeant was always fascinated by Nelson's itinerary. Nelson spent over a decade researching for and writing a book that was published in 2018, “Fort Dodge: America's Frontier Town.”

“We'd have our (Hall of Fame) meetings, and he'd take off to do research on his next book or project,” said Sergeant, who was even nominated by Nelson and inducted himself in 2014. “He'd go from Des Moines to Chicago, looking for railroad maps, stagecoach lines or anything else affiliated with Fort Dodge. Then he'd head to Washington D.C. He had access to archives at the Library of Congress.”

A celebration of life was held to honor Nelson this past Sunday at Shiny Top Brewing in Fort Dodge.

“Al was so proud of our community and its lineage,” Sergeant said. “He learned so much and shared so much with all of us. He wanted to give something back…I know he always loved history anyway, but when he saw a need to fill in a lot of the blanks and verify what had happened here, he took it seriously and made it his life's work.

“I really cherished our friendship, as did so many others. He'll definitely be missed.”

Nelson once told The Messenger that studying history is “like a treasure hunt. You're finding something that nobody else has really found.”

Thanks to Nelson's efforts, we are a better, wiser community today.

Des Lacs-Burlington's (DLB) Jake Schaefer (13) guards Turtle Mountain's Easton Peltier (11) who attempts to move the ball down the court. DLB played against Turtle Mountain in the Division A Region 3 finals at the MSU Dome on Thursday, March 13.

The 2024-2025 Division A Region 3 Boys Basketball Tournament Championship game was held at the Minot State University (MSU) Dome on Thursday, March 13, as well as the contest for third place and a shot at playing into the 2025 NDHSAA Division A Boys Basketball State Tournament that is scheduled for March 20-22, 2025 at the Bismarck Event Center.

The winner of the title game qualified for the tournament while the second and third place teams will participate in state qualifying games on Saturday, March 15, at the Minot Auditorium.

Des Lacs-Burlington vs. Turtle Mountain

The championship game was between the Des Lacs-Burlington Lakers and the Turtle Mountain Braves, both very talented teams. The Braves started the tournament as the seven seed and left a trail of upsets in their wake. 

First against Stanley, the two seed, then against Rugby, the six seed. The Braves put on quite a few impressive games at the tournament and proved to be a challenging opponent for the Lakers. Des Lacs-Burlington held the lead through the entire game. Turtle Mountain put up a good fight but ended up losing to the Lakers 45-40.

The Lakers sent out Jace Crocket to jump against the Braves Wes Davis. Des Lacs-Burlington won the tip off and with a quick pass from Drew Roedocker, Jake Schaefer brought in the first three points of the game out on the wing.

The Lakers Played the first quarter of the game out deep and brought in two more 3-pointers. Crockett and Schaefer played down in the paint to bring in six points. The second quarter consisted of more shots in the paint for both teams, and the quarter almost completely relying on rebounds for another attempt to score. The Lakers led 26-14 going into half time.

The Braves outscored the Lakers in the third quarter 12-8 but couldn't quite take back the lead. Turtle Mountain scored wherever they were open. Scheyer Decoteau made two points in the land and one extra point at the foul line, Kruz Lafontaine made a three pointer out on the wing. 

Turtle Mountain outscored the Lakers by one point in the final quarter. The Braves' Wed Davis led the score with two 3-pointers. With a minute left of the game the Braves were down by six, the game was riding on collecting fouls to earn some extra points without running the clock. 

Turtle Mountain slowly started to close the gap behind the Lakers, but the Braves couldn't keep away from the fouls and sent the Lakers to the free throw line four times in the last couple minutes of the game. 

The Lakers won the game 45-40 and will be heading to the state tournament, the Braves will get to play in the state qualifier for a second chance to make it to state.

Bottineau vs. Rugby

The Bottineau Braves, four seed, faced off with the Rugby Panthers, six seed, at the Division A Region 3 tournament. The two teams competed for the third place finish and the chance to play in the state qualifier March 15. 

The Panthers already had upset one team at the tournament. In the first half against the Braves the Panthers looked like they were gonna do it again. By the third quarter of the game Bottineau had retaken the lead and sustained it till the end of the game to take the 62-40 win over Rugby. The Braves will be able to play in the state qualifier on March 15. 

Rugby led through the first half of the game. The first quarter was led by Taytum Risovi with seven points and Tucker Volk with six. The Panthers outscored the Braves again in the second quarter and ended the first half with a 22-17 lead. 

The Braves stole the lead in the third quarter. Bottineau came out guns blazing in the third period and scored 26 points and put up a tough defence only allowing eight Panther points on the board. Rugby's Emersun Marum was responsible for most of these points. 

Marum made eight points down in the paint and three more on the wing to total 11 points for the quarter. Teammate Connor Guss brought in the second most points and shot from in the lane with six more points. 

Bottineau 43-30 going into the last quarter of the game. The final quarter of the game the Braves outscored the Panthers one again 19-10. Bottineau played to their strengths and kept the ball close to the basket for closer shots, Rugby played out on the wing trying to land high point shots. 

The Braves also took the advantage of rebounding, they picked up 46 rebounds compared to the Panthers 24, to give them the upper hand on most possessions.

Sleepy Eye St. Marys' Olivia Schieffert looks for the hoop during the Class A Girls Basketball State Tournament game against Sacred Heart Thursday at Maturi Pavillion.

MINNEAPOLIS — Sleepy Eye St. Marys' Morgan Mathiowetz forced two turnovers and Brynne Ibberson one, all leading to buckets, to take a 56-50 lead early in overtime in the opening round of the Class A Girls Basketball State Tournament Thursday at Maturi Pavillion against sixth-seeded Sacred Heart.

That early lead helped the third-seeded Knights hold onto that lead for a 64-59 win to send the Knights to Friday's semifinals round of the state tournament.

“Just knowing we had to finish the game,” Mathiowetz said. “Just everybody at this level, when they get here, they're giving 100%. The people that come out on the winning side are going to give 110. Just finding that next level and digging deep and playing with each other and being really united together to get the job done.”

The Knights now play MACCRAY at 2 p.m. Friday at Williams Arena.

Mathiowetz led the Knights with 30 points and 15 rebounds, while Olivia Schieffert had 16 points and eight assists. Natalie Fischer added 7 points and three rebounds.

“Mathiowetz is special,” Sacred Heart head coach Brian Loe said. “She just can do so much. I think we've seen a couple players that are comparable as far as speed goes, but she's just such a well-rounded basketball player, she does everything.”

Sacred Heart was led by the 6-foot Lexi Lawrence with 27 points and 16 rebounds. St. Mary's had a size disadvantage down low, and while Lawrence got her points, St. Mary's also forced several turnovers when the ball went to the post.

“She had a big first half,” St. Mary's head coach Bruce Woitas said. “I think she had 16 points in the first half. But I thought she did a much better job in the second half. We knew we had to focus on her, and they hit some big 3s tonight too, which we didn't see that often in the film that we watched. But we did a great job defensively on her. She shot a ton of free throws, but I think in the second half we limited her, especially early, and that was a big turnaround for us in that second half.”

Both teams played strong defense, leading to a 48-48 tie going into the overtime period. While St. Mary's certainly has an offense that can score in bunches, they are comfortable playing in lower-scoring games as well.

“I think they played pretty good defense, but we really wanted to focus on our defense and keeping them under their score,” Schieffert said. “Because we knew if they were going to keep us under, then we needed to hold them under too with our defense.”

The game started off with the teams trading points, but St. Mary's jumped out to a 13-7 lead after a 7-0 run, including a deep 3-pointer from Mathiowetz, to force a Sacred Heart timeout. The Eagles battled back, however, and after closing the lead to 19-17, they went on a 8-0 run to take a 25-19 lead. Fischer made a 3-pointer to cut into the lead, but Sacred Heart was still able to take a 25-22 lead into halftime.

“I think we really talked about what we needed,” Woitas said. “We weren't moving the ball very effectively in the first half. We were trying to do too much with not everybody involved in the offense. Morgan's a great player, she's been our top scorer all year long, averaging 34 points a game, so she has that full package and she adjusted really well in that second half too. And we got some big transition baskets in the second half too.”

Mathiowetz opened the second half with a 3-pointer, and the teams went back and forth once again. A transition jumper from Mathiowetz gave the Knights a 33-28 lead, and St. Mary's held a 46-40 lead on a layup from Mathiowetz with 2:44 remaining. Sacred Heart wasn't done, however, scoring 8 of the next 10 points to send the game into overtime. 

After a mid-range jumper from Sacred Heart's other 6-footer Lydia Riskey and a pair of free throws from St. Marys' Ameila Schwartz, the Knights went on their 6-0 run to go up 56-50 and force a Sacred Heart timeout with 2:43 to play. Lawrence made a layup coming out of the timeout, but St. Mary's responded with a driving layup from Ibberson. The Eagles couldn't gain ground in the final minutes and were forced to foul. St. Mary's made its free throws, and while Riskey made one final shot at the buzzer, St. Mary's was able to come away with the victory. 

The Knights now turn their attention to seventh-seeded MACCRAY after it upset second-seeded Mayer Lutheran earlier Thursday.

“They've got a really good guard player,” Woitas said. “They shoot the 3, they'll use her a lot to set up the 3 for other players. But I think overall we matchup OK with them. Their guard is a 6-footer as well I believe, shoots a lot of 3s from way deep out. We just have to be ready for that. Kind of similar to what Emily Anderson from Martin County West, except maybe a few more shooters on the outside versus what they had. We've just got to get some rest, get focused and get ready to go tomorrow.

The Knights fans storm the court with the Our Redeemer's players as the team won the Region 3 Championship game while the Bishop Ryan fans are frozen in time in the stands as they were only seconds and three points from swapping places with their Our Redeemer's players and fans on the court.

The 2024-2025 Division B Region 3 Boys Basketball Tournament had the final two games on Thursday, March 13, at the Minot Auditorium. 

The chance to play in the 2025 NDHSAA Division B Boys Basketball State Tournament was on the line as the Velva Aggies faced the Westhope-Newburg Sioux for third place and Our Redeemer's Knights battled Bishop Ryan Lions in the title match. The state tournament is scheduled for March 20-22, 2025 at the MSU Dome.

The winner of the championship has a straight shot to the state tournament while the second and third place finishers will participate in state qualifying games on Saturday, March 15, at the Minot Auditorium.

D6-1 Our Redeemers 66, D6-2 Bishop Ryan 63

There is plenty of history between the Knights from Our Redeemer's and the Lions from Bishop Ryan. The Division B Region 3 Championship game between the two on Thursday, March 13, was the fourth meeting of the year.

The Lions won the first meeting 64-58 on December 21 at the Our Redeemer's boys tournament and Bishop Ryan won the second meeting on the road in the regular season meeting 58-51 at the Castle. 

But the third meeting on March 4 was for the District 6 Championship and the Knights took that win 62-57 for the higher seeding coming into the Region 3 tournament. 

None of the previous games were as exciting as the Region 3 Championship that needed and overtime period and heroics for the Knights to even the yearly tally with their second win in two weeks over the raucous Lions. 

Our Redeemer's started the game with the edge in momentum despite both teams having first quarter jitters with missed shots and turnovers. The Knights did just enough to hold the 14-13 lead to start the second quarter of play.

Roughly half way through the second quarter of play, the Lions found a groove and began to pull away and led 28-23 at the half.

The third quarter started where the second left off with the Lions holding the slight edge in momentum. The inside attack for Bishop Ryan began to wear down the Knights defense. The five point lead was carved down over the third to a 35-31 lead with one quarter to play. 

The Lions and the Knights traded baskets and scoring to start the fourth quarter of play. At one point the gap was two points. With 5:21 to play, Bishop Ryan had swapped two 3-point shots for 2-point baskets and held the 44-38 lead.

The game battled back and forth with the Lions holding a five point lead with less than 40-seconds to play. The Knights hit a layup, then stole the inbounds pass and scored another layup – along with a foul to go to the line to tie the game with 17-seconds left to play. The free throw was good, the game was tied at 56-56 and overtime was needed.

Our Redeemer's was led by Wyatt Weekley with 25 points while Nolan Schmidt had 20 in the win- none more important than the last layup and free throw in regulation. Payten Lindbo scored ten in the win.

Bishop Ryan was led by Jett Lundeen with 18, including a 3-point shot from NBA range for the Lions in the fourth quarter of play. Ramsey Walz added 16 and Jack Passa hit for 12 in the effort. 

D6-3 Westhope-Newburg 62, D6-4 Velva 51

In the only meeting between the two teams in January this year, the Sioux hosted the Aggies and defended their home court with an 83-64 win. The third place game was much closer, but Westhope-Newburg made too many 3-point shots in the end for the win and the chance to play into the state tournament. 

The Aggies started the game by controlling the tipoff and the Sioux turned themselves loose on Velva. Westhope-Newburg never looked overwhelmed and played with a patience that many seniors still have not learned to do.

Neither team scored for just over two minutes. The Sioux found the basket sooner than the Aggies. Westhope-Newburg used the favorable time at the half to work over the states for each contest.

Westhope-Newburg worked to end the first quarter of play, competitively with each team working on their own tempo and game style. The Sioux led xx-xx to start the second quarter of play. 

Westhope-Newburg applied a full court, man press to start the second quarter of play. Both teams began to find the basket with the Sioux hitting more 3-point shots than the Aggies. 

Westhope-Newburg led 34-25 at the half.

Velva charged out the gate to start the third quarter with the first points as well as more energy. Every time the Aggies began to chip away at the lead, the Sioux would hit a shot to keep the edge. With 3:39 to play, the Westhope-Newburg lead was down to 36-34 in the third.

Adjustments were made and the Sioux had the momentum shift back to end the third quarter with Velva in foul trouble. The Westhope-Newburg lead was 47-37 to start the final eight minutes of the game. Velva was never able to gain the ground in the fourth quarter.

The Sioux were led by Walker Braaten with 17 points in the win. Braden Bailey added 15 points while Will Artz added 11 for Westhope-Newburg. Dayton Hawkins and Hunter Tolstad each added eight points. 

Velva was led by Ben Schepp with 18 points while Cooper Kittleson and Mason McPeak each added ten in the effort for the Aggies. Reggie Bruner also added eight points for Velva

The Power Within: The Kyiv Independent's first-ever magazine. Be among the first to get it.

Russia has begun using cryptocurrencies in oil transactions with China and India to circumvent Western sanctions, Reuters reported on March 14, citing four sources familiar with the matter.

The cryptocurrency scheme currently represents a small fraction of Russia's $192 billion annual oil trade, according to the International Energy Agency, but its usage is reportedly increasing. 

According to the report, Chinese and Indian buyers of Russian oil pay intermediary trading firms in yuan or rupees. 

The funds are then deposited into offshore accounts, converted into Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Tether stablecoins, and withdrawn to another account before being exchanged for rubles in Russia.

Reuters' sources suggested that Russia will likely continue using digital currencies in energy trade even if Western sanctions are lifted, citing the speed and flexibility of cryptocurrency transactions. 

Meanwhile, China's state-owned oil companies are reportedly reducing purchases of Russian crude due to concerns over U.S. sanctions, Reuters reported, citing industry sources. 

The move comes as the Trump administration on March 13 declined to renew an exemption that previously allowed Russian banks to access U.S. payment systems for energy transactions.

The decision is expected to complicate Russian oil purchases and could contribute to higher global energy prices.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'Kyiv Independent'}"

Oops, something went wrong

The new year started off with considerable fanfare for the cryptocurrency market. Under President Donald Trump's crypto plan, America was going to become ""the crypto capital of the world."" That meant deregulating the crypto market, promoting innovative uses for blockchain technology within the financial markets, and becoming a Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) superpower.

Those promises mostly have been kept. The White House even hosted a Crypto Summit on March 7. But broader macroeconomic weakness -- in the form of tariffs and recession fears -- have sent crypto markets tumbling. Cryptocurrencies are down across the board, so it's hard to tell what's hot, and what's not. So let's take a closer look at key Trump priorities for crypto.

The three hottest crypto sectors right now are decentralized finance (DeFi), real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and stablecoins. The easiest way to see this is by examining the crypto portfolio of World Liberty Financial, the Trump-affiliated crypto company that uses the tag line, ""Shape a New Era of Finance."" It went on a highly publicized crypto buying spree ahead of the inauguration as a show of support for Trump's crypto plan.

Currently, some of the biggest holdings of World Liberty Financial include Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), Chainlink (CRYPTO: LINK), Ondo, Aave, and Ethena. The company also holds two stablecoins: Tether and USDC. All of these holdings, in one way or another, reflect a core idea of Trump's crypto plan: creating new linkages between the world of traditional finance and the world of decentralized finance.

Decentralized finance really just refers to putting the traditional financial system on blockchain rails. Once you have a Layer-1 blockchain like Ethereum, it's possible to build on top of it. You can create new decentralized exchanges for trading digital assets. You can create new ways to borrow and earn money. And you can create enormous value by reducing the inefficiencies of the modern financial system.

Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization is one of the hottest trends on Wall Street right now, and it's supported by top asset managers such as BlackRock. Tokenization refers to the transformation of traditional assets (such as stocks and bonds) into digital assets that can be traded on the blockchain. Once you do that, you can create new efficiencies and open up markets to new participants. For example, it's now possible to tokenize very illiquid assets (such as private equity and real estate) and put it all on the blockchain in the form of tradable crypto tokens.

It might be hard to believe that stablecoins are hot right now. After all, they are pegged 1-to-1 to the U.S. dollar, so they are supposed to trade for $1 at all times. You really can't speculate in stablecoins (unless you're betting that they will lose their peg), and many investors might not want to hold an asset like USDC or Tether that trades for $1 day in and day out.

But as Coinbase Global recently pointed out, stablecoins might just end up being the biggest story of the year for crypto. The Trump crypto plan calls for using stablecoins as the way to guarantee that the U.S. dollar remains the top reserve currency in the world.

To buy stablecoins, you need dollars. And right now, dollars are pouring into stablecoins at an unprecedented rate. The top five stablecoins now have a total market cap of more than $200 billion.

Three not-so-hot cryptocurrency sectors include meme coins, artificial intelligence (AI), and anything related to consumer-facing applications of blockchain technology (such as gaming, Web3, and the metaverse).

Remember the last crypto bull market rally? Prices of meme coins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu were skyrocketing in value. Celebrities were spending millions of dollars to buy non-fungible tokens (NFTs) from the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection. And people were buying digital real estate in the metaverse as a way of getting rich quick.

Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your point of view), that type of speculative froth is unlikely to return anytime soon. The new Official Trump meme coin is down about 85% from its highs, nobody is buying expensive NFTs when the threat of recession is looming, and early attempts to combine AI and crypto -- such as by creating the brand-new position of White House AI & crypto czar -- have thus far been very low-key.

Still not convinced that consumer-facing crypto sectors are out of favor? Just search for images of the White House Crypto Summit that took place on March 7. The event looks unlike any crypto event you've ever seen. One iconic image from The New York Times looks like a formal Wall Street board meeting: The participants are dressed in dark business suits and ties, clapping politely, and sitting at a long, drab table under a gold chandelier and the watchful eye of Abraham Lincoln.

At this point, you're probably wondering: Why haven't you mentioned Bitcoin? For one, Bitcoin is not a sector, it's a single asset. And second, the Trump crypto plan is primarily focused on economic competitiveness and financial innovation. The stated goal is to ""Make America Great Again.""

To the extent that Bitcoin can help to accomplish that goal, it's important. For example, if it can help to strengthen the U.S. dollar, boost investor confidence in the American economy, help to pay down the nation's $36 trillion debt load, or bring new jobs to America, then it's important.

For now, though, it's perhaps more important to understand how the worlds of traditional finance and blockchain finance fit together, and what that means for America's financial future. I'm convinced that this is the key to figuring out which under-the-radar cryptocurrencies are the best investment opportunities right now.

Users searching for pirated software are the target of a new malware campaign that delivers a previously undocumented clipper malware called MassJacker, according to findings from CyberArk.

Clipper malware is a type of cryware (as coined by Microsoft) that's designed to monitor a victim's clipboard content and facilitate cryptocurrency theft by substituting copied cryptocurrency wallet addresses with an attacker-controlled one so as to reroute them to the adversary instead of the intended target.

""The infection chain begins at a site called pesktop[.]com,"" security researcher Ari Novick said in an analysis published earlier this week. ""This site, which presents itself as a site to get pirated software, also tries to get people to download all sorts of malware.""

The initial executable acts as a conduit to run a PowerShell script that delivers a botnet malware named Amadey, as well as two other .NET binaries, each compiled for 32- and 64-bit architecture.

The binary, codenamed PackerE, is responsible for downloading an encrypted DLL, which, in turn, loads a second DLL file that launches the MassJacker payload by injecting it into a legitimate Windows process called ""InstalUtil.exe.""

The encrypted DLL incorporates features that enhance its evasion and anti-analysis ability, including Just-In-Time (JIT) hooking, metadata token mapping to conceal function calls, and a custom virtual machine to interpret commands as opposed to running regular .NET code.

MassJacker, for its part, comes with its own anti-debugging checks and a configuration to retrieve all the regular expression patterns for flagging cryptocurrency wallet addresses in the clipboard. It also contacts a remote server to download files containing the list of wallets under the threat actor's control.

""MassJacker creates an event handler to run whenever the victim copies anything,"" Novick said. ""The handler checks the regexes, and if it finds a match, it replaces the copied content with a wallet belonging to the threat actor from the downloaded list.""

CyberArk said it identified over 778,531 unique addresses belonging to the attackers, with only 423 of them containing funds totaling approximately $95,300. But the total amount of digital assets held in all these wallets prior to them being transferred out stands at around $336,700.

What's more, cryptocurrency worth about $87,000 (600 SOL) has been found parked in a single wallet, with over 350 transactions funneling money into the wallet from different addresses. 

Exactly who is behind MassJacker is unknown, although a deeper examination of the source code has identified overlaps with another malware known as MassLogger, which has also leveraged JIT hooking in an attempt to resist analysis efforts.

MENTOR, Ohio — Police in Mentor report scams targeting seniors are at an all-time high. 

Good Morning Cleveland anchor Mike Brookbank spoke to Lt. Rich Slovenkay about the increase. 

Slovenkay said detectives receive scam reports two to three times each week. 

One Mentor woman lost more than $660,000 in a cryptocurrency scam. The scheme started with an unsolicited text message.

""The person who sent that text developed a friendship with that person, earned their trust and convinced that victim to invest in their fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme, and she lost a large amount of money,"" said Slovenkay.

Investment scams, including those involving cryptocurrency, are the riskiest, according to a new report from the Better Business Bureau. 

Slovenkay said the best way to protect yourself is to know the signs of a scam.

""If someone's calling with a sense of urgency and saying you have to act right now and keeping you on the phone, they have to know that's a red flag and to hang up and verify this information before they send any money anywhere,"" said Slovenkay.

If you or someone you know is impacted by a scam, report the incident immediately. While recovering money is rare, early reporting increases the odds.

REX Shares has launched a first-of-its-kind convertible-bonds exchange-traded fund (ETF), allowing investors exposure to the convertible debt issued by corporates to add bitcoin to their balance sheet.

Called the REX Bitcoin Corporate Treasury Convertible Bond ETF (BMAX), the fund is necessarily mostly made up of convertible paper issued by Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR), by far the largest issuer of such debt. Other top 10 holdings include the convertible notes of bitcoin miners Marathon Digital (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT).

“Until now, these bonds have been difficult for individual investors to reach,” said Greg King, CEO of Rex Financial, in a statement. “BMAX removes those barriers, making it easier to invest in the strategy pioneered by Michael Saylor — leveraging corporate debt to acquire Bitcoin as a treasury asset.”

The fund officially launched today, and trades on the Nasdaq. It has a gross expense ratio of 0.85% and was seeded with $25 million in assets.

Shares of the ETF are higher in early trading as bitcoin has rallied from an overnight low of around $80,000 to above $84,000.

In the latest episode of the Coinstories podcast hosted by Nathalie Brunell, James Seyffart, a research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, outlined why the next significant surge of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) adoption is likely to come from major wirehouses, such as UBS, Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch. These large institutions, which typically manage the portfolios of high-net-worth individuals, have not yet broadly recommended Bitcoin ETFs—but Seyffart believes that when they do, it could spark a momentous wave in the market.

Discussing the unprecedented success of spot ETFs since they began trading in 2024, Seyffart drew a comparison to gold ETFs launched decades prior. In his words: “My favorite chart of this is if you just look at the gold ETF asset growth over time… Bitcoin ETFs blow away everything you can possibly look at. Even if you adjust inflation-adjust, it doesn't matter.”

He explained how the most widely traded spot Bitcoin ETF—BlackRock's IBIT—rapidly approached the asset size of older gold ETFs, underscoring how quickly it gathered investor funds. At its January peak of around $122–123 billion in assets, Bitcoin ETFs were nearing the roughly $130 billion held by early-mover gold ETFs launched in 2004. “IBIT is the fastest ETF to $50 billion as an entire category,” Seyffart noted, emphasizing that the fund met this threshold in a matter of a couple of hundred days. “The previous record was over a thousand days.”

Although the strength of BTC's price performance helped amplify the total assets under management, Seyffart stressed that the capital inflows themselves were striking. He cited the peak at about “just over $40 billion” of inflows in under a year, with overall spot ETF assets still hovering at more than $100 billion.

While a variety of spot Bitcoin ETFs exist, with numerous asset managers launching their own funds, IBIT has “truly run away” in terms of both assets and liquidity, according to Seyffart. He detailed how funds from Fidelity (FBTC), Grayscale (GBTC), Ark Invest, Bitwise, and VanEck all remain profitable, but none comes close to matching IBIT's daily trading volume and market depth.

Citing 13F filings—forms certain institutional investors must file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission—Seyffart said that as of late 2024, approximately 25% of ETF holdings can be directly attributed to institutions that meet the filing criteria. He further explained that hedge funds appear to be the single largest identifiable group among those filers: “The biggest holders, ironically enough, are hedge funds… $10 plus billion worth of these things.”

A significant portion of hedge fund interest, according to Seyffart, comes from a “basis trade,” a near-arbitrage strategy in which managers buy the spot Bitcoin ETF while simultaneously shorting the futures market. Because bitcoin futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) can carry a premium, traders seek to pocket the spread when the futures contract settles.

He described this approach as “delta neutral,” meaning it does not outright push Bitcoin's price higher or lower: “It's basically risk-free… You're selling forward the futures contracts because there's a persistent premium and offsetting that with the ETFs. So it shouldn't really impact price in some massive way.”

According to Seyffart, wirehouses and other top-tier wealth managers control trillions in assets, and many of them have yet to systematically offer or recommend Bitcoin ETFs. Current protocol at some of these firms allows clients to request Bitcoin ETF purchases, but does not permit advisors to recommend them proactively. “If you say, ‘You're my advisor and I want you to put 2% in Bitcoin,' in most cases they can do that. But they're not allowed to come to you and say, ‘I recommend it,'” Seyffart noted, referencing how many major brokerages classify Bitcoin-focused investing.

He emphasized that this restriction is likely to ease over time. As soon as the largest wirehouses and brokerages more widely approve of or officially recommend BTC ETF positions—such as a “2% or 5% satellite portion” of a typical portfolio—Bitcoin ETF adoption could surge to new levels.

Seyffart stated: “The next big wave of adoption is […] corporations possibly buying [Bitcoin], obviously nations and states potentially adding this to their balance sheets, is another big thing. But for the ETF side of things, it's really those wirehouses and advisers; they control trillions of dollars of assets, like they're the people who manage the money of really wealthy people.”

He added the wirehouses “control the money of centimillionaires, billionaires, you name it—and they are potentially the next wave of adoption for these Bitcoin ETFs,” adding “the ETFs had an absolutely unbelievable first year. We at Bloomberg were pretty bullish; we were more bullish than pretty much any other traditional financial research arm. Not quite as bullish as some of the real, true Bitcoin believers and bulls, but they even blew us out of the water with what they've done.”

Ultimately, the Bloomberg Intelligence analyst believes that once America's largest wirehouses uniformly endorse and recommend Bitcoin ETFs—rather than merely allow them upon client request—the sector could witness “the next big wave” of adoption. With billions of dollars flowing from institutional and high-net-worth portfolios, that wave may well eclipse the record-breaking launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs that took place in 2024.

At press time, BTC traded at $81,901.

REX Shares debuted an exchange-trade fund on Friday providing exposure to Strategy's convertible bonds, a form of debt the ETF issuer said was hard to access for most investors.

The REX Bitcoin Corporate Treasury Convertible Bond ETF (BMAX) provides exposure to debt from three U.S. companies. However, REX said in a press release that the fund is “highly concentrated” in products offered by Strategy, the world's largest corporate holder of Bitcoin.

Since Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, issued its first batch of convertible senior notes in 2020, REX Financial CEO Greg King said in a statement that retail investors and investment advisors have lacked the same opportunities as institutional investors to access these products.

“Until now, these bonds have been difficult for individual investors to reach,” he said. “BMAX removes those barriers making it easier to invest in the strategy pioneered by Michael Saylor.”

The fund debuted on the Nasdaq with $24.8 million in assets, according to REX's website. Aside from Strategy's convertible notes, which account for 81% of the fund's exposure, the fund contains similar products issued by Bitcoin miners Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms.

Convertible senior notes are bonds that can be converted into shares by an investor if the associated company's stock price rises above a certain market price.

The fund is actively managed, and REX said it may invest up to 20% of its assets in equities issued by companies that leverage Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. Those could be purchased on a secondary market or stem from converting convertible bonds.

REX has issued ETFs centered on Strategy before. The company currently offers leveraged ETFs providing 2x long or short exposure to Strategy's stock.

It has also filed for several spot crypto ETFs. Most recently the company filed for an ETF that would provide exposure to the price of MOVE, an Ethereum layer-2 scaling network that just launched its mainnet earlier this week.

REX is racing to offer products for meme coins as well, including President Donald Trump's meme coin on Solana, BONK, and Dogecoin.

Oops, something went wrong

We recently published a list of 13 Best Cryptocurrency Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) stands against other best cryptocurrency stocks to buy now.

Cryptocurrency stocks are on the move in the aftermath of US President Donald Trump announcing plans for a “Crypto Strategic Reserve.” The possibility of a cryptocurrency reserve is a significant step toward Trump's goal of making the United States the global center of cryptocurrency.

The United States already possesses several strategic stockpiles, such as medical and military assets. In times of need, the government draws from these unique reserves. To keep the Federal Reserve afloat, the government would probably be actively purchasing and disposing of cryptocurrencies as part of the strategic reserve push.

“This move signals a shift toward active participation in the crypto economy by the U.S. government,” said Federico Brokate, head of U.S. business at 21Shares, a digital assets investment management firm. “It has the potential to accelerate institutional adoption, provide greater regulatory clarity, and strengthen the U.S.'s leadership in digital asset innovation.”

Additionally, some Bitcoin holders think that a cryptocurrency reserve may act as an inflation hedge. They contend that at times of global economic crisis, the value of Bitcoin may surpass that of the dollar, citing the currency's declining worth over time. However, cryptocurrencies have shown to be highly volatile during recent geopolitical events, like Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, some experts believe that the US government purchasing Bitcoin could endanger the dollar's standing internationally.

Critics contend that cryptocurrency is a speculative investment and has historically been volatile, while proponents claim that the proceeds may be used to pay down the country's massive debt. Approximately 200,000 Bitcoin tokens are thought to be held in the United States due to illegal seizures. The total value of that exceeds $17 billion. With a reserve, these holdings might be expanded to include three lesser-known cryptocurrencies, XRP, Solana, and Cardano, in addition to Ethereum.

Amid the “crypto strategic reserve” push, cryptocurrency stocks' popularity is growing as investors explore ways of diversifying their investment portfolio beyond traditional asset classes. The stocks stand out partly because they offer crypto exposure without requiring one to own the underlying volatile crypto asset. Additionally, the stocks provide both growth potential and innovation. Many experts regard them as being safer than direct cryptocurrency investments.

To determine the 13 best cryptocurrency stocks to buy now, we analyzed the US market for companies with exposure to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Our in-depth analysis focused on firms with solid prospects due to their investments in cryptocurrencies and the underlying technology. We reviewed ETFs and financial media reports to compile a preliminary list. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on the hedge fund stakes in them during Q4 2024.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) operates a technology platform that enables digital payments for merchants and consumers worldwide. The company has sought to strengthen its growth prospects by pursuing opportunities in the crypto space. As it pursues its goal of making it easier for people to use cryptocurrencies in everyday commerce, it is emerging as one of the best stocks to own to gain exposure in the burgeoning sector.

In an effort to broaden its customer offerings, PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) began allowing merchants to purchase, hold, and sell cryptocurrency from their business accounts late last year. With the most users of any peer-to-peer money movement app, Venmo could become a leading cryptocurrency platform with its new feature. It serves as a solid access point for investors who wish to buy significant cryptocurrencies and then use them to purchase Altcoins or access decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

For quicker, less expensive transactions, its stablecoin, PYUSD, which was first introduced on Ethereum, was extended to Solana. Additionally, PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) collaborates with more than 25 businesses to further incorporate PYUSD into the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Overall, PYPL ranks 1st on our list of best cryptocurrency stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of PYPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PYPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Russia is turning to bitcoin and crypto to facilitate oil trades with China and India, circumventing sanctions imposed on Ukraine. 

Amid ongoing sanctions over the war in Ukraine, Russia has turned to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to facilitate some of its oil trade with major buyers China and India.

According to a Reuters report, Russian oil companies and traders increasingly conduct transactions in bitcoin and crypto, allowing them to circumvent restrictions from Western nations. Sources say monthly trade volumes are already in the tens of millions of dollars.

JUST IN: 🇷🇺 Russia is using #Bitcoin and crypto in its oil trade with China and India to skirt Western sanctions: Reuters pic.twitter.com/Ld99WAQ1WQ

The mechanism involves Chinese or Indian buyers purchasing oil and depositing yuan or rupees into an offshore account owned by a middleman company. The middleman then converts the fiat currency into crypto and transfers it to an account in Russia, where it is exchanged into rubles.

While crypto-based oil payments are still a fraction of Russia's $192 billion total oil trade, the practice is growing as sanctions bite. The trend highlights the utility of bitcoin and crypto in enabling transaction settlement for sanctioned nations. Iran and Venezuela have adopted similar crypto strategies. Bitcoin and crypto's censorship resistance allows value transfer beyond the reach of sanctions.

In late 2024, Russia's finance minister publicly endorsed using crypto in foreign trade. The Kremlin sees bitcoin and crypto as one of several effective strategies to overcome financial penalties imposed over the invasion of Ukraine. The Bank of Russia also recently proposed legalizing crypto investments for wealthy citizens.

However, Russia's oil trade still relies primarily on fiat currencies. President Donald Trump's administration is debating whether to ease some restrictions to improve relations with Moscow.

With the Ukraine conflict still unresolved, Russia's pivot toward leveraging bitcoin and decentralized technologies appears to aim to reduce its reliance on traditional finance and dollar settlements. Other countries under U.S. sanctions are likely to be monitored closely.

March 14, 2025 - Washington, D.C. - On Thursday, Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, Ranking Member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sent a letter to United States Department of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urging the Department to cease all attempts to create a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, citing President Trump's glaring conflicts of interest. 

“I write regarding President Trump's recent executive order on the creation of a strategic reserve for cryptocurrency—an asset class that Mr. Trump initially wrote off as a ‘scam.'  Such a reserve provides no discernible benefit to the American people but would significantly enrich the President and his donors.  It would also constitute unsound fiscal policy by picking winners among currencies via social media and wasting taxpayer dollars on a plan that one federal reserve official described as ‘the dumbest idea' ever.  I urge you to cease all attempts to create the strategic cryptocurrency reserve,” wrote Ranking Member Connolly. 

The letter follows President Trump's announcement on Truth Social of plans to create a cryptocurrency reserve including Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano as part of the Administration's January 23, 2025, Executive Order titled “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology,” as well as President Trump's March 6, 2025 Executive Order on the “Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile.”

In his letter, the Ranking Member notes that at no point during the process of instituting such a cryptocurrency reserve has the President consulted with Congress, nor has the President indicated his intention to seek congressional authorization to create the strategic reserve. 

Ranking Member Connolly highlighted President Trump's conflicts of interest in this endeavor, including: 

“The creation of a strategic cryptocurrency reserve is poised to enrich the President and his closest allies at the expense of American taxpayers.  I urge you to cease all plans to create a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, and request that you provide a briefing to the staff of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,”  concluded Ranking Member Connolly. 

The Ranking Member also requested answers to his questions no later than March 27, 2025.

TALLINN, Estonia, March  14, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- XRP investors are elated as the popular cryptocurrency surged past the key $2.30 mark this week, significantly outperforming Bitcoin's modest recovery.

As of Friday, XRP has gained over 5%, reaching $2.33, while Bitcoin climbed around 4% to $83,428. This rebound reflects growing optimism among investors, especially amid reports suggesting a favorable resolution of Ripple Labs' ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

However, savvy crypto investors aren't just banking on XRP alone—they've already set their sights on XRPTurbo, an innovative AI-powered launchpad designed to transform the DeFi landscape on the XRP Ledger (XRPL).

XRPTurbo: Redefining DeFi with AI and Real-World Assets

XRPTurbo has quickly emerged as one of the hottest topics within the XRP community, having filled it's softcap and has gone ahead to raise over 80,000 XRP in just days after its presale launch—a strong indicator of investor confidence.

Limited-Time Opportunity for Early Investors

With XRPTurbo rapidly gaining traction in the XRP community, early participants have a rare chance to secure $XRT tokens at preferential presale pricing.

After the presale concludes, the token will list on multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs) paired directly with XRP, promising increased liquidity and immediate exposure to the broader crypto market.

Bitcoin price remained constrained within a tight 8% channel between $76,000 and $84,472 this week. With conflicting market catalysts preventing prolonged directional swings, here are key factors that moved BTC prices this week, as well as key indicators to watch in the weeks ahead. 

Bitcoin (BTC) faces considerable volatility this week. With conflicting market signals counteracting short-term, traders were unable to establish any dominant directional trend across the crypto markets this week.  





Bitcoin price action | BTCUSD Weekly Chart | Source: TradingView

The current price chart shows BTC  trading above the $83,300 mark on Friday. In relative terms: Bitcoin is posting 3% gains for the week, rising from the opening price of around $80,700 on Sunday. 

This represents a significant recovery compared to last week when United States President Donald Trump's confirmation of trade tariffs on Canada and Mexico had triggered an 8% sell-off with over $900 million in liquidations. 

In other notable price movements this week, Bitcoin prices briefly plunged below the $80,000 support for three consecutive days between Tuesday and Thursday. 

Bitcoin price may face weaker support if prices plunge that low in the coming week, as recent retests may have prompted traders to adjust their stop losses or close out long positions to avoid losses from the next retest. 

The Trump trade war narrative intensified this week, with Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promising retaliatory measures.

Heading into the week, global markets were on edge due to inflation risks in the initial US Nonarm Payrolls data released last Friday.

However, those fears eased momentarily after the US CPI and PPI data showed easing inflation metrics this week.

Historically, Bitcoin demand surges when markets anticipate less hawkish Fed decisions, but current macro pressures surrounding the trade war are suppressing risk appetite, especially among retail traders. 

Bitcoin ETFs saw $143 million in outflows on Thursday, following $13 million in inflows on Wednesday—the first positive flows since the start of March.

In total, investors withdrew another $830 million this week, bringing total outflows in March to $1.7 billion.

Persistent ETF sell-offs continue to fuel short-term volatility in Bitcoin prices as uncertainty around the US trade war and Trump's crypto strategic reserve proposal unsettles investors. 

Florida governor candidate Byron Donalds is preparing to introduce legislation to codify Donald Trump's executive order establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, Bloomberg reported on Friday.

The bill aims to prevent future administrations from overturning Trump's policy, which allows the US Treasury to hold 200,000 Bitcoin and prohibits the sale of reserve Bitcoin. Donalds positioned the move as a defense against what he calls the Democrats' “war on crypto.”

The bill faces significant hurdles, requiring 60 votes in the Senate and a majority in the House of Representatives to advance. 

Texas lawmakers have introduced HB 4258, a legislative proposal to allocate $250 million from the state's economic stabilization fund to Bitcoin and other digital assets.

The bill follows SB 778, which recently gained bipartisan support in the Texas Senate. If enacted, HB 4258 would take effect in 2025 and allow municipalities and counties to invest up to $10 million in digital assets.

The overhang of multiple bearish macro pressures means that Bitcoin price remains at major downside risks despite 3% gains this week. 

On the positive side, crypto bettors on prediction market platforms Polymarkets anticipate a Fed rate pause next week, while others are counting on easing geopolitical pressure between Russia and Ukraine.

Polymarket bettors price in 99% chance of a Fed rate cut pause in March, with odds on Russia-Ukraine ceasefire nearing 80%.

If these expectations materialize, improved risk appetite could drive renewed inflows into Bitcoin and crypto assets, supporting further upside momentum next week.

Bitcoin price is trading at $84,833.67 after posting 5% gains the week.

However, with BTC yet to recoup last week's 8% losses, technical indicators show that bulls are not in complete dominance of the markets. 

First, the Parabolic SAR dots remain above the current BTC price, indicating bearish momentum.

Likewise, the Bollinger Bands show tightening volatility, with resistance at $110,676 and support near $76,505.



Bitcoin Price Forecast | BTCUSD Weekly Chart

If delayed Fed rate hike and easing geopolitical tensions between Ukraine and Russia ease up, Bitcoin price must break above the mid-Bollinger Band at $93,591, it could signal a return to bullish momentum. 

Conversely, a bearish breakdown could see Bitcoin testing the lower Bollinger Band at $76,505.

Increased sell volume, as seen in recent weeks, suggests a risk of deeper downside. In this scenario, a close below $75,000 could accelerate selling pressure, leading to a potential retest of $68K or lower.

Cryptocurrencies sector rose by 0.13% in early European trading on Friday, adding $352 million in aggregate valuation. With BNB, OKB and BGB attracting demand amid intense market volatility, the exchange-based native tokens sector added $1.9 billion.

The US SEC is considering declaring XRP as a commodity in the ongoing settlement talks with Ripple Labs. FOX News reports suggest Ethereum's regulatory status remains a key reference for XRP's litigation verdict.

Cardano price stabilized above $0.70 after posting another 5% decline in its 3rd consecutive losing day. Multiple ADA derivatives trading signals are leaning bullish, but the US trade war impact outweighs the positive shift in inflation indices.

        Share    

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have remained in a strong downtrend this year, shedding over $1 trillion in value. 

Bitcoin (BTC) has crashed from the year-to-date high of $109,300 to $82,000, while popular altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA) have had deeper dives. 

Crypto prices have fallen due to rising fear in the financial markets. The crypto fear and greed index has dropped to the extreme fear zone of 19. Similarly, the fear gauge tracked by CNN Money has dropped to 20.

The main catalyst for this sell-off is growing concern that the United States is heading toward a self-inflicted recession due to Donald Trump's tariffs. 

These fears have outweighed positive news in the crypto industry. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission has ended numerous lawsuits affecting companies like Uniswap, Kraken, and Coinbase. 

Further, Donald Trump has signed an executive order to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital coins stockpile. Also, more institutional investors like Citadel, Blackrock, Rumble, and Trump Media have started to acquire Bitcoin.

Bitcoin and altcoins could face further declines if the S&P 500 index forms a death cross pattern — a technical formation that occurs when the 50-day and 200-day moving averages cross each other. This pattern often signals the start of a prolonged bear market.

The spread between the 50-day and 200-day weighted moving averages (WMA) of the S&P 500 index has continued to narrow. The 50-day WMA is at $5,900, while the 200-day WMA is at $5,857. A crossover would likely lead to further downside, as the index dropped 23% the last time it formed this pattern in 2022.

The S&P 500 index is often seen as a reliable indicator for the crypto market since both are considered risky assets and tend to move in correlation.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin's price has already formed a death cross, with the 50-day and 200-day moving averages crossing each other. This cross happened after Bitcoin dropped below key support at $89,000 — the neckline of the double-top pattern at $108,500. A double top is one of the most bearish patterns in technical analysis.

Therefore, the most likely scenario is that Bitcoin drops to either $73,722 or $68,960 before bouncing back. The initial target is the highest swing in March last year, while the second is the highest point in November 2021.

A potential catalyst that may prevent further S&P 500 and crypto market crash is the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision next week. A more dovish tone as the US dollar index and the bond market suggests would likely lead to a rebound.

Sellers of risk assets are taking a breather on Friday, with crypto markets posting sizable gains along with U.S. stocks after a week of lame price action.

Bitcoin topped $85,000 at one point during U.S. hours and is now trading at $84,400, up 4.7% over the past 24 hours. All cryptos in the CoinDesk 20 Index were higher during the same period, with Chainlink's LINK, Solana's SOL and SUI leading gains.

The price action happened as risk appetite returned to traditional markets as well. The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq indexes were 1.7% and 2.3 up, respectively. Meanwhile, gold, whose price action trounced that of bitcoin during the selling of the past few weeks, backed down below $3,000 after crossing the level yesterday for the first time in its history.



""To see the market bouncing off these recent lows is most likely a combination of the macro news around risk assets (inflation/tariffs) and a sign that a more stable base for cryptocurrencies is coming into place given the drawdowns from the top just months ago,” Paul Howard, senior director of crypto trading firm Wincent, said in a Telegram note.

Some $2.6 billion in leveraged crypto derivatives positions have been liquidated over the past 7 days, predominantly longs, Howard pointed out, leaving the market on a healthier footing with flushing excessive leverage.



Today's bounce also propelled BTC back above its 200-day moving average after dipping below that trendline for the first time since last August's crypto correction. The 200-day moving average is a widely-used benchmark for traders and investors to gauge long-term trends for asset prices, often serving as support for prices to bounce in a bull market, while losing the level providing a risk-off or bear market signal.

Closing the day above the moving average, currently at $83,767, would be a win for bulls, fueling hopes that the worst of the correction might be over for now. Otherwise, confirming the moving average as resistance could foreshadow a deeper pullback.





Well-followed cross-asset trader Bob Loukas noted that bitcoin and stocks have more room to run ""at least for a while,"" bouncing from oversold levels. ""Feels like should be close to end of panic, for now at least, and spend at least a few weeks back recovering,"" he said earlier this week. ""Then the market reassess.""

While oil firms embrace digital currencies, Russia's digital ruble initiative faces delays and technical hurdles.

Russia has started using crypto for oil trades with China and India as it seeks to bypass Western sanctions, Reuters reported on March 14, citing sources familiar with the matter.

According to the report, some Russian oil companies have settled trades in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins like Tether's USDT. This strategy simplifies the conversion of Chinese Yuan and Indian Rupees into Russian Rubles, enabling smoother transactions despite financial restrictions.

Typically, a Chinese buyer deposits Yuan into an offshore account controlled by an intermediary. The funds are then converted into crypto and transferred through multiple accounts before reaching a final destination in Russia, where they are exchanged for Rubles.

These transactions reportedly reach tens of millions of dollars per month.

Although crypto adoption in Russia's oil trade remains limited, it is part of a broader trend. Over the past year, the country has introduced new regulations governing crypto mining, taxation, and international trade.

Western sanctions imposed over Russia's military actions in Ukraine have accelerated this shift toward digital assets. However, industry sources suggest oil firms may continue using cryptocurrencies even if sanctions are lifted due to their efficiency and transaction speed.

While Russia increases its reliance on crypto for trade, its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project is facing significant hurdles.

Last month, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina announced an indefinite delay in the launch of the digital ruble. She attributed the setback to the need for further refinements to ensure that the currency benefits all stakeholders.

However, a recent survey indicates that the digital ruble launch was postponed due to the inadequate IT infrastructure of banks that were expected to handle the project.

The survey of Russian banking experts revealed that 30% of financial institutions are not yet prepared to support the digital ruble. Experts explained that implementing the CBDC requires banks to upgrade their IT systems to handle increased transaction volumes.

Meanwhile, 20% of banking IT specialists stated that their systems are fully equipped for the digital ruble. Another 50% said they are partially prepared but need further upgrades.

At the same time, around 14% of the respondents expressed concerns over potential information security risks associated with the currency.

Given these challenges, Russia's national digital asset initiative could face further obstacles unless major financial institutions fully prepare for its adoption.

Ethereum is preparing for its Pectra upgrade, which aims to boost the network's scalability and offer better staking flexibility, by launching a testnet on Monday codenamed Hoodi. This comes after two previous testnets, Holesky and Sepolia, encountered technical issues.

If all goes to plan, it could hit mainnet as early as April 25.

The second largest cryptocurrency's price appears unmoved by this news. Over the past 24 hours, the Ethereum price has gained only 0.5% and is currently trading at just over $1,900, according to CoinGecko data. Zooming out, ETH has lost 13.3% in the past week amid macro pressures from President Trump's trade war.

The Pectra uprade will be the third upgrade to the network since The Merge in 2022, which saw Ethereum move from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake. Pectra looks to boost Ethereum's scalability, efficiency, and staking flexibility as it expands storage capacity for layer-2 networks. It'll reduce fees, too.

Previous tests of the upgrade faced challenges, most notably Holesky saw an uptick in invalid blocks. As a result, devs are launching Hoodi on Monday, March 17 in hopes it'll address the issues seen with the last testnet.

Ethereum has become the butt of many jokes across the broader crypto community, with fans of other networks mocking the network for its slow development rate and ETH's poor price action. Over the past year, according to TradingView, Ethereum has lost 52% of its share of market cap dominance. That's left room for coins like XRP to gain 258.98%.

But slow and steady wins the race—or so Ethereum maxis would have other investors believe.

Pectra aims to allow users to pay gas fees with multiple tokens, including stablecoins like USDC. It'll also allow for third-party fee sponsorship, which allows an entity to pay gas fees on behalf of the user—something that has become hugely important on layer-2 scaling networks.

On top of this, Ethereum validators will have a significantly increased capacity for how many tokens they can stake—from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH. The uptick will be coupled with more flexibility for when and how the staked Ethereum can be withdrawn.

Pectra will also lay the groundwork for social recovery, which allows users to rely on trusted contacts to help them regain access to a wallet that they've forgotten or lost the key to.

With this, many believe that Pectra will be the biggest upgrade to Ethereum since The Merge and one of its largest in its history.

Once Ethereum's core developers “feel confident” in the state of testing, a mainnet update will be scheduled at least 30 days after the Hoodi fork. This means that the earliest the network could see the Pectra upgrade go live is April 25.

	Two people have died, becoming the first measles-related deaths in the United States in a decade

Texas towns have been running low on measles shots as parents race to get their children vaccinated. Demand skyrocketed after a 6-year-old Texan girl died of measles — the first U.S. measles death in a decade. An adult in New Mexico also died and tested positive for measles after death.

As measles cases surge in the United States, leading to the country's first two measles-related deaths in a decade, questions, worries and misinformation about the infectious disease are swirling. More than 300 confirmed measles cases have been reported this year as of March 13, largely associated with an outbreak at the border between Texas and New Mexico, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Unvaccinated children make up the majority of confirmed cases. 

Still, the number of deaths “suggests that the outbreak is much bigger than the official number,” says infectious diseases physician Peter Chin-Hong of the University of California, San Francisco. Based on the expected fatality rate of 1 to 2 people per 1,000 infections, he says, the real number of cases may be closer to the high hundreds if not over 1,000.

Known for its blotchy red rash that usually starts on the face, measles can lead to high fever, pneumonia, ear infection and brain swelling. The virus that causes measles is highly contagious. The airborne virus spreads when an individual comes in contact with someone who's sick or with virus-contaminated surfaces. It can linger in the air for hours even after an infected person has left the room. After exposure, up to 90 percent of people without immunity to measles will catch it. 

Vaccination is the best way to gain protection, health experts say. But measles vaccination rates among kindergarteners have dropped from 95.2 percent in the 2019–2020 school year to 92.7 percent in 2023–2024, leaving around 280,000 kindergarteners vulnerable that academic year, according to CDC. The decline preceded new scrutiny of the childhood vaccine schedule by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a known vaccine skeptic. 

The measles vaccine “not only prevents serious disease, it also prevents infection,” Chin-Hong says. “It's a fantastic vaccine.” 

Since the United States first declared measles eliminated in 2000, the country has rarely exceeded 300 cases within a year. Most outbreaks and isolated cases are sparked by travelers bringing the virus from places where it circulates more widely.

But the early uptick in 2025 now has left many people wondering whether they need a booster shot, what the early warning signs of measles are and how to treat it. To learn more, Science News spoke with several physicians and researchers well-versed in infectious diseases. 

Generally, it starts with a fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes, Chin-Hong says. But the early symptoms resemble those associated with plenty of other illnesses, leaving measles to be dismissed as something like a simple cold. 

“Nobody really knows it's measles in the beginning,” Chin-Hong says. “That's why it's so insidious and could be so transmissible.” 

Around three to five days later, however, a telltale rash usually appears. It typically starts on the face and works its way down the body. But people are infectious up to four days before the rash appears, and four days after, Chin-Hong notes. An infected person may not show symptoms until up to three weeks after picking up the virus.

No. 

“Nutrition is no substitute for vaccination,” says Scott Weaver, who directs the Institute for Human Infections and Immunity at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. “There's no evidence anywhere in the world that it prevents infection or that it prevents the spread from infected people to others.… The main way to stop this outbreak is through vaccination. There's no reason to think that improving nutrition is going to have any impact on the trajectory of this outbreak.”

“Nutrition is no substitute for vaccination.”

Measles doesn't pass over the well-nourished, agrees Larry Kociolek, an infectious diseases pediatrician at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago and Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. “The frightening thing about measles is how contagious it is in the air. If you enter the room of somebody with measles — even if that person left that room an hour or two prior — if you're not immune to measles, you can catch measles.

“Your risk of acquiring measles is not going to go down if you're not immune just because you've otherwise lived a healthy lifestyle.”

But children who are malnourished have a greater chance of catching diseases and may develop more severe disease than kids with adequate nutrition.Severe malnutrition is not usually involved in measles outbreaks in high-income countries like the United States.

Not directly, Weaver says. “A lot of the severe infections progress to [pneumonia, which] can be caused by bacteria, and in this case, they certainly need antibiotics.”

As for supplements, “the reason that this is in the news is that there were studies in Africa and Asia that showed one of them, vitamin A supplements, actually increased survival among children,” he says.

That may be because children in those parts of the world have a greater likelihood of being vitamin A deficient, Kociolek says. “If you're vitamin A deficient and you get measles, it is very important that you get vitamin A as a treatment to reduce the severity of disease. But there's no evidence that if you're not vitamin A deficient, that vitamin A provides any benefit.” 

In fact, taking too much vitamin A can be dangerous, he says. Symptoms of vitamin A toxicity include nausea, vomiting, liver damage, hair loss and brittle bones that can lead to fractures.

Unfortunately, “there's no treatment for measles,” Chin-Hong says. When someone is hospitalized with severe disease — usually an infant — doctors may give them a general antiviral drug called ribavirin that's sometimes used to treat hepatitis C and RSV. “There's no great data” for ribavirin helping with measles, he says, but it's used occasionally because there are no measles-specific drugs.

When few people in a community are vaccinated, measles can spread easily. Measles is one of the most contagious diseases, with each infected person (red) able to pass the virus to 12 to 18 susceptible people (yellow). People who have gotten a measles vaccine (green) act as a shield against contagion. They rarely get infected and usually don't pass the virus on to others on the rare occasions when they do get infected. When 95 percent of people in a community are vaccinated, the community is protected with herd immunity. Click the arrows to see how disease spreads with and without herd immunity.



No. In fact, the opposite, Weaver says. “It actually interferes with your immune system in the short run. If you're infected by a [measles] virus without being vaccinated, the infection suppresses your immune response for typically a few months to a few years, and that can lead to you being more vulnerable to secondary infections.”

Measles can also cause long-term damage to the immune system. After an infection or vaccination, immune cells known as T cells, B cells and plasma cells maintain the memory of those invaders, says Stephen Elledge, an immunologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. “B cells are involved in making antibodies. They actually don't secrete antibodies. They differentiate into these plasma cells, and the plasma cells become the antibody factories. They go to your bone marrow, and that's where they stay for the rest of your life.They can live for 30 [to] 40 years, the whole time just pumping out the memory of your infections,” he says. “It turns out that measles can kill those cells.… It kills the T cells and kills the B cells. It kills the plasma cells.” 

So 10 to 20 percent of people infected with measles have the immune memory of other infections or vaccinations wiped out, Elledge says. That may leave them vulnerable to illnesses in the future even if they were previously infected or vaccinated against bacteria and viruses. 

“We showed it happens in people and in controlled experiments with macaques, so it's undeniably true. And the epidemiology backs it up 100 percent,” Elledge says. 

The vaccine is a weakened virus that does not kill the immune memory cells so it can't cause immune amnesia. Instead it guards against measles and other infectious diseases by shielding the immune system's memory. 

“Natural immunity” from infections also carries risks far beyond those associated with vaccination. “This natural immunity theory is dangerous,” Kociolek says. “The natural infection for measles can be severe. [About] 20 percent of children will require hospitalization for measles, a small percentage will get life threatening brain swelling. There's a small proportion of people who will recover and be seemingly fine, and then several years later, sometimes 10 to 20 years later, will get lethal inflammation of the brain from their prior infection.” By contrast, “the measles vaccine is incredibly safe.”

Usually infants get a measles vaccine when they are about a year old and a second shot when they are 4 to 6 years old. But in the Texas outbreak area, the state health department is advising parents to get babies vaccinated when they are as young as 6 months old. That early shot should be followed with the regular schedule of measles vaccines.

The reason doctors typically hold the first measles shot until a child turns 1 year old is that antibodies from the mother protect the baby and may interfere with the vaccine. “Those antibodies prevent the vaccine from replicating well,” Weaver says. “But if the mother was not vaccinated or infected and that baby has no immunity, then it's a good idea to give them the vaccine earlier.” 

“Very unlikely,” Weaver says. “The vaccine with two doses protects about 97 percent of people from getting measles again, and natural infection is probably a similar level of protection.”

Even if you do get it, you'll probably have a milder disease, Chin-Hong says. 

Probably somewhat, says Elledge. “Antibodies [against the measles virus] stick around a long time … but they do go down. They're really good when you're young, and then they start dropping off.” 

Older people who were vaccinated many decades ago may have lost some protection, he says.

“The idea that it gives you lifelong protection may be true, but it probably would be more true if you were in an environment where you occasionally got reinfected.” Occasional exposure to the virus or vaccine booster shots may help build stronger immunity, he says. 

But, Weaver says, “the majority of people don't need to worry about it. There's very little evidence of people with older age losing the protection against the infection. So unless they have some particular circumstance [such as] their immunity might wane because of some general immune deficiency, then they can get tested for their antibody levels. The vast majority of people [who] receive two doses as a child, they should be protected for life.”

Some should, Kociolek says. “In general, if you've had one dose of vaccine you're protected, probably with 93 percent effectiveness. If you've had two doses of vaccine you're about 97 percent protected as well. So that's considered adequate immunity. 

“Those who have had a prior measles infection are protected lifelong,” he adds. “Individuals who were born in the United States before the year 1957 are also considered immune. That was before vaccination, [but measles is] so transmissible that everyone born in the U.S. before 1957 is thought to have had measles. If those criteria don't apply to you, you may need to be vaccinated.”

Ideally, Weaver says, people “would go to their health care provider who would have complete records of their vaccination and find out if they received two doses as a child. [If so] they really don't need to be vaccinated again. If those records are not available and they're relying on their own memory or what they were told by their parents and they're not certain about that, it's certainly a good idea to get a booster, even if they likely were vaccinated as a child. It really can't hurt to get that booster.”

Health care workers may “get boosted if their antibodies have dropped below a certain threshold. But for the vast majority of people, they don't really need to worry about that if they're pretty certain they've been vaccinated as a child.”

Measles cases are rising in the U.S. as outbreaks grow in Texas and New Mexico.

Measles is continuing to spread across the United States, as outbreaks grow in western Texas and New Mexico.

Between the two states, 256 cases have been confirmed as of Thursday, mostly in those who are unvaccinated or with unknown vaccination status, according to state health officials. At least one unvaccinated school-aged child in Texas has died and another suspected death is being investigated in New Mexico in an unvaccinated adult. At least 10 other states have also confirmed cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

As health care professionals work to care for patients, they are also attempting to combat the proliferation of misinformation about how to prevent and treat the disease, some tell ABC News.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been one of the prominent voices on measles, making comments that public health experts say are not accurate.

In multiple interviews, Kennedy has claimed that vitamin A and cod liver oil are effective treatments for measles. He also said that poor diet contributes to severe cases of measles and that -- while vaccines prevent illness -- they also cause severe illnesses and even death.

Some public health experts told ABC News these statements are not rooted in scientific evidence and could be quite dangerous for the public.

""I think it's really important to try to stay away from these ideas of fringe theories or ideas that have not been scientifically proven,"" Kirsten Hokeness, director of the school of health and behavioral sciences at Bryant University, in Rhode Island, told ABC News.

During an interview on Fox News with Sean Hannity on Tuesday, Kennedy said that HHS was currently providing vitamin A to measles patients for treatment. He claimed vitamin A can ""dramatically"" reduce measles deaths.

The World Health Organization recommends two doses of vitamin A in children and adults with measles to restore low vitamin A levels, which can help prevent eye damage and blindness.

However, experts who spoke with ABC News said it is not an antiviral treatment against measles (meaning it does not prevent infections), nor is there one available.

""Because it has been described that patients with vitamin A deficiency can have a more severe course, the WHO recommends low doses of vitamin A for children diagnosed with measles,"" Dr. Carla Garcia Carreno, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Children's Medical Center Plano in Texas, told ABC News. ""This is a supplementation in case of deficiency, and it is not intended to treat the virus. High doses of vitamin A can have serious consequences.""

""Neither vitamin A nor cod liver oil will treat measles,"" she concluded.

Kennedy has claimed that poor nutrition plays a role in causing severe measles disease and that a healthy diet can lessen severity.

While malnutrition can be a factor in severe disease, malnutrition and nutritional deficits in measles patients have historically been seen in underdeveloped countries, according to experts.

Additionally, studies have found that mass nutritional supplementation ""followed by an increase in vaccination coverage"" can reduce measles infection and mortality.

""Certainly, good nutrition can promote a healthy immune system, and it's a good idea for everyone to try to maintain good nutrition, but it's certainly not a substitute for vaccination,"" Dr. Scott Weaver, director of the Institute for Human Infections and Immunity at the University of Texas Medical Branch, told ABC News. ""There's no evidence that it can prevent infection, no evidence that it can prevent an infected person from spreading the virus and contributing to one of these outbreaks.""

""So, I want to be very clear, good nutrition is absolutely no substitute for vaccination to prevent someone's own risk for developing severe, maybe fatal, measles,"" he added.

The CDC currently recommends that people receive two doses of the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine, the first at ages 12 to 15 months and the second between 4 and 6 years old.

One dose is 93% effective, and two doses are 97% effective, the CDC says. Most vaccinated adults don't need a booster.

Kennedy has said vaccines do ""stop the spread of the disease"" but also said they cause ""adverse events.""

""It does cause deaths every year. It causes all the illnesses that measles itself [causes], encephalitis and blindness, et cetera,"" he told Hannity, without providing evidence.

Weaver said there is no vaccine that is without risks but that the MMR vaccine is incredibly safe and effective.

""There's no evidence that it has severe outcomes … similar to what the measles virus infection causes,"" he told ABC News. ""It certainly can cause very minor reactions at the site of injection, like just about every vaccine, but it's one of the safest vaccines that's ever been developed.""

Weaver added that the risks of complications from a measles infection far outweigh any risks from the MMR vaccine.

As for Kennedy's unfounded claim that the MMR vaccine causes death, a 2015 CDC review published in the journal Vaccine found such claims are deaths reported to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System – a voluntary reporting system ""that accepts any submitted report of an adverse event without judging its clinical significance or whether it was caused by a vaccination.""

The review found that many of the deaths reported to VAERS claiming to be linked to the MMR included children who has serious underlying medical conditions or had deaths that were unrelated to the vaccine, including accidental deaths.

""These complete VAERS reports and any accompanying medical records, autopsy reports and death certificates have been reviewed in depth by FDA and CDC physicians and no concerning patterns have emerged that would suggest a causal relationship with the MMR vaccine and death,"" the review stated.

Kennedy claimed in an interview with Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Seigel over the weekend that is ""almost impossible"" for measles to kill a healthy individual.

Some people who contract measles may suffer severe complications as a result of infection. While those most at risk include children younger than age 5, pregnant people and those with weakened immune systems, anybody can experience complications.

About in 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who contract measles are hospitalized and about 1 in 20 children with measles develop pneumonia, which is the most common cause of death in young children who get infected.

About one in 10 children infected with measles develop ear infections as well, which can lead to hearing loss, data shows.

Additionally, about 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop encephalitis -- which is the swelling of the brain and can lead to brain damage -- and up to 3 out of every 1,000 children with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications, the CDC says.

Recently, Texas health officials reported the death of an unvaccinated school-aged child, the first death from measles recorded in the U.S. in a decade. The child was healthy and had no preexisting conditions, officials said.

""The CDC estimates that 1 in 5 people [who] get infected with measles ends up in the hospital,"" Hokeness said. ""So, this approach to relying on sort of this natural immunity doesn't make sense when we have a vaccine which prevents it in the first place.""

""But, in short, there's really no benefit to this idea of natural immunity and naturally acquiring the virus. That's why we've developed the vaccines that work so well,"" she added.

Kennedy also claimed in his interview that natural immunity from measles may protect against cancer and heart disease. There is no evidence to suggest either of those are true, experts said.

""If you want to take your chances with getting natural infection, hoping that there might be some very small benefit to that, it's a very big risk to take, because you may very well get severe measles infection,"" Weaver said.

Overall, experts advised relying on scientifically proven medical information.

""We should leverage the knowledge that we've gained over the years and not spend our time focusing on alternative possibilities,"" Hokeness added.

In summary

California is spending more than it expected on Medi-Cal and Republican lawmakers are pointing to coverage expansions that benefited immigrant households.

Welcome to CalMatters, the only nonprofit newsroom devoted solely to covering issues that affect all Californians. Sign up for WhatMatters to receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State.

The California health care program that covers almost 15 million people is costing more money than Gov. Gavin Newsom projected, creating a new budget problem in a lean year. 

Now his administration is borrowing $3.4 billion from the state's general fund to cover the unexpected cost increase. It's unclear when the administration plans to restore the money.

The administration acknowledged that more people are enrolled in the program than the state anticipated, and that the state is spending $2.7 billion more than it planned on coverage expansions for immigrants without legal status.  

Roughly 1.6 million immigrants without legal status are enrolled in Medi-Cal, according to state data. The program is a lifeline to people who traditionally have not had access to health insurance, and California is one of six states that offer coverage to immigrant adults regardless of whether they are in the country legally. 

Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones said Newsom has overpromised and under-delivered on health care at a time when all Californians are struggling to afford the cost of living in the state.

“Democrats and the governor are picking priorities, and they're prioritizing people that have come into our country illegally over people who immigrated here legally, people that are citizens,” Jones said.

The state's Medi-Cal expansion for undocumented immigrants costs about $8.5 billion from the state general fund annually, according to a recent budget hearing. 

“If we weren't spending eight-and-a-half billion dollars on illegal immigrants, we wouldn't need to borrow $3.4 billion to cover the difference,” Jones said.

Δ

H.D. Palmer, a spokesperson for the state's finance department, acknowledged that the rise in spending is partially attributable to higher-than-projected costs associated with larger enrollment numbers for California's undocumented population. In January, the Department of Health Care Services, which oversees Medi-Cal, estimated California is spending $2.7 billion beyond what it budgeted due to the cost of covering care and prescriptions for newly enrolled immigrants.

But immigrants aren't the only population that is using Medi-Cal more than the state expected.

California's Medi-Cal population in general ballooned during the COVID-19 pandemic when the federal government temporarily suspended income eligibility checks to keep people insured during the national emergency. Before the pandemic about 13 million people used Medi-Cal. That number peaked at 15.6 million in 2023 when eligibility checks resumed. Today 14.9 million people are enrolled, according to state data.

The Legislative Analyst's Office has also noted a 40% growth over the last four years in the number of seniors enrolled in Medi-Cal. While seniors make up only about 10% of the program's enrollees, they account for a large part of the program's spending because benefits such as long-term care are among the most expensive. 

Medi-Cal spends about $15,000 a year per senior. That compares to the $8,000 a year the program spends on average on other enrollees. 

Newsom's office said these issues are neither new nor unique to California. Medi-Cal is California's version of Medicaid, the federal-state program that provides health coverage nationwide to low-income households.

“Rising Medicaid costs are a national challenge, affecting both red and blue states alike,” Elana Ross, a spokesperson for the governor's office, said in an email.

Sen. Roger Niello, a long-time critic of the state's closed-door budgeting process, which is typically hashed out between Democratic leaders and the governor, acknowledged that other factors like senior enrollment and high drug costs could be contributing to the high expenses. He said Republicans are worried about increasing spending on immigrant health care.

The Republican from Roseville criticized the lack of transparency from Newsom's finance department.

“The completely opaque nature of the request, which says nothing about any of that, is entirely inappropriate,” Niello said.

Democratic lawmakers said they need more information about what exactly is behind the unexpected spending increases, but pushed back on the idea that the state would need to roll back coverage for its undocumented population.  

“Immigrant workers and families, who pay billions in taxes, deserve access to care, and I am proud to protect California's progress expanding Medi-Cal,” Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas said in a statement. “There are tough choices ahead, and Assembly Democrats will closely examine any proposal from the governor. But let's be clear: We will not roll over and leave our immigrants behind.”

Immigrants lacking permanent status contribute approximately $8.5 billion in state and local taxes a year, according to an analysis by the California Budget and Policy Center, a nonprofit research group. That's about the same amount it's costing the state to give them Medi-Cal.

State lawmakers first allowed undocumented children to enroll in Medi-Cal in 2016 under Gov. Jerry Brown. Since then Newsom has approved adding young adults up to age 25 in 2020 and older adults and seniors in 2022. Adults ages 26-49 were the final group added in 2024. Throughout those years, even some Republican lawmakers supported covering this population. 

“The Republicans need to take a better and keen-eyed look at the timeline associated with those expansions,” said Assemblymember Mia Bonta, an Oakland Democrat who leads the Health Committee. “For them to just try to play the blame game and put it all at the feet of California values to ensure that we have universal health coverage for all with this particular age group being included is just specious.”

Assemblymember Dawn Addis, who chairs a budget subcommittee on health, said she will be questioning Newsom officials closely about the spending increase in an upcoming hearing. 

“We really need to understand the details of what the Department of Finance is saying, what the executive is seeing, and how they're calculating this information,” Addis, a Democrat from San Luis Obispo, said.

Addis emphasized that the biggest threat to Medi-Cal right now is coming from the federal government.

House Republicans recently voted to advance a proposal that could result in cuts of $880 billion to a group of programs, largely Medicaid, over the next 10 years. The California Budget and Policy Center has estimated that the proposals currently at play in Congress could translate into annual losses of $10 billion to $20 billion a year for the state.

“The reason why it's so important for us to fight back against cuts at the federal level to Medicaid is because there is no easy or painless solution to fill that budget hole,” said Amanda McAllister-Wallner, interim executive director of Health Access California. 

Health Access California along with the California Immigrant Policy Center spearheaded the campaign nearly a decade ago to insure all immigrants in the state. 

McAllister-Wallner said it was unfair and unreasonable to pin the state budget shortfall on the immigrant expansions. Over the same time period, the state has added benefits, such as doula services and family therapy, and invested heavily in reforming the system through a multibillion-dollar initiative called CalAIM.

“Those changes that we've made in Medi-Cal made the program stronger (and) have made the state healthier,” McAllister-Wallner said.

Hoover Healthcare Policy Working Group Convenes Experts to Explore State of America's Health System

The Hoover Institution's Healthcare Policy Working Group convened a two-day conference March 3–4, 2025, examining major challenges facing the healthcare system, from Medicare and Medicaid to private insurance markets and pharmaceutical policies.

Hoover Institution (Stanford, CA) – The Hoover Institution's Healthcare Policy Working Group convened a two-day conference March 3–4, 2025, examining major challenges facing the healthcare system, from Medicare and Medicaid to private insurance markets and pharmaceutical policies. Throughout the discussions, participants highlighted the unsustainable fiscal trajectory of federal healthcare programs, regulatory barriers to competition and innovation, and potential market-based reforms that could enhance consumer choice while addressing cost challenges. While participants generally favored increasing the role of markets and consumer decision making in healthcare, they acknowledged the political and structural obstacles to comprehensive reform, resulting in a focus on identifying incremental changes that could improve system efficiency without disrupting access to care.

Medicare Reform

The Medicare session highlighted the program's central role in federal fiscal challenges, with projections showing its costs rising to almost a quarter of the non-interest federal budget by 2050. Participants discussed structural problems, including the complexity of beneficiary enrollment options, outdated administrative pricing structures, and shortcomings in Medicare Advantage payment systems. Reforms ranged from bold measures, like means testing or premium support models, to more targeted approaches, such as delivery system reforms and value-based purchasing. In Medicare Advantage, reform ideas centered on standardizing benefits across traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage programs to improve comparability, implementing competitive bidding instead of benchmark-based payments, and reforming risk adjustment to address favorable selection and upcoding issues.

Health and Technology

The health technology discussion focused on how artificial intelligence and automation could address healthcare's productivity challenges while improving quality and reducing costs. Panelists highlighted that the United States spends more on healthcare administrative costs than France, Germany, and Italy combined spend on their entire healthcare systems, with a complex system of 318,000 different health plans, 600,000 billing codes, and 57 billion negotiated prices. Technology applications discussed included AI-generated clinical notes, automated prior authorization processes, augmented radiology and pathology readings, and remote monitoring systems for high-risk patients. Participants debated whether technology would ultimately lower healthcare costs or simply redirect spending, with some suggesting AI could reduce administrative costs by 5 to 8 percent in the near term. Barriers to technology adoption included state regulatory variations, product liability concerns, and misaligned incentives that fail to reward efficiency gains. Participants agreed that administrative simplification represents a substantial opportunity across healthcare sectors.

Drug Pricing and Approvals

The pharmaceutical policy session examined tensions between drug innovation, affordability, and access, with participants noting that while drug spending may increase healthcare costs in the short term, it often reduces overall healthcare spending in the long run as generics become available. Critics of the Inflation Reduction Act's drug price negotiation provisions argued it targets high-volume, low-price drugs rather than truly overpriced medications, creates a “pill penalty” by treating small and large molecules differently in terms of exclusivity, and establishes an unofficial cost-effectiveness threshold through the Medicare drug price negotiation program. Participants also discussed international pricing disparities—with the United States funding approximately 70 percent of global pharmaceutical earnings despite that sector representing 23 percent of global GDP—and debated potential reforms to Food and Drug Administration approval processes to reduce the “valley of death” between product approval and insurance coverage, which can delay patient access by up to six years.

Medicaid Reform

The Medicaid session examined structural problems with the federal-state partnership, where states have incentives to expand eligibility and services because the federal government covers most costs. Speakers highlighted how the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion, with its 90 percent federal match for the expansion population, exacerbated these incentives and led to enormous improper payments. Reform ideas included phasing down the enhanced federal match rate, moving people above 100 percent of poverty to the marketplace exchanges with premium tax credits, limiting state financing gimmicks like provider taxes, capping state-directed payments, and improving coordination for dual Medicare-Medicaid beneficiaries. Georgia was highlighted as a case study for expanding coverage only to 100 percent of the poverty line while directing those above that threshold to the exchanges, demonstrating how this approach led to increased private market competition and potentially better care access for beneficiaries.

Private Health Insurance

In the private insurance session, participants contrasted the lack of innovation in health insurance with dramatic improvements in other technologies over similar time frames, noting that insurance products remain largely unchanged despite decades of rising costs. Participants advocated for deregulating healthcare markets, expanding individual coverage health reimbursement arrangements (ICHRAs) to give employees more choice, enhancing healthcare savings accounts (HSAs), creating functional cash markets for healthcare services, and addressing price transparency and cross-subsidization issues. Several speakers highlighted Georgia's approach to health insurance exchanges, which uses private-sector entities for enrollment while achieving cost savings and increased carrier competition. The session featured debates about the nature of health insurance and healthcare as services, with some arguing that unique characteristics of healthcare necessitate different approaches than pure market solutions, while others contended that most healthcare could function effectively in a properly structured market environment.

Affordable Care Act and Health Policy Beyond 2025

The final session addressed the future of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and health policy directions, with panelists suggesting the ACA will likely remain in place with only incremental reforms rather than be repealed. Participants noted that Republicans are focusing primarily on tax reform rather than healthcare reform for 2025, with healthcare provisions potentially included in reconciliation only if they generate savings for tax cuts. Participants discussed a vision of a robust free-market healthcare system with true price discovery and competition, while acknowledging the challenges of transitioning from the current system with its entrenched cross-subsidies and regulatory structures. Others offered a pragmatic view of the 2025 political landscape, suggesting potential policy changes like making HSAs an alternative to cost-sharing reduction subsidies.

General Themes Across Both Days

Several consistent themes emerged across the two-day conference. First, participants generally agreed on the unsustainable fiscal trajectory of federal healthcare programs, but they often differed on the appropriate balance between market-based and regulatory solutions. Second, there was broad recognition that excessive administrative complexity drives significant costs in the system, with potential for technology and standardization to address these inefficiencies. Third, discussions revealed a tension between ideal policy solutions and politically feasible reforms, with acknowledgment that healthcare reform faces substantial obstacles from institutions and interest groups. Fourth, many participants advocated for approaches that provide more consumer choice and control while recognizing the limitations of consumer decision making in healthcare contexts. Finally, there was agreement that any reforms must consider implementation realities at the state level, with successful state models potentially offering pathways for broader system improvements.

Attendees of the Healthcare Policy Working Group's roundtable on pressing healthcare system challenges are seen in Annenberg Conference Room on March 3, 2025.

LAS VEGAS – This past week at HIMSS25, a panel of healthcare interoperability leaders convened for an ad hoc discussion about the ongoing evolution of FHIR API-based data exchange: How it can be advanced, how it can be expanded across the payers-provider-pharmacy-patient ecosystem, how certification should evolve and what the role of policymakers, agencies such as CMS and ASTP and technology developers should be over the next decade or so.

The session, ""Ditch the Clipboard: Policy Ideas for DOGE and the Trump Administration,"" shares a name with a recent Leavitt Partners whitepaper that served as the basis of the discussion.

Despite its title, session moderator, Leavitt Partners Principal Ryan Howells, emphasized that the panel talk was not a political discussion.

""The election is over,"" said Howells. ""We are now in a phase, for the next four years, of what the administration's priorities are. This will not be a political discussion in terms of what's right or what's wrong or what's happening with the administration. It's more a discussion about what the priorities of this administration are and how do we align with those priorities to advance interoperability policy.

""It's clear they want to do big, bold things. It's clear that they're actually doing generational change in the federal government,"" he explained. It's clear that they actually want to eliminate waste. Those things are clear. The question now becomes, how do we understand what those priorities are and how actively provide recommendations that could meaningfully move the ball in terms of interoperability and policy over the next decade plus.""

Howells was joined by Michael Westover, vice president of population health at Providence; Anna Taylor, associate VP for population health & value-based care at MultiCare Connected Care; and Jason Teeple, interoperability strategy leader and senior director of enterprise architecture at Cigna Healthcare.

Among the questions they sought to answer: What federal technology policies are needed – or are no longer needed – to create a truly patient-centered health care system? How does CEHRT need to evolve to support a modern, API-based, interoperable ecosystem? And what can we expect on this front from the new administration in the years ahead?

""What do we need to do over the next decade?"" Howells asked. ""Not the next administration, not the next couple of years. What do we need to do over the next decade to meaningfully advance data interoperability and data exchange? Because that's how long it takes. Remember HITECHtook about 10 years, right? FHIR has taken more than 10 years.

""And so when we think about: What does this look like over the next decade? We need to really expand our thinking in terms of what's needed. You see all those awesome vendors that are on the show floor there. They talk about things like AI, cloud-based computing, all the solutions that they have, which is really cool. But what do we need to do in order to enable that innovation ecosystem to thrive?""

Howells made the case that some current interoperability policies are ""antiquated,"" and, also, that there's simply too many of them.

""We have too much regulation,"" he argued. And we have a lot because we started to grow off of a certain program and started to add a bunch of things to start to certify individual functionality inside the EHR, to build the EHR.

""Well, now we've built them. We are now going to have to figure out a way to get the data to move between the systems. We don't have a problem in building the functionality of the EHR anymore. We have a problem in exchanging the data between not only the EHR, but the payers, the pharmacies, the patients, everyone else in the ecosystem. How do we actually do that?

Howells also advocated for ironing out some discrepancies with policies between different agencies, and better alignment on timing of rule compliance.

""We're a little out of sync based on policies in terms of the timing,"" he said, for example, ""for when USCDI is being in place and when the CMS rules need to take advantage. And that's just the nature of the federal government. Sometimes we get a little bit out of sync.""

We also need to move towards a ""more modern computing architecture,"" he said.

""We believe that we need to redefine CEHRT,"" said Howells. ""We go back to the original definition of the HITECH Act, where it talks about hardware, software or packaged solutions sold as services that are designed for or support the use by healthcare entities or patients for the electronic creation, maintenance, access, or electronic health information.

""It does not say EHRs. This could be EHRs. It could be payers. It could be cloud-based solutions. It could be others as well. So if we think out, if we would redefine CEHRT and start to certify the APIs, which is the outbound call to the other systems – rather than certify the functionality inside the APIs – that becomes a different paradigm.""

Oops, something went wrong

We recently published a list of 10 Best Healthcare Stocks For Long-Term Investment. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE:THC) stands against other best healthcare stocks for long-term investment.

In the US, healthcare expenditures and costs have been increasing. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, US healthcare spending increased 7.5% from 2022 to $4.9 trillion in 2023. In 2023, the healthcare industry made up around 17.6% of the US economy, up 17.4% from 2022. The expansion of Medicare and commercial health insurance are the two main forces behind this growth.

The impact of tariffs on this continuing trend has become a major topic of contention in the healthcare sector, as more and more US corporations are turning to China for deals on the next promising molecule, whether in the obesity or cancer arena. Versant Ventures managing director Carlo Rizzuto spoke on the effects of tariffs on healthcare on CNBC's “Fast Money” on February 7. Tariffs might affect the sector in two ways, according to Rizzuto. Products developed in China and introduced to the US or other markets would be the first. The sector would need to see how the tariffs are set up in the market to comprehend how they would impact such trade operations.

Second, and more concretely, the US healthcare industry uses China as a huge hub for contract production and research. As a result, anything that raises that expense is probably going to make the market more difficult. An increase in costs will not improve the running of the healthcare sector, which is already facing pressure from investors.

Speaking about China's enormous influence in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries, Rizzuto stated that the vast majority of healthcare organizations use a Chinese CRO or manufacturing partner in some capacity during the research and development phase. As a result, it plays a crucial role in the way biotech and pharmaceutical companies function in the nation. From the tiniest businesses to the biggest, this pattern is very common.

Simply said, the United States lacks the infrastructure to handle the transfer, thus healthcare corporations cannot reshore all of their externalized R&D and production to the country. Therefore, it is quite hard to understand how such a large-scale reshoring might occur. With the quantity of tariffs applied, the costs to accomplish this achievement can be computed linearly.

According to McKinsey, healthcare EBITDA is projected to rise from a baseline of $676 billion in 2023 to $987 billion in 2028 at a 7% CAGR. Recovery from post-pandemic lows is anticipated to support the improvement in several segments, while growth is anticipated to be faster in other areas (such as specialist pharmacy and HST). Software platforms are essential to the healthcare ecosystem because they make it possible for payers and providers to operate more effectively in a complicated setting.

By automating processes, fostering data connectivity, and producing actionable insights, technological innovation (such as generative AI and machine learning) keeps opening doors for stakeholders across all segments. McKinsey went on to say that increased utilization and pipeline expansion (as in cancer) are projected to drive substantial growth in specialty pharmacy revenue. Specialty pharmacy profit pools are still growing as a result of the rise in the use of specialty medications.

For our methodology, we used a Finviz screener and picked stocks with a market cap of over 2 billion, a 5-year annual return of over 10%, and a low PE ratio under 20. We then ranked these stocks based on their total number of hedge fund holders as of Q4 2024.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Highlights

A recent executive order from the Trump administration on healthcare price transparency signals this issue remains a priority 

The order requires federal agencies to issue guidance on standardizing pricing information and enforcement policies by May 26, 2025

All healthcare providers should be aware of the implications of the order and begin preparing for compliance by identifying exact prices of healthcare services and a presentable format for the information

On Feb. 25, 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to “empower patients with clear, accurate, and actionable healthcare pricing information.” The order signals a return to a priority from President Trump's first term. 

A 2019 executive order from the first Trump administration required hospitals and health plans to publish “meaningful price and quality information” for public use. Hospitals were required to display pricing information for up to 300 services, and health plans were to post their negotiated rates. Both types of healthcare entities were required to make the information consumer-friendly.

The 2025 executive order picks up where the 2019 executive order left off. It directs the federal government to prioritize steps to “promote universal access to clear and accurate healthcare prices.” To realize these goals, it states federal agencies must: 1) require hospitals and health plans to disclose the actual price of items and services, 2) issue updated guidance or proposed actions to ensure pricing information is standardized and easily comparable across healthcare providers, and 3) issue guidance updating enforcement policies to ensure compliance. Federal agencies have until May 26, 2025, to take these actions.

The language of the executive order sheds some light on what healthcare providers can expect. First, while the 2019 order was directed at hospitals and health plans, the 2025 order includes no such limitation. This signals an expansion of price transparency across all provider classes. While hospitals and health plans should be prepared for new agency guidance and enforcement around price transparency, providers of all types should pay attention to this new guidance when it issues.  

Second, healthcare providers should begin analyzing pricing data to identify actual costs and present the information in a useful, consumer-friendly manner. Of note, the order explicitly prohibits healthcare providers from using price estimates. They must disclose the actual prices. 

Finally, healthcare providers should be prepared for increased scrutiny, additional enforcement, and faster compliance timelines. In 2023, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) enforced violations by sending noncompliant hospitals or health plans a warning notice with instructions to correct the deficiencies within 90 days. If the hospital or health plan remained noncompliant, CMS issued a correct active plan (CAP) request with a 45-day deadline. Hospitals and health plans that still did not complete the necessary steps to come into compliance received a civil monetary penalty (CMP). 

Typically, providers took 195-220 days to come into compliance. As of April 2023, CMS issued 730 warning notices and 269 CAPS and imposed CMPs on four hospitals. The CMPs range from $300 to $5,500 per day of noncompliance times the number of beds at the hospital. However, the executive order signals a push for federal agencies, including CMS, to enforce price transparency faster and more rigorously. This may include use of automation to check providers' compliance.

All healthcare providers should be aware of the implications of this executive order and the May 26 deadline, particularly those who may be at increased risk for enforcement. Since there is some question of how healthcare providers will calculate exact prices, providers should consider using this time to sort through billing data, bundled pricing, and drug prices to identify prices. Further, providers should begin considering how the information can be presented in a useful, consumer-friendly manner. Using this time can ensure providers are prepared once federal agencies begin publishing guidance on standardization and enforcement.

The president's deregulatory bent means more responsibility rests on the shoulders of healthcare stakeholders to get artificial intelligence right.

First published on

Healthcare companies struggling to adopt artificial intelligence amid a lack of federal standards are unlikely to get any help from the Trump administration, placing the burden of responsible implementation squarely on the industry's shoulders.

That mandate is becoming increasingly difficult as the technology grows more complex, experts said during the HIMSS healthcare conference in Las Vegas.

“One thing that's clear is that this administration is not going to regulate AI. Good or bad, take that for what it is,” Tanay Tandon, the CEO of provider automation company Commure, said during a panel.

President Donald Trump's hands-off approach to AI governance means hospitals turning to the tools to save money and give overworked clinicians some relief will likely be operating in a regulatory gray area for at least the next four years.

The president says his goal is to free up U.S. developers to innovate. But that comes with downsides for tech developers and healthcare companies desperate for guardrails given AI's proclivity to make mistakes, degrade over time and exacerbate existing bias.

Not to mention, a lack of national standards might actually hamper AI development and adoption, according to some experts.

“When there isn't a federal framework, it can just absolutely cause all kinds of problems,” said Leigh Burchell, the chair of the Electronic Health Records Association. “We all just want to know what our rules are. And then we can comply.”

To date, a handful of federal agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services' technology office, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration, have published targeted rules around the use and quality of AI in healthcare. But neither Congress nor the executive branch have zeroed in on a comprehensive framework to regulate the models — despite some progress during the Biden administration, when an HHS task force was working to build a unified regulatory structure.

That task force unveiled a strategic plan in January — just 10 days before Trump's inauguration. However, Trump nixed the blueprint in one of his first executive orders.

Meanwhile, federal employees working on AI oversight, including at the FDA, have been caught up in the Trump administration's purge of the government's workforce. Amid the turmoil, the future of the HHS office that oversees AI policy remains unclear.

As a result, what little momentum there was in Washington to create a concrete strategy for overseeing health AI appears to have stalled out, at least for now. In its place, Trump has announced the Stargate Project, a $500 billion investment deal with private companies to prioritize AI development and maintain U.S. supremacy in the space — a high-stakes bet that was immediately complicated by the release of DeepSeek, a high-performing and inexpensive open source model from China.

""The current administration — the brakes have come off and the accelerator has come down.""

Brian Spisak

Program director of AI and leadership, Harvard University's National Preparedness Leadership Initiative

The Trump administration did issue a request for information in early February to get public input on a potential national AI action plan. However, the plan's wording makes clear the administration's priorities: to “sustain and enhance America's AI dominance, and to ensure that unnecessarily burdensome requirements do not hamper private sector AI innovation.”

The revocation of the Biden-era AI plan was largely symbolic, as agencies hadn't yet gotten around to imposing any requirements on developers or users.

But in “the current administration — the brakes have come off and the accelerator has come down,” said Brian Spisak, program director of AI and leadership at Harvard University's National Preparedness Leadership Initiative, at HIMSS. “There's a lot of responsibility to leadership of health systems to find the optimal balance between innovation and speed and safety and tradition.”

That responsibility — which also rests on AI developers creating the models, software vendors weaving them into health records and the clinicians using them — is not negligible.

Currently, even the most futuristic AI at healthcare institutions is being used to automate administration, and only peripherally touches patient care. But that appears to be changing: There's growing interest among medical organizations in more clinical use cases for AI, like tailoring treatment plans or helping clinicians arrive at a diagnosis, according to a survey from HIMSS conducted in the fall.

Many of those use cases involve generative AI, which can create original text and images. But such models are known to hallucinate, or provide answers that are factually incorrect or irrelevant. AI can leave important information out, an error known as omission. Models can also drift, a term for when an AI's performance changes or degrades over time.

Given the increasing prevalence of AI in pulling data from EHR systems, transcribing doctor-patient visits and more, errors like these could interfere with clinicians' ability to care for patients, experts say.

Meanwhile, the technology is advancing at a stunning rate. Last year, the healthcare industry was just beginning to come to terms with governance for generative AI. But now, the conversation has already moved onto AI agents, which can complete complex tasks largely unsupervised by humans.

Commure's Tanay equated the current moment to when America moved from kerosene to electricity at the end of the 19th century.

“The way that we did things six months ago is completely irrelevant,” he said.

Because of the breakneck speed of development, federal standards from any administration would likely need to be flexible, experts say. 

The Biden administration's HHS task force suggested the government could create guidelines around testing and piloting tools, along with some support for adoption. However, it shied away from a prescriptive approach.

That's in line with the wish list from many stakeholders. Numerous executives at tech companies and hospital systems said any federal standards should be stratified by the level of risk an AI model imposes — for example, stricter oversight for algorithms that help doctors diagnose diseases, and looser restrictions for algorithms that help hospital staff allocate patients to beds.

“We have to weigh the balance between underregulation, which can potentially increase risk, and overregulation, which will stunt innovation,” said Anthony Chang, the chief intelligence and innovation officer at the Children's Hospital of Orange County in California, during a panel.

“The current administration is more likely to be on the underregulation side. So we have to be careful as a profession that we don't allow that to happen,” Chang said.

The lack of a playbook from Washington has left hospitals and medical groups scrambling to build their own internal controls amid a patchwork of state laws and voluntary standards released by industry groups.

States including Colorado, Utah and California have already enacted legislation establishing disclaimer requirements for AI systems. More states are considering similar laws: The Electronic Health Records Association is tracking 150 different state bills related to health AI, according to Burchell.

“There is a massive explosion of bills,” Burchell said.

But differing standards could stop health AI developers and software companies from rolling out products in specific states, potentially disadvantaging patients depending on where they live. More risk-averse software companies may avoid AI, or certain states, altogether, she added.

“Legislation of a lot of sizes and shapes at the state level is a risk to us, because it means we have to do all kinds of different development. We would rather develop one system that can be used broadly and accepted across the country,” Burchell said.

Health AI standards groups are also stepping into the gap left by the federal government. The groups — often made up of leading hospitals, digital health companies and tech giants — include the Health AI Partnership, an AI learning network for the industry, and the Coalition for Health AI, which recently launched an AI registry for hospitals.

”I think we'll probably see more of these non-government organizations like Health AI Partnership and some of those emerge as maybe our north stars today, as here's some leadership in the space,” said Rachel Wilkes, the corporate lead for generative AI initiatives at EHR vendor Meditech.

But standards from industry consortia hold little weight without the heft of the federal government behind them, experts say. Historically, voluntary standards aren't particularly effective.

“There's room for people to act in their own best interest, whatever that may be, without any sort of federal framework,” Wilkes said.

EHR vendors and hospital operators say they're building up rigorous internal standards for AI tools, including validation and frequent auditing.

“Government oversight has its place, but I do think the way that clinical practice evolves tends to be more driven by what's happening at a health system,” said Seth Howard, the executive vice president of research and development for Epic, the largest EHR company in the U.S.

In interviews, executives with Epic, Oracle, Meditech and eClinicalWorks said they're making AI available to doctors with rigorous oversight, including back-end accuracy checks and ongoing monitoring.

However, tech leaders stressed that it's also the hospital and the clinicians' responsibility to make sure everything is working as planned.

“We are working in an industry that deals with human life. It cannot be trivial. It cannot be under-exaggerated on what guardrails and checks and balances and what discussions need to happen,” said Girish Navani, the CEO of eClinicalWorks.

Technology behemoths betting heavily on AI feel similarly. Google, for example, has worked with for-profit hospital giant HCA on an evaluation framework to catch any errors generated by its AI models and ensure their reliability, according to Aashima Gupta, the head of healthcare for Google Cloud.

“We provide those tools for an evaluation framework, and for all of this there's a human in the loop capturing the feedback, and that feedback loop then makes the model more effective,” Gupta said. “That's what gives me comfort.”

""We are working in an industry that deals with human life. It cannot be trivial. It cannot be under-exaggerated on what guardrails and checks and balances and what discussions need to happen.""

Though some in the private sector say they've got governance handled, modern AI is incredibly hard to oversee, according to AI engineers. The main advantage of generative AI — its creativity — also introduces subjectivity, making grading its outputs complicated.

For example, if two clinicians are tasked to summarize a patient's medical history based on clinical notes, their results could be incredibly different, albeit still accurate. It's the same with generative AI, experts say: How do you measure quality in a standardized way when there's that degree of variability?

“AI governance is still very much a maturing process,” said Harvard's Spisak.

Hospital executives say they're tackling oversight carefully. But some research suggests governance systems for simpler predictive AI models already aren't rigorous enough. Hospitals with explicit procedures for the use and assessment of AI tools are still struggling to identify and mitigate problems, according to a study published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Even some of the most well-resourced and tech-savvy systems are struggling.

The Cleveland Clinic has an AI governing body that includes stakeholders from across the academic medical center, according to Rohit Chandra, the Cleveland Clinic's chief digital officer. The task force oversees AI's impact on the organization's patients and workers while ensuring clinical safety and discussing thorny questions of privacy, legality and bias.

But “I don't think we've figured it all out,” Chandra said during a panel. “The term hallucination, for one, has just shown up in the last two, three years. And we still don't quite know how to deal with it.”

Hospitals should try to make specific people accountable for the performance of the tools, as part of a larger governing body that includes executives, lawyers, doctors and nurses, according to Brenton Hill, the head of operations at standards group CHAI.

Hospitals need to decide how to monitor AI effectively and report that information, which can depend on the products they have in place. They also need to consider what resources the AI will use and develop appropriate data use agreements with AI vendors, Hill said during a panel.

But “there's not one silver bullet governance structure that you can put out there that will solve all your problems,” Hill said.

Though a road map from federal regulators would be helpful, stakeholders working to integrate AI tools into healthcare said they're not holding their breath.

“While self-regulation is good, we don't believe that's sufficient. We believe AI is too important not to be regulated,” said Google's Gupta.

But when asked what she expects from the Trump administration, Gupta was noncommittal. “It's hard to say at this point. We are trying to figure out how we best work with them, share our best practices with them ... Too early to say. I think the entire healthcare community is waiting for that,” Gupta said.

Other experts said the Trump administration is a wake-up call for hospital executives who believed Washington could assume responsibility for overseeing AI.

Instead, the mandate should be on everyone touching the technology to ensure AI algorithms — given their shifting nature and innate opacity — perform as they're designed, especially in an industry where any mistakes could impact patient health.

“The easy answer is, if this regulatory body says it's safe, then I can trust it. I think people were hoping that might happen for AI,” said Aaron Neinstein, the chief medical officer of agentic AI company Notable. “I think that was a pipe dream.”

Freedom House program graduates.

A group of Harrisburg area residents are ready to kickstart their health careers, thanks to a local program.

UPMC Health Plan on Friday celebrated the graduation of its first cohort of students from the Dauphin County Freedom House Foundation training program.

The workforce development initiative, which also has cohorts in Erie and Allegheny counties, provides a free, five-week course to lower-income students interested in the healthcare field.

“They have put in a tremendous amount of hard work and shown immense dedication to learn not only valuable clinical skills, but professional development skills and interpersonal skills that will serve them really well as they embark on this new chapter of their journey,” said Leah Franklin, workforce development manager at UPMC.

In the course, 13 students learned the foundations of healthcare, setting them up for entry-level positions or for further education in the future.

“We are giving our students a very foundational knowledge that gives them a lot of opportunities,” said Trevor Mathey, project manager for Freedom House. “So whether they want to go and immediately become a medical assistant or a patient care technician or community health worker, they have that option. But they also have the option to continue their education and go on and become an EMT or a nurse or pursue many of the other health care professions.”

Not only was the course free, but students were paid while they took the classes and assisted with things like childcare, transportation and finances, which can often serve as barriers to education.

During the program, students attended training at Tech Centro Workforce Development in Harrisburg.

“My mom's a nurse, and I see how many people she helps,” said Tiana Higgins, a Harrisburg native and one of Friday's graduates. “I want to be able to have that impact on people also and change people's lives.”

Higgins said that the courses were hands-on, giving them chances to shadow healthcare professionals, take a CPR training course and learn to take a blood pressure reading, among other things. She plans to now begin working and eventually pursue her LPN and RN certifications.

According to Mathey, there is already a waiting list for the next cohort of the Freedom House program, which will likely begin in a few months.

THE LARGER TREND

Understanding the disparities faced by various racial and ethnic groups is key to addressing preterm births and low birth rates, which should spur action from payers, providers and lawmakers, a 2023 Health Affairs study found.

Specifically, the authors said that state and local lawmakers wield considerable influence in reducing disparities in maternal health outcomes, since many originate from historically inequitable local policies.

Maternal care deserts are a known and increasing problem. Between 2020 and 2022 there's been a 5% increase in counties in the United States that have less maternity access, according to a March of Dimes report. There's a 2% increase in counties that are considered maternity care deserts.

On March 13, 11 leading civil rights and health equity organizations held a joint press briefing to release a report analyzing the Medicaid cuts passed recently by the U.S. House of Representatives. In a news release, UnidosUS stated that the House-passed Budget Resolution framework would make the largest Medicaid cuts in American history, placing at risk the health and financial security of more than 70 million children, seniors, people with disabilities, and working families.

“While people of all backgrounds would be in danger, the report finds that communities of color would suffer especially widespread harm: nearly 42 million people, or approximately a third of all people of color in the U.S., rely on Medicaid for healthcare and would be placed in harm's way if the House's cuts become law.” 

The House Budget Resolution would cut at least $880 billion from Medicaid over the next 10 years to help finance $4.5 trillion in tax breaks. The report illustrates how communities of color are especially at risk, with Medicaid covering half of all children of color and more than a fourth of adults of color aged 65 and older.

Shavon Arline-Bradley, president and CEO, National Council of Negro Women (NCNW) said in a statement, “It is deeply concerning that the U.S. would consider cutting Medicaid. There is no humanity behind these budget cuts. Not having a safety net for healthcare for the least of us says that you do not understand the needs of the American people and are clearly out of touch.”

“Slashing Medicaid isn't just a policy choice—it's a direct attack on the health and well-being of millions of Americans, especially people of color who already face systemic barriers to care. These cuts would rip away essential coverage, forcing families to forgo doctor visits, life-saving medications, and critical treatments,” said Rep. Darren Soto (D-FL-9), Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC), in a statement. “Gutting Medicaid would only deepen inequality and push the most vulnerable further to the margins. No one should have to choose between putting food on the table and getting the care they need to survive.”

The report concluded that many people's commitment to Medicaid comes from personal experience. “For almost two in five Americans, including 38 percent of people who voted for then-candidate Trump, Medicaid covers them or someone in their immediate family.”","{'href': 'https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com', 'title': 'Healthcare Innovation'}"

How and when will rural hospitals get the tools and resources they need to mitigate cyber threats is an unknown. But to increase awareness about the causes of rural hospital vulnerability and drive more collaboration to enhance their cybersecurity resilience, Microsoft said it envisions immediate and sustained commitment through a public-private partnership. 

""We can take action at an unprecedented scale and speed to mitigate cyber risk, drive innovation and ensure both rural hospitals and the Americans they serve are resilient into the future,"" Microsoft researchers said in a new whitepaper, The Rural Hospital Cybersecurity Landscape.

For rural hospitals to remain the cornerstone of healthcare delivery in the United States and continue to provide essential services to millions, Microsoft pledged to continue to expand its efforts to help support their overall resilience, including leveraging artificial intelligence to address needed efficiencies. 

The tech giant is also calling on technology companies, policymakers, community organizations and healthcare providers to address the urgent needs of these critical institutions. 

While rural healthcare providers may be currently optimistic about finances, last year saw high Medicare Advantage enrollment push half of all rural hospitals in the red.

Since 2010, 182 rural hospitals have closed or converted, according to the 2025 Rural Health State of the State report released last month by Chartis. This year, 46% of rural hospitals are in the red and 432 are vulnerable to closure, the consultancy said.

""Compounding the financial resource strain, rural hospitals face significant challenges recruiting and retaining healthcare professionals. Finding skilled staff in specialized areas of hospital management for example, IT specialists or revenue management teams is a significant challenge in rural areas,"" Microsoft said in the whitepaper released on March 5.

Rural hospitals face significant challenges in recruiting and retaining their workforces as well as investing in their own security.

""In large part due to limited budgets, rural hospitals are more likely to lack the resources to implement key cybersecurity measures, creating an ideal opportunity for exploitation from cyber criminals,"" researchers said.

Threat actors the world over know this, whether they are going after rural hospitals for financial gain, or are sanctioned by nation-states to sew discord in the U.S. and harm citizens.

To showcase the increasing severity of the threat landscape, in 2015, Texas experienced five data breaches through cyberattacks, exposing over 102,000 patient records, according to the whitepaper. 

By 2022, 44 attacks exposed nearly 6 million patient records.

""This spike is not an anomaly, but the result of focused efforts to target hospitals who are simultaneously under-resourced with vulnerable IT environments and housing valuable patient data,"" researchers.

Grimly, 20% of the hospitals that experienced a cyberattack reported an increase in patient mortality, Microsoft noted.

The cost per day lost to downtime following ransomware attacks from 2018-2024, estimated at $1.9 million, is compounded by an average downtime of 18.7 days, according to Microsoft.

Then there is the cost of recovery.

""In 2023, according to an IBM report, data breach costs for healthcare rose to more than $10.9 million,"" researchers noted. 

For hospitals already experiencing financial strain, ""this can be the difference between solvency and shuttering,"" and that is why wural hospitals have both immediate and long-term needs for support and to help develop their cyber resilience.

The new white paper discusses Microsoft's insights from its efforts to aid rural providers in improving their cybersecurity postures through its Cybersecurity Program for Rural Hospitals. 

The program offers free security assessment through a pre-vetted security partner to evaluate and identify strategies to mitigate cybersecurity risks, curated learning for provider employees and foundational cyber risk management certification to IT staff, according to Microsoft. 

Participants may also receive one year of Windows 10 Extended Security Update at no cost – where available – and security product discounts and offers, including non-profit pricing for critical access and rural emergency hospitals.

All U.S. rural hospitals are eligible for the tech giant's specialized cybersecurity program, and since it launched more than 375 rural hospitals have asked for help by taking the free assessment. In addition, more than 550 U.S. rural hospitals registered for the company's program and nearly 1,000 individuals from these organizations accessed cyber training opportunities, Microsoft said.

Researchers quickly found out that most rural hospitals hadn't implemented basic cybersecurity best practices, Kate Behncken, Microsoft's corporate vice president of Microsoft Philanthropies and Erin Burchfield, senior director of technology for social impact and one of the whitepaper's authors, said in their blog article on March 5.

Basic cyber hygiene like email security and multi-factor authentication is lacking, as is performing basic vulnerability scanning. 

""Timely patching according to an established process is often neglected in rural hospitals, with only 43% of hospitals being deemed as receiving passing scores in these practices,"" the whitepaper's authors said.

Case in point: On Wednesday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center issued a joint alert warning the sector about Medusa Ransomware. Initial access investigated as recently as last month showed that the variant deploys phishing campaigns as a primary method for stealing victim credentials and once inside exploits unpatched software vulnerabilities such as ConnectWise ScreenConnect – which Blackcat may have used to exfiltrate 6T bytes of Change Healthcare data though denied – and Fortinet EMS SQL injection vulnerabilities. The Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center issued a threat alert about the ScreenConnect vulnerability in January.

Privileged account management is another top liability for many rural hospitals with only 29% of those Microsoft assessed ""adequately separating end-user and privileged accounts or accounts with broader systems/data access."" 

""Often rural hospitals with lean IT teams lack experience in developing and managing such policies and the capacity to do rigorous ongoing monitoring,"" Microsoft said in the whitepaper.

Though most rural hospitals scored well in their asset management practices, end-point management revealed substantial risk. Less than 37% of assessed hospitals met the expert-informed passing score, according to the whitepaper.

Most rural hospitals do not have comprehensive training and awareness programs, either, which makes them vulnerable to social engineering attacks, researchers said.

""Our goal with this program is to address both the immediate cyber risks facing these critical community resources as well as broader systemic challenges facing rural health,"" Behncken and Burchfield said in their blog.

""We can help these hospitals to be less vulnerable to common threats and ultimately, better serve their communities,"" Microsoft stated in the whitepaper.

In addition to the rural hospitals' cybersecurity program, Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit has embarked on both legal and technical action internationally to disrupt cybercriminals and their facilitators, including those targeting healthcare institutions by using legitimate tools to stage ransomware attacks.

In partnership with Microsoft, H-ISAC and international agencies, U.S. software firm Fortra said on Monday that collaborative efforts to dismantle cybercriminals over the two years are paying off and Cobalt Strike abuse in the wild has dropped 80%.

In its appeal to other tech companies, policymakers and others, Microsoft urged innovation as well as boots-on-the-ground support to shore up rural healthcare IT against growing cyber threats.

""Not only through foundational cybersecurity support but also innovation to address inefficiencies and cost drivers, IT skilling to ensure hospitals are prepared to manage these complex environments,"" the company said in the report. 

""Governments in particular have a responsibility to stop attacks against hospitals,"" Microsoft said in its whitepaper.

During his morning keynote at HIMSS25 on March 7, General Paul Nakasone, former director of the National Security Agency from 2018-2024, said he thought immediately of the results of the agency's Cybersecurity Collaboration Center established in 2020 for Operation Warp Speed after he read Microsoft's Rural Hospital Cybersecurity Landscape Report. 

The center not only enabled the U.S. Health and Human Services to communicate with the Defense Industrial Complex and allow experts to exchange information, but through it, the NSA also provided scanning, secure email and protective DNS to participants. 

""The number of intrusions in the defense industrial base dropped dramatically,"" Nakasone said. 

The cost of this security investment by the U.S. Department of Defense – $10 million a year – saved ten times as much as what intrusions would have cost, he said. 

With no other critical infrastructure sector hit harder by ransomware than healthcare – at a cost of $1.9 million per day lost in revenue – Nakasone said similar government involvement could improve the cyber defense of the critical health sector.

""Why don't we do the same thing with rural healthcare? Why don't we do that with healthcare in general?"" he said. 

""Why don't we figure out a way that we can provide major health providers and their subs, and everyone else that wants it, scanning and protective DNS and secure email to make the bar that much higher for attackers to come into?""

The Silver State plans to award managed care contracts to incumbents UnitedHealth, Elevance, Centene and Molina — along with CareSource, a newcomer to the state.

Nevada sent out a request for Medicaid contract proposals in October that would expand its managed care program to cover almost everyone in the state. Currently, Nevada only offers managed care in Washoe and Clark counties, which are highly urban and include cities like Reno and Las Vegas.

However, the state newly budgeted to finance expanding managed care to all counties in the state, which is expected to add about 75,000 individuals to the coverage.

UnitedHealth, Elevance, Centene and Molina are incumbents in the state. UnitedHealth holds about 35% of Nevada's managed care enrollment, while Elevance, Centene and Molina follow with 34%, 17% and 15% respectively, according to state data.

Nevada's health department said in October that it anticipated awarding four contracts come this year. But in a notice of intent to award released Wednesday, the state said it plans to award contracts to five payers: Centene subsidiary SilverSummit Healthplan; nonprofit health plan CareSource; Molina Healthcare; Elevance subsidiary Community Care Health Plan of Nevada; and Health Plan of Nevada, a UnitedHealth subsidiary.

Centene and CareSource scored the highest, and received contracts for both Clark and Washoe counties along with Nevada's rural areas. Elevance and Molina were also awarded contracts for Clark and Washoe counties.

UnitedHealth only received an award to serve Clark county. Previously, the insurer had contracts for both Clark and Washoe.

Nevada's notice doesn't actually award final contracts, but shows those managed care organizations' proposals were selected for contract negotiations with the state.

“This result broadly holds serve in NV for the MCOs, with some very modest puts and takes as we expect some enrollment reshuffling as a result of the awards,” JP Morgan analyst John Stansel wrote in a Wednesday note.

Insurers that ink deals with states to administer managed care programs compete aggressively for the contracts, which can be lucrative. However, the current outlook for Medicaid funding is unclear, given the safety-net insurance program — which, along with its sister program for low-income children, currently covers roughly 80 million Americans — is on the chopping block for spending cuts as Republicans in Congress look for ways to pay for the president's tax plan.

Conservatives on the Hill have yet to coalesce around a specific blueprint for cuts. But likely strategies include shrinking funding mechanisms that critics say allow states to sidestep their share of Medicaid spending or enacting work requirements for beneficiaries to qualify for Medicaid coverage.

Republicans are also debating rolling back federal funding for the Medicaid expansion population. Under the Affordable Care Act, states could expand Medicaid coverage to a greater share of their low-income population in return for the federal government assuming a greater share of their medical costs.

In Nevada, for example, the federal government pays 60% of costs for the traditional Medicaid population, and 90% for the expansion population, according to health policy firm KFF.

Top Republicans have characterized pending cuts as an effort to crack down on waste, fraud and abuse that won't affect patients. However, if the federal government shrinks its Medicaid spending, states would have increase their own Medicaid spending to pay for the difference — or reduce benefits or kick people off the program.

In Nevada specifically, if the federal match rate for the state's expansion population is stripped, more than 300,000 people could be booted from Medicaid and the state could lose about $670 million in revenue each year, according to health policy firm KFF.

Before Medicaid expansion, Nevada had one of the highest uninsured rates in the nation.

LEXINGTON, Ky. (March 14, 2025) — For children battling cancer, keeping up with school can be a challenge due to frequent medical appointments, hospital stays and treatment side effects. The Providing Assistance With School (PAWS) Program at the DanceBlue Kentucky Children's Hospital Hematology/Oncology Clinic bridges the gap between education and medical care, ensuring young patients stay on track academically.

Led by school intervention specialists, PAWS works directly with families, schools, and medical teams to provide essential support. Whether a child is unable to attend school due to intensive treatment or is struggling with cognitive side effects from medication, PAWS helps by coordinating with teachers, securing accommodations and offering academic assistance wherever the student is — be it in the clinic, hospital or at home.

Since the PAWS Program was established in 2014, more than 800 patients, from preschoolers to college students, have benefited from the services of the school intervention specialists.

Oops, something went wrong

Many investors view the healthcare sector as a safe haven when the stock market is turbulent. That's understandable. The demand for healthcare products and services typically holds up very well regardless of what's happening with the market or the economy.

Some healthcare stocks are better picks than others. And you won't need a fortune to invest in a few of the best. Here are three no-brainer healthcare stocks to buy with $1,000 right now.

Many stocks have pulled back significantly in the first few months of 2025 amid worries about the Trump administration's trade policies. But not AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV). Shares of the big drugmaker are up around 20% year to date.

AbbVie's product lineup is led by blockbuster drugs targeting autoimmune diseases, with Rinvoq and Skyrizi delivering especially strong sales growth. The company's cancer drugs Imbruvica and Venclexta are also big winners. AbbVie's 2020 acquisition of Allergan made it a top player in the aesthetics market as well, with top-sellers including Botox and Juvederm.

You can pick up one share of AbbVie for around $212 as of this writing. That's an attractive price considering the company's growth prospects. AbbVie's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio based on five-year earnings growth projections is a super-low 0.45, according to financial data and infrastructure provider LSEG.

To add icing to the cake, AbbVie offers a nice forward dividend yield of 3.09%. The company is also a Dividend King with a track record of 53 consecutive years of dividend increases.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) has delivered an even bigger gain than AbbVie in 2025 with its shares soaring more than 20% year to date while the overall market sank. Part of Vertex's attraction is that it commands a virtual monopoly in treating the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF).

However, Vertex has also benefited from two key U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals in recent months. The FDA gave a thumbs-up to the company's newest CF drug, Alyftrek, on Dec. 20, 2024. It approved Vertex's non-opioid drug Journavx for treating acute pain on Jan. 30, 2025.

I fully expect both of these drugs will be huge growth drivers for Vertex. Alyftrek is taken once per day, a more convenient dosing than the company's current flagship CF therapy Trikafta. Vertex also won't have to pay as much in royalties for the new drug. Journavx has an especially big market opportunity because of the addictive qualities and negative side effects associated with opioids.

One share of Vertex will cost you a little under $500. This modest investment will also allow you to potentially profit from the biotech innovator's pipeline, which features four late-stage programs including a promising islet cell therapy that could cure severe type 1 diabetes.

Unlike AbbVie and Vertex, Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: KNSA) isn't profitable yet. Don't let that concern you, though. This up-and-coming biotech stock is still handily beating the market so far this year with a solid double-digit percentage gain.

Kiniksa arguably has a gold mine with Arcalyst, a drug approved by the FDA in March 2021 for treating recurrent pericarditis, a painful cardiovascular disease. Sales for Arcalyst skyrocketed 79% year over year in 2024 to $417 million. The company projects sales of the drug could reach as much as $580 million this year.

That could be just the tip of the iceberg, though. Kiniksa has captured only around 13% of the market. And Arcalyst remains the only FDA-approved therapy for treating recurrent pericarditis.

You'll have plenty of money left over after buying AbbVie and Vertex to invest in Kiniksa with its share price of around $22. I think the move will pay off as Arcalyst gains additional market share and the company advances its other pipeline programs.

Critics have accused Oz of wanting to cut Medicare and Medicaid services, and pointed to his close ties with drug and pharmaceutical companies.
Oz has also previously made comments about privatizing Medicare.
On Friday, Oz told committee members at the hearing he would not rule out making cuts.
""Dr. Oz will be calling the shots of what gets cuts, or what stays,"" committee chair Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said during Friday's hearing.

Wyden also took aim at Oz's previous promotion of unproven health remedies on his show.

""He's about to testify in front of the Senate Finance Committee, and I've got questions.""
Some of those questions also related to Oz's record on abortion. While campaigning in 2022, Oz said ""local political leaders"" should play a role in a woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy.

L'acquisition devrait générer des synergies opérationnelles et élargir l'offre de services, notamment dans les Services de Soins Infirmiers à Domicile pour Seniors.

Click Holdings (NASDAQ: CLIK) hat eine 25%ige Übernahme eines führenden Wettbewerbers im Bereich der Pflege in Hongkong angekündigt. Das übernommene Unternehmen bringt über 9.000 Pflegekräfte in die bestehende Datenbank von Click, die 11.000 registrierte Fachkräfte umfasst, und schafft so einen kombinierten Talentpool von mehr als 19.000 Gesundheitsarbeitern.

Die strategische Übernahme stärkt die Position von Click im Bereich der Gesundheits-Personalvermittlung, insbesondere im Pflegebereich für Senioren. Das Zielunternehmen hat über 10 Jahre Erfahrung in der Betreuung von Senioren in Hongkong. Dieser Schritt steht im Einklang mit der Mission von Click, die Lösungen für die Belegschaft zu verbessern und der wachsenden Nachfrage nach qualifizierten Pflegekräften gerecht zu werden.

Die Übernahme wird voraussichtlich betriebliche Synergien schaffen und das Dienstleistungsangebot, insbesondere im Bereich Häusliche Pflege für Senioren, erweitern. Click plant, im Rahmen seiner strategischen Vision 'Intelligente Häusliche Pflege-Lösungen für Senioren' zu entwickeln. Weitere Details zu Integrationsplänen und langfristigen Strategien werden in den kommenden Monaten bekannt gegeben.

CLIK's 25% acquisition of a nursing care competitor represents a significant operational expansion, immediately growing their talent pool by 73% from 11,000 to a combined 19,000+ registered personnel. This strategic approach secures key benefits while limiting financial commitment and integration complexity compared to a full acquisition.

The nursing HR sector in Hong Kong offers attractive recurring revenue characteristics, particularly valuable in the seniors care segment where demand typically remains stable regardless of economic conditions. The expanded talent database creates an immediate competitive advantage in fulfilling healthcare staffing needs.

While financial terms remain undisclosed, the synergy potential is substantial through database integration, operational efficiencies, and enhanced market coverage. This partial ownership structure suggests measured expansion, potentially allowing CLIK to evaluate performance before considering additional investment.

This acquisition accelerates CLIK's stated strategy of developing Smart Home Nursing Solutions while strengthening its position in the growing seniors care market. For a company with a market cap of just $15.6M, this represents a meaningful expansion that could significantly impact future revenue generation capabilities, though the immediate financial effect remains difficult to quantify without transaction details.

This strategic acquisition directly addresses workforce challenges in Hong Kong's healthcare sector by creating an expanded pool of qualified nursing professionals. The combined database of 19,000+ registered personnel significantly enhances CLIK's ability to match specialized nursing skills with specific client requirements - a critical differentiator in healthcare HR services.

The senior nursing care segment requires specialized expertise, and this acquisition immediately provides CLIK with access to professionals with over 10 years of experience serving this demographic. This expertise aligns perfectly with CLIK's vision of developing Smart Home Nursing Solutions for Seniors, potentially accelerating their technology-enabled care delivery models.

The healthcare staffing market benefits from consolidation, as larger talent pools increase placement efficiency and service reliability for institutional clients. By expanding their nursing care offerings, CLIK strengthens its competitive position against both traditional staffing agencies and emerging healthcare HR platforms.

Healthcare providers will benefit from access to this enlarged talent pool, potentially reducing staffing shortages that directly impact patient care quality. For CLIK, the ability to fulfill staffing requests more consistently creates opportunities for deeper institutional relationships and potential service expansion beyond basic staffing into more comprehensive workforce solutions.

Hong Kong, March  14, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Today, Click Holdings Limited (NASDAQ: CLIK) (“Click” or the “Company” or “we” or “our”), a provider of human resources (“HR”) solutions in Hong Kong specializing in Seniors Nursing Care, Logistics, and Professional HR services, today announced the 25% acquisition of a prominent nursing care competitor. The acquired company, which has over 10-year experience in serving Hong Kong seniors and maintains a talent pool of over 9,000 nursing personnel, significantly strengthens Click's position in the healthcare HR sector.

This strategic acquisition aligns with Click's mission to enhance workforce solutions and bridge the growing demand for skilled nursing professionals. By integrating the acquired company's extensive talent pool with Click's existing database of over 11,000 registered personnel, Click will be able to provide a more robust and comprehensive HR solution for healthcare institutions and clients across Hong Kong and beyond.

Oops, something went wrong

Wrapping up Q4 earnings, we look at the numbers and key takeaways for the healthcare technology for providers stocks, including Phreesia (NYSE:PHR) and its peers.

The healthcare technology industry focuses on delivering software, data analytics, and workflow solutions to hospitals, clinics, and other care facilities. These companies enable providers to streamline operations, optimize patient outcomes, and transition to value-based care models. They boast subscription-based revenues or long-term contracts, providing financial stability and growth potential. However, they face challenges such as lengthy sales cycles, significant upfront investment in technology development, and reliance on providers' adoption of new tools, which can be hindered by budget constraints or resistance to change. Over the next few years, the sector is poised for growth as providers increasingly prioritize digital transformation and efficiency in response to rising healthcare costs and patient demand for seamless care. Tailwinds include the growing adoption of AI-driven tools for patient engagement and operational improvements, government incentives for digitization, and the expansion of telehealth and remote patient monitoring. However, headwinds such as tightening hospital budgets, cybersecurity threats, and the fragmented nature of healthcare systems could slow adoption.

The 6 healthcare technology for providers stocks we track reported a slower Q4. As a group, revenues beat analysts' consensus estimates by 3.1% while next quarter's revenue guidance was 0.7% below.

Staff and funding cuts to the NIH, FDA and USAID could have downstream implications for R&D in the pharma industry, experts said.

Research that spans therapeutic areas from cancer to mental health is currently in jeopardy following the Trump administration's efforts to cut government spending in healthcare — and the cuts have the potential to impact the pharma industry in the long run.

Since he took office, President Donald Trump ordered public health agencies to freeze federal grants and lay off thousands of employees. Most recently, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was directed to slash funding for vaccine hesitancy research.

Amid the personnel and funding shake-ups, major drugmakers have largely remained silent. But experts noted that the industry has concerns about the negative impact of the funding cuts, even if they're outwardly remaining quiet on political changes.

Federal funding cuts, experts said, could lead to a slowdown in R&D as well as regulatory uncertainty.

“We're not going to have as many shots on goal when it comes to discovering new drug targets, biomarkers or therapeutic approaches,” said Katie McCarthy, senior vice president at Lumanity. “This could slow down and stifle early-stage innovation, which would lead to fewer breakthroughs in the long-term — ultimately impacting human health across the U.S. and around the world.”

The Trump administration froze some 16,000 grant applications for NIH funding — accounting for about $1.5 billion — and fired 1,200 of the agency's 20,000 employees in February. Among those fired was Renee Wegrzyn, head of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), the new federal agency launched by the Biden administration to fund high-impact, high-risk biomedical research.

Trump's nominee for NIH director, Jay Bhattacharya, noted during his confirmation hearing he didn't have plans to cut more staff. But he vaguely hinted that he might take a cost-cutting approach if confirmed — leaving the industry with a sense of uncertainty.

“Every dollar wasted on a frivolous study, every dollar wasted on administrative costs that are not needed, is a dollar not spent on research,” Bhattacharya said during his hearing at the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) committee last week.

Bhattacharya also beat the drum on Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy's “Make America Healthy Again” priorities, emphasizing that he would promote research projects that would tackle chronic diseases like cancer, diabetes and obesity. But he didn't clarify what exactly that would look like, or when or how NIH grants would be resumed.

With a budget of $47 billion, the NIH is the largest funder of biomedical research in the world, according to Nature, with much of that money going towards U.S. universities, researchers and smaller biotech companies.

A significant chunk of biotechs rely on NIH funding to conduct preclinical research, because early-stage R&D is often considered higher-risk among alternative investment vehicles, according to Arda Ural, a pharma consultant and life sciences sector leader at EY-Parthenon.

“You cannot run a business today [as an emerging biotech] unless you get a state or federal grant — it is the lifeblood of innovation,” Ural said.

Moderna's mRNA vaccines, for example, can be traced back to NIH-funded academic research conducted by Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman at UPenn. Both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna commercialized that initial research into their leading COVID-19 vaccines.

“[COVID-19 vaccines] are another example of the impacts of academic research translating into and supporting a massive tailwind for industry,” noted Chandana Haque, executive director of Altitude Lab, a life science incubator funded by Recursion Pharmaceuticals.

Freezing those NIH funds now could have ripple effects much later down the road, halting early-stage research that could be responsible for later breakthroughs.

“The products we have today that we are using in the market were conceived of 10 years earlier,” Ural said. “If you shut down the NIH today, the impact will be somewhat muted in the next couple months — but it will be material and significant in five or 10 years.”

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), meanwhile, has also been targeted for budget and staffing cuts, with the agency laying off some 1,000 employees in February — then later rehiring some who worked on medical devices and food in a chaotic back-and-forth.

Any uncertainty or abrupt changes to the regulatory process could have downstream effects on new drugs coming to market, potentially leading to development and approval delays. A lack of predictability could also further deter investors, according to McCarthy.

“There's so much interaction and collaboration, both formally and informally, between FDA and drug developers — and it's critical for moving the needle in a significant way to positively impact human health,” McCarthy said.

One of the most important aspects of the FDA are the technically-skilled medical experts — biostatisticians, physicians, toxicologists — who help move the PDUFA process along to ensure drugs are safe and effective and ultimately get approved.

“Once that talent leaves the door, it's going to be very difficult to backfill that — and that will have systemic shock to the PDUFA process, which all these companies rely on to get their innovation to patients,” Ural explained. “You have to keep the FDA machine working, because the world is watching the FDA as a beacon for standards of quality and scientific evidence.”

Systemic changes at the FDA could also shake the confidence between patients and regulatory authorities, exacerbating adherence to medication problems among consumers, he added.

Perhaps one of the more controversial cost-cutting measures undertaken by the Trump administration was its directive to slash more than 80% of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)'s foreign aid contracts. That amounted to pulling $60 billion in U.S. aid from programs that battle diseases like Ebola, HIV/AIDS and malaria abroad.

The direct effects of USAID funding cuts on the pharma industry may not be as obvious as NIH cuts. But many pharma companies that manufacture products for diseases like malaria or tuberculosis rely on USAID funding in order to make those medications available in low-income countries.

It's also unlikely that private industry would step in to make up for the absence of federal funding, according to Mariana Socal, associate professor in health policy and management at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Federal aid programs were created for the purpose of assisting countries that have historically been unable to self-finance the healthcare and medications they need.

“These countries have historically lacked the resources to meet the demand in their local market,” Socal said. “It would be unlikely that [private purchases] would start to happen, because that's the underlying problem that generated the need for foreign aid in the first place.”

Big Pharma companies have stayed quiet throughout the political upheaval. Industry lobbying group PhRMA, as well as several other large drugmakers, declined an interview for the story.

But smaller biotech players, investors, patient advocates and other stakeholders outside of Big Pharma have been more vocal about their concerns. In an open letter to Trump, hundreds of stakeholders emphasized the need for “efficient and effective U.S.-led biomedical innovation,” and called on the administration to avoid excessive FDA staffing cuts.

Perhaps more importantly, the letter also expressed industry players' desire to be involved in the restructuring of public health agencies and to be able to include their input.

“There was a small section of that letter that talked about the desire for executives from across the industry to be part of the solutioning,” Lumanity's McCarthy noted, acknowledging that there could be more work to be done to make federal agencies more efficient. “But to make all of these blind cuts without a longer-term strategy in place to solve some of those challenges — that doesn't seem like the best path forward.”

McCarthy believes there's a possibility for pharma companies to increase their own spending to fill in the gap left by NIH cuts, and to strike more partnerships between academic institutions and Big Pharma. Larger pharma companies also have corporate social responsibility and philanthropic efforts that could potentially play a larger role in funding efforts either in the U.S. or abroad. But she acknowledged this might not be financially sustainable in the long run.

“I don't think they can step in and replace the way the federal government has played that role in the past,” she noted.

In the meantime, one biotech company is attempting to fill at least some of the funding gap. Recursion's Altitude Lab has created a small fund of $1 million to invest in startup biotechs that rely on the NIH for R&D. The money will fund some 10-15 startups in a similar way that an SBIR would have been granted.

“We had the idea of like, ‘Hey, this is urgent and really important, and if we don't do something about it, we're going to see thousands of potential therapeutics stalled or abandoned,'” Haque said. “The idea is to pay it forward, but also to support our industry because we're all losing out if we don't see these innovations translating out.”

Haque said she hopes to see more life science and pharma executives step up to find ways to contribute, either by providing cash or taking on higher-risk collaborations to pull research out of academia.

“I hope to see that, but none of us are a replacement for publicly-funded research,” she said. “There's a reason why governments invest in this. I'm hopeful this is an evaluation period, and that we come out of this with strong support for research and a more efficient structure for how we fund innovation.”

For Ural, consulting his pharma clients means monitoring the rapid political changes on a daily basis, and to avoid making knee-jerk reactions to any more signs of upheaval. He's advising them to focus on planning for changes until the end state is clearer. But he also emphasized the need for a “healthy FDA and NIH.”

“Yes, we can make [agencies] more efficient and rule out some potential inefficiencies — that's everyone's hope,” Ural said. “But innovation cannot stop because diseases do not stop. We need to keep that big picture in mind.”

 The world has changed in the past five years in how we market to HCPs and patients, payers and policymakers. Meantime, various stakeholders are falling behind in supporting various engagements and it's not serving anyone well.  Transform 2025 is designed to help marketers do a better job of catching up to — or staying a step ahead of — all the progress.

A new initiative is underway to decentralize healthcare in Spokane, focusing on improving patient access and care quality. This effort is highlighted by Kootenai Health's plans to build a micro-hospital off Highway 41. 

SPOKANE, Wash. – A Spokane physician is raising concerns about the viability of independent medical practices in the Washington. The current American healthcare system is not conducive to maintaining these practices, according to Dr. Raymond Lance at Spokane Urology.

""The system is unfortunately not working in a way that facilitates efficient, timely, high quality care delivery,"" Dr. Lance said.

Independant practices play a crucial role in healthcare accessibility, according to Dr. Lance. While Kootenai Health and MultiCare announced their plans to expand accessibility with new a micro-hospital in Post Falls, independent practice has played in this arena for years.

It's called 'decentralization' - providing healthcare outside a singular central hospital campus. Kootenai CEO Jamie Smith emphasized this model is driving their Post Falls medical center.

""They can stay right here at home and get even better care,"" Smith said.

Despite an industry-wide effort in the region, independent practices face financial challenges due to fixed-rate reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid. Small independent practices are paid lower rate, sometimes, for the same services when compared to larger practice or hospital.

""It's because of this onerous, broken way we reimburse. So, you know, we're, we're price fixed, or even we're in decline in our revenue, but we're not cost fixed. Our costs are going up big time,"" Dr. Lance said.

To manage expenses, Dr. Lance collaborates with a third-party company for administrative tasks; this includes accounting and a legal team.

However, a recent bill in the Washington State Legislature sought to make this business model illegal, as the third-party company - Solaris Health Care - is not owned by physicians.

Although the bill is dead for the session, it reflects broader challenges faced by independent practices and the future of a decentralized system that benefits people in rural areas.

If an independent practice cannot make ends meet, they are forced to close and seek employment at hospital system; often, at a centralized campus.

""It results in a situation where care is increasingly being forced into a centralization, which is not always the most efficient way to do care,"" Dr. Lance said.

There is something many consider to be a positive to come from the pandemic - a new level of flexibility in healthcare. 

Virtual appointments were often the only option when the pandemic began. Five years later, many people still take advantage of the virtual options.

Dr. Paul Gausman is a primary care physician at AHN Health & Wellness Pavilion Westside in Millcreek.

He still has vivid memories of when the pandemic started.

One of the many changes during that time was the increase of online visits. 

He said, at first, he wasn't sold on the idea. But he eventually got more comfortable with it. 

He believes online appointments will continue but will not replace in-person visits.

“It's a very common part of my day,” Gausman said. “Two or three people a day will see me virtually and then the other 22 will be here in-person. It works. It offers a different option for people.”

Another different option born out of the pandemic is virtual physical therapy. 

Dr. Anil Singh of Highmark Health said getting to physical therapy can be hard for some patients. This program means they can stay home and get the treatment. 

Highmark Health was working on the program when the pandemic began. It took off, Singh said, because of the move to virtual appointments.

Each patient gets a tablet with computer vision that lets the therapist guide them through the session. The tablet analyzes how the patient is moving and responding to treatment. 

Singh said this program, in a way, is a return to what healthcare used to be.

“The doctors used to go to patients' houses. Somewhere along the way, that switched and the doctors now made patients come to their offices,” he said. “I think these types of modalities and capabilities of virtual and digital offerings really take us back to having the doctor's office go back to the patient.” 

He said this program will not replace in-person therapy, which is still essential in some cases.","{'href': 'https://www.weny.com', 'title': 'WENY-TV'}"

With the rising costs of healthcare in developed nations and the availability of high-quality, affordable medical services in developing countries, patients are increasingly crossing borders for treatments ranging from cosmetic surgery to complex cardiac procedures. Iran, a country with a rich cultural heritage and a rapidly advancing healthcare system, has emerged as a key player in the medical tourism industry, particularly in the Middle East.

Role of medical tourism in the global economy

Medical tourism is a multi-billion-dollar industry that contributes significantly to the global economy. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global medical tourism market was valued at $44.8 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.1% from 2020 to 2027. The industry's growth is driven by factors such as the high cost of healthcare in developed countries, long waiting times for certain procedures, and the availability of affordable, high-quality medical care in developing nations.

Countries like Thailand, India, Turkey, and Mexico have long been popular destinations for medical tourists. These countries offer a combination of advanced medical facilities, skilled healthcare professionals, and lower costs compared to Western countries. For instance, a heart bypass surgery that costs $130,000 in the United States can be performed in India for just $10,000, including travel and accommodation expenses.

Medical tourism in the Middle East

The Middle East has also seen a surge in medical tourism, with countries like the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Jordan, and Iran leading the way. The UAE, particularly Dubai and Abu Dhabi, has invested heavily in state-of-the-art medical facilities and has positioned itself as a hub for medical tourism in the region. Jordan, on the other hand, has leveraged its reputation for high-quality healthcare and its proximity to conflict-ridden countries like Iraq and Syria to attract medical tourists.

Iran, however, stands out in the Middle East for its unique combination of affordable healthcare, highly skilled medical professionals, and a rich cultural heritage that attracts tourists. Despite facing economic sanctions and political challenges, Iran has managed to develop a robust healthcare system that rivals those of its neighbors. The country's medical tourism industry has grown significantly in recent years, driven by government support, private sector investment, and the increasing reputation of Iranian hospitals and clinics.

Medical tourism in Iran: a success story post-Islamic Revolution

Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iran has made significant strides in various sectors, including healthcare. The government has prioritized the development of the healthcare system, resulting in a network of hospitals, clinics, and medical research centers that offer a wide range of services. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Iran's healthcare system ranks among the top in the Middle East, with a life expectancy of 76 years and a maternal mortality rate of 16 deaths per 100,000 live births, which is lower than the global average.

The success of Iran's healthcare system has laid the foundation for the growth of medical tourism. The country offers a wide range of medical services, including cosmetic surgery, dental care, fertility treatments, and orthopedic procedures, at a fraction of the cost compared to Western countries. For example, a rhinoplasty (nose job) that costs $8,000 in the United States can be performed in Iran for just $2,000. Similarly, dental implants that cost $4,000 in Europe are available in Iran for $1,000.

Iran's medical tourism industry has also benefited from the government's efforts to promote the sector. In 2004, the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education established the ""Health Tourism Council"" to coordinate efforts between various stakeholders, including hospitals, travel agencies, and government agencies. The council has implemented policies to streamline visa procedures for medical tourists, improve the quality of healthcare services, and promote Iran as a medical tourism destination.

When compared to its neighboring countries, Iran's medical tourism industry stands out for its affordability, quality, and accessibility. Turkey, for instance, is a major competitor in the region, attracting millions of medical tourists each year. However, while Turkey offers high-quality healthcare services, the cost of treatment is generally higher than in Iran. For example, a hair transplant in Turkey costs around $3,000, while the same procedure in Iran costs $1,500.

Similarly, the UAE has positioned itself as a luxury medical tourism destination, offering world-class facilities and services. However, the cost of treatment in the UAE is significantly higher than in Iran, making it less accessible to patients from lower-income countries. Jordan, another key player in the region, has a well-established healthcare system but lacks the scale and diversity of medical services offered by Iran.

Iran's strategic location also gives it an advantage over its neighbors. The country shares borders with several countries, including Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, which have limited healthcare infrastructure. As a result, many patients from these countries travel to Iran for medical treatment. Additionally, Iran's visa policies are more lenient compared to some of its neighbors, making it easier for medical tourists to enter the country.

Main destinations of medical tourism in Iran

Several cities in Iran have emerged as hubs for medical tourism, offering a combination of advanced medical facilities, skilled healthcare professionals, and tourist attractions. The following are the main cities active in medical tourism:

- Tehran: As the capital city of Iran, Tehran is home to some of the country's most advanced hospitals and medical centers. The city offers a wide range of medical services, including cancer treatment, cardiac surgery, and fertility treatments. Tehran is also a cultural and historical hub, attracting tourists who combine medical treatment with sightseeing.

- Mashhad: Known as the religious capital of Iran, Mashhad attracts millions of pilgrims each year who visit the Imam Reza Shrine. The city has also developed a reputation for medical tourism, particularly in the fields of fertility treatments and cosmetic surgery. Mashhad's proximity to Central Asian countries makes it a popular destination for medical tourists from the region.

- Shiraz: Shiraz is renowned for its historical sites, including the ancient ruins of Persepolis and the beautiful gardens of Eram. The city is also a center for medical tourism, offering services in dermatology, ophthalmology, and orthopedics. Shiraz's combination of cultural heritage and medical expertise makes it a unique destination for medical tourists.

- Isfahan: Isfahan, known as ""Half of the World"" for its stunning architecture and historical landmarks, is also a growing hub for medical tourism. The city offers a range of medical services, including dental care, cosmetic surgery, and cardiovascular treatments. Isfahan's reputation for hospitality and its well-preserved historical sites make it an attractive destination for medical tourists.

- Tabriz: Located in northwestern Iran, Tabriz is a major center for medical tourism, particularly for patients from neighboring countries like Azerbaijan and Turkey. The city offers a range of medical services, including orthopedic surgery, neurology, and urology. Tabriz's strategic location and well-developed healthcare infrastructure make it a key player in Iran's medical tourism industry.

Iran's medical tourism industry has grown significantly in recent years, driven by the country's affordable healthcare services, skilled medical professionals, and government support. Despite facing economic sanctions and political challenges, Iran has managed to develop a robust healthcare system that rivals those of its neighbors. The country's strategic location, combined with its rich cultural heritage, makes it an attractive destination for medical tourists from the Middle East, Central Asia, and beyond.

As the global medical tourism industry continues to grow, Iran is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend and further establish itself as a leading destination for medical tourism in the region. With continued investment in healthcare infrastructure and efforts to promote the sector, Iran has the potential to become a major player in the global medical tourism market.

LAS VEGAS - As AI is transforming all aspects of healthcare, it's affecting the care model for payers.

Health insurers have end-to-end visibility into individual care needs and utilization patterns across providers and settings.

Virtual care, technology and AI have helped payers define a more active role in care delivery.

Barriers include resistance to change and lack of better payer and provider alignment, panelists said during the first Emerge Innovation Experience at HIMSS25.

Edward Marx, CEO of Marx Advisory and a former global chief information officer at Cleveland Clinic, moderated the panel of experts from Clover Health, SCAN Health Plan and Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey and Humana.  

The session ""Voices of Innovation: Transforming Healthcare in a Payer-Driven World,"" mirrors the title of the book ""Voices of Innovation - Payers,"" co-edited by Marx and Sakshika Dhingra, medical strategy director for Humana.

Clover Health has developed AI powered technology which enables it to harness big data and run algorithms to help with early diagnoses and better outcomes, said Aric Sharp, CEO of Value-Based Care at Clover Health.

""Culturally we encourage everyone to use AI,"" Sharp said. ""The core of our focus is at the point of care.""

Point-of-care solutions for most payers now include AI assistants and Chatbox, which can streamline member interactions.

Members want information quickly, said Heather Lavoie, chief information officer and executive vice president of Enterprise Operations for Blue Cross Blue Shield New Jersey. One of the pain points for patients is calling their insurer, she said. 

""People don't want to call us,"" Lavoie said. What they want is answers, she said. 

A more automated approach is helping with staff turnover, said Khin-Kyemon Aung, senior director of Healthcare Services, medical director and primary care physician for SCAN. 

It's difficult to find people to work in a call center, Lavoie said. AI can be used to do a summary of information for what's covered. This makes it easier for people to work at a higher level. 

""We're asking people to do the same job, but do it more effectively,"" Lavoie said.

AI is also helping with the bigger aims such as allowing outbound calls to be labeled correctly so case managers can implement stratification and nurses can rout cases appropriately by disease state, according to Lavoie.

It's being used for voice interpretation for patients with Parkinson's disease, she said. 

SCAN has started working with Cresta, Aung said. The AI-powered contact center platform provides real-time automation and guidance to chat agents as they navigate complex care conversations.

""It's listening in the background,"" she said.

Direct to consumer AI is making it easier for members, though there's real root causes that AI can't Band-aid over, Aung said.

""AI is an accelerator to all of these other technologies,"" Lavoie said. ""We're excited about technology."" . 

Plans focused on claims, but there's so much more, including member preference information, she said. 

""We're bringing in sensor data, health risk assessments to create better profiles of members,"" Lavoie said. 

Right now, AI is being used to make the way healthcare runs more efficiently, according to Sharp.

""We have to think about breaking the way the system works in its entirety,"" Sharp said, even suggesting that ""revenue cycle could go by the wayside if we look at entirely different models.""

Sharp said one of the biggest barriers to innovation is culture and people wanting to stay entrenched.

Aung mentioned the challenge of payer and provider alignment.

Sharp said payers and providers are solving problems in different ways. What's needed, he said, is to get on the same page and have one path.

Students, educators, counselors, and professionals across eastern Kentucky are invited to Shaping Our Appalachian Region, or SOAR's, Healthcare Career Pathway Fair. Officials said the university is a prime spot for the event because of its bolstered healthcare and education systems, though attendees will get to meet and network with professionals and organizations across the region.

Kirsten Wilburn is the Operations Manager with SOAR. She said one goal of the fair is to foster and encourage prospective healthcare workers to dedicate their service to eastern Kentucky, a region that's been hit hard by a lack of practitioners.

“We have an aging population of people who stay here, but our out migration is showing a younger population leaving,” said Wilburn. “So, our big thing is we need our youth to stay here to not only work and be part of this economic ecosystem in eastern Kentucky, but also to care for the generations that built this place for them.”

Wilburn added non-traditional students, including people who do not pursue a four-year degree immediately after high school, are a key population the fair hopes to reach. Sometimes, these students don't always see a clear path forward, and Wilburn said SOAR hopes to show these students that they can pursue healthcare in a multitude of ways.

“That doesn't always include four-year degrees. That includes two-year degrees, or training certifications. So, this whole event is really aimed to solidify that issue. We educate the students about it, but on the other side of that we educate the teachers and counselors who attend the event with the students,” said Wilburn.

The SOAR Healthcare Career Pathway Fair will be held on March 18, 9 a.m. 2 p.m. on MSU's campus. Attendees will participate in multiple hands-on educational workshops and networking sessions. Registration for students and school groups is available online.

Listen to this article 5 min

According to the state's Health Policy Commission, healthcare costs are growing faster than inflation, labor and wages.

As healthcare costs continue to skyrocket in Massachusetts, employer groups and taxpayer advocates once again told state officials that the affordability crisis is hurting business competitiveness and sustainability.

The Health Policy Commission held its annual health care cost benchmark hearing to review healthcare cost data with the Legislature's Joint Committee on Health Care Financing. The commission and other healthcare stakeholders assessed the most recent report from the Center for Health Information and Analysis, which confirmed that healthcare spending in the state is far exceeding targets. 

According to the HPC, healthcare costs are growing faster than inflation, labor and wages. 

Business leaders, speaking at the hearing and in written testimony, said it's not just individuals feeling the rising costs. The increasing healthcare spending is impacting all businesses, said Eileen McAnneny, president of the Employer Coalition on Health, a business group which launched last year to represent business interests in health policy.

McAnneny said the cost growth benchmark — a cap on growth to which healthcare organizations are intended to adhere — should be lower than the 3.6% it was in the past year. Statewide, spending growth was more than double that rate in 2023, the most recent year tracked in CHIA's reporting.

“If we want to reduce costs, we have to reduce the benchmark and impose stricter penalties,” McAnneny said. Doing so, she said, would “signal we are finally serious about getting healthcare costs under control.”

McAnneny pointed to Mass General Brigham's recent cost-cutting measures, which involve significant layoffs, as an example of ways providers can reduce unnecessary spending, along with adopting artificial intelligence tools to improve efficiency.

""Something's got to give,"" she said. 

Jon Hurst, president and CEO of the Massachusetts Retailers Association, said in a written statement that his members —  employers with less than 100 employees — are seeing big hikes in the cost of health insurance for employees. 

“Small business premium increases of two to three times the inflation rate and the benchmark are unacceptable, unaffordable, and extremely damaging to the competitiveness of the commonwealth,” Hurst said. 

Hurst said the benchmark needs “some level of teeth for real enforcement” — a critique of the agency that's been made repeatedly.

According to the HPC, “the healthcare cost growth benchmark is the centerpiece of the state's cost containment efforts.” As it stands, however, there is no specific enforcement action that the HPC can take against entities that exceed it. 

The HPC can put individual organizations on performance improvement plans if their costs increases are deemed excessive. It has so far done this only one time to compel Mass General Brigham, the state's largest healthcare organization, to control its spending. 

Lora Pellegrini, president and CEO of the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans, said that despite the fact that the benchmark has been exceeded frequently in recent years, it's still an important tool. Health insurers are struggling, she said, pointing to significant losses at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts and Point23Health, the parent company of Harvard Pilgrim and Tufts. Pellegrini said that the HPC should take steps to prevent providers from charging what she said are “excessive” prices and  double down on pharmaceutical oversight. 

“Pharmaceutical spending continues to rise unabated with limited accountability to the benchmark,” she said. She urged the commission and the joint committee to take steps to expand that oversight authority and establish a drug affordability board. 

The commission will meet in April to vote on the 2026 benchmark.

SACRAMENTO – California Gov. Gavin Newsom is seeking a $3.4 billion loan from the general fund to help a shortfall in the state Medi-Cal healthcare program. 

It comes a year after the governor expanded Medi-Cal to undocumented immigrants.

A spokesperson for the governor's office said the money was needed for several reasons, including rising costs of health care in general.

It's the state medical coverage of undocumented immigrants now creating political pushback. 

""More mismanagement by this governor,"" Republican Assembly Minority Leader James Gallagher said. 

Gallager was quick to pounce on the problem of the state health insurance program for low-income people. 

""What has been the biggest driver of cost to the medical system,"" Gallagher said. ""It's been adding illegal immigrants to those rolls.""

The estimated cost for Medi-Cal for undocumented immigrants ballooned from a projected $6.4 billion in July, to $9.5 billion now.

Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas issued a statement reading in part:

""There are tough choices ahead, and Assembly Democrats will closely examine any proposal from the governor. But let's be clear: We will not roll over and leave our immigrants behind.""

Jose Rodriguez is the president of El Concilio California, an immigrant rights organization that receives California funding to help sign people up for Medi-Cal.

""It just seems unfortunate that we're short on funding as a government we always want to scapegoat the immigrant community,"" Rodriguez said. ""These are some of the hardest working people in our country and doing the job that no one else wants to do.""

""I'm sure there will be an effort to roll back some of the access because the federal government is threatening to cut Medicaid,"" Rodriguez said.

Newsom rolled out the state's full-scope Medi-Cal expansion to undocumented immigrants in 2019 and expanded the program to all ages in 2024. 

Now there is new scrutiny over California healthcare costs that could lead to cuts. 

So far the governor's finance department has not released a detailed breakdown what caused the increase in healthcare costs or if there will be more money needed from the general fund on top of this loan.

Luigi Mangione's defense attorney in Pennsylvania continues to argue that Altoona police unlawfully detained the murder suspect and searched his belongings when they identified him at a McDonald's following a tip.

Mangione, 26, is charged with first-degree murder in furtherance of an act of terrorism, stalking and a slew of other state and federal charges in both New York and Pennsylvania, for allegedly gunning down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, a married father of two, on a sidewalk in Manhattan in December 2024.

Now his attorney says authorities' use of the word “manifesto” to describe Mangione's writings allegedly found in his backpack during his arrest on Dec. 9 is “incorrect.”

“The use of this characterization of the defendant's alleged personal experiences and writings is incorrect, improper and without justification and has no probative value,” Altoona-based defense attorney Thomas Dickey said in a Tuesday court filing. “Defendant believes that this characterization was done so solely for the purpose to prejudice the defendant and put him in a negative light before the public, all in an effort to prejudice any potential jury pool.”

Mangione allegedly shot Thompson outside the Manhattan hotel where UnitedHealthcare's annual shareholder conference was being held, in an act prosecutors believe was meant to send a message to the healthcare insurance industry based on a manifesto found on the suspect when he was arrested days after Thompson's murder.

In his writings, Mangione apparently expressed his grievances with the healthcare industry — specifically naming UnitedHealthcare and the shareholder conference where Thompson was headed in New York at the time of the assassination.

Dickey is asking the court not to describe Mangione's alleged writings as a “manifesto.”

He is also asking the court to suppress various other evidence, including what Dickey describes as a warrantless search of the suspect's backpack, statements made to police during his arrest and DNA evidence.

Mangione's attorney argued that Mangione had been improperly detained and arrested at the McDonald's, so certain evidence collected during that arrest should not be submitted as evidence against his client.

The 26-year-old suspect has a degree from the Ivy League University of Pennsylvania and attended an elite private high school in Baltimore.

Despite some supporters' characterization of him as an anti-capitalist crusader, he allegedly stopped at a New York City Starbucks for coffee minutes before the murder and was ultimately arrested while eating hashbrowns at McDonald's.

Mangione is accused of “meticulously” planning the murder with the motive of igniting a “public discussion about the healthcare industry,” according to the US Department of Justice.

New York prosecutors said Mangione plotted to travel to New York; find Thompson, a Minnesota resident in town for UnitedHealthcare's annual shareholder conference; and kill him.

Mangione allegedly shot Thompson from behind with a 3D-printed ghost gun and suppressor. 

The NYPD released a still image from surveillance video, showing him pulling his face mask down and smiling while flirting with a clerk at the check-in of the Manhattan hostel where police say he stayed for the murder. It went viral and immediately attracted a wave of support online for the accused killer.

The suspect allegedly fled the scene of Thompson's murder, rode a bike to a bus station and took a bus to Altoona, where he was ultimately identified and arrested.

Mangione is originally from Maryland and recently lived in California and Hawaii.

He graduated as valedictorian from the Gilman School, a private, all-boys high school in Baltimore, in 2016.

Mangione went on to receive his bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science from the University of Pennsylvania in 2020.","{'href': 'https://nypost.com', 'title': 'New York Post'}"

For once, most representatives from both parties agreed that action is necessary.

“I was encouraged by the engagement from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle,” Empath Health CEO Jonathan Fleece told me in an email after the March 11 hearing, at which he testified. “There was real recognition that home-based care is not only what patients and families want – it's a cost-effective, patient-centered solution that benefits the entire health care system.” 

At the hearing, Fleece offered compelling arguments regarding the paramount importance of home-based care. 

“Home-based care isn't just for those actively dying,” Fleece testified. “It supports people managing chronic illnesses, recovering from surgery and navigating terminal diagnosis. Patients want it. Families need it, and taxpayers benefit. Keeping patients at home prevents costly hospitalizations and reduces strain on the health care system. Today, in a time of financial and workforce challenges, we should be expanding access to care at home, not cutting it.” 

The hearing was not the only action in the nation's capital this week, as the House also passed a continuing resolution that includes extensions of the hospital-at-home and telehealth waivers that at-home care providers have been pushing for. 

While that is welcome news, the ongoing wrangling over the budget also underscores just how unlikely it will be that the bipartisan tenor of the hearing will translate into actual policy changes. And the hearing also surfaced some of the tensions about policies that could benefit some post-acute providers but might not be the best moves for at-home care.

In this week's exclusive HHCN+ Update for members only, I provide an analysis and key takeaways, including: 

In his testimony, Fleece laid out policy priorities and also emphasized the high stakes involved.

He called on lawmakers to pursue three goals: expanding government investment in home-based care, expanding pay-for-performance models to reward high-quality providers and enhancing value-based care models. 

“These are not just policy decisions,” Fleece said. “They represent urgent threats to access, quality and patient choice. The decisions made here will shape the future of home care. Let's protect and expand access before it's too late.” 

As of 2024, 58.9 million Americans age 65 or older were enrolled in Medicare. Nearly 40% of Medicare beneficiaries are discharged to post-acute care, with home health being the most commonly used setting, according to the National Institutes of Health. 

Most seniors want to receive care in this setting — in the comfort of their surroundings with family and friends — often achieving better patient outcomes than facility-based services. However, further reimbursement cuts threaten these positive outcomes, and in some cases, patient lives are at stake. 

My 78-year-old mother had a knee replacement a couple of years ago. She was told she would need physical therapy after her surgery. She resisted because she thought that meant remaining in the hospital. 

While in the hospital, she experienced heightened anxiety and depression due to being away from her home and animals. After she was assured a therapist would come to her house to deliver care, she agreed immediately and was discharged within a day. 

Without home health care, my mother would have declined a much-needed service. She has since had a second knee replacement surgery and lives a healthy, active life.  

With the policy and regulation changes currently on the table, this type of care could become obsolete, and seniors like my mother will walk away from acute-care settings with only a fraction of the care they need being provided. Our aging population deserves better than that. 

Fleece acknowledged that the hearing was a step forward, but work is still left to do. 

“I hope that Congress takes meaningful action to support home-based care – expanding access, reducing barriers and investing in the people who make this care possible,” he said. “I look forward to continuing this conversation in the weeks and months ahead.” 

As Fleece made clear in his comments, the need for more comprehensive support for post-acute care is urgent, but different types of providers do not necessarily agree on the specific actions to be taken. One case in point, which was a topic of the hearing, is a unified post-acute care payment system.

In 2014, the Improving Medicare Post Acute Care Transformation (IMPACT) Act was signed into law. The main goal of this Act was to establish a unified post-acute care prospective payment system (PAC PPS). Congress mandated CMS to deliver operational specifications of a payment system that is ready for implementation.

The Trump administration's 2021 budget proposal included reforms to implement the PAC PPS. If implemented, the reform would have saved $80 billion in the 10-year budget window, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). 

“To further advance efforts toward a unified PAC PPS, CMS submitted the technical prototype to Congress in 2022,” Lisa Grabert, Marquette University research professor, testified during the hearing. “The main finding was the prototype is capable of Congress's intent toward a unified payment approach for post-acute services. Simply put, the unified PAC PPS is ready. I strongly recommend that Congress give CMS the authority to implement the unified PAC PPS.” 

Grabert went on to say that a unified PAC PPS may eliminate the need for several existing policies, including the home-bound requirement for home health services, the three-day inpatient hospital stay requirement for nursing homes, the 60% rule for rehab hospitals and the site-neutral payment criteria for long-term care hospitals. 

“There may also be rules that are appropriate to waive in the interim while the transition to a unified PAC PPS is underway,” she noted. “Congress should only consider regulatory relief in tandem with a unified PAC PPS. These regulatory policies are of high value to the industry-specific providers who receive FFS payments and are likely to add to the deficit. Revenue generated from implementing a non-budget-neutral unified PAC PPS is necessary to offset spending related to regulatory relief.” 

Not all industry insiders believe Grabert's proposal is good for home-based care. 

“The panel of witnesses brought many of the concerns we see in post-acute care,” Kornetti & Krafft Health Care Solutions CFO Sherry Teague told me. “However, the unified payor bill that Ms. Grabert lauded does not consider the uniqueness of home health. All other settings have a consistent brick-and-mortar aspect. We in home health never know what we are walking into. I feel she disregarded Medicare Advantage's impact on everything in post-acute care. This impact is almost always negative and more costly than traditional fee-for-service Medicare.” 

In a small win for home-based care, the House passed a continuing resolution on March 11, including a provision to extend the CMS Hospital-at-Home (HaH) waiver program and telehealth flexibilities through Sept. 30, pending Senate approval. 

The HaH program was initially scheduled to end on March 31. In February, the in-home care advocacy group Moving Health Home and nearly 100 backers sent a letter to Congress urging a five-year extension for the waiver. 

As of November 2024, 378 hospitals across 140 systems in 39 states have received approval to provide HaH services to patients, according to the American Hospital Association (AHA).

And Fleece spoke about the importance of telehealth to home-based care organizations.

“Telemedicine is a critical part of ensuring access to care, whether its recertification of hospice eligibility or ensuring that in crisis we can get access from a communications perspective to all of our patients,” Fleece said. “It is also mission critical to our home-based care organizations that those that are suffering chronic disease or are post-acute to ensure that home-based care is there for the rural communities through telemedicine to reduce hospitalizations, readmissions that home-based care has been proven to demonstrate.”

 Telehealth flexibilities are important to a variety of providers, with the AHA also weighing in on their potential extension.

“The American Hospital Association appreciates the House of Representatives extending these vital health policies that enable hospitals and health systems to serve their patients and communities without disruption,” an AHA spokesperson told me. “We remain committed to advocating for long-term solutions that advance health within Congress this year.”  

Now, it is all in the hands of the Senate. Hopefully, we will see an acceptable resolution soon that will extend the telehealth and HaH programs. But even more than that, here's hoping that the hearing this week is a step toward Congress considering not just money matters but what really matters – quality patient care at home.

Elon Musk's electric carmaker Tesla has warned it and other US exporters could be harmed by countries retaliating to Donald Trump's trade tariffs.

Mr Musk is a close ally of the US president and is leading efforts to reduce the size of the federal government.

But in an unsigned letter addressed to the US trade representative, Tesla said while it ""supports"" fair trade it was concerned US exporters were ""exposed to disproportionate impacts"" if other countries retaliated to tariffs.

The letter was dated the same day that Trump hosted an event at the White House where he promised to buy a Tesla in a show of support for Mr Musk.

It is unclear who at Tesla wrote the letter as it is unsigned, or if Mr Musk was aware of it.

Tesla's share price has dropped 40% since the start of the year. Mr Musk is the carmaker's chief executive and while some have argued his alignment with the Trump administration is hurting its brand, market analysts say the share fall is more about worries over Tesla meeting production targets and a drop in sales over the past year.

In the letter, Tesla said it was making changes to its supply chains to find as many local suppliers for its cars and batteries so it was less reliant on foreign markets. 

""None the less,"" it warned, ""even with aggressive localisation of the supply chain, certain parts and components are difficult or impossible to source within the US.""

The US president has imposed an additional 20% tariff on all imports from China, prompting Beijing to respond with retaliatory levies including on cars. China is Tesla's second biggest market after the US.

""For example, past trade actions by the United States have resulted in immediate reactions by the targeted countries, including increased tariffs on EVs imported into those countries,"" the letter reads. 

The EU and Canada have both threatened sweeping retaliations for tariffs on steel and aluminium imports into the US, which went into effect earlier this week.

Demonstrators have targeted Tesla showrooms in recent weeks in protest against Mr Musk's cost-cutting role in Trump's administration, where he is head of the  Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).

Earlier this week, Trump hosted an event at the White House where he said people protesting against Tesla should be labelled domestic terrorists, while sitting in the driver's seat of a brand new red Tesla that he said he planned to buy. 

Trump said demonstrators were ""harming a great American company"", and anyone using violence against the electric carmaker would ""go through hell"".

Car sharing has not taken off, but will electric cars boost its appeal?

The  deputy first minister has said she engages ""with the office of president"" rather than his ""particular personal views"".

Wine and spirits will be taxed, Trump says, if the EU does not remove tariffs on US whiskey.

The tariffs imposed by Donald Trump could not come at a worse time, says the steel industry body.

The Irish Whiskey Association urged the US and EU to engage in dialogue amidst an escalating trade war.

As the DJC reported last month, Tom's Watch Bar was then very close to opening at Seattle Center. The city issued a temporary certificate of occupancy last week, and Tom's announced on Wednesday that it was officially open. (Patrons were observed inside on Tuesday evening, sipping beer and cheerfully noshing away.)

The sports bar occupies the landmarked former Bressi Garage, now with a second-story addition and wraparound terrace that looks north to Climate Pledge Arena and west to Elliott Bay. The sports bar now goes by 105 Lenny Wilkens Way ; that's on the corner of First Avenue North.

The chain now lists a dozen-plus locations nationwide. Its co-CEO Brooks Schaden said in a statement, “Our concept provides the perfect complement not just to live sports, but to all entertainment experiences, creating a hub where Seattle's passionate fans can gather before, during, and after games, concerts, and events.”

Co-CEO Shannon McNiel added, “From our unique service model that delivers food hot in under eight minutes to our diverse menu featuring elevated sports bar classics, we've created an environment where fans can enjoy the game while experiencing the quality and atmosphere they deserve.”

Seattle Center still owns the building, but Oak View Group controls the property via its lease and renovation, working with Wilcox Construction and architect Generator Studio. Oak View's Josh Pell said, “Tom's Watch Bar will create an immersive, fun experience for the thousands of fans visiting our arena each year.” (Oak View Group previously renovated Climate Pledge Arena, and is about to do the same with Memorial Stadium.)

New windows make for a much more inviting frontage.









The DJC paid a visit to Tom's yesterday evening, not long before the puck drop between the Kraken and Montreal Canadiens. People were proudly wearing those jerseys — and some from cities beyond. There were lots of kids and family groups.

Meanwhile, on TV, USC was playing Rutgers in the Big Ten championships. Tom's boasts over 100 screens; some broadcast sports, and others sport-adjacent programming like Japanese reality TV contests. (On one screen, men in brightly colored skins suits were vainly attempting to climb a staircase made of ice. Prince's fabled Super Bowl halftime show was playing on another.) Future programming also includes the upcoming NCAA basketball tournament and UFC fight nights. Look elsewhere for World Cup skiing or the Tour de France.

Tom's advertises 50-plus beers and more than 50 specialty cocktails. Its menu ranges from grilled chicken avocado salad to bar staples like wings and tater tots. The website doesn't list prices; nor did a bar menu, but a $10 Lagunitas IPA tasted just fine.

Inside the lofty space, concrete floors, boisterous patrons, ambient music, hard-surfaced furniture and the high, trussed ceiling contribute to a loud, cacophonous room tone. In surprising number (perhaps over-staffed?), friendly greeters whisk customers to their tables; Tom's is a little more systematized than your average sports bar — one doesn't just casually wander in to find a seat. Doorways are poorly marked; you can't enter from First, and more signage is needed. Bathrooms have a communal, all-gender vibe, though with private stalls.

Owing to the slope of First Avenue, Tom's steps down one floor on its main level; then there are stairs and an elevator up to the second floor. There, the large outdoor terrace has commanding views and a nice perspective on the sun setting over the bay. When the weather warms, that'll be a popular spot to hang.

The new steel structural work — a full seismic retrofit was required, and to support the second floor — is very impressive. Once a humble garage, constructed in 1923, the building is now a welcoming, bustling space. Previously, Pottery Northwest only occupied about half the building; the rest was used by Seattle Center maintenance crews. So, for the first time, it feels available to the paying public.

The team for the 24,175-square-foot project also included LPC West, owner's rep; Latitude 48, civil engineer; Magnusson Klemencic Associates, structural engineer; Bush, Roed & Hitchings, surveyor; Ron Wright & Associates, historic preservation consultant; Cosco Fire Protection; Wrecking Ball, demolition; and Evergreen Contracting, demo and hauling.

   


Tom's has a second announced location in Pioneer Square, near Lumen Field. It's taking the vacant former Quality Athletics space, at 121 S. King St. Work there hasn't yet begun. The Pioneer Square Preservation Board is still evaluating that mostly cosmetic renovation plan. One Line Studio, of Colorado, is the architect there. DCI Engineers is also consulting on the job. That's expected to open this year, probably in time for football season.

The team for the 24,175-square-foot project also included LPC West, owner's rep; Latitude 48, civil engineer; Magnusson Klemencic Associates, structural engineer; Bush, Roed & Hitchings, surveyor; Ron Wright & Associates, historic preservation consultant; Cosco Fire Protection; Wrecking Ball, demolition; and Evergreen Contracting, demo and hauling.

   


Tom's has a second announced location in Pioneer Square, near Lumen Field. It's taking the vacant former Quality Athletics space, at 121 S. King St. Work there hasn't yet begun. The Pioneer Square Preservation Board is still evaluating that mostly cosmetic renovation plan. One Line Studio, of Colorado, is the architect there. DCI Engineers is also consulting on the job. That's expected to open this year, probably in time for football season.

Seattle Center still owns the building, but Oak View Group controls the property via its lease and renovation, working with Wilcox Construction and architect Generator Studio. Oak View's Josh Pell said, “Tom's Watch Bar will create an immersive, fun experience for the thousands of fans visiting our arena each year.” (Oak View Group previously renovated Climate Pledge Arena, and is about to do the same with Memorial Stadium.)

New windows make for a much more inviting frontage.









The DJC paid a visit to Tom's yesterday evening, not long before the puck drop between the Kraken and Montreal Canadiens. People were proudly wearing those jerseys — and some from cities beyond. There were lots of kids and family groups.

Meanwhile, on TV, USC was playing Rutgers in the Big Ten championships. Tom's boasts over 100 screens; some broadcast sports, and others sport-adjacent programming like Japanese reality TV contests. (On one screen, men in brightly colored skins suits were vainly attempting to climb a staircase made of ice. Prince's fabled Super Bowl halftime show was playing on another.) Future programming also includes the upcoming NCAA basketball tournament and UFC fight nights. Look elsewhere for World Cup skiing or the Tour de France.

Tom's advertises 50-plus beers and more than 50 specialty cocktails. Its menu ranges from grilled chicken avocado salad to bar staples like wings and tater tots. The website doesn't list prices; nor did a bar menu, but a $10 Lagunitas IPA tasted just fine.

Inside the lofty space, concrete floors, boisterous patrons, ambient music, hard-surfaced furniture and the high, trussed ceiling contribute to a loud, cacophonous room tone. In surprising number (perhaps over-staffed?), friendly greeters whisk customers to their tables; Tom's is a little more systematized than your average sports bar — one doesn't just casually wander in to find a seat. Doorways are poorly marked; you can't enter from First, and more signage is needed. Bathrooms have a communal, all-gender vibe, though with private stalls.

Owing to the slope of First Avenue, Tom's steps down one floor on its main level; then there are stairs and an elevator up to the second floor. There, the large outdoor terrace has commanding views and a nice perspective on the sun setting over the bay. When the weather warms, that'll be a popular spot to hang.

The new steel structural work — a full seismic retrofit was required, and to support the second floor — is very impressive.

The Pioneer Square Preservation Board is still evaluating that mostly cosmetic renovation plan. One Line Studio, of Colorado, is the architect there. DCI Engineers is also consulting on the job.

Owing to the slope of First Avenue, Tom's steps down one floor on its main level; then there are stairs and an elevator up to the second floor. There, the large outdoor terrace has commanding views and a nice perspective on the sun setting over the bay. When the weather warms, that'll be a popular spot to hang.

The new steel structural work — a full seismic retrofit was required, and to support the second floor — is very impressive. Once a humble garage, constructed in 1923, the building is now a welcoming, bustling space.

				Practice Range & Teaching 

St Andrews Links Trust is to stage a series disability golf coaching sessions at its golf academy in March and April as part of Scottish Golf's new Community Disability Hub Programme. 

Five venues across Scotland will be hosting the programme's inclusive sessions, which are open to individuals who have a physical, sensory, or learning disability, no matter their circumstances or golfing experience. The Trust is the only location in Fife to be taking part.

This initiative feeds into the Trust's wider objective of widening access to golf, so that anyone who wants to try golf for the first time or develop their skills further can do so.

It comes after the Trust hosted the 30th Phoenix Cup on the Old Course, New Course and Jubilee Course in October 2024. The Phoenix Cup is played by disabled golfers from around Europe and the United States. It is the only fully inclusive amateur match play team golf event in the world, inspired by the Ryder Cup and Solheim Cup. 

The Community Disability Hub Programme offers safe, engaging and fun sessions, with club volunteers, Community Golf Instructors and PGA Professionals on hand to tailor lessons to suit individuals' abilities.

Four sessions will take place at St Andrews Links Academy, from Saturday 22 March until Saturday 26 April. Anyone with a disability who would like to take part in the sessions at St Andrews Links, is encouraged to sign up using the link here.

Paul Ellison, disability golfer and caddie manager at St Andrews Links Trust, said: “Golf is one of the most incredible and enriching sports to play, but those with a disability face unique challenges and hurdles. Having tailored sessions that allow people to feel comfortable on the course and develop their swing is a fantastic and unique opportunity. This will make a real difference to a lot of people that otherwise might struggle to participate in golf.”

He added: “We have been provided with some fantastic opportunities through the DP World Tour, EDGA and the R&A to showcase the skills of golfers with a disability. This new initiative, through St Andrews Links Trust and Scottish Golf is a welcome addition. Hopefully this will give new players a chance to learn the game of golf and give experienced players an opportunity to further develop their skills.”

David Watt, golf academy operations manager at St Andrews Links Golf Academy, said: “One of the Trust's core missions is to widen participation in golf. This means we have to think carefully about every aspect of the facilities we provide to ensure we are inclusive and welcoming for all.

“Holding accessible coaching sessions at our Golf Academy, in partnership with Scottish Golf's Community Disability Hub Programme, illustrates our commitment to this mission. We want to reduce the barriers that prevent people from playing golf, and our Golf Academy is a safe, relaxed environment to take this further. We encourage any individuals with a physical, sensory, or learning disability, no matter your level of experience or circumstance, to sign up for the sessions, have fun and learn from some great golfers.”

Alan Oliver, equality, diversity and inclusion manager at Scottish Golf, said: “It is Scottish Golf's aspiration to build community disability hubs across the country, as we believe in providing opportunities for individuals to enjoy all the benefits the sport can offer, both socially and competitively. We are thrilled to be able to offer these disability opportunities and hopefully we will see many more participants joining us on their golfing journey.

“Scottish Golf are delighted to be working collaboratively with St Andrews Links Trust to deliver community disability opportunities for those who are starting out within the sport and want to find their feet or for emerging golfer's looking for a space to develop and thrive in a safe environment. We're confident that the Trust shares the same core values of our disability hub programme and will help to make this a positive, sustainable initiative.”

Resorts and clubs from across the UK & Ireland came together at The Double Tree by Hilton at Stadium MK last night [March 13], as 59club UK and Ireland recognised the outstanding venues, teams and individuals in the golf, leisure and spa industry.

59club's accolades are awarded based on scores from their impartial mystery shopping audits, evaluating the guest, club member, and prospective member experience according to 59club's objective benchmarking criteria.

With awards spanning 13 categories recognising service excellence – in management, sales, service, operations, retail, spa, golf course management, and food & beverage – 59club continues to honour the best performances across venue of all sizes and profiles, segmenting their main individual award titles into three tiers based on a properties average green fee rate. 

Will Hewitt, General Manager of 59club UK, commented: “It is essential to celebrate those who go above and beyond to provide outstanding experiences for their members and guests. With over 250 venues now working with 59club in this region, those nominated for an award really are some of the very best in our business and we are delighted to recognise their performance on this special night.”

The evening honoured some incredible achievements with Ballybunion retaining their title of Ultimate Members Club for the second consecutive year.

The Grove claimed Ultimate Resort, and also saw Joel Westwell named Golf Manager of the Year, alongside his team who collected Golf Operations Team of the year.

A number of Irish venues were honoured with Eddie Devane and Martin Lehane from Mount Juliet winning F&B Manager of the Year and Greenkeeper of the Year in their respective categories, together with John Dwyer of Royal Dublin who was named Retail Manager of the Year. 

Wales and the South West were also well represented with Paul Thomas from Newport GC and Giuseppe Licata from Filton GC claiming retail awards and Mike Bush from St Mellion celebrating retaining the greenkeeping team of the year award for the resort.

The two outstanding individual performers which nobody seems able to surpass remain Glen McNaughton from Long Ashton GC, who retained the title of Food and Beverage Manager of the Year for a sixth consecutive year and Matt Aplin from Goring and Streatley GC who was named Greenkeeper of the Year for a seventh consecutive year.

The celebrations concluded with 59club Flag Designations, recognising clubs and resorts that strive for excellence, in both customer experience and the facilities they afford their members and guests.

The pinnacle of these awards will see a number of regional winners invited to represent their club and Country at 59club's first ever Global Awards, taking place later this summer at The Belfry Hotel & Resort.

				Greenkeeping & Agronomy 

With Toro's new range of robotic mowing solutions for the fairway and rough now available through UK distributor Reesink Turfcare, golf course managers and greenkeepers can focus on getting the job done consistently and efficiently and prioritise their time and skill on preparing greens, tees and bunkers. 

“The arrival of autonomous technology is what we've all been waiting for,” says Jon Cole, Divisional Business Manager for Reesink Turfcare. “And Toro's vision of this delivers professional-quality results with minimal input required, solving the problem of reduced resources, labour shortages, and rising operational costs.”

All the products launching simultaneously – the Toro GeoLink Solutions Autonomous Fairway Mower, Turf Pro range of robot mowers and Range Pro ball picker – work on Real Time Kinematic geo-positioning technology coming from a GPS-based satellite system for ultra-precise navigation.

This functionality allows for areas to be mapped, setting invisible boundaries in which the machines can operate autonomously. When they reach the edge of the predefined work zone based on satellite positioning, they intelligently keep within it. 

Operation is straightforward: wireless monitoring and control of the units is through a computer or mobile phone where it is possible to customise working perimeters, no-go zones, mowing patterns, cutting height and transport paths.

No boundary wires are required, the mowers can mow a consistent pattern with minimal overlap and are accurate to 2cm. The system can identify missed areas and will reroute the mower to cover them later.

Cole adds: “These mowers free up your greenkeeping team to focus on the essential attentive care that the tees, greens, and bunkers require, while Toro technology carefully maintains the fairways and roughs, intelligently working with minimal input.” 



The Toro GeoLink Solutions Autonomous Fairway Mower is a hybrid mower. It has a Kawasaki engine but steering, traction, lift and lowering of the cylinder units are electric. The mower still has a seat and a steering wheel; this is because it has both manual and autonomous modes. In manual it'll operate just like a normal triplex so if the operator wants to move it to a new location that isn't mapped yet or support a different area on the course, they can. 

There are three fully robotic models in the Turf Pro range. There's the choice of three or five cutting heads providing a cutting width of 63.3cm (25ins) in the Turf Pro 300 and 103.3cm (40.7ins) for the Turf Pro 500. They can mow up to 18.5 acres (75,000m2) and there's a model for use on slopes of up to 24 degrees. 

They are all-electric, self-charging and automatically return to the charging station. And through increased mowing frequency these mowers can purposefully remove less leaf tissue, producing shorter clippings and with adjustable mowing patterns can be utilised to achieve multiple aesthetics.

Cole concludes: “Toro developed this technology and these products in direct response to customer feedback and research. It was clear there was a changing mindset about what was needed regarding labour support, combatting increasing operational costs and how to approach mowing grass. This productive solution eases labour resource pains and provides operational cost savings with no change in Toro's world-renowned cutting performance.”

A ‘Who's Who' of international golf destinations will meet face-to-face with the world's best golf tour operators this autumn as the second edition of Elevate Golf returns to St Andrews.

Four months on from the inaugural Elevate Golf event – which saw leading golf courses, accommodation providers and international tour operators connect for over 3,000 tailor-made appointments – the invite-only event continues to attract widespread demand across the industry.

Close to 180 suppliers – representing international golf courses and resorts seeking to attract golfers looking for premium golf and hospitality experiences – have signed up for the 2025 renewal, gathering at the Fairmont St Andrews with a small group of international tour operators specifically invited to ensure all courses and hotels enjoy quality appointments.





Although suppliers were largely from the United Kingdom and Ireland at last year's inaugural Elevate Golf event, a select few premium European venues were also present. This year's event will, however, see a noticeable increase in attendees from the continent – including from Spain and Portugal – as more destinations recognise the growing importance of international golf tourism.

Elevate Golf 2025 will also welcome several venue's from outside of Europe for the very first time. Many venues from the Middle East will be in attendance, while the international flavour of the event is further complemented with Caribbean destinations such as Albany Bahamas and Puntacana Resort & Club also in attendance. The growing list of destinations join the established bedrock of suppliers, including all the Open Championship rota courses.

Alex Shattuck, CEO of PerryGolf, commented: “Elevate is a tremendous event. Not only the quality of the content but also the quality of the attendees – it really is the who's who in the world of golf and travel. We are in the relationship business and the opportunity to meet face-to-face is invaluable.”

Nuno Sepúlveda, Co-CEO of Details Hospitality Sports & Leisure, which manages several renowned golf courses in Portugal, said: “The meetings we have at Elevate are key. Elevate is different from other B2B and trade events with different clientele and for us this helps open up doors to the American and Canadian markets while also learning how the Scottish, Irish and UK market are so successful in this area. Having those meetings at St Andrews is also a wonderful experience.”

Held between October 26-31, Elevate Golf 2025 will begin with a two-night stay in Liverpool with suppliers and tour operators invited to sample the city's culture and play golf on the wonderful Northwest coast. On arrival in Scotland, connecting on a round of golf at one of seven courses will be an option for attendees – golf will be available at Carnoustie Golf Links, Dumbarnie, North Berwick, Gullane, Royal Troon, Western Gailes or Prestwick – before the face-to-face business meetings begin on October 30. 

Meetings will continue through until the afternoon of October 31, before a gala dinner celebrating global golf tourism is held. Last year's event saw Sam Baker, founder and chairman of tour operator Haversham & Baker, receive a warm reception as he collected Elevate Golf's lifetime achievement award – an award which will return in 2025.

What's next for the campus?","https://www.nola.com/news/business/jefferson-parish-ready-to-buy-hope-haven-from-catholic-church-whats-next-for-the-campus/article_a9f2c69a-0074-11f0-a9f9-bfee3f2b0196.html","Fri, 14 Mar 2025 15:05:00 GMT","

























 The Jefferson Parish Council has reached a deal with the Archdiocese of New Orleans to purchase Hope Haven in Marrero, the former orphanage where dozens of children were physically, sexually and psychologically abused decades ago by priests, brothers and nuns charged with caring for them.

The parish has been leasing the 15-acre campus, with its sprawling grounds and century-old, Spanish mission-style buildings, from the local Roman Catholic Church since 2018, and has already built a walking trail and recreational area on a portion of the site.

Now, it is moving forward with plans to purchase the property for $3.8 million and turn it into a multi-use complex that could include expanded recreational areas, festival grounds, educational attractions and, potentially, offices or apartments.

The redevelopment of Hope Haven by the parish is seen as a way to breathe new life into what stands as a stark reminder of one of the darkest chapters in the clergy abuse scandal, said Republican state Sen. Pat Connick, who represents the area and has been leading efforts to facilitate the deal between the parish, state, archdiocese and abuse survivors.

As part of the deal, the parish has agreed to create a memorial on the site in honor of the victims.

“This could be a win-win-win for everybody -- to put the property back into commerce and bring good life back to the campus,” Connick said. “Evil, sick things took place there but it is time to try to heal.”

The archdiocese, which filed for bankruptcy court protection nearly five years ago amid mounting claims of clergy sex abuse, will need permission from the court to sell the property. Thus far, it has not finalized a purchase agreement.

But all parties have agreed to the deal in principle, according to leaders with the parish, state and archdiocese.

“There are still some details to be worked out,” archdiocese spokesperson Sarah McDonald said in a statement Thursday. “But the site will become home to a permanent memorial to the memory and strength of abuse survivors.""

Attorneys for the committee of abuse victims did not return a call seeking comment on the deal. But another attorney, Frank LaMothe, who has represented dozens of Hope Haven survivors over the years, said he thinks his past and current clients would be supportive of creating a monument there.

“It would mean a lot to them to know there is a recognition of what they went through,” Lamothe said, adding that he could not comment on the sale specifically because he has not been involved in the negotiations.

Hope Haven opened in 1925 on the west side of Barataria Boulevard, next to what is now Archbishop Shaw High School, to provide care for needy children and wards of the state. A few years later, Madonna Manor opened across the street.

Madonna Manor took in young children from families unable to care for them and children placed there by courts as wards of the state. Hope Haven was a home for older children.

In the early 2000s, nearly two dozen lawsuits were filed against the archdiocese and its affiliate, Catholic Charities, by adults who claimed they were molested, beaten and berated as children in the 1950s and 1960s by the priests and nuns that ran the two orphanages.  The archdiocese settled the suits for nearly $5.2 million in 2009.

Fresh lawsuits were filed nearly a decade later, alleging abuse that occurred at Hope Haven and Madonna Manor in the 1970s and 1980s. The suits were filed in 2018, after Archbishop Gregory Aymond released a list of credibly accused priests that included the names of eight priests who had worked at the orphanages.

In May 2020, the archdiocese filed for bankruptcy. In the years since, some 550 abuse survivors have filed claims alleging past abuse.  

Hope Haven would be the latest of nearly a dozen properties the church has sold as it seeks to raise money to settle claims. So far, the property sales have generated about $15 million, a fraction of the amount sought by victims, who have asked the archdiocese and local parishes to pony up more than $200 million, not including separate contributions they are seeking from church insurers.

At $3.85 million, the 15-acre campus Hope Haven campus, ringed with live oaks, might seem like a relative deal. The complex includes two large, century-old buildings of around 30,000 square feet each; a gymnasium dating back to 1930, and several smaller buildings. It was last appraised for $8 million, Parish Council member Deano Bonano said.

But since Jefferson began leasing the property from the archdiocese in 2018, the parish and state have spent nearly $5 million gutting, shoring and stabilizing the historic main building, which the archdiocese had allowed to deteriorate.

It has also spent a considerable amount developing a portion of the site into a recreational area with a 1/3-mile walking trail that snakes around the campus, a children's playground and an adult fitness area.

“Given what we have in it, we felt this was a fair price and it was in our best interest to buy it,” Bonano said.

Under the terms of the deal, the parish will put up $1.4 million towards the purchase price, money that the council approved at its meeting earlier this month. The state is contributing $2.4 million.

For Connick, who led the efforts to get the state money, the revival of Hope Haven has become something of a passion project.

“This could be something so positive for the community,” said Connick, whose grandfather ran a dairy farm near the campus a century ago.

There's no timeline for the deal to be finalized. But, once it is, the parish will begin advertising for proposals from developers interested in the site. A master plan for the property in 2022 suggests developing an aquatic center with indoor and outdoor pools and an outdoor concert venue, as well as an expanded recreational area.

Bonano says parish leaders envision it as “the center for health and fitness in West Jefferson,” much as Lafreniere Park is on the East Bank.  

The master plan also suggests leasing the two main buildings for use as senior or assisted living facilities, medical offices or apartments, and using the lease proceeds to pay for the other amenities.

The YMCA is also potentially interested in the site.

Connick said he'd like to see a children's museum in one of the buildings.

“Why not think big?” he said. “This is an opportunity to create something special for this side of the parish.”

Hudson's Bay Company is nearly a billion dollars in debt, according to court filings that paint a dire portrait of the struggling Canadian department store chain's finances. 

The documents were submitted as part of its creditor protection filing last week. The company owes a total of $950 million to nearly 2,000 secured and unsecured creditors, including well-known apparel and beauty brands like Adidas Canada, Estée Lauder, L'Oréal Canada, Levi Strauss Canada, Michael Kors Canada, Nike Canada and Ralph Lauren.

""The scale is certainly monumental for insolvency proceedings as far as Canada goes. It's a very large one,"" said Dina Kovacevic, editor-in-chief of Insolvency Insider Canada. But it's not a surprise, she said.

""Retailers in the last several years since the COVID pandemic have really been having a hard time with less foot traffic and all of the economic issues that have been going on in the world. So while it is monumental, I think we were probably expecting it. There have been a lot of retailer filings in the last several years.""

The company owes more than $1 million to Canada Post, and is in debt to over a dozen municipalities. The list doesn't include debts owed to government agencies, a figure that the filing says is unknown at this time. The amount owed to employees is to be determined, per the filing.

At the beginning of the year, Hudson's Bay had just $3 million in cash and cash equivalents, the documents show. The $1.1 billion it owes in secured debt includes $724.4 million in mortgages.

Secured creditors are lenders, like banks, which give out loans to companies. To ensure they are paid back, the creditor takes on some of the company's assets as collateral. Unsecured creditors are usually employees and suppliers, ""and unfortunately they tend to be at the bottom of the food chain, so to speak,"" said Kovacevic.

""For any employees that get terminated throughout the process, unfortunately their termination and severance pay will be an unsecured claim, which means that they will likely receive cents on the dollar for those claims,"" she explained.

The Bay announced last week that it was seeking creditor protection, with its chief executive pointing to the COVID-19 pandemic and an ongoing trade war with the U.S. as external factors that have put financial pressure on the company.

Some experts say that the Bay's decline began long before the pandemic, tracing its issues back to its 2008 acquisition by the American investment firm NRDC Equity Partners, and saying that the company's new ownership prioritized its real estate over a cohesive retail strategy.

The company's lack of investment in its stores became evident in recent years, with floors understaffed, escalators and elevators in disrepair and faulty HVAC systems leading to temporary closures last summer.

Los Angeles Rams, from left, Nsimba Webster, Aaron Neary and Ketner Kupp pose together after a preseason NFL football game against the Dallas Cowboys Saturday, Aug. 17, 2019, in Honolulu. The Cowboys won 14-10. 

HONOLULU (Island News) -- A marketing partnership between the state of Hawaii and the NFL's Los Angeles Rams that includes various marketing activities in the Los Angeles area, Japan and on Maui this year is in the works.

This week, the state Procurement Office approved a procurement exemption to possibly work directly on a partnership with the Rams.

Hawaii is partnering with the LA Rams in a marketing deal that includes activities in LA, Japan and Maui.

No contract has been signed yet.

A proposed contract could include the Hawaii Tourism Authority being a title sponsor of a Rams home game at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, according to public documents. The HTA has a pre-existing relationship with the Rams dating back to the 2019 preseason game.

Due to the NFL geographic markets, only the Rams could feasibly host team activities in Hawaii as the state is considered as part of the team's regional market, according to the HTA, which also noted that the L.A. market is the most critical domestic market due to the large volume of travelers arriving in Hawaii from the area.

Hawaii Gov. Josh Green led a group of dignitaries last year in an effort to regenerate tourism and to thank California for giving Maui support.

Following the wildfire tragedy in Lahaina, the Rams had t-shirts made in support of Maui with all proceeds going to the relief efforts while teaming with the other 11 L.A.-based sports teams to donate $450,000 to the cause.

Last year, HTA entered into a $750,000 contract that brought another professional sports team from L.A. to the islands—the L.A. Clippers, which played a preseason game in Honolulu against the Golden State Warriors. Both teams also held training camps on Oahu.

The contract included the Clippers doing several community events in the state including youth basketball clinics, school computer lab renovations and VIP meet and greets with players and staff.

Writer

The Ravens' approach to the initial wave of free agency has been on brand.

While other teams have gone on shopping sprees in a seller's market, General Manager Eric DeCosta prioritized signing his own players (left tackle Ronnie Stanley, fullback Patrick Ricard, and reportedly wide receiver/special-teamer Tylan Wallace) and making selective additions (wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins, special teams ace/inside linebacker Jake Hummel).

The Athletic's Jeff Zrebiec said it's been a good week for the Ravens, but there is still ""serious business"" to be done.

""So far, the Ravens have done just fine. Better than that,"" Zrebiec wrote. ""Their personnel losses have been minimal, and they were winners in free agency at the very moment when they agreed to the three-year deal with Stanley. Navigating the next couple of months of roster-building without a bona fide left tackle on the roster would have been a nightmare scenario. Reaching an agreement less than 48 hours before Stanley hit an open market filled with offensive tackle-needy teams willing to hand him a blank check was clutch.

""So, with the first wave of free agency already over, where does that leave them? They still have several needs — cornerback, safety, inside linebacker and edge rusher stand out — and next to no cap space to fill them. That's where the serious business comes in.""

Zrebiec noted that the Ravens will probably have to make moves to create more salary-cap space in the coming days.

One way to do so is by contract restructures, and that process has already started. According to Russell Street Report's Brian McFarland, the Ravens have reworked cornerback Marlon Humprey's contract to create more than $13 million in cap space.

The Ravens have done a max restructure w/Marlon Humphrey by reducing his $18M salary & roster bonus to the league min of $1.255M & converting $16.745M to a bonus. Two void yrs were added. Restructure creates $13.396M in 2025 cap space.

While restructures are helpful, Zrebiec said the Ravens ""ultimately are probably going to have to check off some big-ticket items."" That could include a contract extension for Lamar Jackson.

""His 2025 cap number is $43.65 million, but it rises to $74.65 million in 2026 and 2027,"" Zrebiec wrote. ""The 2025 number is manageable. The 2026-27 one is not, meaning at some point within the next 12 months, the Ravens and Jackson will need to hammer out a new deal anyway. What better time than the present, when it would give DeCosta some much-needed salary-cap breathing room?""

Zrebiec said a contract extension for running back Derrick Henry also could help. Furthermore, he said the Ravens would ""have to at least weigh the benefits"" of trading tight end Mark Andrews ""if they get an enticing offer.""

""To be clear, the Ravens don't have to do anything with their standout tight end,"" Zrebiec wrote. ""Yet, Andrews is due a $4 million roster bonus on March 20, so a decision could come relatively soon.""

It bears repeating just how big re-signing Stanley to a three-year deal reportedly worth $60 million before the start of free agency is for the Ravens.

NFL.com's Gregg Rosenthal said on “The Mina Kimes Show” that it speaks volumes about the Ravens' culture that Stanley chose to remain in Baltimore rather than spark a bidding war on the open market.

""The Patriots I think were going to go over the top with money, but the Chiefs I think were building their offseason plan around signing Ronnie Stanley, and he chose to stay with the Ravens,"" Rosenthal said. ""They made him take a pay cut before last season. You have to be a pretty great organization from the top to the bottom, from the coaching staff to the administration, to make a dude take a pay cut and then the following year he's taking maybe less money or at least he's giving you the benefit of the doubt and wanting to stay home. This is how great teams can stay great, so I just love that.""

Kimes agreed, saying: ""The Ronnie Stanley deal was my favorite of the entire free agency from a team perspective. I think this is a huge win for the organization.""

Both @greggrosenthal and I agree: The Ravens' deal with Ronnie Stanley was one of the biggest wins any team had in free agency. We discussed why on the pod 👇🎧: https://t.co/4OOdMhzjmE📺: https://t.co/PUdp4MUPch pic.twitter.com/e11EFxB2xX

NFL.com's Kevin Patra also named the Ravens re-signing Stanley as one of the best moves of the opening wave of free agency.

""The top tackle heading into free agency isn't even in the top 10 in per-year average salary among OTs. That's a W for the organization,"" Patra wrote. ""The deal became a good one when the Ravens weren't forced to get to a $23 million- or $25 million-per-year figure to retain their left tackle. I also like the short-term nature of the pact for both sides. The structure allows Baltimore to get out of the deal relatively free after two years if the injury bug respawns. Likewise, if Stanley stays healthy and keys a Super Bowl run in Baltimore, he can push for a re-up in 2027 when no guaranteed money is left.""

One item on the Ravens' to-do list is signing a backup quarterback.

Journeyman Josh Johnson, who had the job last season, is a free agent. Other veterans on the market include former Ravens Joe Flacco and Tyler Huntley, Jameis Winston, Trey Lance, Drew Lock, Carson Wentz, Desmond Ridder, Cooper Rush, and Teddy Bridgewater.

Flacco returning to the Ravens would be a great story, but could it actually happen?

""I think they'd be all for it if the price was right,"" Zrebiec wrote on X. ""He's beloved in that building. I don't know if it's something he'd be interested in. He's never been the nostalgic type and if he's still playing, he's probably going to want to go to a place where he has better chance to start.""

Flacco reportedly met with the New York Giants Thursday.

After being released by the 49ers, free-agent Pro-Bowl FB Kyle Juszczyk is meeting today with the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Getting to know John Feinstein through his time with us as he was writing Next Man Up was one of the great honors of my professional life. Quick-witted and bluntly honest, I was lucky to call him a friend for the last 20 years. This news is heartbreaking and will hurt for a long…

Daniel Faalele and Ar'Darius Washington are rewarded for their 2024 performances. Rod Woodson makes the all-time free-agency team.

Pundit reveals how much teams were willing to pay Ronnie Stanley. Retaining Patrick Ricard is a win-win. Should the Ravens pursue Za'Darius Smith?

The Ravens receive high marks for re-signing Ronnie Stanley. Analyst says Cooper Kupp would be the 'final piece' for the Ravens. A former agent projects what a contract extension for Derrick Henry could look like. The reported departures of Malik Harrison and Chris Board creates a void at inside linebacker and special teams.

Buffalo Bills' Josh Allen signs new deal; pundits consider how it impacts Ravens, Lamar Jackson. Von Miller is a free agent to watch for the Ravens.

Pundit says Darius Slay and the Ravens are the perfect free-agent match. Jeff Zrebiec ranks the Ravens' biggest offseason needs. The acquisition of Derrick Henry is ranked the second-best free-agent signing of 2024. 

Pundit projects the Ravens' first three draft picks. Cornerback T.J. Tampa could step up in Year 2.

ESPN predicts Ronnie Stanley will sign with the Patriots. Lamar Jackson is named the best player in his loaded age group. The Ravens are again linked to DeAndre Hopkins. Pundit says the Ravens will give 'serious consideration' to taking an edge rusher in the first round.

Newsmax agreed to pay Smartmatic $40 million as part of a settlement last year following the voting technology company's election defamation lawsuit against the right-wing news outlet, according to a new regulatory filing.

The settlement, reached in September, included a cash payment and an option to purchase stock in Newsmax, the media company said in its filing. Newsmax said payments totaling $20 million have already been made, with the rest coming before July.

“Management believes the settlement with Smartmatic will, subject to the payment of all consideration in a timely manner, eliminate future legal expenses the Company would have expected to bear related to this suit, which could have included costly appellate legal actions and other matters,” Newsmax wrote.

Newsmax did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night.

Details of the payments provide insight into the confidential settlement agreement that were not publicly available last year. The 2021 lawsuit centered on Newsmax's false claims that Smartmatic's machines manipulated the 2020 presidential election in favor of Joe Biden. A deal was reached shortly before the case was set to go to trial.

After the settlement last year, Newsmax said in a statement that it “acknowledges that the Court found that ‘allegations regarding whether the [2020 U.S. presidential election] and its results were somehow altered or manipulated by Smartmatic are factually false/untrue.'”

Smartmatic settled a related defamation lawsuit in April against One America News for a sum that also was not disclosed publicly.

 J. Erik Connolly, an external lawyer for Smartmatic, said in a statement Thursday that the company is now focused on a similar case against Fox News.

""We look forward to presenting our evidence to a jury and finally having the opportunity to hold Fox accountable for its harmful actions,” Connolly said.

Fox has said it covered newsworthy events and people surrounding the 2020 election.

Fox News' parent company, Fox Corp., reached a settlement in 2023 to pay $787.5 million to the election technology company Dominion Voting Systems to settle defamation claims.

Valueattics Re, a company promoted by Prem Watsa-backed FAL Corporation and GoDigit Founder Kamesh Goyal, has received insurance regulator IRDAI nod to commence reinsurance business in India. This is the first private reinsurer in India to be granted a reinsurance license.

Currently, public sector General Insurance Corporation (GIC Re) is the only reinsurance company operating in India.

Reinsurance companies play a crucial role in the insurance industry by providing insurance to other insurance companies, acting as a second level of insurance or insurers' insurer to manage and transfer risk, particularly large or catastrophic losses.
With this, Kamesh Goyal and Fairfax (through their respective ventures) will become the first promoters in India to have licenses to operate general insurance, life insurance and reinsurance businesses in India.

It is a deep question, from deep in our history: When did human language as we know it emerge? A new survey of genomic evidence suggests our unique language capacity was present at least 135,000 years ago. Subsequently, language might have entered social use 100,000 years ago.

Our species, Homo sapiens, is about 230,000 years old. Estimates of when language originated vary widely, based on different forms of evidence, from fossils to cultural artifacts. The authors of the new analysis took a different approach. They reasoned that since all human languages likely have a common origin — as the researchers strongly think — the key question is how far back in time regional groups began spreading around the world.

“The logic is very simple,” says Shigeru Miyagawa, an MIT professor and co-author of a new paper summarizing the results. “Every population branching across the globe has human language, and all languages are related.” Based on what the genomics data indicate about the geographic divergence of early human populations, he adds, “I think we can say with a fair amount of certainty that the first split occurred about 135,000 years ago, so human language capacity must have been present by then, or before.”

The paper, “Linguistic capacity was present in the Homo sapiens population 135 thousand years ago,” appears in Frontiers in Psychology. The co-authors are Miyagawa, who is a professor emeritus of linguistics and the Kochi-Manjiro Professor of Japanese Language and Culture at MIT; Rob DeSalle, a principal investigator at the American Museum of Natural History's Institute for Comparative Genomics; Vitor Augusto Nóbrega, a faculty member in linguistics at the University of São Paolo; Remo Nitschke, of the University of Zurich, who worked on the project while at the University of Arizona linguistics department; Mercedes Okumura of the Department of Genetics and Evolutionary Biology at the University of São Paulo; and Ian Tattersall, curator emeritus of human origins at the American Museum of Natural History.

The new paper examines 15 genetic studies of different varieties, published over the past 18 years: Three used data about the inherited Y chromosome, three examined mitochondrial DNA, and nine were whole-genome studies.

All told, the data from these studies suggest an initial regional branching of humans about 135,000 years ago. That is, after the emergence of Homo sapiens, groups of people subsequently moved apart geographically, and some resulting genetic variations have developed, over time, among the different regional subpopulations. The amount of genetic variation shown in the studies allows researchers to estimate the point in time at which Homo sapiens was still one regionally undivided group.

Miyagawa says the studies collectively provide increasingly converging evidence about when these geographic splits started taking place. The first survey of this type was performed by other scholars in 2017, but they had fewer existing genetic studies to draw upon. Now, there are much more published data available, which when considered together point to 135,000 years ago as the likely time of the first split.

The new meta-analysis was possible because “quantity-wise we have more studies, and quality-wise, it's a narrower window [of time],” says Miyagawa, who also holds an appointment at the University of São Paolo.

Like many linguists, Miyagawa believes all human languages are demonstrably related to each other, something he has examined in his own work. For instance, in his 2010 book, “Why Agree? Why Move?” he analyzed previously unexplored similarities between English, Japanese, and some of the Bantu languages. There are more than 7,000 identified human languages around the globe.

Some scholars have proposed that language capacity dates back a couple of million years, based on the physiological characteristics of other primates. But to Miyagawa, the question is not when primates could utter certain sounds; it is when humans had the cognitive ability to develop language as we know it, combining vocabulary and grammar into a system generating an infinite amount of rules-based expression.

“Human language is qualitatively different because there are two things, words and syntax, working together to create this very complex system,” Miyagawa says. “No other animal has a parallel structure in their communication system. And that gives us the ability to generate very sophisticated thoughts and to communicate them to others.”

This conception of human language origins also holds that humans had the cognitive capacity for language for some period of time before we constructed our first languages.

“Language is both a cognitive system and a communication system,” Miyagawa says. “My guess is prior to 135,000 years ago, it did start out as a private cognitive system, but relatively quickly that turned into a communications system.”

So, how can we know when distinctively human language was first used? The archaeological record is invaluable in this regard. Roughly 100,000 years ago, the evidence shows, there was a widespread appearance of symbolic activity, from meaningful markings on objects to the use of fire to produce ochre, a decorative red color.

Like our complex, highly generative language, these symbolic activities are engaged in by people, and no other creatures. As the paper notes, “behaviors compatible with language and the consistent exercise of symbolic thinking are detectable only in the archaeological record of H. sapiens.”

Among the co-authors, Tattersall has most prominently propounded the view that language served as a kind of ignition for symbolic thinking and other organized activities.

“Language was the trigger for modern human behavior,” Miyagawa says. “Somehow it stimulated human thinking and helped create these kinds of behaviors. If we are right, people were learning from each other [due to language] and encouraging innovations of the types we saw 100,000 years ago.”

To be sure, as the authors acknowledge in the paper, other scholars believe there was a more incremental and broad-based development of new activities around 100,000 years ago, involving materials, tools, and social coordination, with language playing a role in this, but not necessarily being the central force.

For his part, Miyagawa recognizes that there is considerable room for further progress in this area of research, but thinks efforts like the current paper are at least steps toward filling out a more detailed picture of language's emergence.

“Our approach is very empirically based, grounded in the latest genetic understanding of early homo sapiens,” Miyagawa says. “I think we are on a good research arc, and I hope this will encourage people to look more at human language and evolution.”

This research was, in part, supported by the São Paolo Excellence Chair awarded to Miyagawa by the São Paolo Research Foundation.

 “Tomatosoup with Crayfish” by kstenqnen is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0.

Coauthor, a software tool helping developers design and create compliant software for medical devices, is about to release the latest webinar in its ongoing device cybersecurity webinar series, focusing on SBOMs.

Developed by Hindsight Software, the webinar is titled “Software Supply Chain: Know Your SBOMs from Your SOUP.” It aims to provide insights into the management of software supply chain risks and explains the role of software bills of materials (SBOMs), with specific reference to medical device security.

The webinar will contrast SBOMs with SOUP (software of unknown provenance), highlighting the differences for a better understanding of security, provenance, and licensing in software development processes.

The session goes live on 20th March 2025 at 12:30pm GMT, and should benefit professionals including software developers, regulatory affairs specialists, and medical device manufacturers.

A range of topics are to be discussed by expert presenters:

The 30-minute webinar comes at an important time, when regulatory bodies are increasingly requiring the use of SBOMs to reduce risks, improve transparency in software components, and help track any security vulnerabilities that may arise after software is released.

The requirement for SBOMs have become more important in the medical device supply chain due to the growing cybersecurity challenges stemming from software flaws.

SBOMs can be thought of as a list of component parts like might be drawn-up to assemble a physical object comprising of many parts. It's a formal record of the elements that make up a ‘finished' piece of code. (Software is rarely ever considered finished or perfect.)

Developers often use existing components in projects. Doing so saves inordinate amounts of time otherwise spent to achieve what could be termed ‘standard features' – the ability to draw text or images on a screen, for example, or get input from a keyboard. In software development, these are called libraries and frameworks, among other terms.

In many cases, code written by developers depend on the inclusion of libraries etc. for their application to run, so the collective term for the required components are sometimes referred to as dependencies.

Due to the ongoing nature of software development, it's common for software to be versioned, in that bug-fixes and feature additions are added over time and so software, and each of its dependencies are published under version numbers.

An SBOM, in part, is a record of the component parts of an application, all its used frameworks, libraries, and/or dependencies, and the version number of each. If a potential security flaw is found in one component by the original developer or anyone examining (or using) the source code, it is superseded once renewed by a new version of the code, and given the next number in a sequence. Organisations running a piece of software, therefore, need a record of version numbers in the SBOM so they can apply patches to the affected component(s), typically involving updating to new version(s) of either the entire application, or the dependency where the issue was discovered.

Additionally, software is normally published under specific licence terms, which can limit how the code is used, or stipulate what happens to any changes made to the code. It's important, therefore, for the SBOM to also record the different licences under which each component is released. For example, under some licences, changed code can require re-publishing by those that made the changes, in order for the software user to remain compliant.

There is one downside though - all tech and everything that comes with it costs money, and usually a pretty penny too! This can leave us feeling deflated about the money we're spending on something that's essentially, a pass time. Luckily, there are clever ways in which you can save money on these luxuries and in this article, we're going to tell you exactly how!

If you're someone that loves gaming, you'll know all too well how expensive new games can be. It can be anything from £40 and upwards, and that's usually just for the base game! However, there are really smart ways around this. Depending on what console you use for gaming, you'll be able to get some sort of game pass. For example, for Playstation users, you can subscribe to a PSN account for much cheaper per month than buying a brand new game. And, you'll have access to a myriad of new games while you're subscribed.

The same goes for Xbox users or even PC gamers. There's the Xbox game pass or EA subs you can activate for around £15 a month that will give you access to loads of games under their umbrella. While it's still costing you some money each month, you can enjoy more games for less money!

Not only that, when you're subbed to these kinds of services, you'll notice that your system will detect and download updates for your games, meaning you no longer have to wait around for downloads or installations.

As mentioned briefly above, there sometimes comes a time when you either don't have time for certain games and tech, or you've outgrown it and would like to make some money from them to put towards your next upgrade. Lots of stores buy all sorts of games, consoles, phones, and other tech from people in exchange for cash. While you can do this on the website, it might be easier to head to your nearest store so that your items can be checked there and then in store, and you can walk away that day with the cash. Selling your old phone, games or console is a great way to make extra money when you're in a pinch.

It's all too easy to wake up one day and realise that you're paying an extortionate amount for your broadband deal. The first step that you should take is to phone your current provider and ask them for a cheaper deal. More often than not they will be able to lower your price by a small amount.

However, you shouldn't always settle for this figure as there are many other internet providers around the world that would be more than willing to do you better broadband deals. Make sure that you know you've got the cheapest price before settling for a company so that you can save yourself that little bit of extra money each month and not feel so guilty!

There are so many free trials these days, so why not make the most of them? Services like Netflix and Spotify offer a month's trial completely free of charge. If you use these kinds of trials in a clever way, you can enjoy lots of free entertainment without having to spend a single penny. For example, you could trial Netflix for a month and then try out Disney+ for a month.

It's not just entertainment deals you should be looking out for either. Services like Canva offer free pro trials that are a month long, meaning you could create high-quality media if you need it for work or a personal blog. The same goes for cloud storage - there are loads of services that will give you the space for free for a whole month! The only thing you have to do is remember when your free trials are ending so that you can cancel the subscriptions before they renew!

Like many, there's a chance that you have games on your phone or you use it for personal reasons like social media and chatting to family and friends via text message. Like with your internet bill, it's too easy to add on features and then end up with a large bill that you don't truly need. Most providers will claim that they cannot reduce your bill because obviously, they want to continue receiving money from you. This however, is untrue, so make sure that you push it with them so that they offer you a much cheaper deal. You may even find that your cheaper deal doesn't actually change many of your current terms, so it's definitely worth a shot!

If you're on pay as you go, it might be an idea to use a messaging service like Whatsapp with your friends and family so that all of you can save some money on your phone bills. Whatsapp runs on the use of the internet, so if you're in Wifi range you're able to text, video, and call for absolutely nothing!

It's understandable that when a new game comes out on a console that you don't have, that you want to rush out and buy that console so that you can join in on the fun that everyone is having. However, new consoles no matter how long they've been out can still cost you a fair amount of money. Instead, consider buying second hand consoles so that you can still join in on all of the fun, but save yourself a nice amount of money! Often people sell their consoles because they are simply too busy for them, so there's actually nothing wrong with them! Just be sure to have it all turned on before handing over any cash!

Try these easy yet clever ways of saving money on your tech so that you can have some spare cash for other things in life that you want to enjoy!

BENGALURU (Reuters) -Indian IT major Wipro is realigning its four global business lines from April 1 to better address client needs, the company said on Friday.

This is its first rejig after CEO Srinivas Pallia took over the role in April 2024, and comes two years after a similar move under former top boss Thierry Delaporte.

Wipro has brought all cloud, data, analytics and AI, and other related businesses under its tech services business line. Its head of cloud resigned on Friday.

The company's consulting business line will be headed by Amit Kumar, who was hired from Accenture Consulting last month.

""This evolution of our business lines will enable us to further sharpen our focus towards client needs with consulting-led and AI-powered solutions,"" Pallia said in a statement.

Following the overhaul, Capco - Wipro's largest acquisition - will operate separately under the consulting business line with Capco's head reporting to Pallia. Its Designit business will go under the tech services business line. Both acquired companies were previously under the consulting business.

Apart from the existing engineering business line, the company also announced a fourth newly created line called Business Process Services, with Jasjit Kang as its head.

TEHRAN, Mar. 14 (MNA) – A manhole explosion at Texas Tech University caused green flames to shoot from the ground before a massive blaze erupted.

Frightening footage revealed how the underground chamber caught alight before thick black smoke poured out amid a roaring fire. The incident on Wednesday led school officials to issue evacuation orders for several buildings and cancel classes for the rest of the week.

An alert sent to the campus community around 8:45 p.m. described the explosion as occurring at a substation but a later update said it was at a manhole. No injuries were reported, Lubbock Fire Rescue Capt. Jon Tunnell said. Later footage captured by local TV stations showed a heavy presence of firefighters on campus. It wasn't clear what might have caused the explosion.

Exchange Rate Information

This announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise noted, all translations from RMB to U.S. dollars are made at a rate of RMB7.2993 to US$1.00, the exchange rate set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as of December 31, 2024.

Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures 

In evaluating its business, the Company considers and uses the non-IFRS financial measure of adjusted net loss as a supplemental measure to review and assess operating performance. The Company believes that adjusted net loss provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the Company's consolidated results of operations in the same manner as it helps the Company's management. The Company defines adjusted net loss as net loss for the year/period excluding share-based compensation expenses, fair value changes of financial liabilities measured at FVTPL, fair value changes of financial assets at FVTPL and changes in the carrying amounts of preferred shares and other financial instruments subject to redemption and other preferential rights.

The Company presents the non-IFRS financial measure because it is used by its management to evaluate its operating performance and formulate business plans. Adjusted net loss enables the Company's management to assess the Company's operating results without considering the impact of the aforementioned non-cash adjustment items that it does not consider to be indicative of its core operations. Accordingly, the Company believes that the use of this non-IFRS financial measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results in the same manner as its management and board of directors.

This non-IFRS financial measure is not defined under IFRS and is not presented in accordance with IFRS. The non-IFRS financial measure has limitations as an analytical tool. One of the key limitations of using the adjusted net loss is that it does not reflect all items of expenses that affect the Company's operations. Further, this non-IFRS measure may differ from the non-IFRS information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore its comparability may be limited.

The non-IFRS financial measure should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to loss for the year/period or any other measure of performance information prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS or as an indicator of the Company's operating performance. Investors are encouraged to review the Company's historical non-IFRS financial measure in light of the most directly comparable IFRS measure, as shown below. The non-IFRS financial measure presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measure presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting the usefulness of such measures when analyzing the Company's data comparatively. It is encouraged that you review the Company's financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.

  March 14, 2025

BEIJING – The fast-evolving artificial intelligence technology is expected to spearhead an industrial revolution and expedite the development of China's autonomous and intelligent connected vehicles, as AI is emerging as a critical strategic opportunity for the automotive industry, said national lawmakers, political advisers and experts.

As China is accelerating steps to advance the mass production and commercialization of self-driving vehicles, more efforts should be made to improve the regulations and standards for autonomous driving, speed up the construction of intelligent transportation infrastructure, and expand the testing and application for autonomous vehicles in a wider range of scenarios, they added.

Their comments follow this year's Government Work Report which stated that under the AI Plus initiative, China will support the extensive application of large-scale AI models and vigorously develop new-generation intelligent terminals and smart manufacturing equipment, including intelligent connected new energy vehicles.

He Xiaopeng, chairman and CEO of Chinese electric vehicle maker Xpeng Motors, said a transformative AI era is approaching, and AI will accelerate the arrival of self-driving vehicles and even driverless vehicles. He emphasized that his company has continued to invest in AI and launched its self-developed AI-powered chips to enhance the intelligent driving capabilities of vehicles.

The Xpeng CEO, who is also a deputy to the 14th National People's Congress, China's top legislature, said he believes that 2025 will mark a significant turning point in intelligent driving. With the continuous advancements and breakthroughs in core technologies such as algorithms, sensors and computing platforms, it is appropriate to bolster the mass production of Level 3 autonomous driving technology, he added.

Autonomous driving is categorized from Level 0 to Level 5. The higher the level, the more intelligent the technology and the lesser the involvement of humans.

Level 3 refers to conditional automation, which allows vehicles to perform autonomous driving tasks under certain conditions. Such vehicles have “environmental detection” capabilities and can make some informed decisions, but are still subject to a human override.

“Xpeng is planning to roll out its Level 3 capabilities in the second half of the year,” He said, adding that by 2026, the company aims to explore Level 4 (high automation) capabilities, including fully driverless parking.

Level 4 vehicles can intervene if there is a system failure and do not require human assistance in most circumstances. However, a manual override option is still available.

Feng Xingya, chairman of automobile manufacturer GAC Group, said, “The advancements in AI technology are becoming the core driving force bolstering the development of intelligent connected vehicles, and the application of AI will help reshape the automotive industry.”

AI is reshaping the intelligent experience of automobiles — from intelligent driving to human-machine interaction — and driving the transformation of automobiles toward “intelligent terminals”, said Feng, who is also a national lawmaker.

Looking ahead, GAC will promote the iteration of advanced intelligent driving and AI models, while speeding up the application of AI in fields such as automobile research and development, manufacturing and marketing, he added.

While highlighting the significance of bolstering the commercialization of self-driving technology, Feng said that autonomous driving serves as the core technology of intelligent connected vehicles and a vital link in intelligent transportation.

GAC is among the first carmakers to test Level 3 autonomous vehicles on public roads, and it plans to mass produce these vehicles this year. Feng suggested revising the Road Traffic Safety Law to clarify the liabilities concerning autonomous vehicles and accelerating the research and establishment of a specific law related to intelligent driving.

China has introduced a series of policies to promote the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicles in recent years.

According to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the country supports the commercial application of Level 3 and above autonomous driving systems. Over 50 cities nationwide have released autonomous driving pilot demonstration policies, and stepped up efforts to expand the application scenarios of self-driving technology.

Wang Xianjin, vice-president and chief engineer of the China Academy of Transportation Sciences, said the testing and operation of self-driving vehicles has accelerated significantly in China, laying a good foundation for the commercialization of autonomous driving, a tech frontier in which all major economies are scrambling to establish a beachhead.

Wang, who is also a national political adviser, called for efforts to speed up formulation and revision of policies and regulations supporting the commercial application of self-driving technology, and continuously expand the scale of pilot operations of autonomous vehicles in more cities.

Lei Jun, founder, chairman and CEO of Xiaomi Corp and a national lawmaker, proposed establishing a national testing and verification system for autonomous vehicles. He stressed the need to accelerate the commercial mass production of self-driving vehicles, with the goal of supporting their use on highways, expressways and urban roads by 2026.

Good Samaritan Pulmonologist Johnathon Grant, DO, during an Ion procedure.

Good Samaritan announced in a recent press release the addition of the Ion Endoluminal System, a state-of-the-art robotic-assisted platform for minimally invasive lung biopsies.

""This innovative technology enhances precision and access when diagnosing lung nodules, potentially leading to earlier detection and treatment of lung cancer,"" the press release read.

Good Sam reported that lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, but early detection significantly improves survival rates. The Ion Endoluminal System, developed by Intuitive—the makers of the da Vinci Surgical System—offers a revolutionary approach to lung biopsies. By allowing physicians to navigate deep into the lungs with enhanced stability and precision, this technology enables tissue sampling from hard-to-reach nodules while reducing the need for more invasive procedures.

“With the introduction of Ion, we can provide our patients with a more advanced and minimally invasive approach to lung biopsy,” said Good Samaritan Pulmonologist Johnathon Grant, DO, in the press release. “This means greater accuracy, faster results, and ultimately, better outcomes for those at risk of lung cancer.”

Compared to traditional bronchoscopy methods, the press release shared that the Ion system offers increased reach and flexibility, which allows for more successful biopsies with fewer complications. This means patients can receive a diagnosis sooner, helping them and their care teams make informed treatment decisions more quickly.

Patients can learn more about this groundbreaking technology by visiting gshvin.org/ion.

As Web3 adoption accelerates, the demand for robust security solutions has never been more urgent. Over $2.3 billion was lost to hacks in 2024 alone , highlighting persistent vulnerabilities in decentralized applications and blockchain ecosystems. This growing threat underscores the need for cutting-edge security measures which are critical to sustaining trust and innovation in the blockchain industry .

India has emerged as a key player in the global Web3 space. The country's share of the Web3 developer base has surged from just 3% in 2018 to 12% in 2024. Also, since 2023, India has onboarded the most new crypto developers, moving past the US, reflecting increased interest and expertise in blockchain technology. As more Indian developers and startups build on decentralized platforms, the demand for scalable and AI driven security solutions to protect smart contracts and blockchain infrastructure has also intensified.

Traditional smart contract auditing methods are often slow, expensive, and limited in scope, leaving room for critical security gaps. Recognizing this challenge, CredShields, a blockchain security firm, has introduced SolidityScan, an AI-powered security solution that automates smart contract auditing.

“Security vulnerabilities in smart contracts can lead to devastating financial losses. SolidityScan offers a scalable, real-time, and cost-effective way to detect and mitigate these risks before they can be exploited. Unlike traditional audits , SolidityScan instantly analyzes smart contracts with its 450+ AI powered vulnerability detectors for weaknesses, enabling developers to focus on innovation without compromising security,” said Shashank, co-founder of CredShields.

With blockchain adoption increasing across finance, gaming, and decentralized governance, cybersecurity remains a major concern. “The decentralized nature of Web3 makes it both powerful and vulnerable. SolidityScan is designed to provide proactive, AI-driven security solutions that adapt to evolving threats,” said Indranil, co-founder of CredShields.

By integrating automated security tools like SolidityScan, businesses and developers can mitigate risks and strengthen trust in blockchain-based platforms. As Web3 continues to expand, the role of AI in securing decentralized ecosystems will be indispensable in preventing financial losses and fostering sustainable growth.

Tata Technologies Ltd, a subsidiary of Tata Motors encountered a ransomware attack earlier this year that affected the company's network and forced it to suspend some of its services. Now, TechCrunch has reported that a ransomware group that goes by the name Hunters International has published what it claims to be data stolen from the Pune headquartered company.

According to TechCrunch, who claims to have seen the data published on the gang's dark web leak site said it includes personal details about current and former employees along with some confidential information like purchase orders and some contracts with customers in India and the United States.

The leaked data, which amounts to about 1.4TB in size includes more than 7,30,000 documents like Excel spreadsheets, PDF files and PowerPoint presentations. However, it is still unclear if the data shared by the Hunters International group is in any way related to the recent ransomware attack.

In a filing with the Indian stock exchanges, Tata Technologies had said that an investigation was underway “in consultation with experts to assess the root cause and take remedial action as necessary.”

For those unfamiliar, Hunters International is a relatively new ransomware-as-a-service group that offers its infrastructure to hackers and takes a cut of the ransom payments. It is also affiliated with the Hive gang, which may have previously leaked stolen data from Tata Power back in 2022.

Founded in 1989 as an automotive unit of Tata Motors, Tata Technologies focuses on automotive design, aerospace engineering and research and development and has an annual revenue of $600 million, operating in more than 18 locations in India, Asia-Pacific, Europe and North America.

When Michael Fassbender auditioned to play James Bond, he ended up promoting a different actor for the role.

In a recent appearance on the Happy Sad Confused podcast, Fassbender said he suggested Daniel Craig might make a good James Bond during his own audition for the film Casino Royale.

“I met with Barbara Broccoli just, you know, through passing, and I actually went in to an audition phase before Daniel [Craig] was cast, but I don't think I was ever in the mix,” Fassbender said. “But I remember going into that room and meeting with her and [Michael G.] Wilson, and I think I was like, ‘Daniel Craig is ...' — I don't know why I was promoting him, I should have been promoting myself.”

Fassbender said the flub is par for the course, admitting he was an hour late to his Mad Max: Fury Road audition. “This is what I was saying, I was terrible at auditions,” Fassbender said.

Even though he ended up not getting the role, Fassbender still gave Craig his flowers.

“Obviously Daniel did a fantastic job and went on to be I think the most successful Bond in history, but that was it really, there was never a conversation after that,” Fassbender said.

Justin Bieber is speaking out about how he feels ""unworthy.""

On Thursday, the Grammy-winning pop star took to his Instagram story and penned a message to his 294 million followers about his internal battle with not feeling worthy of the constant praise he receives.

""People told me my whole life, ‘Wow Justin u deserve that' and I personally have always felt unworthy. Like I was a fraud. Like when people told me I deserve something, it made me feel sneaky,"" he wrote.

""Like, damn, if they only knew my thoughts. How judgmental I am, how selfish I really am, they wouldn't be saying this.""

""If you feel sneaky, welcome to the club. I definitely feel unequipped and unqualified most days.""

The message comes after Bieber sparked health concerns among his large fan base.

Fans began weighing in on his well-being after he attended wife Hailey Bieber's Rhode event in Los Angeles last month.

In a video that went viral on TikTok, Bieber was seen with a huge grin on his face and rocking side-to-side while talking to attendees at the event.

""Are you sure that's Justin Bieber?"" one user asked.

Another added, ""I refuse to believe this is Justin Bieber,"" with a crying emoji.

""Is he okay?!"" a user asked. Another chimed in, ""This is so hard to watch. Someone help him.""

After the speculation, Bieber's team told TMZ concerns about Bieber's mental and physical health are ""exhausting and pitiful and shows that despite the obvious truth, people are committed to keeping negative, salacious, harmful narratives alive.""

His team added that he is focused on being a father to his son Jack and producing new music. Hailey and Justin welcomed their first child in August.

Bieber's rep did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Bieber, who previously revealed he had been diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome, explained that he had tried to continue the tour, which kicked off in January 2022 and was scheduled to run through 2023.

After postponing a string of concerts, the two-time Grammy Award winner shared a video on Instagram in which he explained he was suffering from partial facial paralysis after being diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome.

The syndrome ""occurs when a shingles outbreak affects the facial nerve near one of your ears,"" according to the Mayo Clinic. The virus can cause facial paralysis and hearing loss.

Bieber shared a hopeful update on his recovery in March 2023. The singer uploaded a video in which he demonstrated improved facial mobility as he winked, rolled his eyes, raised his eyebrows and smiled using both sides of his face.

AUSTELL, Ga. (AP) — A memorial service was underway Friday near Atlanta for Grammy-nominated R&B singer Angie Stone, who was killed in a car crash south of Montgomery, Alabama.

The cargo van she was riding in flipped over and was then hit by a truck on March 1, music producer and Stone's longtime manager Walter Millsap III has said. Everyone else in the van survived except Stone, who was 63. Online tributes from fans and fellow artists poured in after her death.

Friday's service began at 11 a.m. at Word of Faith Cathedral in Austell, Georgia, just west of Atlanta.

On Saturday, a service is planned at First Nazareth Baptist Church in Columbia, South Carolina.

Mourners filed into the massive Word of Faith Cathedral Friday, taking their seats around a gold casket surrounded by red roses.

“God is good even when life is not, and so we celebrate the life of our sister that has been well lived,” Bishop Dale Bronner, the church's senior pastor, said in opening the service.

Filmmaker and entertainment executive Tyler Perry was among those who were scheduled to speak. Many acclaimed musical artists were scheduled to perform, including Kirk Franklin, Anthony Hamilton, Keke Wyatt, Tamela Mann, and the Walls Group.

The church-grown singer was born in Columbia, where music was always in her life since she was a child, Stone told the AP in 1999 interview. Her mother would sing around the house, and her father sang gospel and blues at establishments around Columbia.

Stone was a member of the all-female hip-hop trio The Sequence and known for the hit song “Wish I Didn't Miss You.” She helped form The Sequence, the first all-female group on the hip-hop trailblazing imprint Sugar Hill Records, becoming one of the first female groups to record a rap song.

The group recorded “Funk You Up,” which has been sampled by numerous artists, including Dr. Dre.

After finding success in the early 1980s, Stone later joined the trio Vertical Hold before launching her solo career.

Stone created hits like “No More Rain (In This Cloud),” which reached No. 1 for 10 weeks on Billboard's Adult R&B airplay chart; “Baby” with legendary soul singer Betty Wright, another No. 1 hit; and “Wish I Didn't Miss You” and “Brotha.”

She found a sweet spot in the early 2000s as neo-soul begin to dominate the R&B landscape with the emergence of singers like Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, Maxwell and D'Angelo.

Her 2001 album “Mahagony Soul” reached No. 22 on the Billboard 200, while 2007's “The Art Of Love & War” peaked at No. 11.

A Soul Train Lady of Soul winner, Stone went on to showcase her acting chops with film roles in “The Hot Chick” starring Rob Schneider, “The Fighting Temptations,” which starred Cuba Gooding Jr. and Beyoncé, and “Ride Along” led by Ice Cube and Kevin Hart.

She also hit the Broadway stage as Big Mama Morton in “Chicago,” and she showcased her vulnerability on the reality TV shows “Celebrity Fit Club” and “R&B Divas: Atlanta.”

Jennifer Garner and Jennifer Lopez have both married and divorced Ben Affleck. 

According to People, despite being exes of the same actor, the silver screen queens remain friends, even after photos of Affleck and Garner getting ""cozy"" at a family outing surfaced online earlier this month. 

A source recently told the outlet that the ""On The Floor"" songstress and 13 Going on 30 actress have stayed in touch as friends through Lopez and Affleck's marriage and divorce and have bonded over their children. 

Garner, who shares children Violet, 19, Seraphina, 16, and Samuel, 13, with the Argo actor, married Affleck in 2005. The pair went their separate ways in 2015, and their divorce was finalized in 2018. Lopez rekindled a romance with Affleck in 2021, 19 years after breaking off their first engagement. The former couple married in 2022 and the Maid In Manhattan actress filed for divorce two years to the date of their wedding ceremony in August 2024. Their divorce was finalized in February 2025. 

Just last week, Affleck and Garner attended a paintball event with their son, and the Justice League star was spotted holding his ex-wife's waist, and she didn't pull away. 

Shortly after, a source revealed that Affleck would ""love to"" get back together with Garner but knows it's not the right time. Another insider told Page Six that the Family Switch actress has no interest in reigniting a spark with Affleck and that she is enjoying her current relationship with CaliGroup CEO John Miller. Miller and Lopez also commented on the photos, and neither were fans.

Jack Quaid has admitted filming the final season of 'The Boys' is ""bittersweet.

The 32-year-old actor - who plays vigilante Hughie Campbell in the superhero series - is having fun shooting the show out in Toronto but he isn't looking forward to having to say goodbye to the rest of the cast and crew when filming wraps for good on the fifth series.

He told 'Extra': “I'm working on Season 5 of ‘The Boys' right now. I'm in Toronto. It's our last season. It's going to be very bittersweet, but we're about halfway done shooting and it's going to be awesome. I'm just going to miss everybody.”

Jack thinks fans will be happy with the way the series comes to an end.

He added: “It's gonna be an incredible last season. I think it's a really great payoff.”

The 'Novocaine' actor is the son of Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan and previously admitted he feels ""immensely privileged"" because he knows being a nepo baby has given him an advantage in his career.

Discussing being called a nepo baby, he told The Daily Beast: ""I'm inclined to agree. I am an immensely privileged person, was able to get representation pretty early on, and that's more than half the battle.

""I knew the door was open for me in a lot of ways that it's just not for a lot of actors.

""And I've just tried to work as hard as I possibly can to prove that I deserve to walk through that door. So if that's in the rom-com space, it's got to be different enough, and I need to work my a** off.""

Meg previously defended her son over being branded a nepo baby, but while Jack can understand why she spoke out, he doesn't share her concern that it undermines his talent.

He said: ""My first thought was like, she's being a mom. She's being a loving mom.

""But I don't think she's trying to say that I'm not a nepo baby. I think she's just trying to say that, in her opinion, it undermines my talent. I don't think it undermines my talent.

""I know that I work hard, and I know I've heard 'no' way more than I've heard 'yes.'

""But I also know that this industry is insanely hard to break into, and I had an easier time doing that than most. Both things can be true.

""So no, I don't think she was trying to say that I'm not a privileged person. She knows. She must know. I think she was being a mom.""

Bollywood's Mr. Perfectionist, Aamir Khan, is known for keeping his personal life under wraps, but this time, the superstar has taken everyone by surprise! As he celebrated his pre-birthday bash in Mumbai, Aamir made an unexpected revelation—introducing his new girlfriend, Gauri Spratt, to the world. This major announcement has set the gossip mills on fire, and fans are eager to know more about the mystery woman who has stolen Aamir's heart.

Gauri Spratt is not from the film industry, making her relationship with Aamir even more intriguing. Hailing from Bangalore, she has spent most of her life away from the Bollywood limelight. According to sources, Gauri previously ran a salon in Bangalore before moving to Mumbai, where she now operates a BBlunt salon.

Her educational background is just as interesting—she studied at the Blue Mountain School and later pursued an FDA Styling and Photography course at the University of Arts, London, in 2004. Recently, she joined Aamir Khan's production house, bringing her closer to the film industry.

Gauri's multicultural heritage adds to her charm. Her father is Tamil-British, while her mother is Punjabi-Irish, giving her a unique blend of cultures. When asked about her identity, Gauri confidently stated, ""I am Indian.""

Aamir Khan and Gauri Spratt have known each other for 25 years, but their relationship took a romantic turn only 18 months ago. Despite their long-standing connection, they managed to keep their love story completely hidden from the media.

Aamir, known for being a master strategist both on and off-screen, cleverly kept his relationship under wraps. ""She used to live in Bangalore, so I would fly there to meet her. Since there's less media presence in Bangalore, we remained off the radar,"" he shared. The actor even joked about how he outsmarted the paparazzi, saying, ""See, I didn't let you guys catch a thing!""

This revelation marks a new phase in Aamir Khan's personal life. The actor has been through two marriages—first with Reena Dutta, with whom he shares two children, Junaid and Ira Khan, and later with Kiran Rao, with whom he has a son, Azad Rao Khan. Despite his divorces, Aamir has maintained a strong bond with both his ex-wives, often seen co-parenting their children.

With Gauri now in the picture, fans are curious about whether Aamir is planning to settle down again. When asked about marriage, he playfully responded, ""At this age, should I even be thinking about marriage? I don't know about that yet, but I am definitely in love. My family and kids have accepted our relationship.""

While Aamir continues to focus on his upcoming projects, including producing films and supporting new talent, Gauri is also stepping into the industry in her way. With her background in styling and photography, she might play an important role in Aamir's creative ventures.

This unexpected love story has left fans buzzing with excitement, and it remains to be seen how this relationship unfolds in the public eye. Will wedding bells ring for Aamir again? Only time will tell.

A panel of residents from Boston, Denver and Chicago weigh in on the sanctuary city mayors' heated testimony on Capitol Hill during 'Fox & Friends First.'

An accused child rapist illegally in the U.S. was recently arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement Boston, the agency announced on Thursday.

ICE Boston said Stivenson Omar Perez-Ajtzalan, 19, was arrested on Jan. 30 for aggravated rape of a child in Lawrence, Massachusetts. The victim is said to be more than 10 years younger than Perez, who is a Guatemalan national.

He was arraigned on the felony charges in Lawrence District Court on Dec. 20, 2024.

ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Boston acting Field Office Director Patricia Hyde said Perez not only displayed a ""blatant disregard"" for America's immigration laws, but he also sexually assaulted a child.

""He came to this country to do harm, and now he must be made to face the consequences of his actions. ICE Boston will remain dedicated to our mission of protecting public safety by arresting and removing illegal alien offenders from New England,"" Hyde said.

BOSTON POLICE COMMISSIONER DOUBLES DOWN ON ICE RESISTANCE: 'WE DON'T ENFORCE' DETAINERS 

Perez was allegedly released back into the community by the court, who did not inform ICE of his release, according to Fox News' Bill Melugin. ICE was also unable to file a detainer because the court released him so quickly.

""Massachusetts continues to be the only state I've seen in my coverage that frequently releases aliens not only charged with child rape, but aggravated child rape, without any notice to ICE,"" Melugin said.

Perez was given a notice to appear before a Justice Department immigration judge after his arrest and he was placed into removal proceedings, according to ICE Boston. He remains in ICE custody.

Massachusetts has made headlines since President Donald Trump was elected for acting in defiance of his administration's immigration crackdown. 

Gov. Maura Healey said in November that her state police will ""absolutely not"" be cooperating with mass deportation efforts and warned that she will use ""every tool in the toolbox"" to ""protect"" residents of her state.

Healey changed her tune in January, noting that her state is not a sanctuary state, despite a 2017 ruling by the state Supreme Judicial Court that severely limits law enforcement cooperation with ICE.

Intense storms with winds gusting up to 90 mph and hail the size of baseballs are forecast to strike a large area of the Midwest and the South on Friday, the National Weather Service warned.

An area that includes St. Louis; Springfield, Illinois; southeast Iowa; and western Tennessee and Kentucky are under a “moderate risk” of damaging storms, but other areas from Louisiana to Ohio and Wisconsin are also at some risk, the agency said.

The severe storms are likely to be over the lower and mid-Missouri Valley, the Mississippi Valley and the lower Ohio Valley late Friday afternoon into Saturday morning, the weather service said.

“Tornadoes, several of which could be strong, widespread damaging winds with gusts from 70 to 90 mph, and scattered large hail up to baseball size will be possible,” it said.

On Saturday, Louisiana, including New Orleans, will be under an increased risk of severe storms, with tornadoes possible, forecasters said.""It's going to be later that morning and into the afternoon and evening hours on Saturday where we're going to likely be seeing a significant severe weather outbreak,"" Kevin Gilmore, a meteorologist at the weather service's office for New Orleans and Baton Rouge, said in a video briefing Thursday.

The area was under a threat level of three and four — or ""enhanced"" and ""moderate"" — out of five levels used by forecasters, which is unusual this far in advance, he said.

While the Midwest and the South are bracing for possible severe storms Friday and Saturday, on Thursday there was a critical risk of fire in Texas and other parts of the Great Plains — and the extreme danger will continue into the weekend.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said he was directing additional state resources to respond to “extremely critical wildfire danger” expected to last through the weekend.

“With dry conditions, wind gusts, and low humidity increasing wildfire danger, Texans are encouraged to make an emergency plan, limit any activities that can cause a spark, and heed the guidance of local officials to keep yourself and your family safe,” Abbott said in a statement.

The weather service said that on Friday, ""potentially historic fire-weather conditions"" are likely across the southern Great Plains — with extreme risk in areas that include Lubbock and Wichita Falls in Texas, as well as Oklahoma City.

In the West, a winter storm has been blanketing the Sierra Nevada in California with snow. Tahoe City, on the western shore of Lake Tahoe, got 17½ inches of snow by 10 a.m. Thursday, the weather service for the region said.The snow was expected to take a break Thursday, the weather service said, but another storm will hit the Sierra on Friday and into Friday night.

In the Los Angeles area, a tornado hit the city of Pico Rivera on Thursday morning. The high-end EF-0 tornado around 3:15 a.m. had maximum winds of 85 mph and tracked for around 1 mile, the weather service said after storm surveys were done.

Trees were uprooted and tree branches were torn down, some of which landed on cars and roofs. The tornado itself also caused some roof damage, the agency said.

Trump Administration

Shutdown breakthrough: Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, broke with his party on Thursday and said he would vote for a Republican-written bill to keep federal funding flowing past a midnight Friday deadline.

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, broke with his party on Thursday and lined up enough Democrats to advance a Republican-written bill to keep federal funding flowing past a midnight Friday deadline, arguing that Democrats could not allow a government shutdown that many of them have demanded.

During a private luncheon with Democrats, Mr. Schumer stunned many of his colleagues by announcing that he planned to vote to allow the G.O.P. bill to move forward, and indicated that he had enough votes to help Republicans break any filibuster by his own party against the measure, according to attendees and people familiar with the discussion.

It was a turnabout from just a day earlier, when Mr. Schumer proclaimed that Democrats were “unified” against the legislation, and a remarkable move at a time when many of the party's members in both chambers and progressive activists have been agitating vocally for senators to block it in defiance of President Trump.

In a speech hours later on the Senate floor, Mr. Schumer announced his plan to vote to move forward with the Republican measure, which would fund the government through Sept. 30. He argued that if Democrats stood in the way, it would lead to a shutdown that would only further empower Mr. Trump and Elon Musk in their bid to defund and dismantle federal programs.

“The Republican bill is a terrible option,” Mr. Schumer said in his evening speech. “It is deeply partisan. It doesn't address far too many of this country's needs. But I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option.”

In a shutdown, Mr. Schumer said, “the Trump administration would have full authority to deem whole agencies, programs and personnel nonessential, furloughing staff with no promise that they would ever be rehired.”

He also warned that if the government closed, Mr. Trump and Republicans would have no incentive to reopen it, since they could selectively fund “their favorite departments and agencies, while leaving other vital services that they don't like to languish.”

His announcement came little more than 24 hours before a shutdown deadline. If Congress fails to approve legislation extending federal funding, it will lapse at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday.

In a meeting with reporters after his remarks, Mr. Schumer declined to confirm that he had sufficient Democratic votes to move the legislation past procedural hurdles, saying that senators were making their own decisions. But other Democrats said they were confident that he had the backing to push the measure forward.

Senate Republicans are expected to need the support of at least eight Democrats to steer around a filibuster. Other than Mr. Schumer, only one Democrat, Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, has said he will support the bill.

Mr. Schumer has long seen responsibility for government shutdowns as a political albatross. But many Democrats on Capitol Hill have refused to go along with the stopgap spending measure, regarding it as their only leverage against Mr. Trump. All but one House Democrat voted against the plan on Tuesday, and many of them, along with their colleagues in the Senate, have spent the last few days pressing to hold firm against it to challenge the president.

Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York said on CNN that it would be a “mistake” for Mr. Schumer not to block the bill.

“I hope that individuals that are considering that reconsider it,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. “I genuinely do. I don't think it's what New Yorkers want.”

In lengthy closed-door group discussions over the past three days, Senate Democrats have agonized over how to handle the spending bill, which would keep government funding largely flat over the next six months.

Many of them described an impossible choice between two evils: supporting a bill that would give the Trump administration wide latitude to continue its unilateral efforts to slash government employees and programs, or a shutdown that would also give Mr. Trump and his team broad leeway to decide what to fund.

Several Democrats — including both centrists and progressives — declared that they could not back legislation that would give that kind of power to the president and Mr. Musk. They groused that Republicans had unilaterally drafted the legislation and refused to consider any changes to win their votes, essentially daring them to take the blame for a politically toxic shutdown.

“What everyone is wrestling with is that either outcome is terrible,” said Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico. “This president has put us in a position where, in either direction, lots of people's constituents are going to get hurt and hurt badly. So people are wrestling with what is the least worst outcome.”

Thursday's session was particularly emotional, stretching on for two hours and at times growing heated. At one point, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York could be heard through closed doors shouting, “This will not be a normal shutdown!”

Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, who had widely been seen as one of the Democrats who might be willing to join Republicans to overcome a filibuster, announced that he would oppose the measure, adding that his decision was the most difficult call he had made since he was elected five years ago.

“That is a calculation I've been struggling with for days — weeks, in fact,” he said. “It's a tough call, and that's why we spent a lot of time talking. That's one of the challenging things on either path: There's a lot of unknowns out there.”

But he added that Mr. Musk “had been wreaking havoc on our government,” and said that the Republican-written bill, drafted in consultation with the White House, “is designed to give him more influence, more power.”

“This is not the way we should be funding the government,” Mr. Kelly said.

Republicans sought to escalate the pressure on Democrats to relent and end the spending fight, and warned on Thursday that the moment for making a decision was at hand.

“As the expression goes, it's time for Democrats to fish or cut bait,” said Senator John Thune, the South Dakota Republican and majority leader. “Democrats need to decide if they're going to support funding legislation that came over from the House or if they're going to shut down the government. So far it looks like they plan to shut it down.”

At the same time, residents of the District of Columbia were protesting on Capitol Hill to demand that Senate Democrats block a spending bill that would amount to a $1 billion budget cut for the District over the next six months. Crowds of school-age children carried signs made with crayons and colored markers, one of which read, “You cut my dad's job and now you want to cut my school,” punctuated by four sad faces.

Some Democrats said they were still trying to assess whether the best approach to reining in Mr. Trump was defeating the spending plan or allowing it to become law.

“We are intent on stymying and stopping the slide toward Trump's tyrannical and autocratic power, which is happening in real time and inflicting harm on real people,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who said he would vote to block the spending bill. “I'm respectful of my colleagues who have a different opinion with the same goal, which is to prevent unchecked and unbridled dictatorial power for President Trump and Elon Musk.”

The Trump administration escalated its dispute with Columbia University on Thursday, demanding the school make dramatic changes before it would discuss lifting the cancellation of $400 million in government grants and contracts.

The leader of the U.S. Postal Service said in a letter to lawmakers on Thursday that he had reached an agreement with Elon Musk's cost-cutting team allowing it to help in “identifying and achieving further efficiencies.”

The Postal Service has long struggled with its finances, and Mr. Musk and President Trump have both suggested it should be privatized. But Mr. Musk's cost-cutting group, the Department of Government Efficiency, has not targeted the Postal Service's roughly 635,000 workers.

Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, who took his position during the first Trump presidency and moved to shrink the agency's ranks during the Biden administration, said he had signed an agreement with Mr. Musk's group on Wednesday.

Mr. DeJoy, a Republican megadonor, wrote in the letter that Mr. Musk's initiative was “an effort aligned” with his efforts.

He said that the Postal Service's work force had shrunk by 30,000 since the 2021 fiscal year, and that the agency planned to complete a “further reduction of another 10,000 people in the next 30 days” through a previously established voluntary-retirement program.

Last week, Mr. Musk said at a tech conference organized by the bank Morgan Stanley that the Postal Service should be privatized, declaring, “We should privatize anything that can reasonably be privatized.”

Mr. Trump has by turns suggested privatizing the independent agency and merging it with the Commerce Department. Union officials and Democratic lawmakers have been alarmed by the talk of privatization, and have argued that such a move would hurt workers, drive prices higher and disproportionately damage service in rural areas.

The agreement described by Mr. DeJoy on Thursday was comparatively less disruptive, but it drew a stern rebuke from Representative Gerald E. Connolly of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, which oversees the Postal Service.

Mr. Connolly said in a statement that the deal would bring “catastrophic consequences for all Americans — especially those in rural and hard-to-reach areas — who rely on the Postal Service every day.”

The “only thing worse for the Postal Service,” Mr. Connolly said in the statement, would be if the agency were turned over to Mr. Musk so that he could “undermine it, privatize it, and then profit off Americans' loss.”

In his letter, the postmaster general argued that the service had transformed in recent years from a “battered government bureaucracy” on the verge of financial collapse into an agency “experiencing an unprecedented period of growth and innovation.”

“Our strategies have focused on maintaining a modified, but sustainable, universal service mission that was noble when constructed, still meritorious today, and that can be financially self-sufficient with the changes we are pursuing,” Mr. DeJoy wrote.

The Postal Service was once a Cabinet-level department of the government, but was turned into an independent agency under President Richard Nixon. In 2021, the agency reported it had lost $87 billion in the previous 14 years.

Brian L. Renfroe, the president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, said in an interview on Thursday that he was “skeptical of DOGE.”

But Mr. Renfroe said Mr. Musk's team had not yet done “anything that raises big alarms.”

“We will be in wait-and-see mode,” he said, adding that any new cuts at the Postal Service would “almost directly result in challenges providing the service that we provide every single day.”

It was supposed to be a moment of celebration: Vice President JD Vance was attending a concert at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington on Thursday evening for the first time since President Trump's stunning takeover of the institution.

Instead, as Mr. Vance took his seat in the box tier with the second lady, Usha Vance, loud boos broke out in the auditorium, lasting roughly 30 seconds, according to audience members and a video posted on social media. Mr. Vance was shown in the video waving to the audience as he settled into his seat.

The incident put on display the outcry over Mr. Trump's decision last month to purge the Kennedy Center's once-bipartisan board of its Biden appointees and have himself elected its chairman. (The president, who broke with tradition during his first term by not attending the Kennedy Center Honors after some of the artists being celebrated criticized him, complained that the center had become too “wokey.”)

Mr. Vance attended Thursday's performance by the National Symphony Orchestra, one of the Kennedy Center's flagship groups. The ensemble, under the baton of its music director, Gianandrea Noseda, performed Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No. 2, with Leonidas Kavakos as the soloist. After an intermission, the orchestra played Stravinsky's “Petrushka.”

The Vances stayed for the entire concert, audience members said. Ms. Vance was recently appointed by Mr. Trump to serve as a board member at the Kennedy Center, alongside other Trump allies like Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff; and Laura Ingraham, the Fox News host.

The concert started about 20 minutes late because of added security measures, audience members said.

A White House spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment.

Richard Grenell, whom Mr. Trump named as the center's new president, posted on social media on Friday morning that the video showing Mr. Vance being booed “should challenge us all to commit to making the Kennedy Center a place where everyone is welcomed.”

“It troubles me to see that so many in the audience appear to be white and intolerant of diverse political views,” he wrote. “Diversity is our strength. We must do better. We must welcome EVERYONE. We will not allow the Kennedy Center to be an intolerant place.”

In February, President Trump ousted the Kennedy Center's longtime chairman, the financier David M. Rubenstein, the center's largest donor. His new board of loyalists elected him chairman and fired Deborah F. Rutter, the center's president for more than a decade. At least three other top staff members were also dismissed.

Performers, including the actress Issa Rae and the musician Rhiannon Giddens, have dropped out in protest amid fears that Mr. Trump's calls to rid the center of “woke” influences, drag shows and “anti-American propaganda” would result in a reshaping of programming. The musical “Hamilton” recently scrapped a planned tour there next year.

While Mr. Trump has not yet articulated his vision for the center, his appointees have provided some hints. Mr. Grenell recently said that the center planned “a big, huge celebration of the birth of Christ at Christmas.”

A federal judge in Maryland issued an even more sweeping restraining order than one earlier in the day on Thursday, broadly barring the Trump administration from carrying out any future “reductions in force” like this week's ordering the termination of half the Education Department's workers. The order also directed agencies to offer to rehire probationary employees they had recently laid off, and applied to 18 agencies — up from the six mentioned the case earlier in the day.

Tim Balk

On “The Ingraham Angle” on Fox News Thursday night, Vice President JD Vance addressed an argument that erupted last week in the White House between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Elon Musk, saying that Rubio was doing an “incredible job” and that Musk was doing a “great job.” 

“The fact that you have a disagreement at a meeting, that does not mean that you have misalignment,” Vance said of the dispute, which took place in a Cabinet meeting and was reported by The New York Times. Vance added, “It does annoy me that that leaked.”

The Senate has adjourned for the night, meaning the critical procedural vote on advancing the spending bill will take place Friday afternoon. At the moment, Republicans, with help from Schumer and a handful of other Democrats, appear to have the votes to pass the bill and avoid a shutdown.

Tim Balk

Vice President JD Vance told Laura Ingraham on Fox News that he could not rule out a recession after the Trump administration imposed heavy tariffs on its biggest trade partners. “You never can predict the future,” Vance said in an interview on “The Ingraham Angle” that aired Thursday night.

Tim Balk

The prospect of a recession this year came up earlier this week in another interview on Fox News that aired Sunday. President Trump declined to dismiss the possibility of a recession, telling Maria Bartiromo on Fox News that there would be a “period of transition, because what we're doing is very big.” The remark has contributed to anxiety on Wall Street this week, and the S&P 500 fell into a correction Thursday.

Not only did Senator Chuck Schumer of New York announce that he planned to vote to allow the G.O.P. bill to move forward at a private luncheon at the Capitol today, but he made it clear that he had enough votes to help Republicans break any filibuster by his own party against the measure, according to attendees and people familiar with the discussion. The news stunned some Democrats in attendance, who have been vociferously opposed to the measure, those people said.

Elon Musk met with the head of the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command this week, an N.S.A. spokesman said on Thursday, a sign that the effort to shrink the size of the federal work force could soon turn to a critical arm of the intelligence community.

Mr. Musk, who is leading efforts to reorganize the federal government, traveled to the National Security Agency at Fort Meade, Md., on Wednesday, his first visit there as a special adviser to Mr. Trump, according to the N.S.A. spokesman, who said Mr. Musk had met with General Timothy Haugh, who leads both the N.S.A. and Cyber Command.

The spokesman, who did not allow his name to be used, also said that General Haugh was holding meetings with key White House advisers to ensure the N.S.A. and Cyber Command were “aligned” with the priorities of Mr. Trump, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence.

Mr. Musk's visit was reported earlier by The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal.

The N.S.A. is one of the most bureaucratic of the U.S. spy agencies but collects some of the most valuable intelligence, scooping up telephone and computer communications around the world.

Cyber Command, while a separate organization, is also headquartered at Fort Meade.

While Mr. Musk has criticized the federal government's computer systems, the N.S.A. has some of the most expert cryptologists and computer network experts in the world.

Mr. Musk this week complained about a disruption of service attack on X that caused service outages. On Monday, he said on Fox News that the cyberattack originated from “IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area.” However, an activist hacking group, Dark Storm, claimed responsibility, and experts have cast doubt that the attack actually originated from Ukraine.

Panamanian officials responded to a news report that the White House had directed the U.S. military to draw up plans for sending troops to the Panama Canal with a statement in which they said that while Panama valued its partnership with the U.S. and remained committed to regional security, “our sovereignty over the Panama Canal is absolute and not the basis of any negotiation.” The report by NBC News was based on the accounts of two American officials and said that President Trump and his advisers wanted to see “a U.S. military presence in Panama and on the canal itself.”

Annie Correal

The American officials told NBC News that the administration's possible strategies around the Panama Canal ranged from ensuring that U.S. ships had safe passage through the waterway to restoring total American ownership of the U.S.-built canal, which has been owned and operated by Panama since 1999.

Annie Correal

Panamanian officials continued: “Since 1999, we have successfully managed and secured this global trade route without foreign military presence. Our security strategy is built on varied cooperation, not deployment, and any move to increase foreign forces in Panama would challenge our neutrality and sovereignty.”

Zach Montague

A federal judge declined to require a coalition of states suing the Trump administration to post a bond covering the federal government's legal costs if the challenged failed. A week ago, the White House circulated a memo directing agencies to increasingly make that demand of parties suing the government in an attempt to stem the tide of lawsuits it is facing.

Zach Montague

In explaining the decision, the judge cited legal precedent allowing “an exception to the bond requirement in suits to enforce important federal rights or public interests.”

Representative Raúl M. Grijalva, a progressive Arizona Democrat who was one of the first to publicly urge President Biden to end his re-election campaign last year, died from cancer, his office said in a statement. He was 77.

Mr. Grijalva had lived for a year with his illness, which caused frequent absences from the Capitol that affected the balance of power in recent months, as Republicans held a slim majority.

Mr. Grijalva, as durable as a cactus in Arizona's political scene, represented a border district in his state — covering parts of Tucson, tribal reservations and the vast desert along the U.S.-Mexico border — for more than two decades. He was a liberal fixture of a fast-changing state powered by new arrivals, neighborhoods and businesses eating into the Sonoran desert that Mr. Grijalva, a passionate conservationist, cherished and tried to protect.

His liberal stances often put him out of step with Arizona's Republican-heavy congressional delegation and even Democratic leaders who often tacked to the center in the bitterly contested swing state.

But his progressivism endeared him to voters in his left-leaning district and earned loyal support from tribal leaders. One of his final major legislative efforts sought to block a copper mining project at Oak Flat, a sacred area to Western Apache people.

As the son of a Mexican father who came to the United States as part of the bracero-guest-worker program, Mr. Grijalva espoused staunch support for immigrants, unions, tribal rights and environmental protections. He got his start in politics in Tucson, serving as a school board member and county supervisor before being elected to Congress in 2002.

Mr. Grijalva announced in April that he had been diagnosed with cancer. Months later, he said that he would retire at the end of his current term in January 2027.

Gov. Katie Hobbs of Arizona is required to call a special election for the seat within 72 hours. A special primary election must then be held between 120 and 130 days later, followed by a special general election 70 to 80 days afterward. Mr. Grijalva won re-election with 63.4 percent of the vote in 2024, and whoever wins the Democratic primary for the seat would be the favorite to replace him.

A spokesman for Ms. Hobbs said that it was too soon for any announcement on the timing of an election. Ms. Hobbs also praised Mr. Grijalva in a separate statement as a “true champion for the people of our state.”

She continued: “To his last day, he remained a servant leader who put everyday people first while in office. I join every Arizonan in mourning his passing.”

Schumer's argument for why a shutdown would give Trump more power than if Democrats approved the stopgap funding bill: “Under a shutdown, the Trump administration would have full authority to deem whole agencies, programs and personnel nonessential, furloughing staff with no promise they would ever be rehired. The decision on what is essential would be solely left to the executive branch.”

He added that if the government shut down, House and Senate Republicans could “pursue a strategy of bringing bills to the floor to reopen only their favorite departments and agencies, while leaving other vital services that they don't like to languish.”

Carl Hulse

After declaring that he would vote to keep the government open, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, is to meet with reporters. What remains unclear is if sufficient Democrats will join him in advancing the Republican bill and what the timing for such a vote might be. Senators have not yet been sent home for the night.

Minho Kim

Kari Lake, a special adviser to Voice of America's parent organization said that she had directed VOA, a federally funded news agency, to cancel all contracts with news wire services provided by The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse. President Trump named her as the next director for VOA, but she has not yet assumed the job, as a bipartisan board that oversees federal news agencies must confirm leadership positions, including those at VOA.

Minho Kim

Lake has rebuffed calls from Elon Musk to abolish VOA altogether. But she has said the broadcaster's coverage will be free from what she described as “Trump derangement syndrome,” or T.D.S. “It won't become Trump TV,” Lake said during a speech last month at the Conservative Political Action Conference, an influential gathering of conservatives. “But it sure as hell will not be T.D.S.” 

Catie Edmondson

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, says on the Senate floor of the Republican funding bill, known as a C.R.: “While the C.R. bill is very bad, the potential for a shutdown has consequences for America that are much, much worse. The Republican bill is a terrible option. It is not a clean C.R. It is deeply partisan. It doesn't address far too many of this country's needs, but I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option.”

Catie Edmondson

“A shutdown would give Donald Trump, Elon Musk and DOGE the keys to the city, state and country,” Schumer says. We reported earlier that Schumer told colleagues at the party's private luncheon at the Capitol on Thursday that he would vote to clear the way for a final vote on the bill.

Resignations. Retirements. Firings.

And now large-scale layoffs, as agencies faced a Thursday deadline to turn in their plans for executing the next phase of President Trump's goal of significantly reducing the government payroll.

Agencies were given guidance and a timeline last month to submit outlines for “reductions in force” — a bureaucratic term meaning shrinking of an organization. Many agencies have not yet announced detailed plans. But some plans have trickled out, pointing to a downsizing effort exceeding the number of probationary workers already fired and the number of workers who accepted voluntary resignation offers.

At least some planned cuts could be blocked by the courts. On Thursday night, a federal judge temporarily restrained the government from carrying out any reductions in force across 18 agencies. 

And if the layoffs go forward, there are rules governing how government agencies can make them. Part of the process is assigning scores to individual employees based on their length of service, performance and veteran status. Those with the highest scores are supposed to be prioritized for finding other jobs in the agency.

Here is what we know about the reduction in force efforts at various agencies.

More than 1,300 workers were fired this week.

This is in addition to the 572 who took resignation packages and 63 probationary workers who have been fired. The reductions have cut the size of the agency, which started the year with 4,133 workers, in half.

Last month, the agency sent an email offering employees a buyout ahead of “very significant” layoffs.

The department has planned to cut 80,000 people. That number could include people who are retiring or taking a buyout, however.

In total, the department is looking to shrink its work force from 482,000 to 399,957.

The agency has planned to cut at least 1,000 people. This is in addition to 1,300 workers who have resigned or were laid off.

Together, the reductions would represent nearly 20 percent of NOAA's approximately 13,000-member work force.

The agency held a meeting with employees on Thursday but did not say how many cuts they were looking to make, according to two employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Officials presented workers with a list of job categories that were eligible for voluntary separation packages. This included staff focused on laboratory safety, ethics management, records management and the Freedom of Information Act, which enables the public to access government records. Workers were told those jobs could also be targeted for layoffs.

The agency has planned cuts of about 7,000 workers, including those opting to retire or resign. The goal is to reduce the work force to 50,000, according to the agency.

The agency said it would cut jobs by closing specific offices. The Office of Technology, Policy and Strategy; the Office of the Chief Scientist; and the Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility were targeted, as well as some other employees in the Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity, according to a March 10 memo shared with The Times.

The agency did not provide a total number of cuts.

A recent memo stated that the department hopes to make reductions through voluntary early retirements and resignation incentives, like buyouts. Plans to make additional work force cuts are due to the department's head of civilian personnel policy by March 20, the memo said.

The agency previously announced layoff plans for 144 employees in its Office of Field Policy and Management. It has not disclosed other details about future cuts.

Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York said she planned to meet with President Trump at the White House on Friday. The visit comes days after Thomas D. Homan, who is overseeing Trump's deportation operation and threatened to bring more federal immigration agents to New York, visited the State Capitol in Albany and faced protests over the detention of a recent Columbia graduate. Hochul told reporters Thursday that she hadn't paid attention to Homan and would be talking about the benefits of congestion pricing.

A federal judge in Washington has ordered Elon Musk and operatives involved with his Department of Government Efficiency to hand over documents and answer questions about its role in directing mass firings and dismantling government programs.

The judge, Tanya S. Chutkan of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, said on Wednesday that the plaintiffs in the case — a coalition of 14 Democratic state attorneys general challenging Mr. Musk's authority — had demonstrated a clear need to shed light on the inner workings of Mr. Musk's team. It was the first time a judge has ordered Mr. Musk's division be subject to discovery.

In the weeks after Mr. Musk's team fanned out across federal agencies demanding access to federal offices and databases, lawyers seeking to stop the group's advances have been forced to rely on news reports and anecdotal evidence about what, exactly, Mr. Musk's team has been doing.

In many cases, federal judges have grown frustrated by the inability of the government's own lawyers to answer straightforward questions about what data Mr. Musk's associates have viewed, or to what extent the group had directly spearheaded recent downsizing efforts. In filings in another case, the government has also downplayed Mr. Musk's role, claiming he was not officially the group's leader.

The group of states had asked Judge Chutkan to grant the request to let them probe Mr. Musk's team for information in order to confirm details about its operations and its future plans, and to “illustrate the nature and scope of the unconstitutional and unlawful authority” they said Mr. Musk has so far exercised.

Judge Chutkan agreed, writing in an opinion that “the requests seek to identify DOGE personnel and the parameters of DOGE's and Musk's authority — a question central to Plaintiffs' claims.”

The order on Wednesday was more limited than the states' slightly more ambitious request, which included a demand for two members of Mr. Musk's team to sit for depositions — an ask Judge Chutkan denied. But the order still requires Mr. Musk and his office to provide a broad array of information about its engagement with federal agencies, employees, contracts, grants and databases within three weeks.

Judges in other cases have responded similarly to demands for more clarity about Mr. Musk's team, which has largely been shrouded in secrecy.

On Thursday, a judge in California required an associate of Mr. Musk's who was detailed to the Office of Personnel Management, the government's human resources arm, to be deposed about any role he had in helping steer the mass firings of federal workers.

And on Monday, a judge in Washington ruled that Mr. Musk's office was subject to the Freedom of Information Act, and ordered it to rapidly produce records that a public ethics group had sued to obtain.

The Trump administration on Thursday demanded that Columbia University make dramatic changes in student discipline and admissions before it would discuss lifting the cancellation of $400 million in government grants and contracts.

It said the ultimatum was necessary because of what it described as Columbia's failure to protect Jewish students from harassment.

The government called for the university to formalize its definition of antisemitism, to ban the wearing of masks “intended to conceal identity or intimidate” and to place the school's Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies Department under “academic receivership.”

“We expect your immediate compliance,” officials from the General Services Administration, Department of Education and Department of Health and Human Services said in a letter.

They said that since the Trump administration had announced it was cutting the funding, “your counsel has asked to discuss ‘next steps.'” The administration demanded a response to its letter within a week as “a precondition for formal negotiations regarding Columbia University's continued financial relationship with the United States government.”

The Trump administration sent a letter to Columbia on Thursday demanding that the university make dramatic changes in student discipline and admissions before it would discuss lifting the cancellation of $400 million in government grants and contracts.

The Trump administration's move to cut Columbia's grants and contracts represented an extraordinary escalation of the government's actions against the university.

Columbia, it said, “has fundamentally failed to protect American students and faculty from antisemitic violence and harassment.”

A Columbia spokeswoman said Thursday evening that the school was “reviewing the letter"" from the three government agencies, adding, “We are committed at all times to advancing our mission, supporting our students, and addressing all forms of discrimination and hatred on our campus.”

On social media, Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia, described the government's letter as essentially saying, “We'll destroy Columbia unless you destroy it first.”

Hours earlier, the school announced a range of disciplinary actions against students who occupied a campus building last spring, including expulsions and suspensions.

The punishments levied include “multiyear suspensions, temporary degree revocations and expulsions,” according to a statement. The school did not release the names of students who would be punished, in compliance with federal privacy laws, according to a university spokeswoman. It is unclear how many students have been punished.

The announcement came one day after Gregory J. Wawro, a professor of political science who also serves as the university's rules administrator, said in a statement that the hearings for students accused of violations “in connection with the April 17-18 encampment on the South Lawn and the occupation of Hamilton Hall” had been completed.

Student defendants were allowed to bring two advisers, including legal counsel, to hearings, which were held over video conference, according to a Columbia employee with knowledge of the process who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to speak publicly.

Late Thursday, Columbia's interim president, Katrina Armstrong, said that the Department of Homeland Security had searched two dorm rooms after presenting two federal search warrants. In an email to students and staff, and a news release, Ms. Armstrong said that no one was detained and nothing had been taken. She did not say what the target of the warrants was.

Columbia University and the D.H.S. did not immediately respond to requests for comments after working hours.

The Trump administration has placed increasing scrutiny on universities in recent weeks. On Monday, it warned 60 other universities they, too, could face penalties from pending investigations into antisemitism on college campuses.

Last spring, Columbia began to issue suspensions of pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had been encamped for more than a week on campus as they protested the university's investment in Israel, including its dual-degree program with Tel Aviv University.

A protest that had mostly been nonviolent then took a turn, with demonstrators breaking into and seizing Hamilton Hall, an academic building. After about 20 hours, Columbia's president at the time, Dr. Nemat Shafik, called in the city's Police Department. Officers in riot gear arrested dozens of people.

A maintenance worker who was trapped in the building was physically injured in the melee.

In all, nearly 50 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had been inside Hamilton Hall were arrested, along with more than 100 others who were protesting in and around the campus.

Questions about how the university administration was handling discipline have dogged the school since.

In February, the House Committee on Education and Workforce sent a letter to Ms. Armstrong, and Columbia's board chairs, David Greenwald and Claire Shipman, listing “numerous antisemitic incidents” that it said had taken place in the last two academic years.

Those incidents include the student occupation of Hamilton Hall last April, the protest against a class taught by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the disruption of an Israeli history class.

Representative Tim Walberg, a Republican from Michigan who is the chair of the House committee, said he was glad that there has been forward movement but expressed frustration that the school has not provided the detailed disciplinary records his committee seeks.

“I welcome the news that some lawbreaking individuals are being held accountable,” Mr. Walberg said, “but I remain skeptical about Columbia University's long-term ability to continue to hold pro-terror supporters accountable given the school's obfuscation.”

The university said that it began its judicial process last summer, filing its complaints against students with the University Judicial Board, which is an independent panel of faculty, students and staff.

Students notified on Thursday of the sanctions have five business days to file an appeal, on grounds that there was a procedural error, availability of new information or “excessiveness of sanction.” A university appellate board has 10 days to issue a ruling.

Columbia University Apartheid Divest, a group that helped organize the protests and last fall asserted its support for “armed resistance,” said on its Instagram page Thursday that “the university's extreme repression is a panicked attempt at silencing the movement for Palestinian liberation,” adding that “they have seen our unyielding commitment to Palestine firsthand over the last year, and they are terrified.”

The announcement of sanctions can be seen as a sign that “Columbia has turned the corner,” said Professor Joshua Mitts, a professor in the law school who this semester is teaching a seminar on free speech and civil liberties on campus. He is also the adviser to Law Students Against Antisemitism, a campus group.

Calling the judicial process “fair and transparent,” Mr. Mitts said that the university showed its fidelity to due process, free speech and academic freedom as it sought to upend antisemitism.

“This is Columbia at its best,” he said.

Representative Raúl M. Grijalva, a progressive Arizona Democrat who was one of the first to urge President Biden to end his re-election campaign last year, has died from cancer, his office said in a statement. Grijalva, 78, was first elected to Congress in 2002.

Grijalva had been absent from the Capitol in recent months as he battled cancer. Those absences — and vacancies from House Republicans stepping down to take jobs in the Trump administration — has significantly affected the balance of power in the House, in which Republicans have a very slim majority.

Johns Hopkins University, one of the country's leading centers of scientific research, said on Thursday that it would eliminate more than 2,000 workers in the United States and abroad because of the Trump administration's steep cuts, primarily to international aid programs.

The layoffs, the most in the university's history, will involve 247 domestic workers for the university, which is based in Baltimore, and an affiliated center. Another 1,975 positions will be cut in 44 countries. They affect the university's Bloomberg School of Public Health, its medical school and an affiliated nonprofit, Jhpiego.

Nearly half the school's total revenue last year came from federally funded research, including $365 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development. In all, the university will lose $800 million in funding over several years from U.S.A.I.D., which the Trump administration is in the process of dismantling.

Johns Hopkins is one of the top university recipients of the funding that the administration is aiming to slash. And it appears to be among the most deeply affected of the major research institutions that are reeling from cuts — or the threat of cuts — to federal money that they depend on for research studies and running labs.

In a statement on Thursday calling it a “difficult day,” Johns Hopkins said it was “immensely proud” of its work on the projects, which included efforts to “care for mothers and infants, fight disease, provide clean drinking water and advance countless other critical, lifesaving efforts around the world.”

In a statement last week describing Johns Hopkins's reliance on federal funding, Ron Daniels, the university's president said, “We are, more than any other American university, deeply tethered to the compact between our sector and the federal government.”

Of the school's total operating revenue in 2023, $3.8 billion, or nearly half, came federally funded research. The Trump administration has said that it wants to make the government leaner and more efficient by, among other measures, dramatically cutting financial support for the program, which promotes public health and food security in low-income countries.

In ordering cutbacks in the agency, which amount to a 90 percent reduction in its operations, President Trump said that it was run by “radical left lunatics” and that is was riddled with “tremendous fraud.”

Critics of the decision, however, have said the cuts are ushering in a new era of isolationism that could prove to be dangerous. Sunil Solomon, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins, said the cuts would lead to a resurgence in the spread of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.

“What true great nations do is help other nations, but now, it seems, we're America first,” Dr. Solomon said.

The administration has also sought to reduce the amount of money that the National Institutes of Health sends to university for research, cuts that have been blocked for now in the courts. If they go into effect, those cuts would reduce federal payments to Johns Hopkins by more than $100 million a year, according to an analysis of university figures.

The university, which receives about $1 billion a year in N.I.H. funding and is currently running 600 clinical trials, is one of the plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit challenging those cuts.

Separately, the Trump administration also has targeted specific schools for cuts. It slashed $400 million from Columbia's budget last week based on accusations that it had failed to protect students and faculty from antisemitism.

Johns Hopkins and Columbia are on a list of 10 schools that the administration says are being scrutinized by an executive branch antisemitism task force. The administration has threatened to reduce federal funding for schools on the list, and others, that it views as being noncompliant with federal civil rights laws.

In addition to the more than 2,000 employees whose jobs have been eliminated, the university said that an additional 78 domestic employees and 29 international would be furloughed at reduced schedules.

The cuts at Johns Hopkins involve programs funded by U.S.A.I.D. through which American universities have worked with global partners, largely to advance public health and agricultural research. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this week that 5,200 of the agency's 6,200 contracts had been canceled and that the remaining programs would be operated directly by the State Department, eliminating the need for U.S.A.I.D., which is under the State Department.

Research projects that are being eliminated include international work on tuberculosis, AIDS and cervical cancer, as well as programs that directly benefit residents of Baltimore.

Dr. Solomon, the epidemiologist, runs a $50 million, six-year program to improve H.I.V. outcomes in India. He said the budget cuts in his program alone would result in layoffs of about 600 people in the United States and India. The program had led to, among other things, the diagnosis of almost 20,000 people with H.I.V. through contact tracing.

“It's heartbreaking,” Dr. Solomon said. “Stopping funding isn't going to kill you today, but in six months you're going to see an impact around the world.”

Dr. Judd Walson runs the department of international health at Johns Hopkins, which oversaw a five-year, $200 million program to diagnose and control tuberculosis in 20 countries funded by U.S.A.I.D.

In Kampala, Uganda, he said, the program was the only way children were diagnosed.

“That's just one example of how the sudden withdrawal of support is having real impacts on survival,” he said.

In addition to the loss of jobs at Johns Hopkins, he said, the loss of the programs will lead to a spike in communicable diseases worldwide.

What is essentially a shutdown of U.S.A.I.D. has had significant effects at universities around the country.

An organization called USAID StopWork, which is tracking the layoffs, said that overall, 14,000 domestic workers had lost their jobs so far, with thousands more anticipated.

Research by the Federal Reserve shows that universities serve as major economic engines in many agricultural regions, from Iowa to Florida, meaning that the impact of the administration's cuts to science research will be felt in both red states and left-leaning communities like Baltimore.

The elimination of a $500 million agriculture project called Feed the Future, which funded agriculture labs at 19 universities in 17 states, means many of those labs must shutter.

At the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 30 people have lost their jobs at a Feed the Future lab that worked on improving soybean cultivation in Africa, according to Peter D. Goldsmith, a professor of agriculture who ran that laboratory.

At Mississippi State University in Starkville, Miss., a fisheries laboratory was shut down, according to Sidney L. Salter, a university spokesman, who did not disclose the number of jobs lost.

Economic ripple effects of the funding cuts are expected to spread through the Baltimore area. Johns Hopkins, which enrolls about 30,000 students, is also one of Maryland's largest private employers.

An earlier version of this article misstated the amount that Johns Hopkins received in one year from the U.S. Agency for International Development. It is $365 million, not $800 million.

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, one of the nation's most prominent Democratic governors and among those seen as considering running for president in 2028, said she had a one-on-one meeting with President Trump at the White House Thursday afternoon. 

“I had a productive meeting at the White House today with President Trump where we discussed bringing good paying jobs to Michigan,” Whitmer said. “We also discussed tariffs, the importance of keeping our great lakes clean and safe, and additional defense investments in the state. I'm grateful for his time today.”

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, told colleagues in their private luncheon at the Capitol on Thursday that he would vote to clear the way for a final vote on the Republican bill extending government funding, according to multiple people familiar with the comments. That is the clearest signal yet that Democrats could relent and let the bill to avert a shutdown at the end of the week pass despite deep reservations among virtually the entire conference.

Tesla, Elon Musk's electric car company, warned the Trump administration not to impose tariffs in ways that could hurt U.S. manufacturers. The government ought to “ensure that U.S. manufacturers are not unduly burdened by trade actions that could result in the imposition of cost-prohibitive tariffs on necessary components, or other import restrictions on items essential to support U.S. manufacturing jobs,” the company said in an unsigned letter to the U.S. trade representative, Jamieson Greer, dated March 11.

Tesla joins many businesses sending letters seeking to influence the trade representative's office, but its message carries perhaps more weight given that Musk is playing a very active role in the administration's efforts to reshape the federal government. Tesla makes all the cars it sells in the United States at factories in California and Texas. It also has factories in Nevada and New York.

The world's most widely followed stock-market benchmark slid into a correction on Thursday, a drop that underscores how the two-year-long bull market is running out of steam in the early days of the Trump administration.

The move stems from investors' growing pessimism about the whipsawing policy pronouncements from Washington over the past few weeks. On-again, off-again tariffs and mass layoffs of federal workers have fomented unease on Wall Street.

On Thursday, the S&P 500 fell 1.4 percent. After weeks of selling, the index is now down 10.1 percent from a peak that it reached less than one month ago and is in a correction — a Wall Street term for when an index falls 10 percent or more from its peak, and a line in the sand for investors worried about a sell-off gathering steam.

Other major indexes, including the Russell 2000 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, had already fallen into correction. On Thursday, the Nasdaq fell 2 percent, while the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which tend to be more exposed to the ebb and flow of the economy, was 1.6 percent lower.

The deeper worry among investors is that uncertainty around the effects of President Trump's policies is causing consumers to spend less and discouraging businesses from investing. That reticence could, in turn, drive the economy into a downturn, forcing investors to reassess company valuations.

“I think what markets are telling us is that they are very concerned about the potential for a recession,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. “That is certainly not what markets expected going into 2025.”

This is the 11th correction in the S&P 500 since the 2008-9 financial crisis, according to data from Yardeni Research. Three of the previous downturns turned into bear markets, defined as a more severe decline of at least 20 percent.

Since the 2008-9 financial crisis, there have been nearly a dozen corrections — declines of 10 percent — in the S&P. Three of those resulted in bear markets — declines of 20 percent.

Note: The vertical is adjusted so percentage changes are comparable.

So far, the administration has brushed off the market turmoil. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Thursday that he was focused on the “real economy,” downplaying signals sent by business leaders and investors. “I'm not concerned about a little bit of volatility over three weeks,” he said.

As stocks have been falling in recent weeks, the Trump administration has emphasized that its economic policies are designed to promote job growth over the long term, but could cause some market turmoil in the short term.

Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the economy had already begun to be “negatively impacted.”

The pain has been acutely felt among the behemoth tech companies that drove the market higher in recent years, but their once rallying share prices have since reversed course. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has fallen roughly 14 percent from its peak in December.

The sell-off has also spread to other corners of the market, signaling broader concerns than simply a re-pricing of highly valued technology companies. The Russell 2000 has fallen 18 percent from its peak in November, close to a full-fledged bear market.

Sectors of the stock market exposed to tariffs, like food producers, have slumped. The effects are being felt by other companies, like retailers and airlines, that are worried about a pullback among consumers should the economy enter a downturn. On Thursday, the low-cost retailer Dollar General said customer traffic fell in its most recent quarter, and the company predicted continued financial pressure. Delta Air Lines cut its financial forecast this week for the first three months of the year, citing less demand for domestic travel.

“So far in 2025, the U.S. economy has only faced headwinds,” Ms. Shah said.

On Thursday, Mr. Trump threatened to impose 200 percent tariffs on European wine and champagne, one day after the European Union announced retaliatory tariffs on imports of U.S. whiskey and several other American products. The president has already added tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and a wide swath of products from China.

And when asked by reporters about tariffs on Canada — one of the United States' largest trading partners — he was adamant that he would not offer a reprieve.

“I'm sorry, we have to do this,” Mr. Trump said.

The constantly moving goal posts have left investors so rattled that even recent good news about the economy hasn't had a calming effect. On Thursday, a report on weekly unemployment claims came in lower than expected. On Wednesday, a better-than-expected reading of the Consumer Price Index had briefly helped bolster stocks.

Investors are worried that tariffs, once in full effect, will push prices higher — hurting business and consumers. Mr. Trump's immigration policies and firings of federal employees through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency are also looming in the backdrop, as is the threat of an impending government shutdown.

“The outlook for inflation depends more on tariffs, deportations and DOGE than the backward-looking data releases right now,” Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said on Thursday.

The S&P 500 fell 1.4 percent today, pushing the benchmark index into a correction — a Wall Street term for when an index falls 10 percent or more from its recent high. The index is down 10.1 percent from its mid-February peak, a drop that underscores how the two-year-long bull market is running out of steam in the early days of the Trump administration as investors are rattled by trade wars and an uncertain economic outlook.

Four fair housing organizations sued the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Government Efficiency on Thursday, faced with the sudden rescission of approximately 30 million in critical grant dollars.

The organizations — in Massachusetts, Idaho, Texas and Ohio — were among 66 housing rights nonprofits across the country that received a letter in late February informing them that key funding used to help individuals fight eviction and seek redress for discrimination had been cut off. The lawsuit was brought on behalf of a proposed class of the groups.

According to the lawsuit filed in Massachusetts district court, HUD and DOGE, operating at the direction of President Trump, made an “egregious overstep” when they canceled dozens of grants connected to the Fair Housing Initiatives Program. The program and the grants distributed to state and city organizations are used to enforce the federal Fair Housing Act that prohibits discrimination in housing based on race, ethnicity, religion and other factors, like gender identity and disability.

Most fair housing complaints in the United States are handled by local housing organizations: In 2022, these groups received more than 33,000 complaints.

Local fair housing organizations generally have annual budgets of less than $1 million, and the grants account for a significant portion of their revenues. The groups say they had no warning that the funding would end abruptly. “The impact of these dollars is concrete and profound,” the complaint reads.

“It's how they pay their bills,” said Yiyang Wu, a lawyer at the civil rights law firm Relman Colfax, which is representing the fair housing organizations. “It's their bread and butter.”

In its letters, HUD told the organizations that each grant being canceled “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”

HUD and DOGE launched a joint task force they said would eliminate waste, fraud and abuse last month. In a news release announcing the task force on Feb. 13, HUD Secretary Scott Turner said that under his leadership, the department would be “detailed and deliberate about every dollar spent” to “better serve the American people.”

The department has made widespread slashes to initiatives that it said promoted diversity, equity and inclusion programs. “DEI is dead at HUD,” Mr. Turner has repeatedly said in recent weeks.

Since receiving notice of the funding cuts, some fair-housing groups are now leaning on their reserves to pay bills. Others are already struggling.

The San Antonio Fair Housing Council, which previously had four full-time staff, three part-time staff and three per-diem workers, was forced to lay off more than half of its work force.

The Massachusetts Fair Housing Center was forced to turn away clients, including a domestic violence survivor who was facing displacement from her temporary shelter. And the Intermountain Fair Housing Council, which serves the entire state of Idaho, has been forced to “narrow its service area, leaving 10 counties without any eviction prevention or fair housing services,” the lawsuit reads.

The grant termination, said Lila Miller, another lawyer at Relman Colfax, was illegal because the grants had been allotted by Congress. She said Congress has not authorized DOGE to direct another agency's operations.

“Congress makes the law and Congress sets the bounds of agency action,” she said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news","Putin still intends Ukraine domination, U.S. intelligence reports say","https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/03/13/putin-trump-ukraine-russia-ceasefire/","Fri, 14 Mar 2025 05:30:55 GMT","

While offering a cautious assessment on ceasefire chances, spy agencies say the Russian leader is determined to hold sway over Kyiv.

Classified U.S. intelligence reports, including one earlier this month, cast doubt on Vladimir Putin's willingness to end the war against Ukraine, assessing that the Russian president has not veered from his maximalist goal of dominating his western neighbor, according to people familiar with the analysis.

One of the secret assessments distributed to Trump administration policymakers, dated March 6, says Putin remains determined to hold sway over Kyiv, a person familiar with the document said. Like others in this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified intelligence.

The reports are not intended to assess President Donald Trump's high-stakes diplomacy to end the three-year Ukraine war or the prospects of a 30-day ceasefire proposal that U.S. and Ukrainian officials agreed on this week. But they underscore the tough task Trump and his national security team face, and raise the question of whether the White House is misreading Putin's willingness to seek peace.

Putin on Thursday reacted cautiously to the ceasefire proposal. While not rejecting it outright, he hinted that Moscow might place conditions on any agreement. The Russian leader spoke in advance of a planned meeting in Moscow with Trump envoy Steve Witkoff to discuss the ceasefire plan. Russian troops, meanwhile, appear to be making significant progress in ousting Ukraine from a sliver of territory in Russia's Kursk province that Kyiv had hoped to use as a territorial bargaining chip.

Some current and former U.S. officials said that the Russian leader, even if he agreed to a temporary truce, would use it to rest and refit his troops — and was likely to break the terms of the deal by creating a provocation that he would blame on Ukraine.

Other officials said the reports were more cautious on what peace terms Putin might accept. But they acknowledged that there is no sign Putin has relented in his demand that Ukraine be brought into Russia's security and economic orbit. “He has a long-standing desire to restore ‘Mother Russia,'” one official said.

The CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment.

“I don't believe a ceasefire or even a truce or a treaty will be an end to the story,” said Eugene Rumer, a former U.S. intelligence official and Russia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “This is the new permanent standoff between Russia and the rest of Europe.”

Other analysts said they thought the talks could yield a positive outcome if Washington and Europe play their cards right.

“For Putin to stop fighting, he has to think he can win in a negotiation,” said Eric Ciaramella, who is also a former U.S. intelligence official and Russia expert at Carnegie. “But that doesn't mean he will win. The key to making a favorable and lasting ceasefire deal will be setting up security arrangements for Ukraine that would allow it to rebuild its military strength and deter a renewed attack.”

While it is unclear whether Trump was personally briefed on the March 6 intelligence report, the person familiar said it is the type of analysis that has traditionally been shared with the president.

Some of the U.S. assessments on Putin's intransigence have appeared to irk Trump, another person familiar with the matter said. Indeed, Trump and his aides in recent days have raised the prospect of stiff new sanctions on Russia if it refuses to agree to end the war. They have not specified what those sanctions would be, though Trump on Wednesday said they “could be devastating.”

“The president desperately wants a deal,” the person said. “And the Russians are showing no signs of relenting. They're ramping up their demands.”

The ceasefire proposal announced Tuesday after U.S.-Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia would include a 30-day halt in fighting to freeze military positions along 1,800 miles of front lines. It was the latest turnabout in a two-week stretch that saw a near-rupture in relations between Washington and Kyiv following a confrontational Oval Office meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Trump cut off U.S. military and intelligence aid to Ukraine last week to prod Zelensky to engage in peace talks. Once the agreement in Saudi Arabia was reached, Washington said it was lifting the prohibition on arms and intelligence.

On Wednesday, Trump refused to assess the odds of striking a deal with Putin. “I think it makes sense for Russia,” Trump told reporters. “We've also discussed land.”

Russia, which seized and annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 before launching a full-scale invasion in 2022, controls about 20 percent of Ukrainian territory and illegally annexed four eastern provinces near Russia's borders. Ukrainian officials say they want to restore the totality of the country's pre-2014 borders, although many officials and analysts say it is unlikely to regain Crimea through diplomacy or force.

The contours of an eventual territorial settlement are unclear. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov last month briskly rejected a French-British proposal for European peacekeeping troops to deploy to Ukraine to safeguard any peace agreement.

Throughout President Joe Biden's tenure, U.S. spy chiefs said publicly that they saw no sign the Russian leader had scaled back his aims for Ukraine, despite significant military setbacks in the months after Russia invaded in February 2022.

Putin has stated publicly that his terms for a peace deal include keeping full control of the four eastern Ukrainian provinces Russia has occupied, preserving a “land bridge” between Russia and Crimea, and gaining possession of territory that Ukraine currently controls, such as the cities of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. He also wants Ukraine to be nominally independent but subservient to Moscow, a former U.S. official said.

Putin's calculations could change if his military situation begins to deteriorate, the former official said. While much larger and more populous than Ukraine, Russia has seen more than 95,000 of its soldiers killed in the past three years, according to a BBC analysis. Some estimates put the total of killed and wounded near 500,000.

Meanwhile, a European intelligence official, citing intelligence gathered within the past month, said officials in Moscow believe that Trump is weak, lacks a core set of principles and may be open to manipulation.

The European intelligence official said that if a permanent ceasefire is achieved, Moscow probably will revert to “hybrid” or nonmilitary means of undermining Ukraine, as it did in 2014 after it invaded Crimea and eastern Ukraine and on through the full-scale invasion in 2022.

Those means include economic and diplomatic coercion; penetrating Ukrainian elites, business circles, security services and the military; and exerting influence through the Russian church in Ukraine, the official said. Russia's leaders have long painted Zelensky as a puppet of the West and tried to undermine his legitimacy.

“The 2022 invasion happened because the hybrid tools did not bring results,” the European official said.

Russia has stepped up its use of hybrid techniques in Europe in recent years, attempting an assassination of the CEO of a German arms maker, carrying out arson in Britain and other European countries, and meddling in elections in Moldova.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Elon Musk paid an unannounced visit to the National Security Agency on Wednesday and met with its chief, an NSA spokesperson said, days after he called for revamping the country's top cyberespionage hub.

It was Musk's first publicly confirmed visit to an intelligence agency since he launched the Trump administration's effort to drastically slash the federal workforce.

The NSA is one of the country's most valuable tools for collecting intelligence, according to experts, overseeing a vast eavesdropping operation, as well as sophisticated cybersecurity capabilities.

Musk, the billionaire businessman who has come under criticism for his aggressive tactics and sweeping secrecy, posted on his social media platform, X, last week, “The NSA needs an overhaul.” Musk's post and his visit suggested the long secretive agency, known as the “puzzle palace” for its famed codebreaking abilities, may be next. 

During his visit to the NSA's headquarters at Fort Meade, Maryland, Musk held talks with Air Force Gen. Timothy Haugh, who oversees the agency, as well as the military's Cyber Command, the spokesperson said. Musk was also given a tour of the NSA's Remote Operations Center, according to a source with knowledge of the matter.

Asked about the focus of the meetings, the NSA spokesperson said in an email that the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command are focused on priorities outlined by the president, the defense secretary and the director of national intelligence and that “meetings with key advisors ensure we are aligned.""

The Wall Street Journal first reported Musk's visit.

Some former intelligence officials and Democrats in Congress have warned against rushing to fire employees without careful planning to avoid losing talented officers and damaging national security. For decades, the federal government has struggled to compete with the private sector when it comes to hiring talented tech workers. 

The Defense Department oversees the budgets of parts of the intelligence community, and, as a result, some spy agencies are under instructions to meet a goal set by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to reduce the civilian workforce by 5% to 8%, the source said.  

“As part of the defense secretary's direction to streamline operations, bolster readiness and prioritize critical missions, the Department of Defense will continue efforts to eliminate positions that are non-mission critical and reduce the civilian workforce by 5 to 8 percent over the coming months,” according to a Pentagon memo signed by the acting deputy assistant defense secretary for civilian personnel policy, which was obtained by NBC News.

The Defense Department memo encourages managers to use early retirement or other buyout options to meet the goal by June. 

To try to meet the administration's orders to reduce its workforce, the NSA is looking at offering employees early retirement and/or other buyout options, the source said.  

Other intelligence agencies are also grappling with how to reduce their numbers of employees without damaging their missions. The CIA has started to fire some employees who were hired in the past two years, NBC News has reported.

The head of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Navy Vice Adm. Frank Whitworth, acknowledged this week that there is some concern among employees about plans to cut the workforce across the federal government.

“There is nothing like mission to help people stay focused no matter what else is going on,” SpaceNews quoted Whitworth as saying at an event Monday in Washington. “That said, they're humans, they have stresses.”

Canadian officials said a Thursday meeting with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick was constructive and lowered temperatures amid the ongoing trade war launched by U.S. President Donald Trump last month — but they expected no immediate changes to punishing tariffs. 

""This was a constructive discussion,"" said Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne in Washington. ""We have our disagreements, but as long as you have dialogue you are making progress.""

Trump's plans to massively realign global trade have thrown markets on both sides of the border into disarray and are forcing layoffs in some of Canada's critical industries like steel production.

Champagne was joined by Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc, Canada's Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman and Ontario Premier Doug Ford for the meeting at the end of another roller-coaster week in trade relations between the two countries.




On Tuesday, Trump threatened to double steel and aluminum duties on Canada in response to Ford slapping a 25 per cent surcharge on the province's electricity exports to three U.S. states. Before the end of that day, Ford backed off the surcharge and Trump backed down on doubling the steel and aluminum tariffs.

Trump went ahead Wednesday with an additional 25 per cent import tariff on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S., including from Canada.

Canada responded with 25 per cent tariffs on another $29.8 billion worth of American goods, which took effect just after midnight Thursday. Canada last week applied 25 per cent tariffs to $30 billion in U.S. goods in response to the first round of tariffs from the U.S.

""We're like a family. Sometimes there's tension between families,"" Ford said Thursday in Washington at a separate news conference from the federal ministers. ""But that was an extremely productive meeting.""




A news release from the U.S. Department of Commerce said the Canadian and American officials discussed the Trump administration's ""goal of fair trade with Canada and the province of Ontario, while working to secure America's border and eliminate fentanyl.""

""Both countries recognized the strength and history of their relationship,"" it said. 

Jamieson Greer, Trump's recently confirmed United States trade representative, was also at the meeting. 

Champagne and LeBlanc were not clear whether much will change in the relationship between the two countries after Mark Carney replaces Justin Trudeau as prime minister Friday.

Champagne said he expects Carney and Trump to have a conversation in the coming days.

Trump and Trudeau have had a difficult and often tumultuous relationship. Trump has goaded Trudeau for months about Canada becoming the 51st state, referring to him repeatedly as ""Governor Trudeau.""




The comments continued Wednesday as Trump met with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte in Washington.

""To be honest with you, Canada only works as a state,"" Trump sad.

Trump called the international border between the two countries an ""artificial line"" and said there's no chance he'll relent on tariffs.

""Now there will be a little disruption ... it won't be very long,"" he said. ""But they need us, and we really don't need them … We have to do this. I'm sorry. We have to do this.""

That issue was front and centre Thursday as the man set to become America's top diplomat in Ottawa took questions at his congressional confirmation hearing.

When asked about Trump's repeated annexation threats during his Senate confirmation hearing, Pete Hoekstra said that ""Canada is a sovereign state.""




When senators asked him whether a ""joke"" about annexation is ever appropriate, Hoekstra said he could not comment on the president's relationship with Trudeau.

If confirmed, the former Michigan congressman will become ambassador at a fraught time in U.S.-Canada relations. 

Trump linked some tariff actions to the flow of deadly fentanyl but Canadian officials have said the president's goal is to use economic force to annex Canada.

Hoekstra told the hearing Trump has a series of priorities for Canada, which include freer trade and fighting the flow of fentanyl.

New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen pushed back on Hoekstra, saying that the volume of fentanyl coming from Canada is minuscule and noting that Canada has one of the lowest tariff regimes.




Hoekstra later acknowledged ""it's not a huge amount"" of fentanyl coming from Canada.

Shaheen's state borders Canada and she said businesses there were operating according to the rules in the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement, also called CUSMA, which was negotiated by Trump during his first administration.

Shaheen said she's fielded calls from business owners whose orders from Canada were cancelled as a result of Trump's tariffs and rhetoric.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=tennis+news","‘King of Clay' Nadal reveals his second-best surface…","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/nadal-roddick-podcast-interview-march-2025","Fri, 14 Mar 2025 15:28:57 GMT","

 Was there a fundamental misunderstanding of Rafael Nadal's all-surface potential early in his iconic career? 

 The Spaniard himself believes so. Nadal, who retired in November as a 92-time tour-level champion, thinks that his early success on clay warped others' expectations of him on faster surfaces. 

 “Because I started winning a lot on clay, people started thinking I was a clay-court player,” Nadal told his fellow former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings Andy Roddick on the Served podcast. “But the truth is, of course my game adapted well to the clay, but I loved playing on fast courts… I finished my career winning a couple of US Opens [late on], but my second-best surface was grass.”

 Nadal won a record 14 of his 22 major titles on the clay at Roland Garros, while on hard courts he won twice at the Australian Open and four times at the US Open. He also lifted the trophy twice in 15 appearances at Wimbledon, and the Spaniard never doubted he would have success on grass despite making many of his early title breakthroughs on slower surfaces. 

 “I played the Wimbledon final in 2006, so it's not like it took me five years to play well on grass,” said Nadal, whose breakout season came in 2005, when he won 11 tour-level trophies as an 18-year-old. “I lost in the second round in 2005 against Gilles Muller. In 2004, I couldn't play because I was injured, but in 2003 I beat [future Wimbledon semi-finalist] Mario Ancic already in the first round. So my game adapted well to all surfaces.” 



 Nadal revealed to Roddick that his progress on grass was crucially hampered in the middle of his career by problems with his knees. 

 “I was in the Wimbledon final in 2006, 2007, won it in 2008, in 2009 I was not able to play,"" explained Nadal. ""Then I won in 2010 and played the final in 2011, so not counting 2009, I played five finals in a row. Then arrived a point when I was not able to play on grass for many years. My knees were not holding, I was not able to slow down… After that, 2012 to 2016, my knees were not good enough to play on grass. Then I recovered well in my knees and started playing well on grass again. 

 “For me it was painful, because I felt that my chances were bigger, if I was healthy enough, on grass than hard. Honestly, I preferred to play against Novak [Djokovic] on grass than on hard.” 

 In a wide-ranging interview, Roddick also asked his fellow ATP No. 1 Club member Nadal questions on a variety of other topics, including his role at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games opening ceremony and the work done by the Rafa Nadal Foundation.

By Joshua Dawson

LGBTQ+ tennis players were brought together from across Britain for a weekend of competition and celebration at the second annual Pride in Tennis Cup in Newport.

The event, run by Pride in Tennis, the LGBTQ+ network for tennis in Britain, and hosted by Tennis Wales, took place across the weekend of 8/9th March and saw more than 50 players from eight clubs come together at Newport Tennis Centre to take part in two competitions.

Ollie Neale of Southsea Topspinners triumphed in the Rally Allies Trophy, beating runner-up Mahender Pal of London's F.A.S.T. to the title.

That competition is a rotational doubles event for more advanced players where individuals, representing their clubs, compete in a series of doubles matches.

While in the Pride in Tennis Cup, local favourites the Cardiff Baseliners claimed victory, consigning defending champions F.A.S.T. to the runner-up spot.

The team event saw eight teams of beginners and improvers compete across two groups of four, with group winners and runners-up progressing to semi finals and lower placed teams entering a consolation draw.

Also taking part were the North London Lobsters from London, Manchester's Northern Aces, the Bristol Breakers, the Geordie Grandslammers from Newcastle, and the Weegie Whackers from Glasgow.

These clubs are part of the Pride in Tennis network, the LGBTQ+ network for tennis in Britain.

Simon Johnson, CEO of Tennis Wales, highlighted the importance of events like the Pride in Tennis Cup, saying: “It was a pleasure to be able to work with Pride in Tennis to host the Pride in Tennis Cup here in Wales.

“Events such as this are vital in helping to show people from LGBTQ+ communities, as well as other underrepresented communities such as those from different ethnic or underserved communities, that tennis is a sport for all.

“We're proud to have worked with Pride in Tennis on this event, and look forward to further collaboration to open up the sport in future.”

The network seeks to promote LGBTQ+ inclusion in tennis and, through its Rally Allies programme, funded by the LTA Tennis Foundation.

It works with the LTA, LEAP Sport Scotland, and tennis venues across the country to provide education to support and celebrate tennis players from LGBTQ+ communities.

Alfred Wong, Vice-Chair of Pride in Tennis said after the event: “Events like the Pride in Tennis Cup create further opportunities for safe and welcoming spaces for LGBTQ+ communities to feel more included and foster a greater sense of belonging.

“With over 50 players from across the country coming to Newport to take part, it's been a great success, and I want to thank Tennis Wales and the staff at Newport Tennis Centre for helping us to put on such a great event.”","{'href': 'https://uk.sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Eurosport UK'}"

Andre Agassi will forever be known as a legend when it comes to tennis and he left a sizeable stamp on the game during his playing days. 

Before Roger Federer started his rivalry with Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, Agassi and Pete Sampras used to battle it out for supremacy in the world of professional tennis. 

Agassi retired after a shocking realisation in 2006 but the American delivered years of devoted service to the sport and claimed eight Grand Slam singles titles. 

Sampras had immense respect for Agassi and over the years the pair had a brilliant rivalry, featuring some stunning matches at the world's top tournaments. 

As with most top players these days, Agassi knew when the time was right to retire and he's had to watch on as the Big Three blow the records set by him and Sampras out of the water. 

Back in 2014, Agassi was quizzed on who would make a theoretical Mount Rushmore compilation if it came to tennis players. 

In an interview with the Reno Gazette Journal, he was anything but hesitant when it came to picking three of the players he'd include. 

However, in 2014, there was one of the Big Three that wouldn't have been a definite pick when it came to making the grade in the eyes of Agassi. 

He said: “The top four would be, not in any particular order, Nadal, (Rod) Laver, Federer and the four is absolutely an open case. 

“I would leave the face uncarved for a few more years. You could debate (Bjorn) Borg if he had played longer. 

“You could debate a lot of things. I'll leave the fourth on Mount Rushmore pure stone to be carved, maybe even carve if next year if Djokovic does what he's still capable of doing.”

Well, given he made these comments in 2014, we had better take a lot at how many there would be on there if he included Borg or Djokovic. 

Clearly Federer and Nadal were a given. They amassed a number of Grand Slam victories over their career and anyone would be hard pushed not to include those two. 

If Agassi was asked the same question now, surely Djokovic would be carved on the space that he suggested he'd leave back when he gave the interview. 

Djokovic might be coming towards the end of his career but to still be in the top 10 of the ATP World Rankings and getting to the business end of majors at 37 is no mean feat. 

This type of discussion offers everyone an opinion. Surely, however, most people associated with having a passion for tennis would agree on three of the names. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}"

DEI Resources

 

Tempe, AZ – Just in the past few weeks, two universities have announced the reinstatement of college tennis on their campuses as Wittenberg University has reinstated men's and women's tennis and Northeastern State University has reinstated men's tennis.

As two universities with a rich history at both the NCAA Division II (Northeastern State) and the NCAA Division III (Wittenberg) levels, the two programs had very different paths to reinstatement but each relied on the support and excitement of their alumni bases to showcase the need for the return of these programs to each campus.

“The decision to continue the tennis program is great for the University, current and future players, and, most importantly, the alumni,” John DeVito, head coach, said in a statement released by the Wittenberg athletics department. “Without their assistance and continuous support, the decision to continue Men's and Women's Tennis at Wittenberg would have never happened.”

“Over the last few years, I've had the privilege of meeting several men's tennis alumni, and I'm sure they're just as excited as we are to see this program return,” Tim McLane, head coach, added in a statement from the Northeastern State athletics department. “We welcome their involvement and support as we move forward.”

These two programs join a host of other colleges and universities who have brought back tennis to their campuses over the past few years. They join the University of Mount Saint Vincent (M&W), West Liberty University (M&W), Louisiana Christian University (W), and Centenary College (M&W) to name a few.

Wittenberg is currently competing this spring semester, while Northeastern State will return to competition in the fall of 2025 when their men's program returns. To read more about the reinstatement of both programs please explore the official releases from Wittenberg University and Northeastern State University.

Match Recap: Men's Tennis | 3/13/2025 11:11:00 PM 

at Wake Forest University

3/16/2025 | TBA

GREENSBORO – The North Carolina A&T men's tennis team lost one of the most decorated players in program history after the 2023 season when Vasil Ivanov played his last match for the Aggies.

It was a significant loss, but fortunately, A&T had another highly accomplished and all-conference player, Esteban Lopez, to lead the Aggies to a 15-5 record and a berth in the Coastal Athletic Association Men's Tennis Championship Tournament. Lopez departed after the 2024 season without another all-conference player behind.

Somehow, that doesn't seem to be a problem either. The Aggies improved to 11-0 on Thursday with a 4-2 win at the Piedmont Indoor Tennis Center over a Long Island University (LIU) Sharks team that defeated Campbell earlier this season.

A&T's impressive start, minus Ivanov and Lopez, means the Aggies have built a strong program. Period.

""Our guys have been fighting hard to win at every turn on their campaign since the middle of February,"" said A&T head men's tennis coach Dejon Bivens. ""They have wanted to be dominant and stay unbeaten. I have been pushing our guys to bring out their best, and what is scary is that their best tennis is still coming.""

That best tennis will hopefully come on Sunday when the Aggies face the No. 1 team in the nation in, the Wake Forest Demon Deacons at the Wake Forest Tennis Center at 4 p.m. Wake Forest is 21-0 and the reigning NCAA indoor national champions.

""Our guys are well-trained warriors,"" said Bivens. ""They may be a bit tired, but they will bring their best this Sunday. We certainly miss having Esteban and Vasil, but these guys are writing their own history and will continue to shatter all doubt and look to make noise not just in our conference but in the nation.""

A&T brought the noise on Thursday. LIU and A&T did not play doubles matches because the Sharks had time constraints because of travel.

A&T received two crucial wins from a rookie and a veteran. Senior Ian Pedersen staged a thrilling three-setter against Leon Harder at No. 1 singles, winning the opening set 6-0 before losing Set No. 2, 7-5. Pedersen then slammed the door shut with a convincing 6-1 win in the third.

It marked Pedersen's second straight three-set win in as many days, improving him to 4-2 at No. 1 singles and 9-2 overall. Freshman Jindrich Brill then stepped in and defeated Ales D'Anna 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 at No. 5 singles to win his third straight match to improve to 10-1 this season.

Sophomore Lucas Coupo-Moison and sophomore Said Akbarov had heartbreaking three-set losses. Otherwise, the Aggies may have earned the sweep on Thursday. Coupo-Moison lost to Philip Hilble 6-7, 7-5, 6-2 at No. 2 singles, while Daniel Ishchanka defeated Akbarov 4-6, 6-3, 7-6.

Sophomore Kaua Santos and junior Mathieu Dussaubat had convincing two-set wins, accounting for A&T's complete point total. Santos defeated Victor Sjostrom 6-0, 6-2 at No. 3 singles, and Dussaubat handled Felix Abraham 6-1, 6-3 at No. 6 singles.

""This was a great win by our guys,"" said Bivens. ""I could not be more pleased, especially since LIU came into the match confidently defeating one of our toughest conference rivals in Campbell earlier this week.""

Michigan State University

No. 68 Wisconsin

3/13/2025 10:04:00 PM  | Men's Tennis

Michigan State looks to build on momentum from upset win over No. 10 Arizona, as they face tough Big Ten opponents on the road.

EAST LANSING, Mich. – Michigan State men's tennis hits the road for more Big Ten Conference road action, as they take on B1G conference opponents Nebraska and Wisconsin. 

Spartans Last Outing
Before heading back on the road, Michigan State men's tennis delivered a thrilling 4-3 victory over No. 10 Arizona on Wednesday at the MSU Indoor Tennis Center. After dropping the doubles point and falling behind 0-1, the Spartans battled back to secure the upset win.

The victory marked MSU's third consecutive home win, snapping a five-match road losing streak and improving its record to 7-5 on the season. Meanwhile, Arizona fell to 14-2, seeing its nine-match winning streak come to an end in just its third road contest of the dual-match season.

The Spartans maintained consistency in their doubles lineup, sticking with the same pairings from the weekend. Junior Ozan Baris and redshirt sophomore Aristotelis Thanos took the No. 1 doubles spot, while the Sheldon brothers—senior Max and freshman Mitchell—competed at No. 2. Sophomore Taym Alazmeh and freshman Vuk Radjenovic completed the lineup at No. 3, solidifying the Spartans' doubles rotation.

The Spartans' first win of the day came from the Sheldon brothers, who battled back from an early 0-2 deficit to defeat Arizona's Cabrera and Christensen, 6-4.

Meanwhile, on the neighboring court, Taym Alazmeh and Vuk Radjenovic took on Gustafsson and Sekachov (UA) but fell short in a hard-fought 2-6 match.

With the doubles point on the line, Ozan Baris and Aristotelis Thanos faced off against Arizona's Friend and Padgham in a tightly contested showdown. The duo fought until the very end but ultimately fell in a tiebreak, 6-7 (0-7), giving the Wildcats the doubles point.

With Arizona securing the early lead, the Spartans were left needing a strong singles performance to pull off the upset.

Senior Max Sheldon quickly evened the score for the Spartans, dominating his match against Arizona's Filip Gustafsson with a commanding 6-2, 6-1 victory.

Arizona responded with a point of its own in a highly anticipated rematch between Ozan Baris and Jay Friend. The two had previously met in the NCAA Individual Championships, where Baris emerged victorious in the semifinals. This time, however, Friend got his revenge, defeating Baris 6-2, 6-2.

Freshman Matthew Forbes added another tally to the Spartans' score, securing a solid 6-3, 6-3 win over Arizona's Alexander Rozin and picking up another victory in his spring season.

The match-clinching moment came courtesy of freshman Vuk Radjenovic. After taking the first set 6-3, Arizona's Christensen responded with a dominant 6-0 second set. In a back-and-forth battle, Radjenovic dug deep and pulled ahead in the final set, sealing the victory for Michigan State.

With the team result decided, the final match between Mitchell Sheldon and Kask played out for the fans. The two put on an exciting display, but Mi. Sheldon ultimately fell in a hard-fought battle, 6-3, 4-6, 6-7 (8-10). 

Scouting Wisconsin
The Wisconsin Badgers men's tennis team has shown significant promise in the early stages of their 2025 spring season, currently holding a 4-1 record.

This marks a notable improvement from their previous season, where they finished at the bottom of the Big Ten with a 1-22 overall record and 0-9 in conference play.

Scouting Nebraska
The Nebraska men's tennis team holds an 8-4 overall record and a 1-1 mark in Big Ten Conference play. The team has demonstrated strong performances, notably securing consecutive victories against Ole Miss, Tulsa, and Creighton. 

The Huskers aim to surpass their 2023-24 season, during which they achieved a 17-10 record, reached the Big Ten Tournament semifinals, and concluded with the highest dual wins since 1990.

Up Next: 
The Green and White continue their busy March full of road trips with matchups at Indiana on March 22 and Purdue on March 23.","{'href': 'https://msuspartans.com', 'title': 'Michigan State Athletics'}"

Match Recap: Women's Tennis | 3/13/2025 9:27:00 PM 

GREENSBORO – Injuries have prevented the North Carolina A&T women's tennis team from playing with a six-player lineup all season, but it has not stopped the Aggies from being extremely competitive.

That trend continued Thursday against Long Island University at the Piedmont Indoor Tennis Center. The Aggies put together another strong effort, but the Sharks got a crucial three-set win at No. 2 singles and used the Aggies' forfeit at No. 6 singles to win 4-2. A&T dropped its third straight, falling to 5-3 overall.

""We suffered a bit of a setback against LIU, but their play has been stellar,"" said A&T head women's tennis coach Dejon Bivens. ""It is tough to be down a player and compete. But they have been showing a lot of grit and determination.""

The two teams did not play doubles because LIU was under a time constraint because of travel. The Sharks headed into the match with a 1-0 advantage because the Aggies had two players sidelined with injuries. What unfolded after the Sharks were awarded the point made for an excellent drama.

Three three-set matches followed, with the Aggies winning twice.

Unfortunately, the Sharks took command of the two-setters, starting with Lucia Garrigues defeating A&T freshman Dorsa Cheraghi 6-2, 6-1 at No. 1 singles. LIU took a 3-0 lead when Clara Tardivel claimed a 6-4, 7-5 win over Juana Weiss Gomez at No. 4.

A&T came roaring back, placing a win on the board when junior Hana El Sherif defeated Mia Tsoukalas 3-6, 6-2, 6-1. El Sherif improved to 5-3 this season. Another terrific three-setter emerged at No. 2 singles. LIU's Ksenia Reznitskaya outlasted A&T sophomore Randy Rakotoarilala 1-6, 7-5, 6-4.

That didn't stop freshman Flavia Villegas from continuing her hot streak. She has been a marvel at No. 5 for the Aggies this season, improving to 8-0 with a 6-4, 3-6, 10-6 win over Paula Guillen Cerver. It has been quite the week for the Bolivia native. She got a win over a Clemson player on Sunday before winning again on Thursday against Norfolk State.

""Flavia has been a standout, and I look forward to a bright future with her,"" said Bivens. ""We have a very young team with Hana El Sherif leading the way. Our ladies are hungry to get better, and with every match, they are showing that they will be dangerous. I am looking forward to what is to come from our ladies. We are off to a great start.""

The Aggies return to action on Saturday when they travel to Boling Springs, NC to face the Gardner-Webb Runnin' Bulldogs at 1:30 p.m., Wednesday, March 19.

Hosting Hancock County, Apollo tennis split, with the E-Gals winning 9-0 and the Hornets winning 8-1. 

For the E-Gals, Sami Ebelhar, Adelyn Dilback, Anna Dilback, Ruthie Layson, and Hser Moo all won their singles matches. The doubles teams of Morgan Shook and Scout Carroll and Eh Skitter and Annie Halbig also both won.

“We were able to play our first years and lower varsity members, and I am really proud of all of them,” Apollo head coach Janie Walther said. 

For the Hornets, Lucas Anderson, Alex Madden, Tyce Boling, Caleb Ewing, Tre London, and Van Reska all won their singles matches. The doubles teams of Madden and Boling, Anderson and Tre Condon, and Van Reska and Payne Pence all won. 

“I thought the boys competed well, but we need more killer instincts at times,” Hancock County head coach Dan Hopkins said. After four matches, we should be getting past game jitters. Alex is still rounding into shape, and this was a good win for Lucas. The girls struggled a bit, but our top doubles team competed well. I am proud of them.”

Editor's note: During Saturday's match against Santa Clara at noon, Cal Poly women's tennis will be holding a Nephrotic Syndrome Awareness Day to honor their Team IMPACT member, Brooke, and all those that fight the rare kidney disease.

SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. — If you've attended a Cal Poly women's tennis match over the last two seasons, you may have noticed an important, inspirational member of the team join the Mustangs pre-match huddles. Her name is Brooke Fritz. 

Every home match, the 9-year-old from Atascadero dresses in full uniform to match what the Mustangs are wearing that day and cheers them on from the sidelines. Brooke is the team's biggest cheerleader, supporter and inspiration.

“Brooke has become an integral part of our team,” said Sarah MacCallum, a junior on the Cal Poly women's tennis team. “Seeing her show up to our practice and matches with a big smile on her face to cheer us on has been so special. Besides the joy she brings us, she serves as an excellent reminder of why we started to play tennis and why we continue to play every day. We are so happy to be a part of this special experience with her.”

Brooke joined the Mustangs last season thanks to an organization called Team IMPACT, which matches children battling a serious illness or disease with a local college sports team to help create a life-changing experience for everyone involved. When Brooke was just 3 years old, she was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome, a rare kidney disorder.

Brooke's parents, Kristina and Mark, first discovered signs of something wrong during a flight home from Texas in 2018 when they noticed Brooke had swollen eyes and was continuously vomiting. The next day, the family took Brooke to the pediatrician, who immediately suspected that she might have nephrotic syndrome. Lab tests soon confirmed the diagnosis with countless hospital and ICU visits to follow in the coming days and months. During one 22-day hospital stay early on in the process, Brooke suffered congestive heart and kidney failure. But Brooke kept fighting and has battled the disease off and on for the last seven years, going in remission several times. 

Brooke is in a more stable condition now thanks to the incredible care from doctors and physicians, but still suffers relapses and flare ups. Kristina said the opportunity for Brooke to be a member of the Cal Poly women's tennis team for the 2024 and 2025 seasons has meant so much to their family and given her daughter so much more confidence.

“This opportunity has helped Brooke experience being a part of a team where they mutually support each other,” Kristina said. “Brooke gets to cheer the girls on for their matches, and the team gets to cheer her on in her fight.”

From the moment Brooke officially joined the team last year thanks to Team IMPACT, Cal Poly women's tennis head coach Ellie Edles Williams knew the 9-year-old would have an immediate impact on the team's culture and spirit, and it showed in the results. Last season, Cal Poly captured its second Big West Championship in program history and first since 2003 thanks to an incredible run in the conference tournament as the No. 5 seed. Brooke was there all season long to support the team and the Mustangs felt her presence, fighting for every point just like she would.

“From the first time I met her, I just instantly knew she was just going to be a great fit for our team and for our program,” Williams said. “She always comes to our practices with such a big smile on her face, and it's just such a great reminder of why we play sports and what it truly means to be part of a team and a family.”

While serving as a member of the leadership team that works closely with Team IMPACT, redshirt sophomore Amy Leather has had the chance to get to know Brooke extremely well and even given her tennis lessons. From forehands to backhands to serving, Brooke has learned it all, becoming more comfortable and familiar with the sport every time she steps on the court.

Leather said Brooke has been a true inspiration to the entire team and shown them they can overcome any challenge life presents them.

“In those long, hard practices, it's been a great, uplifting feeling to have Brooke there,” Leather said. “I'm so grateful that I've been able to spend so much time with her.”

As Brooke enters the last few months as an official member of the Cal Poly women's tennis team, Kristina said she can't thank Team IMPACT enough for providing her daughter with such a unique experience that has truly changed her life.

“Brooke suffers with anxiety and depression as a result of her chronic illness, “Kristina said, “and Team Impact has been a great way for her to be a part of something bigger than her disease and to build connections with individuals who encourage her to push through the challenges she faces while cheering on an amazing group of young women.”

Brooke's time as a Team IMPACT member on the team may be coming to a close soon, but Brooke and the Fritz family plan to continue attending Cal Poly women's tennis matches in the future as the whole family is now lifelong Mustang fans. 

During Saturday's home match against Santa Clara at noon at the Ronca Tennis Center, the Mustangs are partnering with the Nephrotic Syndrome Foundation to raise awareness for the disease and celebrate Brooke and her fight. Cal Poly will be donning special uniforms as part of their special Nephrotic Syndrome Awareness Day and Mustang fans are encouraged to come out and honor Brooke in her final season with the team.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=tennis+news","Tennis preview: Lehighton returns experience","https://www.tnonline.com/20250314/tennis-preview-lehighton-returns-experience/","Fri, 14 Mar 2025 17:48:47 GMT","



The tennis season is already underway, having started on Monday.

Four area schools will sport teams again this season.

Leading the way is Lehighton, which posted a solid 9-4 mark a year ago and has both Cokrlija brothers — Bayto and Bekim — returning.

Other area teams include Jim Thorpe, Palmerton and Pleasant Valley.

JIM THORPE

Head coach – Emilio Mercado (2nd year)

Assistant coach – Nathan White

Last year's record – 0-15 overall

Key players lost – Max Priore – an 11th-grader – is sidelined this season due to an off-season injury.

Key returnees – Alex Plesniarski and Ian Walk – both 11th-grade singles' players – return for another season. Coach Mercado spoke about what both players mean to the program. “Alex is our captain and an overall great player. He ensures everyone on the team feels supported, and is ready to help his teammates with their techniques or strategy.” As for Walk, a multi-sport athlete at Thorpe, Mercado said, “As a soccer player, Ian has incredible speed and hustle on the court. He chases down every tennis ball, and his unpredictable movements keep his opponents and teammates on their toes.”

Others to watch – Evan Rosenbrook (Sr., singles) and Trent Sutphin (So., doubles).

Strengths – Mercado, who also played tennis for the Olympians in high school, knows his program's biggest strength will be the overall team morale. “With an increase in team size, we've welcomed new players who are just starting to learn the sport,” he said. “Our focus is building their confidence, and improving consistency where everyone can succeed and play a good tennis match.”

Weaknesses – As a relatively new team, Mercado anticipates that there will be “some challenges in the early matches, especially with nerves and the flow of the game.” However, once his players settle in and gain match experience over time, Mercado believes this area of concern will diminish and confidence will grow.

Outlook – “Each player has their own individual goals, but as a team we share one common objective: win enough matches and qualify for team districts,” said Mercado. “With being in the Colonial League, we're excited to see how far we can go together and make it a memorable year.”

LEHIGHTON

Head coach – Cody Schuler (5th year)

Last year's record – 9-4 overall

Key players lost – Michael Bowman (doubles player)

Key returnees – Bayto Cokrlija (Sr., 11-1 record last season), Bekim Cokrlija (Jr., 10-2 record), and Isaac Carpenter (Sr.) have been practicing hard during the off season and are ready to take on the competition in the Colonial League.

Others to watch – Dante Kalbach (Sr.), Phillip Ebbert (Jr.), Jed Cordes (So.) and Julian May (Sr.) are all trying to solidify spots on the Indians' doubles teams. Other seniors who have helped the team over the past few years include Anna Howland, Patrick Devitt and Savanna Wehr.

Strengths – The Indians have an experienced team with several upperclassmen helping to lead the Tribe with leadership. Schuler commented that having the seniors around helps the younger players within the program better their game each and every day.

Weaknesses – Schuler was quick to point out a concern at the serving line. “Some players need to work on getting a solid second serve,” said the fifth-year Indians' coach. “We don't want any lollipops or double faults.”

Outlook – “I think that we are going to have a strong season this year,” said Schuler of expectations for the 2025 season. “We have solid singles players and have an experienced team, retaining 16 players from last season. We took on four new freshmen, including two who are avid tennis players — Allie Conrad and Anna Hawk.”

PALMERTON

Head coach – Jen Danzeisen (8th year)

Last year's record – 5-12 overall (4-9 Colonial League)

Key players lost –The Bombers take a hit at No. 3 doubles with the absence of senior Jared Reinhard, who won seven matches as a first-year varsity player last season.

Key returnees – Levi Johnson may only be a 10th-grader, but the Bombers' veteran coach has “high hopes” for him in singles action. A year ago, Johnson played No. 2 singles as a young underclassman. “He has strong technique and skills, so I'm hoping he will come back stronger this year,” said Danzeisen. Other key returnees for the Bombers will be Hadlee Lake, Colton Ruzicka and Anderson Garcia. “They were my doubles starters, and I foresee some of them moving up on the ladder this season.”

Others to watch – Kevin O'Neil and Josh Merkel were both exhibition players last year for the Bombers, and Danzeisen feels “both improved a lot since last year. I hope to see them in the lineup.” Lauryn Harris, Bryce Willis and Matt Breiner are all new to the team, and “they are all picking up the strokes very fast, and they can hustle.”

Strengths – “I would say my players really love the game, they are athletic, they listen, and they work on trying to improve their weaknesses,” said Danzeisen of what will be the key to the Bombers' success this season. “They are respectful and supportive of their team members, their coach, and the opposing team players.”

Weaknesses – Tennis is not a year-round sport in Bomber Territory, and that is why it serves as an area of concern for this season. “They don't participate in year-round lessons or practices, so I would say they still need to work on improving their strokes and strategy,” said Danzeisen. “They only had a week-and-a-half on the courts, so they had to get ready fast for our first match.”

Outlook – “I'm excited to see my team play. In the first week at practice, they were hitting great and already are improving,” said Danzeisen. “They love the game and are eager to get started. As always, I am positive and hopeful for them to achieve individual wins, points, and hopefully have more team wins this year. If they give the game a 100% effort, I will be proud of them.”

PLEASANT VALLEY

Head coach – Mark Allison (33rd year)

Assistant coach – Laura Ammermann

Last year's record – 9-8 overall

Key players lost – Ben Keppel, Damon McMurtry, Aaron Rehrig, Chris Weiner

Key Returnees – Noah Dolan (Sr., singles), John Hargrave (So., singles), Roman Steuer (Sr., doubles), Jens Hansen (Jr., doubles), Logan Krock (Jr., doubles)

Others to watch – Isaac Klein (So., singles), Liam Angell (Jr., doubles), Noah Conklin (So., doubles), Zachary Prator (Sr., doubles)

Strengths – Allison, who returns to the helm after a year off, believes the Bears' strength is a “great group of players working hard” together. And the seasoned coach feels the program also utilized the fact of “overall balance at both singles and doubles.”

Weaknesses – The concern right now is the amount of playing time the Bears had to work with their new doubles' teams. The Bears only had a week to prepare them for the season.

Outlook – Back at it again, Allison is thinking of nothing but the best for his Bears. “I'm looking forward to a very successful season. They're a great group of players to work with.”","{'href': 'https://www.tnonline.com', 'title': 'tnonline.com'}"

SANTA BARBARA, Calif. — The No. 28 Pepperdine women's tennis team got back in the win column with a 5-2 victory over No. 51 UC Santa Barbara on Thursday afternoon.

UNI tennis (2-9 / 0-0 MVC) vs. Omaha (6-8 / 1-1 Summit League)

CEDAR FALLS, Iowa — After securing a hard-fought road victory last weekend, the UNI tennis team returns to action for its final non-conference home matchup of the season on Friday against the Omaha Mavericks on Friday. Competition is scheduled to begin with doubles play at 4 p.m. CT at the Black Hawk Tennis Club in Waterloo.

Northern Iowa is coming off a narrow 4-3 road win at Milwaukee, highlighted by key singles wins. Senior Darta Dalecka led the way with a three-set battle, winning 6-2, 5-7, 6-3, with Andjela Raznatovic secured a straight-set victory, 6-3, 6-4 and Kanyanut Sudsaard dominated her match with a 6-0, 6-1 win. The Panthers also picked up a crucial point by default in the number six singles spot. 

Omaha enters Friday's contest looking to test UNI's momentum, bringing depth in both singles and doubles play. The Panthers are looking to build on recent success and defend their home court before opening Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) play next weekend at Belmont.

UNI tennis action can be followed all season long on social media on Facebook (UNI Tennis), X (@UNITennis) and on Instagram (@uniwtennis).

Springtime on Hilton Head attracts all kinds of visitors, from raucous spring breakers to migratory shorebirds. One particular variety populates not the island's beaches, but its other attractive feature: its tennis courts. 

For years, college tennis teams have flocked to Hilton Head Island each March to play against each other on the island's public and private courts, for a tournament called Spring Tennis Fest.

The island has ten public tennis courts: four at Cordillo Courts and six at Chaplin Community Park. But for the first two weeks of March, those courts have filled with visiting college tennis players rather than island residents.

That led Justin Wilson, a resident of Indigo Run since 2022, to complain on Nextdoor about the tournament's complete use of the facilities, which he says has rendered them inaccessible to the public. Wilson said he frequents the public courts, but was surprised to find them completely full last week.

“Public facilities should first serve the residents that fund them,” Wilson wrote in the post, which attracted 109 commenters.

Some sided with Wilson, calling the situation “outrageous” and “unfair” for the taxpayers that fund the courts. 

Others didn't see the problem. “Been an event for years. Chill,” wrote one Andreas Kmiecik.

The island's annual college tennis tournament was first hosted 40 years ago, originally under the name “Spring Break Tennis.” Over 40 teams came out to the first tournament back in 1986, the Island Packet reported. 

For the past 15 years, the event has been run by the Professional Tennis Registry, a nonprofit organization that trains and certifies professional tennis instructors. As the island has grown, so has the event, which attracted 159 teams last year, according to PTR Vice President of Marketing and Special Events, Julie Jilly.

PTR reserves a combination of public and private courts for the three-week-long tournament. But this is the first year they've had to rely so heavily on the public courts, Jilly said. 

In past years, PTR booked two private facilities run by the Van Der Meer Tennis Academy, which has about 15 hard courts at the two sites. However, Jilly said the company did not let PTR use their facilities this year.

“So more than ever we've relied this year on our public park facilities, which is unusual for us,” she said.

All public parks and recreation facilities on the island are managed by the Hilton Head Island Recreation Association, an independent nonprofit organization. The town grants the association the right to rent out the facilities at their own discretion. 

It's unclear as of yet how much PTR will pay in full for use of the island's public courts. The fee is based on actual use of the courts, which are totaled up and billed at the end of the month. For the Cordillo courts, PTR will pay about $9 per hour, while use of the Chaplin courts is charged $150 per match. 

Frank Soule, the association's Executive Director, contends that the event boosts the local economy, bringing in revenue for hotels and restaurants.

Soule said he was “shocked” by Wilson's comments, and that it was “first complaint we've had in years.” Soule added that the tennis community knows about the event far in advance, and that many private courts are available on the island. 

Next week, island residents itching to swing their rackets might find some openings at the courts. According to Jilly, the third — and last — week of the tournament is less busy than the first two.

The event's schedule, which includes the time and location of each match, is posted online. The last matches will take place on March 24, according to the schedule.

“It's a shame that one person can get so upset about two weeks,” Jilly said.

It was an exciting weekend of wins for both the NYU women's and men's tennis teams in the Bronx.

The women's team dominated against Rochester Institute of Technology on Saturday and then doubled their win count against William Smith College with a 7-0 defeat on Sunday — marking their first undefeated score of the season. In similar fashion, the men's team conquered RIT and Hobart College with scores of 6-1. Right now, both teams are in sync with an overall record of 4-1 and the rest of their seasons are looking bright. 

“Our first loss [of the season] was tough, but after this weekend, our spirits are back up,” said senior and captain of the women's team Jimena Menendez. “It was so nice to be at a home game this weekend. With both the women's and men's teams there, the energy was great.”

It's not easy playing tennis in the city, as finding nearby and available courts is extremely hard, often resulting in a commute. This is especially difficult for student-athletes who have to balance the time-consuming practice and commute with schoolwork. 

Both the women's and men's teams practice in the final hours of the day, from 9 to 11 p.m. in the Bronx. They are two of the only NYU sports teams that practice this late. 

“Practice is a lot, but everyone has been so good at giving all their effort at 9 p.m. every day,” said Menendez. “As a senior, though, it has gotten easier. It takes some time getting used to, especially adjusting to the late-night practices and having no weekend. But now it's second nature to me.”

Despite these late-night practices, players find a way to make the most of them. For instance, on the 45-minute bus ride to the Bronx, besides napping, a lot of team bonding occurs. In a sense, the bus ride and late-night bonding experiences are what make NYU tennis uber competitive, as the teams use their closeness to their advantage. 

“Tennis is such an individual, gladiatorial sport where it's only you and another person,” said junior Cooper Kline. “However, when I got to college, it became so much more of a team sport. We're all really close knit, and when it comes to game day, we always cheer the loudest. Having such a close, supportive team can really overwhelm someone with energy. It can be what breaks the other team. I really enjoy it because I grew up playing alone for so long.”

While some are just beginning to adapt to NYU tennis, Menendez says she's preparing to say goodbye. Menendez has been on the NYU women's tennis team for four years and a captain for two. In the fall, she became the first Violet to win the Intercollegiate Tennis Association Northeast Regional Singles Championship for two consecutive years. Before she leaves, she's working on ensuring that the positive team culture will last eternally, because to her, the players are what made her stay in tennis for years. 

“As a senior, I've been really nostalgic — I'm surprised I haven't cried yet,” Menendez said. “I've gotten all sappy in my head, like I keep thinking, ‘I'm never going to go to Albany again.' I don't really care to go to Albany again, but you know what I mean. But the nostalgia has been making me want to do better. At the same time, though, I want us to do super well — not because it's my last year, but because I also know that we can do super well.”

Both teams hope to make it to nationals this year — a goal that has each player training day in, day out.  

“There are definitely a lot of moments where it's hard to keep up the motivation, but I've already invested too much time in this sport,” Menendez said. “I got to keep going. And before you know it, the years fly by and you meet so many great people on your team that you get to know on a completely different level. We like to say that we win for each other, and it would be crazy to me not to have any of it.” 

Kline also conveyed his motivation in tennis.

“No one's forcing you to be a college athlete, so you got to really love it,” Kline said. “I purely love tennis. I love competing. I love that build-up in the week going into a match, where it's all-consuming in the best way. I love being tired from tennis. I love the mental aspect, making all these fast-paced decisions on the fly, recalculating each thought as you make each play. I love it when the sun goes down and you feel like you really did something that day and put your all out there.”

Both teams will be competing against The College of New Jersey this Saturday, March 15 in Ewing, NJ.
