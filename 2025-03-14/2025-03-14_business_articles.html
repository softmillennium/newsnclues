Hudson's Bay Company is nearly a billion dollars in debt, according to court filings that paint a dire portrait of the struggling Canadian department store chain's finances. 

The documents were submitted as part of its creditor protection filing last week. The company owes a total of $950 million to nearly 2,000 secured and unsecured creditors, including well-known apparel and beauty brands like Adidas Canada, Estée Lauder, L'Oréal Canada, Levi Strauss Canada, Michael Kors Canada, Nike Canada and Ralph Lauren.

"The scale is certainly monumental for insolvency proceedings as far as Canada goes. It's a very large one," said Dina Kovacevic, editor-in-chief of Insolvency Insider Canada. But it's not a surprise, she said.

"Retailers in the last several years since the COVID pandemic have really been having a hard time with less foot traffic and all of the economic issues that have been going on in the world. So while it is monumental, I think we were probably expecting it. There have been a lot of retailer filings in the last several years."

The company owes more than $1 million to Canada Post, and is in debt to over a dozen municipalities. The list doesn't include debts owed to government agencies, a figure that the filing says is unknown at this time. The amount owed to employees is to be determined, per the filing.

At the beginning of the year, Hudson's Bay had just $3 million in cash and cash equivalents, the documents show. The $1.1 billion it owes in secured debt includes $724.4 million in mortgages.

Secured creditors are lenders, like banks, which give out loans to companies. To ensure they are paid back, the creditor takes on some of the company's assets as collateral. Unsecured creditors are usually employees and suppliers, "and unfortunately they tend to be at the bottom of the food chain, so to speak," said Kovacevic.

"For any employees that get terminated throughout the process, unfortunately their termination and severance pay will be an unsecured claim, which means that they will likely receive cents on the dollar for those claims," she explained.

The Bay announced last week that it was seeking creditor protection, with its chief executive pointing to the COVID-19 pandemic and an ongoing trade war with the U.S. as external factors that have put financial pressure on the company.

Some experts say that the Bay's decline began long before the pandemic, tracing its issues back to its 2008 acquisition by the American investment firm NRDC Equity Partners, and saying that the company's new ownership prioritized its real estate over a cohesive retail strategy.

The company's lack of investment in its stores became evident in recent years, with floors understaffed, escalators and elevators in disrepair and faulty HVAC systems leading to temporary closures last summer.

 The Jefferson Parish Council has reached a deal with the Archdiocese of New Orleans to purchase Hope Haven in Marrero, the former orphanage where dozens of children were physically, sexually and psychologically abused decades ago by priests, brothers and nuns charged with caring for them.

The parish has been leasing the 15-acre campus, with its sprawling grounds and century-old, Spanish mission-style buildings, from the local Roman Catholic Church since 2018, and has already built a walking trail and recreational area on a portion of the site.

Now, it is moving forward with plans to purchase the property for $3.8 million and turn it into a multi-use complex that could include expanded recreational areas, festival grounds, educational attractions and, potentially, offices or apartments.

The redevelopment of Hope Haven by the parish is seen as a way to breathe new life into what stands as a stark reminder of one of the darkest chapters in the clergy abuse scandal, said Republican state Sen. Pat Connick, who represents the area and has been leading efforts to facilitate the deal between the parish, state, archdiocese and abuse survivors.

As part of the deal, the parish has agreed to create a memorial on the site in honor of the victims.

“This could be a win-win-win for everybody -- to put the property back into commerce and bring good life back to the campus,” Connick said. “Evil, sick things took place there but it is time to try to heal.”

The archdiocese, which filed for bankruptcy court protection nearly five years ago amid mounting claims of clergy sex abuse, will need permission from the court to sell the property. Thus far, it has not finalized a purchase agreement.

But all parties have agreed to the deal in principle, according to leaders with the parish, state and archdiocese.

“There are still some details to be worked out,” archdiocese spokesperson Sarah McDonald said in a statement Thursday. “But the site will become home to a permanent memorial to the memory and strength of abuse survivors."

Attorneys for the committee of abuse victims did not return a call seeking comment on the deal. But another attorney, Frank LaMothe, who has represented dozens of Hope Haven survivors over the years, said he thinks his past and current clients would be supportive of creating a monument there.

“It would mean a lot to them to know there is a recognition of what they went through,” Lamothe said, adding that he could not comment on the sale specifically because he has not been involved in the negotiations.

Hope Haven opened in 1925 on the west side of Barataria Boulevard, next to what is now Archbishop Shaw High School, to provide care for needy children and wards of the state. A few years later, Madonna Manor opened across the street.

Madonna Manor took in young children from families unable to care for them and children placed there by courts as wards of the state. Hope Haven was a home for older children.

In the early 2000s, nearly two dozen lawsuits were filed against the archdiocese and its affiliate, Catholic Charities, by adults who claimed they were molested, beaten and berated as children in the 1950s and 1960s by the priests and nuns that ran the two orphanages.  The archdiocese settled the suits for nearly $5.2 million in 2009.

Fresh lawsuits were filed nearly a decade later, alleging abuse that occurred at Hope Haven and Madonna Manor in the 1970s and 1980s. The suits were filed in 2018, after Archbishop Gregory Aymond released a list of credibly accused priests that included the names of eight priests who had worked at the orphanages.

In May 2020, the archdiocese filed for bankruptcy. In the years since, some 550 abuse survivors have filed claims alleging past abuse.  

Hope Haven would be the latest of nearly a dozen properties the church has sold as it seeks to raise money to settle claims. So far, the property sales have generated about $15 million, a fraction of the amount sought by victims, who have asked the archdiocese and local parishes to pony up more than $200 million, not including separate contributions they are seeking from church insurers.

At $3.85 million, the 15-acre campus Hope Haven campus, ringed with live oaks, might seem like a relative deal. The complex includes two large, century-old buildings of around 30,000 square feet each; a gymnasium dating back to 1930, and several smaller buildings. It was last appraised for $8 million, Parish Council member Deano Bonano said.

But since Jefferson began leasing the property from the archdiocese in 2018, the parish and state have spent nearly $5 million gutting, shoring and stabilizing the historic main building, which the archdiocese had allowed to deteriorate.

It has also spent a considerable amount developing a portion of the site into a recreational area with a 1/3-mile walking trail that snakes around the campus, a children's playground and an adult fitness area.

“Given what we have in it, we felt this was a fair price and it was in our best interest to buy it,” Bonano said.

Under the terms of the deal, the parish will put up $1.4 million towards the purchase price, money that the council approved at its meeting earlier this month. The state is contributing $2.4 million.

For Connick, who led the efforts to get the state money, the revival of Hope Haven has become something of a passion project.

“This could be something so positive for the community,” said Connick, whose grandfather ran a dairy farm near the campus a century ago.

There's no timeline for the deal to be finalized. But, once it is, the parish will begin advertising for proposals from developers interested in the site. A master plan for the property in 2022 suggests developing an aquatic center with indoor and outdoor pools and an outdoor concert venue, as well as an expanded recreational area.

Bonano says parish leaders envision it as “the center for health and fitness in West Jefferson,” much as Lafreniere Park is on the East Bank.  

The master plan also suggests leasing the two main buildings for use as senior or assisted living facilities, medical offices or apartments, and using the lease proceeds to pay for the other amenities.

The YMCA is also potentially interested in the site.

Connick said he'd like to see a children's museum in one of the buildings.

“Why not think big?” he said. “This is an opportunity to create something special for this side of the parish.”

U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose 200% tariffs on alcohol from Europe would serve a major blow to drinks makers on the continent, but it could have one unlikely beneficiary — the struggling beer industry.

President Trump said Thursday that he may target wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages from France and other European nations after the European Union moved to reinstate an import tax on American whiskey in response to earlier Trump tariffs.

Such a levy, if enacted, could "literally wipe out" all global profits for some European drinks producers, Trevor Stirling, managing director and European beverages analyst at Bernstein, said Friday.

"If you take it at face value, for some of the producers, it could literally wipe out all of their global profits," Stirling told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe."

French spirits maker Rémy Cointreau — which derives around one-third of its global sales from the U.S., would likely be among the worst affected — Stirling said, noting that markets were currently failing to fully price in the impact of the proposed tax.

Wine and spirits firms Pernod Ricard, Rémy Cointreau and Davide Campari all fell more than 3% Thursday, following Trump's comments, with the latter two slipping again during Friday's session. LVMH, which owns Moët & Chandon and Hennessy among others, briefly turned positive Friday before slipping back in the red following nine negative sessions.

"Investors are perhaps being a little bit too blasé about the potential that there is a real risk it could be a 200% tariff," Stirling said, acknowledging that the rate was unusually high relative to those leveled against other countries and sectors. "One has learned never to underestimate the Trump administration."

The levies form part of Trump's broader vision to relocate global production to the U.S. — a strategy many analysts have questioned, particularly within the production-specific drinks and luxury sectors.

"Provenance matters when selling premium spirits and wine — cognac has to be from Cognac, champagne from Champagne etc. As a result, it is not a category that the Trump administration will encourage onshoring with," Chris Beckett, head of equity research at Quilter Cheviot, wrote in a note Thursday.

Nevertheless, the proposals could provide a boon for the already highly localized beer industry, which has been under pressure over recent quarters amid declining sales and shifting consumer habits.

"Beer is just not in the crosshairs of this. Beer looks like an island of stability right now," Stirling told "Squawk Box Europe."

AB InBev, the world's largest brewer, which owns brands including Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois, told CNBC last month that it sees limited impact from tariffs given its high levels of domestic production.

"We don't think that we're going to have big topics to discuss during this year in terms of tariffs," CEO Michel Doukeris said.

Heineken CEO Dolf van den Brink, meanwhile, in February described proposed U.S. tariffs, including on aluminum used in beer cans, to be "relatively manageable."

"The beer industry is capital intensive and it's very local. So, as such, it's an industry that's a bit less susceptible to disruption in international trade flows," he told "Squawk Box Europe" last month.

Oops, something went wrong

Gold made the sprint to $3,000 on Friday as uncertainties about the economy and an escalating trade war drove up demand for the safe-haven asset.

Gold (GC=F) futures rose to hover above $3,008 per ounce while spot gold reached above $3,001.

The precious metal was on track for a second straight week of gains amid new data indicating moderating inflation and the announcement of retaliatory tariffs from the United States' trading partners.

"Though it feels like a psychological threshold, gold at $3,000 might just be a stepping stone if trade wars deepen," said Tony Redondo, founder of Cosmos Currency Exchange. "That said, it's not all about Trump. Central banks, interest rate bets, geopolitical tensions, and inflation concerns are all stoking the flames."

Trade tensions grew this week after President Trump threatened 200% tariffs on wine and spirit imports from Europe on Thursday. The threat followed the EU's announcement of retaliatory tariffs after the US put a 25% duty on steel and aluminum.

Gold is up more than 12% year to date after making multiple record highs in recent months.

"All eyes are on how gold continues to play a role as a safe haven asset," said Joe Cavatoni, market strategist at the World Gold Council. "With rising inflation expectations, lower rates, and continued uncertainty, we continue to see support for gold looking ahead.”

Wall Street has been playing catch-up by raising price targets to keep pace with gold's rise.

In a note on Thursday, Macquarie Group predicted the precious metal will touch $3,500 in the third quarter.

"Year-to-date, gold has been running ahead of our expectations," wrote Marcus Garvey, head of commodities strategy at Macquarie.

"We are raising our gold price forecast to a 3Q25 quarter average peak of $3,150 per ounce and our single point price high to $3,500 per ounce," he added.

Wall Street strategists have attributed much of these gains to continued central bank buying and tariff uncertainty, including the possibility that even imports of the precious metal into the US won't be spared.

Institutional investors have shipped elevated amounts of physical gold bars to vaults in New York in a move to front-run tariffs and take advantage of a price disparity between London and New York.

The Ravens' approach to the initial wave of free agency has been on brand.

While other teams have gone on shopping sprees in a seller's market, General Manager Eric DeCosta prioritized signing his own players (left tackle Ronnie Stanley, fullback Patrick Ricard, and reportedly wide receiver/special-teamer Tylan Wallace) and making selective additions (wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins, special teams ace/inside linebacker Jake Hummel).

The Athletic's Jeff Zrebiec said it's been a good week for the Ravens, but there is still "serious business" to be done.

"So far, the Ravens have done just fine. Better than that," Zrebiec wrote. "Their personnel losses have been minimal, and they were winners in free agency at the very moment when they agreed to the three-year deal with Stanley. Navigating the next couple of months of roster-building without a bona fide left tackle on the roster would have been a nightmare scenario. Reaching an agreement less than 48 hours before Stanley hit an open market filled with offensive tackle-needy teams willing to hand him a blank check was clutch.

"So, with the first wave of free agency already over, where does that leave them? They still have several needs — cornerback, safety, inside linebacker and edge rusher stand out — and next to no cap space to fill them. That's where the serious business comes in."

Zrebiec noted that the Ravens will probably have to make moves to create more salary-cap space in the coming days.

One way to do so is by contract restructures, and that process has already started. According to Russell Street Report's Brian McFarland, the Ravens have reworked cornerback Marlon Humprey's contract to create more than $13 million in cap space.

The Ravens have done a max restructure w/Marlon Humphrey by reducing his $18M salary & roster bonus to the league min of $1.255M & converting $16.745M to a bonus. Two void yrs were added. Restructure creates $13.396M in 2025 cap space.

While restructures are helpful, Zrebiec said the Ravens "ultimately are probably going to have to check off some big-ticket items." That could include a contract extension for Lamar Jackson.

"His 2025 cap number is $43.65 million, but it rises to $74.65 million in 2026 and 2027," Zrebiec wrote. "The 2025 number is manageable. The 2026-27 one is not, meaning at some point within the next 12 months, the Ravens and Jackson will need to hammer out a new deal anyway. What better time than the present, when it would give DeCosta some much-needed salary-cap breathing room?"

Zrebiec said a contract extension for running back Derrick Henry also could help. Furthermore, he said the Ravens would "have to at least weigh the benefits" of trading tight end Mark Andrews "if they get an enticing offer."

"To be clear, the Ravens don't have to do anything with their standout tight end," Zrebiec wrote. "Yet, Andrews is due a $4 million roster bonus on March 20, so a decision could come relatively soon."

It bears repeating just how big re-signing Stanley to a three-year deal reportedly worth $60 million before the start of free agency is for the Ravens.

NFL.com's Gregg Rosenthal said on “The Mina Kimes Show” that it speaks volumes about the Ravens' culture that Stanley chose to remain in Baltimore rather than spark a bidding war on the open market.

"The Patriots I think were going to go over the top with money, but the Chiefs I think were building their offseason plan around signing Ronnie Stanley, and he chose to stay with the Ravens," Rosenthal said. "They made him take a pay cut before last season. You have to be a pretty great organization from the top to the bottom, from the coaching staff to the administration, to make a dude take a pay cut and then the following year he's taking maybe less money or at least he's giving you the benefit of the doubt and wanting to stay home. This is how great teams can stay great, so I just love that."

Kimes agreed, saying: "The Ronnie Stanley deal was my favorite of the entire free agency from a team perspective. I think this is a huge win for the organization."

Both @greggrosenthal and I agree: The Ravens' deal with Ronnie Stanley was one of the biggest wins any team had in free agency. We discussed why on the pod 👇🎧: https://t.co/4OOdMhzjmE📺: https://t.co/PUdp4MUPch pic.twitter.com/e11EFxB2xX

NFL.com's Kevin Patra also named the Ravens re-signing Stanley as one of the best moves of the opening wave of free agency.

"The top tackle heading into free agency isn't even in the top 10 in per-year average salary among OTs. That's a W for the organization," Patra wrote. "The deal became a good one when the Ravens weren't forced to get to a $23 million- or $25 million-per-year figure to retain their left tackle. I also like the short-term nature of the pact for both sides. The structure allows Baltimore to get out of the deal relatively free after two years if the injury bug respawns. Likewise, if Stanley stays healthy and keys a Super Bowl run in Baltimore, he can push for a re-up in 2027 when no guaranteed money is left."

One item on the Ravens' to-do list is signing a backup quarterback.

Journeyman Josh Johnson, who had the job last season, is a free agent. Other veterans on the market include former Ravens Joe Flacco and Tyler Huntley, Jameis Winston, Trey Lance, Drew Lock, Carson Wentz, Desmond Ridder, Cooper Rush, and Teddy Bridgewater.

Flacco returning to the Ravens would be a great story, but could it actually happen?

"I think they'd be all for it if the price was right," Zrebiec wrote on X. "He's beloved in that building. I don't know if it's something he'd be interested in. He's never been the nostalgic type and if he's still playing, he's probably going to want to go to a place where he has better chance to start."

Flacco reportedly met with the New York Giants Thursday.

Republican Sen. Ted Cruz supports President Trump's use of tariffs, just not for the long term.

"I fully support the president using the threat of tariffs to incentivize Mexico and Canada to help secure the border. Now that being said, my home state of Texas does an enormous amount of trade with Mexico and Canada. I don't want to see the long-term economic policy being big tariffs against Mexico and Canada," Cruz told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).

"And so my hope is that those policies stay as an incentive rather than an ongoing feature of economic policy."

The president has paused 25% duties on Canadian and Mexican imports that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement (USMCA). But Trump on Wednesday hit Canada with 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, backing off a floated 50% duty.

On Thursday, Trump said that if the European Union didn't remove a 50% tariff on whiskey, the US would place a 200% tariff on wine, champagne, and other alcoholic products.

Trump has implemented a second round of 10% duties on Chinese imports after instituting 10% in February.

The targeted countries wasted no time hitting back.

China unveiled a 15% tariff on US chicken, wheat, corn, and cotton products and an additional 10% tariff on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, seafood, fruits, vegetables and dairy products. The new tariffs from China began on Monday.

Canada announced a 25% tariff on 30 billion Canadian dollars of US imports.

As for Cruz, there is a lot at risk for his home state of Texas after brisk 3.9% GDP growth in 2024.

Mexico has been Texas's biggest trade partner for the past 16 years. Texas's top imports from Mexico include electric machinery, sound and TV equipment, various fuels, and medical and surgical equipment.

Texas houses about one-third of US refining capacity and refines crude oil imported from Canada and Mexico.

Businesses in the state may already be wary of the tariff pinch.

The latest Dallas Fed survey for February saw its production index — a barometer of state manufacturing conditions — plunge 21 points from January. The new orders index fell 11 points and the capacity utilization index declined 14 points.

Perceptions of broader business conditions worsened in February too.

"It's clear in the next four years, we will see more tariffs than we had the previous four years," Cruz said. "What I've urged him [the president] is two things. No. 1, focus on China. I have said for a long time that China poses the greatest geopolitical risk to the United States over the next hundred years. And so I want to see our economy delink from China."

"And then secondly, what I've urged the president to do is focus on reciprocity," he explained. "And the virtue of reciprocity is if President Trump imposes tariffs on a foreign country and the foreign country doesn't like those tariffs, they already have a solution to that, which is lower the tariffs they're putting on US goods."

 

Investors have reacted harshly this month to the flurry of tariff headlines.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 1.4% on Thursday, the 10th daily decline this year with a loss above 1% according to data from Creative Planning chief markets strategist Charlie Bilello. Last year, at this point, the S&P 500 had only three big down days, which Bilello said was "abnormally" low.

The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) are each down by about 5% in March.

Some of the market's often most popular stocks, such as Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and Palantir (PLTR), have seen pullbacks of more than 10% from their 52-week highs.

Wall Street recession calls have begun to creep into the picture too.

"Well, look, there's no doubt there has been some uncertainty," Cruz said. "When I talk to business leaders, the most consistent question I get from them is what's going to happen on the tariff front? So I understand that uncertainty, and I think it'll take some time to have a clearer picture of what the exact tariff landscape is going to look like."

Elon Musk's electric carmaker Tesla has warned it and other US exporters could be harmed by countries retaliating to Donald Trump's trade tariffs.

Mr Musk is a close ally of the US president and is leading efforts to reduce the size of the federal government.

But in an unsigned letter addressed to the US trade representative, Tesla said while it "supports" fair trade it was concerned US exporters were "exposed to disproportionate impacts" if other countries retaliated to tariffs.

The letter was dated the same day that Trump hosted an event at the White House where he promised to buy a Tesla in a show of support for Mr Musk.

It is unclear who at Tesla wrote the letter as it is unsigned, or if Mr Musk was aware of it.

Tesla's share price has dropped 40% since the start of the year. Mr Musk is the carmaker's chief executive and while some have argued his alignment with the Trump administration is hurting its brand, market analysts say the share fall is more about worries over Tesla meeting production targets and a drop in sales over the past year.

In the letter, Tesla said it was making changes to its supply chains to find as many local suppliers for its cars and batteries so it was less reliant on foreign markets. 

"None the less," it warned, "even with aggressive localisation of the supply chain, certain parts and components are difficult or impossible to source within the US."

The US president has imposed an additional 20% tariff on all imports from China, prompting Beijing to respond with retaliatory levies including on cars. China is Tesla's second biggest market after the US.

"For example, past trade actions by the United States have resulted in immediate reactions by the targeted countries, including increased tariffs on EVs imported into those countries," the letter reads. 

The EU and Canada have both threatened sweeping retaliations for tariffs on steel and aluminium imports into the US, which went into effect earlier this week.

Demonstrators have targeted Tesla showrooms in recent weeks in protest against Mr Musk's cost-cutting role in Trump's administration, where he is head of the  Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).

Earlier this week, Trump hosted an event at the White House where he said people protesting against Tesla should be labelled domestic terrorists, while sitting in the driver's seat of a brand new red Tesla that he said he planned to buy. 

Trump said demonstrators were "harming a great American company", and anyone using violence against the electric carmaker would "go through hell".

Car sharing has not taken off, but will electric cars boost its appeal?

The  deputy first minister has said she engages "with the office of president" rather than his "particular personal views".

Wine and spirits will be taxed, Trump says, if the EU does not remove tariffs on US whiskey.

The tariffs imposed by Donald Trump could not come at a worse time, says the steel industry body.

The Irish Whiskey Association urged the US and EU to engage in dialogue amidst an escalating trade war.

Newsmax agreed to pay Smartmatic $40 million as part of a settlement last year following the voting technology company's election defamation lawsuit against the right-wing news outlet, according to a new regulatory filing.

The settlement, reached in September, included a cash payment and an option to purchase stock in Newsmax, the media company said in its filing. Newsmax said payments totaling $20 million have already been made, with the rest coming before July.

“Management believes the settlement with Smartmatic will, subject to the payment of all consideration in a timely manner, eliminate future legal expenses the Company would have expected to bear related to this suit, which could have included costly appellate legal actions and other matters,” Newsmax wrote.

Newsmax did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night.

Details of the payments provide insight into the confidential settlement agreement that were not publicly available last year. The 2021 lawsuit centered on Newsmax's false claims that Smartmatic's machines manipulated the 2020 presidential election in favor of Joe Biden. A deal was reached shortly before the case was set to go to trial.

After the settlement last year, Newsmax said in a statement that it “acknowledges that the Court found that ‘allegations regarding whether the [2020 U.S. presidential election] and its results were somehow altered or manipulated by Smartmatic are factually false/untrue.'”

Smartmatic settled a related defamation lawsuit in April against One America News for a sum that also was not disclosed publicly.

 J. Erik Connolly, an external lawyer for Smartmatic, said in a statement Thursday that the company is now focused on a similar case against Fox News.

"We look forward to presenting our evidence to a jury and finally having the opportunity to hold Fox accountable for its harmful actions,” Connolly said.

Fox has said it covered newsworthy events and people surrounding the 2020 election.

Fox News' parent company, Fox Corp., reached a settlement in 2023 to pay $787.5 million to the election technology company Dominion Voting Systems to settle defamation claims.
