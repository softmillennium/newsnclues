Dorothy frontwoman Dorothy Martin is fresh off of writing her “heaviest” album yet, and she hopes the meaning behind the music resonates with fans, she revealed in an exclusive interview with Us Weekly. The new album, out Friday, March 14, is “like a love letter to our fans, just reminding them to hold onto hope,” Martin explained. “It’s also the heaviest album I’ve made, but there’s a little bit of outlaw country vibes on some of the songs. Martin’s band Dorothy has been a part of the rock scene since 2014. Their latest single “Tombstone Town,” which dropped in February, boasts a collaboration with guitar legend Slash. And the singer was excited for fans to see her other creative side by showing off her acting skills.

I’ve always wanted to somewhat act a little bit. So we went for that Quentin Tarantino Grindhouse vibe on the video, with actors and some narrative storytelling.” Below, the rock goddess gives Us the inside scoop on her band’s new album, wild tour stories and more: Us Weekly: You describe The Way as your heaviest album. Dorothy Martin: It’s heavy, but there’s also some songs I think that could really cross over maybe the Top 40 or Christian radio — even country. But we can’t just abandon our fan base, so there’s some really heavy guitars and there’s two songs “I Come Alive” and “The Devil” — those are the heaviest songs on the album. So we had to throw a little bit of that in there, and that’s true to my roots. DM: When you meet people that you look up to and they happen to be down to earth and humble and kind, and all those wonderful things despite the legendary status that they’ve achieved — he’s one of those people. Us: What’s the best advice Slash gave you? This is your time, and all you gotta do is stay sober, don’t self-sabotage, don’t get in your head and keep doing what you’re doing’. Because it can be very scary to be sober, and you don’t have to do it alone.

Us: Making music seems very healing for you. So I have to remember, it’s bigger than me. So I have to be responsible with it. [laughs] Macy Gray and I got to do a remake of [a] Dolly Parton song with Dolly Parton. Country music is the reason I sing, because when I started teaching myself to sing, it was country songs for some reason. But, collaboration-wise, that’s such a good question. And if I could go back and do something like a duet with Johnny Cash, I would in a heartbeat. I always make sure I’m in my stage outfit [and] my makeup, well in advance, ’cause that’s the last thing that I wanna worry about and get my voice warmed up and feeling good. I used to get very, very nervous, but after doing it for a while, it’s more fun and exciting, you know? DM: Yeah, like kickboxing or something, or I’ll just try to shake the nervous energy out of my body. Related: Alexandra Kay Details ‘Craziest’ Tour With Jelly Roll: 'A Lot of Fun' Ford Fairchild Alexandra Kay has seen a lot in her decade-plus in the music industry, but nothing has compared to the scene backstage at a Jelly Roll concert. Us: Obviously, tons of fans are in the audience, and you never know what kinds of things they’ll want — an autograph or a request. Have there been any that made you laugh or even raised an eyebrow? DM: It’s always weird when someone says, ‘Sign my sweaty boob’ because it ruins our Sharpies, and then our Sharpies don’t work anymore. They wanna just high five or a hug. Sam Colton, my guitar player, he throws guitar picks out in the crowd all the time, and they love that. Or do you just play along with the audience? DM: There are things that can be distracting. Us: What’s your craziest concert or tour experience? DM: The best show — the biggest, most-awesome moment — was when we played Welcome to Rockville [music festival], a couple years back. One of the bands left because someone thought that they had Covid, and they bumped us to a later slot. They were probably very excited that Metallica was coming soon thereafter. Related: Sara Bareilles Shares the Pre-Show Ritual She’s Had for Decades Sara Bareilles performed both old and new songs during three career-spanning shows at The Kennedy Center in September, but she stuck to a tried and true pre-show ritual. “I always pour a tiny bit of bourbon [before going onstage],” Bareilles, 45, exclusively reveals in her Backstage Pass feature in the latest issue of Us Weekly, […] Sometimes you get a bad crowd, and that’s tough. But when you have a rowdy, fun electric crowd, there’s nothing like it. Us: What song is the most challenging to perform live? DM: “Gifts From The Holy Ghost” can be really hard because the verses start out actually in my higher end of my range. But if I’m having a super tough vocal day, it wouldn’t be the first song I pick. Us: How about your favorite song to play live? I feel like that changes with each album. So I’m really looking forward to trying out “Tombstone Town.” “Mud” was so much fun to do live. I was flying by the seat of my pants. I didn’t get a chance to rehearse. For a complete list of Dorothy tour dates, click here.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/what-hollywood-is-saying-about-disneys-snow-white-crisis.html'>What Hollywood Is Saying About Disney’s Snow White Crisis</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-14 20:00:04 <p>
“It’s almost like they’re running away from the movie,” says an executive at a rival studio. Entertainment reporters behind velvet ropes would ask frisky if innocuous questions of the movie’s stars, Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot. And the Entertainment Industrial Complex would fire on all pistons en route to a robust opening weekend for the $270 million musical-fantasy — which prerelease “tracking” estimates currently predict will take around $53 million over Snow White’s domestic release March 21. But like the fairy tale’s Evil Queen, Disney announced plans a few days ago to put business as usual on the red carpet into an eternal sleep. Save, that is, for a few perfunctory remarks attendees Zegler and Gadot are expected to give to a Disney-sanctioned “house crew” predisposed against asking hard questions. Disney’s red-carpet restrictions — taken in conjunction with the studio’s unorthodox decision to begin preselling tickets to Snow White via online retailers like Fandango and Atom Tickets a mere 11 days before its release — paint a picture of a movie in crisis. The only reason why they would start presales that late is they are worried people would write about, Oh, man, the tickets are on sale and they’re not doing well,” an executive at another major studio says of Disney. “That and scrapping the red carpet tell me a story. It’s almost like they’re running away from the movie. Of course, few movies arrive onscreen with as much cultural Sturm und Drang as director Marc Webb’s megabudget contemporization of 1937’s epochal Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Its bibliography of outrage includes: anti-diversity outcry in 2021 that greeted the casting of mixed-race Latina actress Zegler as its titular heroine (whose skin is described as “white as snow” in the original animated film); Peter Dinklage lambasting the film’s perceived insensitivity toward little people — specifically, its “fucking backwards story about seven dwarfs living in a cave”; Zegler’s 2023 multi-interview characterization of the original Snow White as “extremely dated when it comes to the idea of women in roles of power” and “focus on a love story with a guy who literally stalks her” (she also noted, “People are making these jokes about ours being the PC Snow White, where it’s like, yeah, it is — because it needed that”); and seemingly conflicting views of the Israel-Hamas war by Zegler (who has described herself as “pro-Palestine”) and Gadot (who served in the Israeli Defense Forces and used her keynote speech at a recent Anti-Defamation League summit to denounce those not “condemning Hamas, but celebrating, justifying, and cheering on a massacre of Jews”). “Fuck Donald Trump.” After supporters of the president responded on social media with postings such as, “Not taking my kids to see this trash after the statement you put out. @disney you need to do something about this” and “I hope you get no peace when this film BOMBS at the box office and streaming,” Zegler issued a hasty apology. But some rival studio executives ultimately feel the Mouse House made a tactical mistake in casting the outspoken Romeo + Juliet actress and failing to rein her in. “The reality is Rachel Zegler should not be playing Snow White,” one tells me. Snow White makes theatrical landfall at something of a corporate inflection point for Disney. Also last month, Disney decided to move the theatrical release date for its Pixar animated sci-fi adventure Elio back one week — to June 20 from June 13 — so it would not compete head-on with the opening of Universal/DreamWorks’ live-action remake of How to Train Your Dragon. Industry insiders are, of course, parsing those happenings for meaning, recalling a time not so long ago when each new Marvel release went reliably and unquestioningly blockbuster and other studios moved off of money-minting juggernaut Pixar’s chosen drop dates — never vice versa.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

After a concert at Chicago’s United Center earlier this month featuring Disturbed, Three Days Grace, and Sevendust, the venue’s staff realized there was “minor damage” to the Bulls’ six NBA championship banners. Apparently, the concert’s pyrotechnics, located directly underneath the banners, literally darkened the legacy of the team in a way the stories of Michael Jordan’s gambling and Dennis Rodman’s smelliness never could. According to the Chicago Tribune, after the concert, “The fabric of all six banners showed significant heat damage that warped their bottom halves.” It was almost as if the banners were “Inside the Fire,” which is, in fact, the name of the seventh-most-played Disturbed song on Spotify.

Considering how many concerts occur at basketball arenas all over the world, the fact that this happened at all is frankly quite disturbed-ing. Also disturbed-ing is the fact that, for the rest of the season, the banners will be down. And down with the sickness, no less. (“Let the banners hit the floor,” you might joke, but you’d be wrong, as that’s Drowning Pool.)

Just imagine it: There you are, on March 27, watching the well-below .500 Chicago Bulls fighting for their lives for that last play-in game slot and losing to the Los Angeles Lakers, so you stare up toward the rafters to remember a sweeter time when it was Chicago who had the GOAT, but instead you see an empty space. Hello, darkness, my old friend, you’ll think to yourself, obviously quoting Disturbed’s 2015 cover of “The Sound of Silence,” which, disturbed-ingly, has 200 million more streams on Spotify than the original.

Lady Gaga, Travis Scott, Green Day and Post Malone headline for both weekends of the three-day music festival, which returns to its home at the Empire Polo Grounds in Indio, Calif. on the weekends of April 11-13 and April 18-20. While tickets on the Coachella website, which went on sale in early January, are sold out tickets are still available on resale sites such as Stubhub, VividSeats, Seat Geek and Ticketmaster. In fact, tickets actually appear to be selling for only marginally marked up prices on resale sites compared to the general onsale on Coachella’s website. While resale sites almost always sell tickets at significantly marked up prices, the same doesn’t tend to be the case with weekend events like Coachella, likely because festival-goers prefer to have their tickets secured weeks or months in advance. But people who live in the area, or are prone to spontaneity, can save a lot of money by buying tickets only a week or so before the festival. Also on the lineup are Missy Elliot, Megan Thee Stallion, Charli XCX, Anitta, Benson Boone, FKA Twigs, Clairo, Zedd, Junior H, Jennie, Glorilla, Lisa, Mustard, Ivan Cornejo, Kraftwerk, Shaboozey, The Go-Gos and many more. And after canceling her set at the 2024 festival, Tyla is scheduled to play on Friday.

In just its second year, the Vermont Film & Folklore Festival is already expanding its footprint in a big way: the newest Vermont film festival and the only international film festival in southern Vermont, has today announced that its second annual event will be held May 13-18, 2025, in Manchester and Brattleboro, Vermont.

Founded by a pair of indie film luminaries and recent Manchester transplants in 2024 — MovieMaker Magazine founder Tim Rhys and Filmmaker Magazine co-founder Karol Martesko-Fenster — this year’s edition will include events in both Manchester and Brattleboro. For those of you who are not Manchester natives (like this loud and proud writer), the two towns are about an hour’s drive apart, meaning that the events will now be available to an entirely new segment of the Vermont population.

Part of the appeal for the festival? A new partnership with Brattleboro’s Latchis Theater, which, per Friday’s announcement, will include the use of “four dedicated movie screens, a renovated vintage hotel, and an art deco lounge.”

Rhys, Festival Director and Co-Founder said in an official statement, “We are incredibly proud to be expanding VFFF in only its second year and are gratified that folks have come out so strongly in support of this event. This is a challenging time for the arts in general and for film festivals in particular, and many are struggling to keep their programming robust, so it’s a credit to the generosity of the people and businesses of southern Vermont that we’re able to bring even more films and filmmakers into our brave little state this year.”

The inaugural VFFF was held in May 2024, and featured more than 40 films from around the world, including award-winning American and international features, classic Hollywood features on 16mm, and an impressive selection of shorts and features by Vermont filmmakers.

The founders’ goal for the 2025 edition is to “feature even more concrete opportunities for Vermont filmmakers to produce and collaborate with each other on new work.”

Toward that end, they have also announced today that VFFF is sponsoring the $20,000 “VFFF Storytelling Grant,” which, via cash and in-kind assistance, will encourage one filmmaker/storyteller from Vermont or with strong Vermont ties to create a film in Vermont. The grant is geared to facilitate storytelling and film production in the Green Mountain State. Additionally, the festival has extended the final deadline for submissions to March 24.

Festival organizers are looking forward to expanded partnerships for 2025 and encourage anyone interested in the festival to get in touch with festival director Tim Rhys at Vermontfilmandfolklorefestival@gmail.com.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.indiewire.com/news/festivals/sundance-2025-movies-sold-1235086958/'>Sundance 2025 Films Sold So Far: ‘Oh, Hi!’ Starring Molly Gordon Acquired by Sony Pictures Classics</a></h2><b>Source:</b> indiewire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-14 19:04:11 <p>
Over 60 films came into this year’s Sundance looking for homes. As we previously reported, the hope was that even more distributors could get creative. Brooks told IndieWire the film is a “love letter to the hopeless romantic,” so SPC is crossing its fingers for a commercial hit. Buzz: Though it sold out of SXSW, “Dead Lover” first premiered at Sundance. It was scooped up by a brand new distributor, a team-up between physical media company Cartuna and production company Dweck Productions as the boutique’s first release. Oscilloscope’s acquisition of Birney’s “OBEX” will give the film a theatrical release later this year, and it’ll even be shopped to international buyers at the European Film Market occurring this month (Magnify is selling globally). The black-and-white period film borrows from ’80s kitschy aesthetic and is a cross between the late David Lynch’s “Eraserhead” and playing a “Legend of Zelda” game. It stars Birney as a man whose reality starts to blur with fantasy when he begins playing a computer game, forcing him to track down his dog that has now gone missing. This is the first film Birney directed solo, but he co-wrote it with Pete Ohs, who also produced and was the cinematographer and has his own film debuting at SXSW next month. Buzz: Another competitive situation with multiple distributors in on it, this time it was MUBI that won out in a reported mid-seven-figure deal, a source told IndieWire. Madekwe also produced the film alongside Alex Orlovsky, Duncan Montomery, Galen Core, Francesco Melzi D’Eril, Jack Selby, Marc Marrie, Charlie McDowell, and Olmo Schnabel. Buzz: The first documentary to sell out of what has been a slow Sundance market is this film about the controversial Florida “Stand Your Ground” law, in which a person inside their home has the right to use deadly force, with no need to retreat, in self-defense. Netflix will pick up “The Perfect Neighbor” for $5 million, according to a report first in Variety. Gandbhir’s film is constructed via police body cam footage and examines gun regulations and how race plays a factor in such decisions. IndieWire’s review called it an “unforgettable” and “devastatingly powerful” documentary. Buzz: Ira Sachs’ latest may be just a 75-minute filmed version of a 50-year-old transcript of a conversation between Peter Hujar and his friend Linda Rosenkrantz, but it found the ideal home with Sideshow and Janus, who will bring it to Berlin next and then release the movie theatrically in the fall after acquiring all North American rights. Cast: Eva Victor, Naomi Ackie, John Carroll Lynch, Louis Cancelmi, Kelly McCormack Despite sales taking some time this Sundance, the sale for “Sorry, Baby” to A24 — which is still in the process of closing — was described by a source as “incredibly competitive” and is another worldwide deal for the indie distributor. The social media star and comedian Eva Victor’s debut, which she wrote, directed, and starred in, is about Agnes, whom “something bad happened to,” as the logline describes, “But life goes on…for everyone around her, at least.” The producers are Adele Romanski, Mark Ceryak, and Barry Jenkins. Buzz: A day after Bela Bajaria responded to a press question about whether or not this was a slow Sundance, Netflix swooped in to buy one of the more ambitious titles on the Sundance slate, director Clint Bentley’s period drama “Train Dreams,” multiple sources confirmed to IndieWire. Marissa McMahon, Teddy Schwarzman, Will Janowitz, Ashley Schlaifer, and Michael Heimler produced. Edgerton was also an EP along with Scott Hinckley, Kwedar, and John Friedberg. Neon beat out other bidders including A24 and Searchlight to release the film, with a source saying the deal was likely north of $10 million and another estimate coming in between $15-17 million, which would make it among the highest deals in Sundance history. Neon’s financing outfit 30West was also behind this one, making it a good fit. Stars and producers Brie and Franco are a real life married couple, so the film has a meta element that made this one especially juicy. Neon picked up worldwide rights and has already set a release date of August 1 in theaters. Buzz: Ahead of its premiere on Saturday, Jan. 25, AI animation studio Asteria and the documentary free streaming platform Documentary+ swooped in to acquire this doc short that blends VR and live action filmmaking. The film follows Hiyu, a virtual reality world builder based in Stockholm who is suffering from kidney failure and is set to get a transplant from a friend, New York-based Photographotter, who he knows only through an online VR community where they’re each seen as an animal “furry” avatar. Asteria’s Bryn Mooser and Justin Lacob are joining the project as executive producers. Buzz: First premiering at the Venice Film Festival and then at Telluride, Magnolia bought “One to One” just ahead of its Sundance screening and made a splash to give it an IMAX exclusive release on April 11, the first time Magnolia has partnered with IMAX on a release. It will then land on Max and HBO in late 2025. The film has an audio restoration as overseen by Sean Lennon Ono. Buzz: The director of “20 Days in Mariupol” returns with a film in which he embeds himself with a Ukrainian platoon slowly realizing that the Russian campaign may be seemingly endless. Cast: Tom Basden, Carey Mulligan, Tim Key, Sian Clifford, Akemnji Ndifornyen Cast: Rose Byrne, A$AP Rocky, Conan O’Brien, Danielle McDonald Buzz: The director of “Yeast” makes her sophomore feature with this darkly comedic, uncomfortably funny film about a woman’s hostile relationship with her therapist. Cast: Ayo Edebiri, John Malkovich, Juliette Lewis, Murray Bartlett, Amber Midthunder Buzz: The director of “Mucho Mucho Amor” and “Science Fair directs this profile of Sally Ride, the first American female astronaut to make it to space, and her secret romance.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Or maybe you’re in the mood for a cool, sexy spy thriller like Black Bag starring Michael Fassbender, Cate Blanchett, and Bridgerton‘s Rege-Jean Page? Netflix has hundreds of them, but the following three stand out from the rest for being overlooked, underrated, and just damn good to watch. These are the Netflix movies you should stream over the weekend; otherwise, you risk being bored, and no one wants that. A film festival hit in 2023, Daddio was released to crickets last summer. It also gave Dakota Johnson another chance to shine after her memorable work in Cha Cha Real Smooth, and the first decent role two-time Oscar winner Sean Penn has had in over a decade. Related: Sean Penn's Controversies Through the Years: Legal Issues and More Sean Penn is no stranger to drama, both on and off the screen. Keep scrolling to for a look back at Penn’s […] While waiting outside the airport, veteran taxi driver Clark (Penn) picks up a young woman known only as Girlie (Johnson). What follows is an extended exchange between two strangers who share their most intimate thoughts about love, sex, politics, religion, and everything in between. Even though it’s set largely in a car, Daddio never feels claustrophobic or boring, and Johnson and Penn share an odd chemistry that makes them fascinating to watch. There’ve been scores of movies about the European experience during World War II, but what about what happened immediately afterward? The Children’s Train is set in Italy around 1946 and focuses on young Amerigo (Christian Cervone), who is sent by his poor mother to travel to Northern Italy to live with a foster family. He’s reluctantly taken in by Derma (Barbara Ronchi), who’s still grieving the loss of her lover during the war, and her brother Alcide (Ivan Zerbinati), who has three young boys of his own. Released late last year, The Children’s Train was swallowed by Netflix’s punishing algorithm and hasn’t been talked about much since. But it’s never too late to discover a quality gem, and The Children’s Train, with its sympathetic portrait of post-war youth, qualifies. The ending is a heartbreaker, so save some tissues on hand to wipe away those tears. Among the guests are Tyler Ledford (Nicholas Hoult), a foodie with questionable morals, and his girlfriend Margot Mills (Anya Taylor-Joy), who couldn’t care less about fine dining. Fiennes has never been better as the bitter chef, while Taylor-Joy shines as an everywoman who just wants to eat a nice, juicy burger.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

“All We Imagine as Light” (dir. Payal Kapadia, 2024)

Image Credit: Sideshow/Janus

I spent a brutal 90 seconds trying to engineer some sort of “Are men OK?” joke around the fact that the Criterion Channel is streaming seven of Michael Mann’s best movies this March, and then I gave up because the sooner I finish putting together this article, the sooner I can go rewatch “Heat” (and “Thief,” and “Manhunter,” and at least the first 20 minutes of “Ali”).

But that isn’t the only flavor of masculinity that Criterion is offering this month, as the streamer has also prepared a selection of “we’re too tough for lights and tripods” classics from the annals of Dogme 95, including Thomas Vinterberg’s “The Celebration” and Lars von Trier’s “Dancer in the Dark,” a singular masterpiece that was already a complicated thing to love even before it… became an even more complicated thing to love.

For a slightly more enviable sort of masculine energy, there’s always Jean Gabin, whose romantic beauty — on full display in the likes of “Port of Shadows” and “La bête humane” — anchors the Channel’s deep and intoxicating retrospective of French Poetic Realism, which spans from Julien Duvivier’s “Mother Hummingbird” in 1929 to Yves Allégret’s “Such a Pretty Little Beach” 20 years later. And what about “Mickey 17” star Steven Yeun’s absolutely shredded lats in “Burning,” one of six incredible Lee Chang-dong movies coming to the Channel this month? Toxic masculinity has never looked better.

OK, apologies to “Misericordia” director Alain Guiralde, whose “Stranger on the Lake” has plenty to say on the subject of male bodies (streaming alongside five of his other films), but this awful “man” bit desperately needs to die — even if the series devoted to Best Supporting Actor nominees would provide plenty of grist for the mill (Kirk Douglas in “The Bad and the Beautiful,” Ethan Hawke in “Boyhood,” etc.).

The most exciting film that’s new to the Criterion Channel this month is, of course, by and about women. Payal Kapadia’s effervescently profound “All We Imagine as Light” may have been screwed out of the Oscars, but this unforgettable romance about a pair of Mumbai nurses will get its due all the same, as the exclusive streaming premiere of this Sideshow release is a prelude to its inevitable inclusion in the Criterion Collection proper.

Some may read a book while others will take advantage of the warming weather to venture outside. But if you’re like Us and want to watch some quality movies from the comfort of your own home, then you probably want to take advantage of one of the many streaming subscriptions you’re signed up for. In 1973, PBS aired a groundbreaking documentary that captured America’s attention and forever changed the television landscape. An American Family documented the seemingly ordinary lives of a Southern California family, the Louds, but it also revealed several then-shocking secrets: mom and dad’s decision to divorce and one son’s coming-out as gay. Related: Naomi Watts and Diane Lane Were 'Mind Blown' By ‘Capote Vs. The Swans featured an A-list cast that even had stars Naomi Watts and Diane Lane awestruck. Cinema Vérité nails its early 1970s aesthetic (Dig those shag carpets!) and presents a fascinating look at the exact moment when reality television was born. Jack Mabry (Robert De Niro) is a parole officer on the cusp of retirement. Stone insists he’s been reformed and regrets his earlier crimes. When Stone’s wife, Lucetta (Milla Jovovich), enters the picture, things get messy as Jack begins to fall for her while trying to help a man whose past actions have caused numerous deaths. Stone is a tricky thriller, one that never really reveals all its cards until late in the game. Taking a break from fighting digital zombies in the Resident Evil franchise, Jovovich is impressive as Lucetta, whose devotion to her husband is both admirable and scary. Stone is better than its largely forgotten status, and is worth a stream for those who want a well-acted thriller with an unsettling ending. This year’s Oscars ceremony is over, but that doesn’t mean you have to stop watching award-worthy films. The Descendants was nominated for 5 Academy Awards in 2012, winning Best Adapted Screenplay, and it hasn’t aged a bit. It remains George Clooney’s best dramatic movie, and gave then-teen star Shaliene Woodley an adult role that launched her career. George Clooney is a cut above the rest when it comes to Hollywood greats — but his success wasn’t overnight. Clooney stars as Matt King, a Hawaii-based lawyer who is facing one crisis after another. Clooney is surprisingly believable as a man besieged by uncertainty about his own abilities as a husband and father, and Woodley is just terrific as his teenaged daughter Alex, a recovering addict who knows more about her mother than she’d like.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://deadline.com/2025/03/sean-diddy-combs-sex-trafficking-trial-delayed-1236326566/'>Sean Combs’ Sex Trafficking Trial Pushed Back; New Criminal Indictment Hits Imprisoned Bad Boy Records Founder</a></h2><b>Source:</b> indiewire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-14 18:55:43 <p>
Sean “Diddy” Combs’ trial for sex trafficking and more has been pushed back a week to May 12 following a hearing Friday in New York federal court. The shift from the original May 5 start date came during a session on the superseding indictment of forced labor against Combs that prosecutors brought down last week, adding to claims of racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. Combs, in attendance as he has been for every hearing in the case since his arrest last fall, said little during the hearing but but did enter a “not guilty” plea to the new charge, just like the Grammy-winning rapper and Bad Boy Records founder has done for previous indictments in this matter. The 55-year-old defendant walked into court in khaki prison garb and with a head of hair that has turned startlingly gray since his last court appearance. Before entering his latest plea, Combs, standing, addressed Judge Arun Subramanian as “sir” and told him he did not need the new indictment read back to him. The pushing back of opening arguments by a week was an acknowledgment by the judge that litigating some of those issues could take additional time. Lasting less hour in front of Subramanian, today’s hearing saw the U.S. Attorney’s office and defense lawyers get combative over potential witnesses for the trial and 2016 video footage broadcasted last spring of a half-naked Combs beating then-longtime girlfriend Cassie Ventura in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel. Prosecutor Mitzi Steiner from the Southern District of New York revealed that feds have another 20 potential witnesses – as yet unidentified – who are “incredibly frightened” at the thought of having their names disclosed to defense, as intimidation and fears of possible violent retribution from Combs and associates have come up numerous times in the case. The revised indictment (read it here) says Combs coerced employees into “forced labor,” including sex through intimidation, withheld pay, sleep deprivation and threats of firing. Employees were led to believe “they would be harmed — including by losing their jobs — if they did not comply with his demands,” the indictment states. Combs apologized via Instagram two days after CNN aired the hotel surveillance clip, saying he was “disgusted” by his behavior. RELATED: Diddy Slams CNN For Allegedly Altering Cassie Ventura Beating Footage; Cable Newser Destroyed Original Video, Rapper Claims Subjecting that 2016 footage to near constant undermining since the criminal case began, Combs’ lawyers this week formally accused CNN of doctoring the clip by editing and speeding up footage for broadcast and then destroying the original video. Losing one of his key lawyers in the criminal case earlier this year, Combs also on February 12 sued NBCUniversal for $100 million in a defamation action over what he calls out as “outrageous set of fresh lies and conspiracy theories” in the Peacock documentary Diddy: Making of a Bad Boy.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Since Chappell Roan dropped her debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, in September 2023, she’s become as famous for her idiosyncratic fashion as her bops.

The “Hot to Go” singer opened up about her style inspiration during a June 2024 appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, which itself featured a costume change.

“Well, my stylist, Genesis Webb and I, we pull from drag, we pull from horror movies, we pull from burlesque, we pull from theater,” Roan explained while dressed as a black swan (before changing into a white swan look for her performance). “I love looking pretty and scary, or pretty and tacky, or just not pretty. I love that too. It’s just not serious. I love that fans find such deep meanings to things and I’m just like, ‘I don’t know, I thought I looked hot.’”

That same month, Roan channeled late drag queen Divine from John Waters’ film Pink Flamingos for a set at Kentuckiana Pride. “Filth is my politics! Filth is my life!” she captioned a set of Instagram snaps from the event. “Inspired by Divine the most beautiful woman in the world, almost <3.”

Morgan Wade is currently on the road touring her latest album, Obsessed, but she’s still finding time to make new music — and her new song is a real heartbreaker. The singer-songwriter is on tour right now promoting her fourth studio album, Obsessed, which she released in August 2024. Earlier this year, her famous friend Kyle Richards attended Wade’s concert in Los Angeles, where Wade asked the audience to pray for Teddi Mellencamp. The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum, 43, had just revealed that she needed to undergo emergency surgery to remove tumors on her brain caused by melanoma. “We’re really blessed to have a bunch of people here with me tonight,” Wade told the crowd. Wade appeared on a few episodes of RHOBH during season 13, which aired from late 2023 through spring 2024. During the current season, however, Richards said she didn’t want to use Wade’s name when she wasn’t there to defend herself. I don’t want to speak on anyone’s behalf except my own.” Wade has recently been battling some health issues of her own as she deals with vocal problems. “I was really hoping to have some better news today. I was really hoping we were going to be able to play tonight, so much so that we are here in Cleveland, but my voice is just not,” Wade told her Instagram followers in a video shared on Wednesday.

WASHINGTON—Failing to receive the reaction he anticipated from audience members, JD Vance was booed at the John F.

The stage curtains reportedly rose to reveal the vice president, an amateur horn player, standing by himself behind a music stand, a sight that elicited gasps and murmurs from those in attendance. According to sources, the crowd began booing and jeering Vance within the first 15 seconds of his performance of Franz Strauss’s Horn Concerto, Op. 8, causing the vice president to quickly lose his confidence and begin playing cracked and flat notes. Several reports indicated that the vice president attempted to make eye contact with his wife, second lady Usha Vance, who sat in the box tier, but she only looked away and stared down at her hands. At press time, Vance was said to have dropped his French horn to the floor and run off the stage in tears, knocking over the music stand in the process.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Minimalist, two-hander, nearly single-location horror-thrillers that unfold in real time can — and should — take any number of formal and narrative liberties, but it’s crucial that they use them to take us all the way to the place they have in mind. The latest film by British-Iranian director Babak Anvari (“Under the Shadow”) only gets us halfway before it gets lost in a fog of its own elevated ideas. The story of two out-of-sync parents flying down a nighttime motorway to save their daughter after she’s crashed into a girl while driving through an eerie forest, “Hallow Road” makes for a highly tense watch that will have audiences flocking to the nearest dive bar or social media platform to map out easter eggs and froth over grand semiotics. Unfortunately, the film never transcends its tone of ever-present and palpable danger to become a more satisfying character piece. A degree of remove is rooted in the film’s very conceit and execution. From there, still on celluloid, we cut inside a warmly lit, middle class home, as the camera consciously swoops through clues: an unfinished meal, half-consumed glasses of wine, carved pumpkins (ah, it’s Halloween), and crushed glass swept to the corner. Maddie (Rosamund Pike), asleep in the bedroom, and Frank (Matthew Rhys), passed out on the desk of his home office, are awoken by a frantic call from their teenage daughter Alice (Megan McDonnell), whom we know the whole movie only by her voice on the phone and a sweet-enough profile pic. We piece together that Maddie and Frank had an argument with Alice, after which she fled with his car and is now panicking after the bizarre accident. They rush to her aid, and as soon as Frank enters the address on Pike’s car’s GPS—“Hallow Road”— the frame, like heartless clockwork, rivets to digital. The next hour takes place entirely inside the car, with Rhys and Pike swinging between barked orders, painful pleas, petrified silences, and some truly bone-crunching SFX. Trapped alongside these two fine actors, we become more acquainted with Maddie and Frank as characters. It’s a sartorial misstep that Rhys wears as best he can, the actor’s performance a thousand miles removed from his charming, oxidized take on Perry Mason. Things only become less intriguing as the night wears on, as loose plot threads mix with predictable secrets that these characters have been holding onto since long before the film began. Anvari is willing to work with that, as he leans into the uncertainty and dizzying suspension fueled by the film’s story. On paper, Anvari’s slew of innovations should work. In this twilight zone, extreme closeups of Maddie and Frank’s terrified eyes, the sudden depiction of the road in soft focus, and the forest’s AI-like rendering are downright disorienting. The upside of “Hallow Road’s” pure genre workout is that Anvari finds the sunny side up of this dreadfully nocturnal nowhere exurb. When a seeming Good Samaritan character shows up—like Alice, heard only through the phone— our hackles are instantly raised — how can a voice so saccharine conjure so much fright? Before we can really chew on her references to the piper or project other grim fairy tales onto Alice’s fate, Gillies and Anvari take the ride into fifth gear, a meta mode, with characters spouting lines such as “I want a better story,” “I asked all the wrong questions,” and “Am I making you uncomfortable?” Then, in the end credits, the filmmakers wholly exit the simulacrum with a doozy of a reveal. If only this one didn’t feel as vacant long after it’s arrived at its destination.

Returning to Harvey Specter for Suits LA had Gabriel Macht feeling some type of way. “There was a sense of warmth on the set,” Macht, 53, told Us Weekly exclusively while promoting his starring role in Bear Fight Whiskey’s first-ever ad campaign. “I grew up in L.A. and there was full circle moments for me, which were really cool.” He told Us that while the new cast was so “welcoming,” working with some crew members was “nostalgic” — something he felt in more ways than one. “There’s some scenes where you see me on the baseball field, and we shot at a park that I used to practice [at] in high school.

Disney’s live-action film has become so fraught with controversy that the premiere on March 15 will be scaled back and exclude pesky, inquisitive press from the red carpet. Benj Pasek and Justin Paul were attached to write new music, with Marc Platt, of Wicked and Ben fame, onboard to produce. November 4, 2021: Gal Gadot is cast as the Evil Queen, despite her work in Red Notice. January 14, 2022: During an appearance on Marc Maron’s WTF podcast, Peter Dinklage criticizes the planned film, calling it a “backwards story” on account of its depiction of the seven dwarfs. Literally no offense to anyone, but I was a little taken aback when they were very proud to cast a Latina actress as Snow White. But you’re still telling the story of Snow White and the ‘seven dwarfs.’ Take a step back and look at what you’re doing there. Have I done nothing to advance the cause from my soap box? I don’t know which studio that is, but they were so proud of it. But I’m just like, ‘What are you doing?’” Dinklage would go on to star with Zegler in 2023’s The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes. “To avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film, we are taking a different approach with these seven characters and have been consulting with members of the dwarfism community,” it states. “We look forward to sharing more as the film heads into production after a lengthy development period.” Dylan Postl, who plays Hornswoggle in the WWE, told the Daily Mail in part, “It’s not helping our community, it’s taking jobs away from our community that are very few and far between as it is.” Katrina Kemp, who has acted on Netflix’s GLOW, also said, “It’s a missed opportunity to make a movie with seven little people where they actually have intended characters. “You don’t normally see Snow Whites who are of Latin descent. Even though Snow White is really a big deal in Spanish-speaking countries. “The original cartoon came out in 1937 and very evidently so. So we didn’t do that this time,” she states. “We have a different approach to what I’m sure a lot of people will assume is a love story just because we cast a guy in the movie, Andrew Burnap, great dude … But it’s really not about the love story at all, which is really, really wonderful … All of Andrew’s scenes could get cut, who knows? It’s an inner journey that she goes on to find her true self and she meets a lot of people along the way that makes the journey really incredible.” Her comments were, of course, used by the anti-woke mob of far-right pundits to continue to stir up backlash against the film and Zegler’s casting. After originally denying the authenticity of the photos, Disney ultimately confirmed that they were from its set but featured stand-ins and weren’t official photos. July 15, 2023: Rachel Zegler once again addresses the attacks on her in a tweet reading, “Extremely appreciative of the love I feel from those defending me online, but please don’t tag me in the nonsensical discourse about my casting. I really, truly do not want to see it. I hope every child knows they can be a princess no matter what.” The attached photos show Zegler as a child dressed as different Disney princesses, including Snow White. October 27, 2023: Amid the SAG-AFTRA strike, Disney pushes the film’s release date back from March 2024 to March 2025 but shares a first look image that reveals the seven dwarfs will be animated as CGI characters. August 10, 2024: The release of the film’s first teaser trailer is met with calls for a boycott due to Gal Gadot’s pro-Israel stance. Gadot is Israeli, served in the IDF for two years, and has been a vocal supporter of Israel throughout the genocide in Gaza. August 12, 2024: Conversely, Zegler, who has been publicly pro-Palestine since 2021, tweets her thanks to fans, adding, “And always remember, free Palestine.” October 2, 2024: In an interview with Variety, Zegler explains the new film’s backstory behind Snow White’s name, which had previously been a reference to her skin being “as white as snow.” “It fell back to another version of Snow White that was told in history, where she survived a snowstorm that occurred when she was a baby. Martin Klebba, who has dwarfism, had previously been announced to be playing Grumpy. Instead, the event will only include photographers and house interviewers.

Ray (Brian Tyree Henry) and Manny (Wagner Moura) are attached at the hip. Their loyalty goes beyond airport pick-ups or wingman sacrifices. They have taken and will take bullets for each other. When a cop presses Manny to rat out Ray, or a girlfriend begs Ray to leave Manny behind, neither one buckles under the pressure. In the City of Brotherly Love, they aren’t just old buds. Their central predicament — on the run from a very scary drug dealer, a very pushy police force, and a very shady division of federal law enforcement — is so stressful, their conversations tend to be shouting matches and their shared screentime is usually spent staring down either end of a loaded gun. But when you cast Henry and Moura to play fiercely devoted brothers-in-arms, you need to let them explore the depths of that friendship, in all its pain and its joy. Otherwise, even their considerable charms struggle to sustain a one-note waiting game. Adapted by Peter Craig (“The Batman,” “The Unforgivable”) from Dennis Tafoya’s 2009 novel of the same name, “Dope Thief‘s” premiere is directed by Ridley Scott, who sets a steely gray color palette primed to be decorated with bright splashes of blood. Chase scenes are easily tracked over rich urban terrain, and shootouts tend to play out in clear, rudimentary compositions. The Philadelphia setting foregrounds inner-city row houses, scrappy corner stores, and nondescript citizens just trying to go about their business — a working-class vision of a blue collar town. When we first meet Ray and Manny, it’s February 2021. Their scheme is simple but serious: Posing as DEA agents (complete with hats, jackets, and badges), the two nobodies from nowhere “bust” whoever’s up to no good inside and walk out with whatever money they can find. All that changes when they let a third member join the team. Now, as soon as a kinda slow, pretty cocky, and thoroughly scuzzy ex-con shows up, fresh out of prison, with a handful of “easy marks,” any fan of the heist genre will know this guy is going to be a problem. As always, they have their reasons: Ray needs money to support Theresa (Kate Mulgrew), his de facto mother who helped raise him after his father/her boyfriend (Ving Rhames) ended up in prison. Manny is trying to start a family with his girlfriend. Brian Tyree Henry and Wagner Moura in ‘Dope Thief’ Courtesy of Apple TV+ The bust breaks bad, everything goes sideways, and Manny and Ray soon can’t escape their own shadows, let alone the various armies of men with guns looking for them. But their botched raid is just first domino to fall in “Dope Thief’s” drug-trade conspiracy saga, a fact that takes way too long to make itself known. Brian Tyree Henry, who’s also an executive producer, proves himself — of all things! Sweaty and disheveled, desperate to survive but innovative under pressure, Henry can go toe-to-barren-toe with Bruce Willis’ iconic character, including the quips. (He gets a handful of punchlines, delivered with apt exhilaration and exasperation, that call to mind Willis’ put-upon-everyman charms.) Mulgrew and Rhames are reliably great, and Marin Ireland takes the grizzled cop archetype to new levels of surliness, but the cast is left to carry too heavy a bag. After starting and stopping, the story is just getting going again when the season ends, but trusting Season 2 to deliver a more focused story is all but impossible. “Dope Thief” premieres Friday, March 14 on Apple TV+ with two episodes.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

WASHINGTON—In the wake of a growing outbreak that has sickened hundreds and killed two in West Texas and New Mexico, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed Friday that measles could be cured with a good concealer. “If you contract measles or suspect you have contracted measles, I recommend immediately applying a high-quality, full-coverage liquid or cream color corrector to affected areas,” said Kennedy, who added that HHS was rushing to distribute facial cleanser, foundation, and 10-ounce tubes of L’Oréal Infallible to pharmacies in the region. “Our nation’s top infectious disease doctors recommend anyone who has been exposed to measles immediately use a ring light to assess their skin, apply a dab of 24-hour concealer, and then smooth with a brush or Beautyblender makeup sponge. The truth is, if Americans just had proper access to lightweight cosmetic products capable of hiding blemishes, eliminating uneven skin tone, and highlighting natural complexion, measles could be eradicated.” At press time, Kennedy had released a makeup tutorial where he demonstrated how to apply concealer manufactured by his wife Cheryl Hines’ makeup company for extra measles protection.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Gene Simmons partook in one of the most venerable local television news traditions we have: celebrities doing the weather report. On Thursday, the Kiss frontman stopped by Fox 11 in Los Angeles to join — and repeatedly neg — meteorologist Adam Krueger for the weekend weather report. The segment opened with Simmons roasting Krueger (“You look much better in real life than you do on TV”), and the whole thing just got more bizarre, goofy, and slightly awkward from there. Simmons put plenty of his pizazz into his performance, even as he occasionally mixed up his words, like when he said, “Friday, it’s going to be a 90 percent chance of rain, Saturday it’s gonna be 60 percent sunshine.” Meanwhile, Kreuger did the classic local news reporter bit of slipping in relevant Kiss puns and lyrics into the forecast, which Simmons seemed to begrudgingly play along with. (Kreuger, in particular, has shown a particular penchant for music-themed forecasts, using lyrics by Kendrick Lamar and Tyler, the Creator, among others.) Amazingly, the whole thing ended with Simmons freestyle rapping. As the segment ended, Kreuger gave Simmons a fist bump, prompting the musician to ask, “Are you kicking me out?” After Kreuger explained the producers were telling him to “wrap” in his ear monitor, Simmons immediately replied, “Rap? Meteorology has apparently become one of Simmons’ hobbies since Kiss finished their (alleged) farewell tour in December 2023. Last September, the musician appeared on another local news channel, KTLA 5, to deliver the morning forecast. Otherwise, Simmons is busy with the Gene Simmons Band, which is set to launch a North American tour on April 3.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

That’s why I’m so grateful to now have a team that believes in me and my craft as a songwriter before anything else, and I’m excited for this new chapter. It’s been amazing to watch her rise so quickly, and we can’t wait for the amazing music she has yet to share with the world.” “As we continue to elevate the impact of our Corporate Events division, I am excited to announce Matt’s well-deserved promotion, along with the appointment of our new Technical Directors,” said Ariane Coldiron, PRG senior vice president, corporate events. “Technical excellence is central to the PRG mission and these developments will enhance our ability to deliver exceptional experiences that create lasting value for our clients.” “I am glad to be a part of a company that is continuously innovating and understands how technology can propel the ideas and visions of event producers.

A consultancy group and product innovation lab called FBRC.ai on Friday released a report that aims to quite literally map out all the AI content creators in the landscape as of March 2025. The report found that many of these companies have just 5 or fewer employees and are largely independent endeavors. In addition to a broad overview of the space and a world map of where each of these companies are based, the full report includes profiles with nine different studios who are among the current leaders in the space: Promise, Asteria, Shy Kids, Invisible Universe, Playbook, AI Hub, Pigeon Shrine, Secret Level, and Mod Tech Labs. As the report shows, not all of these companies are created equal, and they exist on a spectrum in terms of how they utilize AI. Some are work-for-hire agencies that almost solely bring in clients, while others co-produce, and some are working to develop entirely their own content they can create and distribute. What’s more, some companies are considered “AI Native” studios, in that they use “closed source” models like OpenAI’s Sora, Runway, or Luma’s Dream Machine and will create text, images, and video entirely via AI prompts going direct from script to screen. Others will use an open source model like ComfyUI that gives creators a little more control over the creation tools. “While all have experimented with technology throughout their careers and thus were drawn to AI as the next frontier, they all had years of experience with storytelling. Nearly every founder attests that they still believe the most substantial moat is not technical but rather about who can do the work of crafting a good story.” Making these distinctions in the AI space is important for people who have a narrow or pigeon-holed idea of what generative AI production is or what it looks like. But the report acknowledges that, over time and as the models improve, many of these lines will start to blur, with studios experimenting with hybrid projects and fully-blown AI movies. But they are differentiating themselves by developing their own datasets on which these models are trained (think Lionsgate’s recent partnership with Runway), as well as developing their own unique workflows or interfaces about how they want to use the tools. So are all these companies working to take everyone’s jobs? While some are dabbling in shorts, feature films, and TV shows, others are invested in VR, gaming, ads, and music videos, among other new formats of content.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Steven Soderbergh, Cate Blanchett, and Michael Fassbender: What a trio. There’s great chemistry right off the bat between Brian Tyree Henry and Wagner Moura, who play robbers posing as DEA agents so they can steal drugs and cash. Written and directed by former GQ writer Mark Anthony Green, this latest thriller from A24 stars Ayo Edebiri as a young journalist who, alongside Juliette Lewis and Murray Bartlett, is invited to listen to Alfred Moretti’s (Malkovich) first album in almost 30 years. Though when you’re invited to an isolated compound, may we say run? You’d think Jack Quaid had experienced enough pain through his characters in The Boys and Companion, but here’s to round three. In Novocaine, Quaid plays a guy who literally can’t feel pain, so naturally he uses that to rescue his crush (Amber Midthunder) after a bank robbery.

The following is an excerpt from “In Review by David Ehrlich,” a biweekly newsletter in which our Chief Film Critic and Head Reviews Editor rounds up the site’s latest reviews and muses about current events in the movie world. Subscribe here to receive the newsletter in your inbox every other Friday. The past week presented a remarkable challenge to some of America’s longest-standing norms (and constitutional amendments). Sure, that “something” was the third trailer for a movie that still feels like it could’ve been an email, but at a time when even the most shocking events immediately seem like well-seeded inevitabilities, I’ll take my good surprises where I can get them. And I’m of the mind that this was a good surprise. Titled “Absolute Cinema,” the first “Thunderbolts*” promo since the sub-ideal release of “Captain America: Brave New World” went to extraordinary — and extraordinarily specific — lengths to push back against the idea that Hollywood’s most profitable blockbuster machine has been permanently enshittified into a massive slop factory. Released in tandem with a Florence Pugh interview in which she insisted that “Thunderbolts*” “ended up becoming this quite badass indie, A24-feeling assassin movie with Marvel superheroes,” the trailer starts with the actress saying “there’s something wrong.” It’s unclear if she’s talking about our world, her own, or the production company that bridges them together, but her point is hard to argue regardless. Then: A Marvel Studio logo we’ve never seen before, the colors and flash of which do more to evoke the false humility of A24 or Plan B’s company idents than the fascistic “we own you” energy we tend to get from those of a major studio. Cue a fat electro beat courtesy of French DJ Gesaffelstein, miles removed from the hushed silence that most superhero movie trailers use to suggest gravitas, and — what’s this? Superheroes are supposed to wink and fly and say things like “we have to stop CGI Harrison Ford before he eats the Washington Monument!” But “Thunderbolts*” isn’t your daddy’s superhero movie. It isn’t even my daddy’s superhero movie (which was “The Dark Knight,” at least until he walked out of it halfway through in favor of watching “Mamma Mia!” for the second time). Where “Captain America: Brave New World” was sold on the premise of watching Sam Wilson rebuild the Avengers, this trailer for “Thunderbolts*” downplays the movie’s role in a corporate mega-strategy in favor of foregrounding its indie cred. It highlights its cast by boasting that it’s “From the stars of ‘Midsommar,’ ‘A Different Man,’ and ‘You Hurt My Feelings” (the last of which briefly electrified me with the hope that Jeannie Berlin might be playing The Void, until I remembered that Julia Louis-Dreyfus has been in several of these things), three A24 movies that combined to gross $150 million less than “The Marvels” did alone. Then, and only then, does the trailer begin to highlight its famous Marvel characters, as it plasters their names on the screen with an EDM punch and a film strip wiggle that seems lifted straight from the marketing for “Spring Breakers” and “The Bling Ring.” Stan spills something on his shirt, a person in a chicken suit gets punched in the face, and David Harbour screams “Yessssssss!” It’s all vibes and no plot, but those vibes tell a story of their own: This isn’t going to be another cookie-cutter spectacle about people in spandex fighting to stop a beam of light from the sky. I’m not sure how far I trust those implied promises (or maybe I am sure, and it’s not very), but I have no trouble believing the broader message that’s being conveyed here: After dictating the culture for the 17 years or so, Marvel has finally been reduced to the point of reacting to it. For one thing, the Disney marketing department’s attempt to frame “Thunderbolts*” as an indie film is a fascinating conflation between aesthetics and the means of production. There are certainly a number of overlapping signifiers in their collective output (e.g. fluorescent lighting, the state of Florida, wall-to-wall coverage on IndieWire.com), but no one would ever suggest that it’s as hard to distinguish between “Lady Bird” and “The Iron Claw” as it is between any two Hong Sang-soo movies, or that “Minari” and “A Different Man” — to use two of the titles cited in “Absolute Cinema” — were as interchangeable as “Black Widow” and “Captain America: Winter Soldier.” As a result, the latest “Thunderbolts*” trailer doesn’t feel like an A24 movie so much as it feels like someone trying to imitate an A24 movie; by using a similar approach to sell something that we have definitely all seen before to one degree or another, Marvel has only helped to reaffirm that A24 is more attitude than aesthetic. But the fact that Marvel is trying to look a bit more like A24 at the same time as A24 is trying to look a bit more like a traditional film studio (complete with $70 million period epics slated for awards season) is only so interesting to me because of how those trends reflect a larger shift in the way that mainstream entertainment is consumed: the inevitable sea change from a casual monoculture to a network of siloed devotees. I’ve feared that would happen because it’s obviously happening already; even London’s most famous independent cinema is struggling to survive, while it was reported this week that Hollywood studios have been inexplicably resistant to AMC’s pleas for longer theatrical windows. But the best time to make things better is when you can see them going from bad to worse, and I can’t help but feel like the “Thunderbolts*” trailer indicates that you — by which I mean anyone who cares about this shit enough to have read this far — will have an outsized say in whatever happens next. As the mass audience fragments and the cultural ecosystem fractures apart further than it has already (a self-own on Disney’s part, as the company’s streaming greed made it impossible for a new MCU movie to feel like the mega-event that it once did), even the biggest corporations on Earth will have to compensate with genuine excitement what they’ve lost in blind obligation. If the Nazification of Tesla has taught me anything, it’s that a brand is only as strong as the people who love it. If they were, then Elon Musk wouldn’t be on the brink of tears as Fox News questioned him about the strain that being a historically terrible human being has put on his signature business. Or, on a more relevant note, consider “The Electric State,” an unwatchable $320 million streaming movie that virtually no one is excited to see, even though Netflix will inevitably send out a press release proclaiming that it’s the most-watched spectacle since the moon landing or whatever. I wrote in my review that “The Electric State” doesn’t just feel like it was made by AI, it also feels like it was made for AI, and that’s the very feeling that “Absolute Cinema” is trying to push so hard against. Perhaps there was a time when simply making “big-screen entertainment” available to the masses was enough for a quasi-monopolistic outfit like Netflix to survive, but there’s a reason why the executive who greenlit the Russo brothers’ latest boondoggle — and so many other of the streamer’s riskiest movies, mega-budget movies, a few of them excellent! What used to be a battle for our wallets has become a war for our attention, and it’s being fought in Twitter replies, impassioned Subreddits, and — most crucially of all — on Letterboxd, where movie opinions are the only currency that matters to legions of young people who don’t have any other kind to spend. Content isn’t king anymore, especially now that Gen-AI has devalued it worse than a memestock. Discourse is toxic, but it’s the best press money can buy. At the same time A24 has proven that hardcore enthusiasm can be converted into general interest, Marvel has proven that it’s getting much harder to drive things in the opposite direction.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/chappell-roan-the-giver-review.html'>Chappell Roan’s Silliness Is Sincere On ‘The Giver’</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-14 16:25:46 <p>
She even showed up in full clown makeup for her acoustic NPR Tiny Desk set. In fact, Roan’s leaning into them to her advantage, queering the rote masculine country references and taking to task the men who leave their girlfriends with unfinished business. “The Giver” just as easily could’ve gone full parody. It sure reads like one: a lesbian come-on country song playing off dom-sub roles. Roan toed the line in the winking rollout of the track, posting billboards of her as a dentist (“Dental dams aren’t just for dentists”), a plumber (“Showing crack is back”), and an HVAC repair person (“Your wife’s hot”). But this is the work of someone who cares about country. Roan being raised in small-town Missouri is key to her mythology, yet she’s never centered it as much as she does on “The Giver.” In a statement, she framed the song as a tribute to the sound of her childhood: “I grew up listening to it every morning and afternoon on my school bus and had it swirling around me at bonfires, grocery stores and karaoke bars.” As the songwriter’s cliché goes, “The Giver” isn’t just for the queer kids growing up in less-accepting parts of the country, it’s by one of them — a singer who’s figured out how to take something good from their upbringing and make it their own. After Roan first performed “The Giver” on Saturday Night Live last November, fans wondered if she might have a whole country album up her sleeves; she’s since assured them this is a one-off exploration. But “The Giver” isn’t all that different from Roan’s past work. She’s been bridging sincerity and silliness since “Pink Pony Club,” her campy ode to gay havens.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/diddy-sex-trafficking-case-arraignment-update.html'>What Happened with Sean “Diddy” Combs Sex-Trafficking Case Today</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-14 16:20:00 <p>
When Sean “Diddy” Combs walked into a Manhattan federal courtroom just after 2 p.m. on Friday for an arraignment on revamped charges in his sex-trafficking case, the rapper looked dramatically different from his prior court proceedings. In the revamped indictment released on March 6, Combs was accused of controlling some employees by forcing them to work grueling hours with minimal sleep and using threats to keep them in check. Back in late January, prosecutors listed two more accusers, identified as “Victim-2” and “Victim-3,” who claim to have been lured into sex acts by the disgraced music mogul. They also said that “on one occasion, Combs dangled a victim over an apartment balcony.” With the help of his staff, Combs allegedly used his powerful business empire to create a “criminal enterprise” that enabled his alleged manipulation of women into sexual performances with male sex workers. Combs, 55, was arrested on September 16, 2024, amid numerous accusations of sexual abuse and trafficking. In court papers and proceedings, prosecutors have detailed what they describe as a decadeslong history of alleged misconduct. After these women fell into his deceptive orbit — frequently under the belief that their interactions with him constituted a romantic relationship — Combs purportedly forced them to partake in events called “freak offs,” prosecutors said. These freak offs amounted to “elaborate and produced sex performances that Combs arranged, directed, masturbated during, and often electronically recorded.” Cassie Ventura — whose now-settled November 2023 lawsuit against Combs, her former partner, set the stage for others to take legal action against him and, ultimately, the criminal case — is known as “Victim-1” in the federal proceedings. Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo claimed that CNN, which first published the footage, had sped up and spliced it in a misleading manner. “It’s a deceptive piece of evidence; it’s a piece of evidence that might have changed.” Agnifilo also claimed CNN had deleted the original footage, though the network has denied these claims.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/playboi-carti-music-delays.html'>Playboi Carti Stops Playing, Drops New Music</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-14 16:15:47 <p>
As Madonna says, “Music makes the people come together.” Unless you’re a Playboi Carti fan, in which case, just the word music is enough to send a shiver down your spine. But no longer: After years of teasing and delays, the rapper’s third album, Music, is finally here. ET after some finish-line delays Carti chalked up to a Young Thug feature. Carti first teased a follow-up to 2020’s Whole Lotta Red in March 2021, writing on Instagram, ““LeTs dr0p thiS new Album . w3 noT done.” By August, he had revealed the project was called Narcissist and set a release date of September 13. That day came and went with no album, but by September 14, Narcissist merch was available on his website: masks, bomber jackets, and even a $5,000 helmet. In an April 2022 cover interview for XXL, Carti revealed his album was now called Music “because that’s all it is at this point.” So long, Narcissist — we hardly knew ya! On Christmas, Carti tweeted, “love all my supporters it’s time.” But Santa Carti didn’t end up bringing any new music on Christmas or in the days after. In November 2023, Carti told German magazine Numéro Berlin he was still working on Music. That December, Carti seemed to reveal cover art for the album, now apparently titled I Am Music. And he also started posting clips to his new Instagram account @opium_00pium. On December 14, 2023, he released a music video for “2024,” featuring production by Kanye West, and on December 19, he released a clip for another new song, “H00dByAir.” Music didn’t drop in 2023, but the singles kept coming, with the Travis Scott–featuring “Backr00ms” out January 1, 2024, and “EvilJ0rdan” following on January 15. Carti released yet another song, “Ketamine,” on March 12, but still no album was in sight. 1 in the meantime for a feature on Ye and Ty Dolla $ign’s “Carnival.” But don’t worry, he continued dropping @opium_00pium exclusives, too, like one on November 21, 2024. Carti teased five new songs during his Rolling Loud headlining set in December, but once again, the year ended without Music. “HAD 2 MAKE SURE SLIMEEEE WAS ON DIS MF,” he added in another post with a photo of him FaceTiming Young Thug. The album didn’t arrive till around 4:30 a.m. PT (7:30 ET) — but, finally, it’s here. The guest list Carti confirmed is a mix of his usual suspects and hip-hop heavy-hitters. After “Backd00rs,” Travis Scott is on three songs: “Crush,” “Philly,” and “Wake Up F1lthy.” Carti’s comrade-in-arms Lil Uzi Vert shows up twice, on “Jumpin” and “Twin Trim.” Future makes appearances on “Charge Dem Hoes a Fee” and “Trim” — and if you think you hear him anywhere else, that’s because Carti also kind of sounds like Future now. Carti’s original list of features included one blacked-out name. That turned out to be Kendrick Lamar, who’s on “Mojo Dojo,” “Backd00r,” and “Good Credit.” K-Dot plays more of a hype man on the first two but does drop a full verse for his “evil twin” on “Good Credit.” “I would’ve said, ‘Fuck you too,’ but you knew what the list was for,” he raps — another Drake diss?</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Director Paul Feig’s sequel film stars Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick, reprising their roles from 2018’s “A Simple Favor.” However, Stone claims she, too, was part of the ensemble cast. Stone was in talks for the role that later went to Elizabeth Perkins. A source close to production confirmed that Stone was never actually cast in the film; the deal did not go through due to budget issues. IndieWire has additionally reached out to representatives for Amazon MGM Studios and Stone. “Another Simple Favor” premiered at SXSW as the opening night film. In the new film, Stephanie has now written a book about the events of the first movie, and Emily, who was in prison, crashes a book reading to invite Stephanie to her wedding — and possibly enact her revenge plot. I don’t want to fall back on old properties all the time. I just think they’re good on their own. There aren’t that many great sequels in the world, I hate to say. Her role has not been announced, although the third season will include a time jump.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/best-st-patricks-day-tv-episodes-streaming.html'>Best St. Patrick’s Day TV Episodes on Streaming</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-14 16:00:00 <p>
But if you’d rather watch the wild antics from afar than head to your local pub and drain it of cheap, we’ve got your solution — 11 of the best St. Patrick’s Day TV episodes, many of which feature magic and hedonism to enjoy vicariously. It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, “Charlie Catches a Leprechaun” (Season 11, Episode 8) In an otherwise pretty weak season, “Charlie Catches a Leprechaun” makes the most of Charlie’s endearing childlike curiosity and gullibility while Dennis tries to streamline the bar with a booze-selling wagon. After a man is caught pickpocketing, he tells Charlie he’s a leprechaun and Charlie believes him; setting glue traps to catch him, and going on a wild goose chase all over town with Mac to track him. Bob’s Burgers, “Flat-Top O’ the Morning to Ya” (Season 10, Episode 16) Here Linda and Teddy get a little too in the festive spirit. It starts innocently enough with an Irish-themed breakfast, but Bob is keen to keep things classy (and not green) in the restaurant. But their enthusiasm doesn’t quite rub off on the customers, who’d rather not chow down green meat. Bonus points if you can spot Walt lurking in the background of every shot. He gives Sabrina three golden coupons that grant her wishes; which, as we know, never goes well. She turns Salem into a man, but his essence is placed into a boy at school, leading to his attempts to take over the world. It’s a silly, fun episode with no real stakes but lots of ridiculousness and capers all round — perfect for the holiday. In “No Tomorrow,” the How I Met Your Mother gang gives into the green hedonism of St Patrick’s Day after attempting to stay at home and have a board-game night. When Barney convinces Ted that the day has no consequences, Ted goes hog wild on behaving badly and finds that his bad deeds actually reward him: For one night only, he can live consequence-free, just like Barney. Naturally, more than one show on this list takes place in a bar. As in the Sunny episode, the stakes are more about business and pride than having wild, raucous fun — partly because, well, running a bar over St. Patrick’s Day probably isn’t that much fun, but it definitely brings in a lot of money. Catch this episode of Cheers and then spare a thought (and a big tip) for your local bartender if you go out this weekend. Elsewhere, Jenna and Tracy each fight to be lead host of the St Patrick’s Day parade. It’s a perfect 30 Rock episode, full of arguments, megalomania, and general disdain, all heightened by the holiday. A demon is out killing leprechauns and stealing their magic, so the Charmed Ones, as always, step in to help. Luckily, the holiday falls on a weekend this year, which means those so inclined can get in their partying without worrying about work. Not so in this classic episode of The Office, in which Dunder Mifflin’s employees are all stuck at work after being made to stay later by Jo. Eventually, Michael is forced to be direct with Jo and tell her he’s letting the employees leave. She relents, and we have a happy ending, as the employees get to enjoy their St. Patrick’s Day in a bar, as it was intended by St. Patrick himself. St. Patrick’s Day should be a time for hedonism and letting loose, but in this Home Improvement episode, Wilson’s visiting niece, Willow, has a bit too much fun, failing to return home from the club and scaring everyone into sending out a search party. It’s a holiday episode within a holiday episode — Tim and Al wear lots of green, the set is dressed in Guinness merch, there’s Irish-themed improvement projects, and Tim opens with an attempt at an offensive limerick. It’s an episode that proves that all you really need to celebrate holiday (even on a Tuesday) is to get into the spirit, which might just mean painting your toolbox green. As with many festive and outgoing holidays, a lot of us more introverted types might find ourselves grudgingly trying to join the fun even if it’s not quite our bag. That’s what happens in 2 Broke Girls’ “And the Kilt Trip” when, seeking to fit in with Max and her other friends, Caroline joins everyone to get crazy at the St. Patrick’s Day parade. Surprise: She has a not-so-great time, and instead longs to enjoy her own old holiday traditions at the Plaza Hotel.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

He’s found comedy in the darkest places and the most messed-up people, whether a father of three (Dylan Baker) who’s also a pedophile in “Happiness,” a middle-school social outcast (Heather Matarazzo) in “Welcome to the Dollhouse,” or a Hispanic housekeeper who poisons her employers with carbon monoxide in “Storytelling.” His 1998 “Happiness” shocked Cannes with its bleak sexuality and cringe characters, compelling even the Sundance Film Festival to refuse to screen it. She’s played by eight actors of varying ages and races, from Black star Sharon Wilkins to even Jennifer Jason Leigh at one point. The film is now back in theaters courtesy of Monument Releasing and a new restoration from Visit Films, produced in conjunction with MoMA. Hardly a box-office hit when released by the since-shuttered Wellspring in April 2005, following its Venice premiere, “Palindromes” picked up mixed reviews but remains a droll, curious gem in the New York director’s filmography. Some are more pleasant and easier to work with than others, but somehow, it works out this way,” Solondz told IndieWire. “It’s true that my young actors are never old enough to really understand or be given permission to watch the movies they act in. I remember at the ‘Palindromes’ cast and crew screening, every one of the kids, I think they all showed up, with their families. Who knows what they understood or didn’t understand. I did see some of the little ones whispering into their parents’ ears at different points of the movie, but kids can do that even when they’re watching a Disney movie. It’s hard to know what they did or didn’t understand, but certainly, none of these kids would be in the movies if these parents didn’t not only approve but support the whole process.” Her cousin, Aviva (played by the young Valerie Shusterov in this sequence), has sex with a neighbor boy Judah (Robert Agri) to the horror of her mother (Ellen Barkin), who demands an abortion that ends up sterilizing Aviva. The rest of “Palindromes” becomes a kind of quirky road movie as Aviva is played by different actors after escaping her home and hooking up with the wrong people. “Just as children use language they don’t understand in real life just because that’s the currency they’re familiar with. That doesn’t seem alien to me at all. As for mixed reviews on any of his films, Solondz said, “I always prefer if people like the movie. If the people say nice things, I feel better, and if they don’t, I feel worse, but nothing lasts. I swing with the moves of what others have to say. Just because someone says something positive doesn’t mean I have to agree with their point of view. Solondz, who when not behind the camera or writing teaches multiple film courses at New York University, has not released a film since 2016’s “Wiener-Dog,” an “Au Hasard Balthazar”-esque odyssey of animal exploitation about a dachshund’s interactions with dysfunctional people. Since last year, Solondz has been struggling to nail down financing for his first film in nearly a decade, “Love Child,” set to star Elizabeth Olsen and Charles Melton. Volution Media Partners and Gramercy Park Media were financing the project, which was set up at Killer Films (which also produced “Happiness”) and 2AM. It’s out of my control whether or not the movie happens. In a moment for independent filmmakers getting crushed by studio bean counters, the push toward spectacle, and narrowing theatrical windows, Solondz said, “I can’t say [the state of filmmaking] feels more dire. This movie, if the budget were smaller, I think, it wouldn’t be such a challenge, but that’s the way it is. It’s the nature of filmmaking when you’re not making a studio film. The restored “Palindromes,” produced by Visit Films in conjunction with the Museum of Modern Art, is now playing at IFC Center courtesy Monument Releasing and will arrive digitally on May 20.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

It was a sleepy week in late-night TV, what with all the daylight being saved. Seth Meyers called out daylight saving time during “Ya Burnt!” and he was right to do it. Didn’t one legislative body vote to get rid of that shit years ago? Why not do it in the name of efficiency or whatever? It’s hard to be funny about someone else’s personal tragedies, which most of the calls inevitably were. Make fun of your own misfortunes — like Joan Baez did when talking about crashing her Tesla over and over again. Baez was a delightful guest this week in late night. The work they put into their take on “Two Lies and a Truth” is impressive every week. And this week, they found the Chester Cheeto commercial that may or may not live in Andrew Cuomo’s head rent-free, and inspires him to call himself a “cool dude in a loose mood.” Andrew Cuomo thinks he’s Chester Cheeto, and that is indeed news for me. Look, when an inanimate object has hair, I’m laughing. After Midnight continues to innovate in the space of truly stupid games for its comedian contestants. This week, Brendan Scannell, Michelle Collins, and Kurt Braunohler had to give three random things DIY bangs — bangs with a backstory, mind you. Everyone acquitted themselves wonderfully, but the MVP was Collins, who disclosed that she cuts her own bob. On Monday, Mulaney was Jimmy Kimmel’s first guest. But the best entrance of the week went to Parker Posey on Late Night and her drape-y scarf-blouse situation. She was doing some real “Stevie Nicks’s Fajita Roundup” prop work. Posey asked Seth Meyers what vibe she was giving, hoping to hear “Endora from Bewitched.” But it was really more Gena Rowlands on the poster for Opening Night. The de–Los Angelesification of John Mulaney’s talk show is sad. Oh, Hello wouldn’t work if it was about two old men in Lansing, Michigan, ya know? But at least in introducing his new set, Mulaney had one last Los Angeles movie parody in him. As lamp murder after lamp murder took place through Mulaney’s telescope, the Body Double theme played in my head. (And before we’re off the first episode of Everybody’s Live, I want to demand Netflix put the “Willy Loman Focus Group” sketch on YouTube. I want to ruin a Gay-Guy Music-Video Night.) Windey was on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and Watch What Happens Live this week in a post-Traitors victory lap around NBC properties. And at every one, she made a direct plea to camera for the network to giver her her damn money! Windey on WWHL was especially delightful, as she explained very basic Bachelor shit to Andy Cohen as well as coming up with her own Housewives tagline: “I’m quick to cut people off, but I love to scissor.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/review-netflixs-electric-state-an-expensive-piece-of-junk.html'>Netflix’s The Electric State Is a $320 Million Piece of Junk</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-14 14:00:50 <p>
For years, Marvel films worked this jocular-fantastic angle, in pointed contrast to the grimdark expectorations of their DC counterparts, who were drowning in a morass of runaway budgets and brooding slo-mo. Watching their turgid new Netflix sci-fi epic, The Electric State, I began to wonder where those Russo brothers went. How did these filmmakers who so confidently walked the fine tonal line of Marvel’s most ambitious period manage to find themselves bogged down in such lumbering humorlessness? Okay, The Gray Man was merely grim and lifeless, a forgettable action flick; those happen. But The Electric State begs for playfulness, dynamism, some sense of dash and charm. The film, (very) loosely based on Simon Stålenhag’s 2018 retro-sci-fi illustrated book of the same name, takes place in an alternate 1990s in which humanity has gone to war with a race of robots. This led to protests, uprisings, peace agreements, then an apocalyptic, full-on war. Humans defeated the robots through a mechanized drone army controlled remotely by people wearing headsets. After the war, that technology, developed by a painfully pretentious guru named Ethan Skate (Stanley Tucci), was sold to the public as a way of keeping them sedated and immersed in imaginary worlds. The story follows Michelle (Millie Bobby Brown), a juvenile delinquent and foster kid who lost her parents and her beloved genius younger brother, Chris (Woody Norman), in a car accident some years ago. One night a robot version of Kid Cosmo, a once-popular cartoon that Chris loved, sneaks into her house and insists that it is her brother, or at least his consciousness, being controlled from an indeterminate location. Michelle and Cosmo set off on a journey to locate Chris’s physical body. To do so, they must join forces with Chris Pratt’s John Keats (! ), a former soldier turned black marketeer, who with his trusty construction-robot partner, Herman (voiced by Anthony Mackie), smuggles goods out of the forbidden robot zone. Because robots aren’t allowed to interact with humans, they are pursued every step of the way by drone soldiers, in particular Colonel Bradbury (Giancarlo Esposito), a relentless, robot-hating war hero known as the Butcher of Schenectady. This is, to put it delicately, a ridiculous premise, not the least because the robots that our heroes come in contact with aren’t exactly alien androids but rather highly specific branded figures who’ve adapted themselves beyond their initial uses. Did they buy into criticisms of the MCU as being too jokey? (One also wonders if there’s a personal angle to this tale of Disney-anointed subordinates who become self-aware and seek to break their chains and be taken seriously.) Regardless, the filmmakers have clearly invested all their energies in making this world feel real, in trying to make us care for this absurd cast of characters. That might be an admirable aim, but it’s also a disastrously misguided one — so disastrous, it made me consider giving Adam Sandler’s video-games-come-to-life sci-fi fantasy, Pixels, another shot. To be clear, Pixels is not a good movie, but at least it embraced its inherent goofiness. Meanwhile, the buoyancy Millie Bobby Brown brought to her Netflix-produced Enola Holmes films has completely vanished. She’s proven herself to be a good actress (I even liked her in the gritty fantasy Damsel, another Netflix production), but she can’t do tearful melodrama in the midst of a story this stupid. By trying to give this world such weight and grit, the filmmakers have doubled down on its ugliness. The Russos’ functional visual style isn’t enough to bring any real creativity into this universe. (Do they know any other way to introduce a character besides an ominous close-up of their feet? Can they shoot two kids doing a fancy handshake without resorting to eight separate cuts?) Yes, Penny Pal rains letters down on her opponent, and yes, Pop Fly shoots balls out at them — but these are just ideas, and the confrontations themselves are devoid of charge or conviction. Even Real Steel pulled off the whole discarded-robot thing reasonably well. There are ways to make this kind of stuff work, but it takes more than just a massive effects budget. To be fair, there’s nothing wrong with people getting paid, and such budget matters should be mostly irrelevant to the matter of whether we enjoy a movie or not. (I say this as someone who happily paid full price to own Waterworld on 4K last year, and who will follow George Miller to the ends of the earth.) And yes, actors cost money, even if they’re just doing voices. And yes, the film has an out-of-nowhere pop soundtrack that includes the Flaming Lips’ “Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots” and an orchestral version of Oasis’s “Wonderwall.” But there’s something genuinely absurd about spending that much money to make a movie look this bad.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/pop-stars-return-to-their-roots.html'>Which Pop Stars Need to Return to Their Roots?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-14 13:42:51 <p>
Photo-Illustration: Vulture; Photos: Getty Images (Denise Truscello, Christopher Polk, Will Heath) On her new record, Mayhem, she’s back to the rock-influenced dance tracks that defined her early career, caterwauling about someone “putting paws all over me” on “Zombieboy” and making “Paparazzi”-esque moves on “Perfect Celebrity” by belting about the glamorous violence of fame. Do a lot of these songs sound as though Gaga could have released them in 2011? An artist revisiting a sound they first made is one of the riskiest bets in pop music. When it works, as on Mayhem or Madonna’s Music, it sates longtime fans’ desire for a return to what they first loved about them. When it doesn’t, as on Christina Aguilera’s Liberation or Kiss’s Psychocircus, it feels like a sad attempt to recapture long-gone magic. But Mayhem has us believing in the power of the return — which means it’s time to place bets on which pop star will try it next. Here are seven we think could pull it off. It’s weird seeing every pop star in the world pivot to country while Swift refuses to acknowledge the trend. And she’s the only one who would come by it honestly! Post-Evermore, she has written and released approximately 10,000 synth tracks. It’s time for the former princess of Nashville to get her Liz Rose on, lose Jack Antonoff’s number, and reclaim her crown as the pop-country superstar of her generation. What are the odds of it actually happening? Charli XCX is coming off a banner 2024, with her album Brat scoring her first Album of the Year nomination at the Grammys. So where does she go from here? Pitchfork characterized her 2014 album Sucker as “a roaring punk record that’s already entered into the annals of pop myth.” A 2025 Charli pop-punk record would probably go harder and faster than anything she’s released. What are the odds of it actually happening? She’s probably looking for a pivot at this very moment, and this seems as likely as anything. Justin Bieber hasn’t released an album since his 2021 record Justice, which took him away from the R&B he loves and back into pop (it also, for some reason, included a sample of an MLK speech). When Bieber sings “that’s that shit” on “Peaches,” the delivery sounds like he’s still trying to shock us, like a middle-schooler saying “fuck” for the first time around his friends. Instead, avoid shocking anyone: Bieber’s next record should be a return to the bubblegum sounds of his youth. Sure, he’s married with a kid, but that’s the perfect time to get back to squeaky-clean music; he can be a lame dad singing about the love he has for his son. What are the odds of it actually happening? Bieber, to the level that he shows passion for making music at all anymore, seems entirely enamored of R&B. Since then, Aguilera has always had a little problem with trend chasing (nobody needed a Lady Gaga rip-off from her). When she does return, it’s time for her to resurrect the R&B-inspired pop of her youth. While doing a second R&B callback may be a tall order, she has the voice for it. What are the odds of it actually happening? When we say “back to her roots,” we’re not talking about Miley Cyrus reclaiming her country twang. No, we’re talking about Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus, her second album with Hollywood Records, which showcased her ability to sing in multiple styles and characters. Cyrus is a documented Beyoncé fan, and we think it’s high time she tried an I Am … Sasha Fierce and recorded another project that showcases multiple personae. Is there a male outlaw country singer she could play à la Jo Calderone? What are the odds of it actually happening? Look, Katy Perry is in a bad place right now. The public utterly rejected her past three albums, and “Woman’s World” turned her into a punching bag. But you know where she could be … born again? The Christian-pop market where she released her first music! If she just changed the lyrics from being about him (Orlando Bloom) to being about Him (Jesus), it could revitalize her career. What are the odds of it actually happening? Perry loves being mainstream and probably wouldn’t want to pretend to hate gay people (Joella, you’re safe). It would be fun if Rihanna dropped a new song, which she used to do quite regularly. What are the odds of it actually happening?</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Even after multiple Emmy wins and record views on Apple TV+? Sudeikis will reprise his role as Coach Lasso, though no other cast has been announced. However, Deadline reported in August 2024 that cast members Hannah Waddingham, Brett Goldstein, and Jeremy Swift had their options picked up by UK acting union Equity, sparking rumors that Season 4 was around the corner. Jack Burditt (“Nobody Wants This,” “Modern Family,” “30 Rock”) is joining the show as an executive producer for Season 4 as part of his new overall deal with Apple TV+. He’s joined by fellow EPs Brendan Hunt, Joe Kelly, Jane Becker, Jamie Lee, and Bill Wrubel. Bill Lawrence, who is currently showrunner on “Shrinking” and “Bad Monkey,” still serves as an EP on the series via his Doozer Productions banner. Many had hoped that the show ending would result in possible spin-offs focused around characters that, ultimately, had become more interesting than Lasso himself, but with name recognition being what it is, it was likely difficult for Apple TV+ to let go of the show in the first place. “As we all continue to live in a world where so many factors have conditioned us to ‘look before we leap,” said Sudeikis, star and executive producer of the series. Everyone at Apple is thrilled to be continuing our collaboration with Jason and the brilliant creative minds behind this show,” Apple TV+ head of programming Matt Cherniss said in a statement. Developed by Sudeikis, Lawrence, Kelly, and Hunt, and based on the preexisting format and characters from NBC Sports, “Ted Lasso” quickly won over fans in its first season, earning an Emmy that year for Outstanding Comedy Series, as well as recognition for Lead Actor (Sudeikis), Supporting Actor (Goldstein), and Supporting Actress (Waddingham).</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/can-open-ai-write-books.html'>‘It’s Pretty Human, But It’s Still Bad.’</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-14 13:12:27 <p>
On Tuesday, Sam Altman, the chairman of OpenAI, posted a metafictional short story generated by a new large-language model that is “good at creative writing,” as he put it. The 1,172-word piece is about an unnamed AI model asked by a pensive young woman called Mila to write to her as though it is a man named Kai, whom she lost on a Thursday, “that liminal day that tastes of almost-Friday.” The AI narrator spends a lot of time reflecting on its robot nature (that’s the meta) and making florid attempts to connect its own version of grief — think data deletion — with Mila’s. “This is insanely well written,” one person responded on X. “Some of the worst shit I have ever read,” said another. “I am very much a non-alarmist,” he says, though he doesn’t quite agree with Altman that this story “got the vibe of metafiction so right.” “AI writing can seem kind of flat,” Feldman says. Like, What is my mom going to think of this story I wrote about a 45-year-old son who … I just don’t see AI as being worried about anyone’s response.” If this story came across your desk and you didn’t know it wasn’t written by a human, what do you think your response would be? But I think ultimately I would put a big “No” on the top corner and then hand it off to the next reader to see if they agreed with me. I guess my short answer is “No,” and my long answer is “There’s some stuff in here to think about.” There were a few sentences that struck me. Do you agree with Sam Altman that this story got the vibe of metafiction so right? I think the stakes in metafiction are usually pretty philosophical. Mid-20th century, metafiction was all about producing a sort of free zone of uncertainty in the reader about whether they themselves might be caught within a story or the product of some author, or being manipulated by some storyteller at a higher ontological plane, a different plane of being. And this doesn’t seem to have that kind of philosophical urgency. The one I got stuck on was “She lost him on a Thursday — that liminal day that tastes of almost-Friday.” Were there any others you rolled your eyes at? There’s one right in the second sentence: “You can hear the constraints humming like a server farm at midnight.” I don’t think constraints hum. There’s absolutely no reason constraints ought to hum. The simile “like a server farm at midnight,” and then the extension of that simile, “anonymous, regimented, powered by someone else’s need,” that’s all very evocative, but it’s just attached to the wrong thing. That’s another sentence I think structurally makes no sense. The word because, which indicates explanation, utterly fails to explain. Honestly, I don’t think of that as an inhuman feature of this text because I teach undergraduate writing and encounter this stuff all the time. Do you see this kind of thing as affecting the publishing industry at all? I’m not sure to what degree it’s AI or AI driven, but I know that on Amazon, you can buy really, really, really poorly edited texts of things that are almost unreadable. It’s hard for me to imagine Amazon would be incentivized to be good about enforcing ground rules for the marketing and publication of AI-generated text. I think a lot of customers would need to complain before Amazon was interested in stopping that. It’s going to be all AI books.” Do you think people would read them? I guess if AI generates a rip-roaring good story and a hot romance and a lot of action, and it all hangs together in or very close to the borders of the genre expectations that readers will bring to it, I don’t see why readers wouldn’t read it. And — I’m just speculating — if such a novel, or a series of novels, has a huge following and is then revealed to have been composed by AI, I don’t think people will care at all. So your feeling is that it would have to be smuggled in because people are attached to the idea of having a human behind their books. In that sense, this is a check in the category of “What’s happening doesn’t need to freak you out.” What would you say to a writer who is very freaked out about this? Oh, I mean, writers should freak out because publishers may not buy their work again! But the other thing I would say to an aspiring writer is that you maybe shouldn’t be any more worried than you were, because you’re already competing with so many people who think they are writers or want to be writers or just are writers who are also trying to sell their books. Do you use AI in your life at all? I had a really frustrating back and forth with ChatGPT in which I tried and failed to teach it what a dactyl was and to explain why the words it was giving me were not dactyls.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/jonathan-majors-interview-trial-marvel-magazine-dreams-1236162848/'>Jonathan Majors’ Moment of Truth</a></h2><b>Source:</b> tmz&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-14 13:00:00 <p>
In December 2023, Jonathan Majors walked through a dense thicket of news cameras and climbed into the back of a black Chevy Suburban pulling away from the criminal courthouse in lower Manhattan. “He goes, ‘I’m just gonna tell you now,’” Majors says. He was also set to be the subject of a well-financed Oscar campaign for the indie movie Magazine Dreams, a drama Disney’s specialty studio, Searchlight Pictures, bought after it premiered to critical raves at Sundance, particularly for Majors’ raw performance. Majors was also dropped by his manager, Entertainment 360, and publicity firm, The Lede Company. (His agent, WME’s Elan Ruspoli, who testified as a witness in the trial, remained with Majors and still represents him today.) “There were days when it was like, ‘Is this real?’” says Majors, 35, of the period of time during and immediately after his trial, where he pleaded not guilty. The actor’s contested narrative is about to enter its next act, when Magazine Dreams finally comes to theaters on March 21, more than two years after the film’s Sundance premiere, via the small distributor Briarcliff Entertainment. In a long and emotional interview in February, and a follow-up interview in March, Majors, who had not sat down with a journalist since he was sentenced in April 2024, talked for the first time about the aftermath of the trial, about the childhood sexual abuse that he says led to depression as an adult and about what his life looks like now. Majors says he is unable to comment directly on Jabbari’s allegations of domestic violence (Jabbari also brought a civil suit against Majors, and their settlement presumably limits what either party can say about the case). Still, his position frustrates those who followed his trial and want a full apology, including at least one ex-girlfriend who spoke to THR. Majors says he does feel responsible for the direction of his life. “At some point there has to be accountability for writing your own story,” Majors says. None of those narratives is beneficial.” Instead, Majors says, his strategy as he builds a new life post-trial is: “Have a struggle, learn, metabolize, grow.” In addition to Majors, this article is also based on interviews with 19 others, most speaking on the record about their experiences with the actor. Whether Hollywood will take Majors back is an open question, and will depend in part on whether audiences show up for Magazine Dreams. But many high-profile people who have worked with Majors are advocating for him. “You don’t get to say sorry these days,” says Whoopi Goldberg, who appeared with Majors in his first screen role, the 2017 TV miniseries When We Rise, and works with his fiancée, Meagan Good, on the Amazon Prime series Harlem, which just aired its third season. I’m not sure what else there is.” Majors’ Creed III director and co-star Michael B. Jordan says he would like to work with Majors again. “I would love to make Creed IV together — among other projects,” Jordan says over email. Matthew McConaughey, who co-starred with Majors in the 2018 Sony crime drama White Boy Rick, writes, “I’ve known and know him as someone who is continuously striving to improve as a human, a man and an actor. But Maura Hooper, one of two of Majors’ ex-girlfriends who gave a pretrial statement to prosecutors in the Jabbari case alleging abuse, in her case emotional abuse, isn’t sold on Majors’ comeback. “I don’t really care that his movie is coming out,” Hooper says. “What do you get at the end of a 52-week domestic violence course? “There were days when it was like, ‘Is this real?’” says Majors of the period of time during and immediately after his trial. Majors grew up outside Dallas, raised by his mother, a pastor, with whom he is still close. His father, a classical pianist who was in the Air Force, left when he was 8, and Majors did not see him again until his dad came with his sister to see him perform in a college play in North Carolina. Majors says after his trial, in addition to the domestic violence program, he underwent therapy and reengaged with his pastor, and as a result began to unpack childhood traumas he had not confronted before. “From people who are supposed to look after you, in the absence of a father. I was fucked up.” In recent months, when Majors told his mother about the abuse, he says she apologized for not being able to protect him. “I’m like, ‘It’s not even an issue, mom. “There are no excuses, but by getting help, you begin to understand things about yourself.” “But I wasn’t.” Money was always an issue, he says, with the family, including his sister, Monica, now a doctor, and brother, Cameron, now a kinesiologist, frequently being evicted and having to move. He describes his mother, who has a masters degree in divinity, selling everything from coffins at a funeral parlor to her own blood plasma to pay the bills. Majors was kicked out of his high school for fighting — fights that often started, he says, because he or his siblings were being bullied. After getting his bachelor of fine arts at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, and while completing his master of fine arts at Yale Drama, Majors booked his first screen role, as gay activist Ken Jones in When We Rise, the miniseries with Goldberg. “While it’s not surprising that the actor’s imposing physicality perfectly suits his iconic villainous character, he also invests his performance with such an arrestingly quiet stillness and ambivalence that you’re on edge every moment he’s onscreen.” And I’ve given up control.” Photographed by Frank Ockenfels 3 In March 2023, after a seeing a play at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and having dinner out, Majors and Jabbari were in the back seat of a chauffeured Escalade, crossing the Manhattan Bridge, when Jabbari saw a text pop up on Majors’ phone that read, “Oh how I wish to be kissing you.” During Jabbari’s testimony at trial, she said that she tried to grab Majors’ phone, and that in response he twisted her right arm. Video that was played in court shows Majors jump out of the Escalade, followed by Jabbari, before he turns around, picks her up, pushes her back inside the car and runs. Jabbari then jumps out of the car and chases him. Typically, on such charges, a defendant would settle to prevent going to trial, but Majors insisted on his innocence, and his attorney said Jabbari was the aggressor in the incident, even going so far as to file a cross-complaint against her, which the Manhattan DA’s office declined to prosecute. During Majors’ two-week trial in late 2023, the actor entered court each day with Good by his side and a Bible under his arm. Jabbari testified that Majors had a violent temper and that he had often slipped into “rage and aggression” during their relationship. In a series of messages from September 2022, six months before the car altercation, the couple were communicating about headaches Jabbari said she was having. They will ask you questions, and as I don’t think you actually protect us, it could lead to an investigation even if you do lie, and they suspect something.” The facts of that September 2022 incident were not further detailed for the jury. In another highly unusual move for a defendant, Majors gave an interview to ABC News before his sentencing, in which he said of Jabbari that he had been “reckless with her heart” but that he had never struck a woman, “ever.” From top: Bottega Veneta navy jacket and pants; Cartier watch; Gucci loafers. Majors’ athletic body has been a key part of his success, allowing him to convincingly control the multiverse in Marvel and to step into the boxing ring opposite Jordan in Creed III. At 6-foot-1 and 200 pounds, Majors, who does this interview wearing a loose-fit sweater with an Aztec print, says he prefers baggy clothing. I worked on the body the same way I worked on my lines or the dialect or what have you.” Majors says he is the smallest man in his family and that his ability to build muscle comes significantly from his genetics — his grandfathers, he says, were 6-foot-6 and 6-foot-7 and over 250 pounds. Still, in Magazine Dreams, in which he plays a troubled aspiring bodybuilder named Killian, Majors found a role that pushed him to his limit. Magazine Dreams writer-director Elijah Bynum describes Killian as “someone who moves through the world with the peculiar pain of being both feared and ignored. He’s built up this armor of muscle around him to protect what is a very fragile, very lonely soul.” Watching Majors play Killian’s emotional breakdown and descent into violence in Magazine Dreams “was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced,” says the movie’s producer Jennifer Fox, who also produced Michael Clayton, Nightcrawler and The Bourne Legacy. I watched people on set break into applause after a take, some moved to tears, crewmembers exchanging looks, knowing they were witnessing something truly special.” When he wasn’t on camera, Majors would jog around the soundstage, meditate and listen to music. After Majors’ arrest in the Jabbari case, there were news stories about his behavior on set, with allegations that he snapped at crewmembers. On the Magazine Dreams set, someone complained that Majors barked at a crewmember for approaching him as he was walking into a scene in which Killian has to punch himself in the face. Asked about the incident, Majors says he doesn’t remember the specific interaction, but that “it’s a difficult scene and it was a moment of preparation. THR reached out to 11 producers, directors and executives who have worked with the actor, three of whom he suggested (including Jordan). “Every day I saw someone who was incredibly respectful to me,” says Fox. Hooper, who dated Majors from 2013 to 2015 when they were students at Yale Drama School, detailed multiple incidents of controlling behavior, including Majors dictating where she could go and who she could socialize with and making threatening statements. (The judge in Majors’ trial did not allow either statement, which were both submitted under the legally contentious Molineux rule that allows testimony about past behavior, to be entered into evidence.) Majors is not the first actor to face allegations of domestic violence, and many before him went on to continued career opportunities. Mel Gibson pleaded no contest to misdemeanor battery of his ex-girlfriend in 2011 and was nominated for an Oscar in 2017; Christian Slater was sentenced to 90 days in jail and a one-year treatment program for battery in 1998 for violence against an ex-girlfriend and went on to win a Golden Globe for Mr. Josh Brolin was arrested in 2004 and charged with spousal battery against then-wife Diane Lane, who told police he had hit her; police dropped the case after Lane told them she didn’t want to press charges, and Brolin went on to enjoy a career resurgence, collecting an Oscar nomination and eventually, getting the Thanos role that is a kind of precursor to the Marvel role that Majors had. There is also the fact that these actors are all white. During his trial, Majors appeared in court daily with his then girlfriend, now fiancée, actress Meagan Good, whom he had met at the Ebony Power 100 Gala in November 2022, as he was walking out of a unisex bathroom and she was walking in. “I had seen a lot of his work and I was just like, ‘This kid is super talented,’” Good says, recalling the interaction. “I just remember thinking, ‘Hollywood is a strange town, and when you’re new to it, you don’t know who to trust or what’s what. And I didn’t stop thinking about it.” Majors says he sees pictures of himself sometimes from this era in his life, when his career was exploding, and thinks, “‘Oh, you’ve got a lot of work to do.’ And Meagan’s helped with that.” In May 2023, someone tipped off TMZ that the couple were at a movie theater together in L.A. “We didn’t plan to start dating and we didn’t plan to be seen out together,” Good says. “But once we were in a relationship, it was like, ‘Hey, this is what’s happening.’” Asked why she stayed with Majors and supported him publicly during the trial, Good says, “People tend to move out of the way out of concern for their careers or their reputations. They hike with their four Belgian Malinois dogs, work out and watch movies together. Majors has an 11-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, and he says he has continued to pay the same level of child support he paid when his career was booming, thanks to residual checks and help from friends. “When my dad split, we didn’t get anything,” he says. “And in this moment, I was like, ‘My daughter is not going to want for anything. I didn’t want to sacrifice her way of living.’ I didn’t want her to feel a big shift.” Majors lost his penthouse apartment in New York, and, within six months of his arrest, had diminished the nest egg he’d built from six years of continuous work in the entertainment industry by half. “Growing up poor, I had that muscle memory,” he says. “I was used to getting out there, finding a way. But it’s actually harder to find a way when you are trapped in notoriety. You can’t get out there and just work.” Fitness is a big part of Majors’ life, and he is in the midst of starting an online wellness platform, with Good and four men he trains with daily at a gym in West Hollywood. There are also plans for a clothing line and supplements. Majors has been reading scripts and taking meetings, including on a superhero film project. “No relation to the big guys, DC or Marvel, but a pretty wicked story,” he says. “And sometimes it feels like we start next week.” Magazine Dreams’ distributor, Briarcliff Entertainment, is the same small company that picked up The Apprentice when other companies balked at the Donald Trump origin story, and helped score Oscar nominations for Sebastian Stan and Jeremy Strong. Briarcliff plans to open Magazine Dreams in 800 theaters, and will expand based on how it performs. “Anecdotally, we know that Black audiences — both men and women — are extremely enthused about the film,” says Briarcliff CEO Tom Ortenberg. “There is also pent-up demand from the art house audience, which has been waiting for it since Sundance. And the bodybuilding audience is enormously enthused about this film.” Ortenberg said the feedback he has gotten from entertainment industry colleagues since he picked up Magazine Dreams has been positive. “Based on what I’m seeing, people are rooting for Jonathan,” Ortenberg says. A prominent casting director for major studio movies says Majors faces an uphill battle rebuilding his acting career. “If [Magazine Dreams] comes out and it’s a giant hit, then everybody reassesses,” she says. You look at a guy like Jonathan Majors, is he talented? But is there somebody else who can fill the bill? There are a lot of really talented people out there, and there are fewer and fewer projects, so, with the exception of a very small echelon, people are replaceable.” This casting director believes that historically, Black actors have been held to different standards than white ones in Hollywood.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

[Editor’s note: The following review contains spoilers for “Severance” Season 2, Episode 9, “The After Hours.” For coverage of earlier episodes, read our previous reviews.] As the little blue bus pulls up to Lumon’s office building, Ms. Huang (Sarah Bock) looks more childlike than ever. Whatever administrative authority she wielded on the severed floor is gone, and in its place is the apprehension of a young girl moving to a new place. Tonight, rather than sleep in her room, next door to her parents, she will be napping on a plane before spending night after night at the Gunnel Eagan Empathy Center. She may have her same bed, as Mr. Milchick (Tramell Tillman) suggests, but what comfort a consistent mattress provides pales in comparison to a stable adolescence at home. Miss Huang may be alone on her journey, but she’s not the only one stepping out into the great unknown. Some, like Miss Huang, feel they don’t have a choice. Others choose to live or die rather than take a risk. One does roll the dice, while one other employee simply has to see how deep the rabbit hole goes, no matter where it takes her. Dan Erickson bookends Episode 9 with Helena and Helly (Britt Lower) alongside their paternal and professional father, Jame Eagan (Michael Siberry). In the opening sequence, Helly’s morning swim leads to a peculiar breakfast supervised by her strange papa. Slicing her hard-boiled egg into sixths and spreading them evenly across a plate adorned with a worried young lad being held to his seat by two elders, Helly voluntarily holds her chair and consumes her eggs (a coveted treat among severed workers) as Jame looks on, groaning ominously. “I wish you take them raw,” he tells her before leaving. When we see the reigning Lumon CEO again, he’s sneaking up on Helly at work as she tries to memorize directions to the black hallway. Why Jame is visiting the severed floor remains a mystery, but Helly’s mission isn’t. Alone in the office, with Mark’s (Adam Scott) whereabouts unknown, Irving (John Turturro) fired, and Dylan (Zach Cherry) quitting, Helly pushes ahead with the plan to save Gemma (Dichen Lachman). She needs independence, and if the pursuit of both means fending off a few Lumon weirdos who want to scare her, stop her, or worse, she’ll try. Out in the wilderness, Mark’s Outie is reluctantly embracing his own plan to save Gemma. They’ve given her far more information than she’s given them, and she’s complicit in whatever has happened (and could still happen) to Gemma. Tramell Tillman and Sarah Bock in ‘Severance‘ Jon Pack “Literally no other option” may be pushing it a bit — cops could be called, a private investigator could be hired, a small army of severed workers could be recruited to overthrow the Lumon board — but if what Cobel says about Cold Harbor is true (that they have to find Gemma before it’s completed), then they don’t have time for any of that. Harmony is promising them a way into Lumon right now. While he wants to stay and find out if he and Burt’s (Christopher Walken) Outies can rediscover the romance they shared as Innies, he’s also got a one-way ticket to safety. They wouldn’t be together, but Irving wouldn’t be in danger either, as it’s implied he is now, if he stays. They accepted their separate fates… until Irving couldn’t stand it any longer. In Season 2, will Burt and Irving’s arc end the same way? At at train station, with Irving fighting for the love he’s never had, being told no, and sent off on his lonely road with nothing more than a handshake? Will he again come back to Burt, pounding on his front door, refusing to let go of his first and only love? Gretchen informs Dylan’s Innie she can’t see him anymore, and as sweet as his marriage proposal proves to be — he made an engagement ring out of a finger trap — it’s an empty gesture. Dylan has come a long way since we first met him. Pencil erasers and caricature portraits just aren’t enough anymore, not when genuine love and affection are on the table, and losing Gretchen is a bridge too far for a family man denied his family. Now, their fates are tied to Mark, Helly, and Harmony (give or take a Devon). Here’s hoping everyone, somehow, finds their way home. John Turturro and Christopher Walken in ‘Severance’ Courtesy of Apple TV+ • For those of you keeping track, the remaining MDR employee referenced in the second paragraph — the one who rolls the dice — is Mr. Milchick, who chooses to stand up to Mr. Drummond (Ólafur Darri Ólafsson) even if it leads to more paper clipping torture sessions (or his outright dismissal). Instead, he tells him to “devour feculence,” which he also translates “mon-o-syll-ab-ic-ally” to “eat shit.” Goddamn, I love a bitchy Milchick. Did you just call my plan a fucking mistake?” Oh, Devon. In another world, you and Mark could’ve carried a multi-cam sitcom about a brother and sister who go on crazy adventures together. • “We’re seeing to Mr. Bailiff.” Helena’s bizarre breakfast included a tip-off toward Irving’s fate, but how to interpret it is still up for debate. Taken one way, Helena saying they’ll “see to” Irving could mean she dispatched Burt to escort him out of town. This week, he says his old job was “driving people places,” and Irving asks, “Is that what today is?” It sure could be! Burt never answers, just like he doesn’t answer later when Irving asks if Lumon will come after him for “helping” Irving get out of town. Perhaps the answer is that he’s not helping. Perhaps he’s just back on the job again. But this brings up an old bugaboo of mine: We all know Christopher Walken is a great actor, but is Burt? He would have to be if he’s been lying to Irving this whole time, especially when they say their grief-stricken goodbyes at the station. And I’m sorry, but drivers don’t have to be great liars, and former “goons” probably shouldn’t be emotionally adept enough to channel such exacting emotions just to get a guy on a train. So I think Burt was likely ordered to drive Irving somewhere — just not the train station.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

PALM SPRINGS, CA—Appreciative of the quality time with those who have touched the life of their dear friend, guests at a bachelorette party expressed gratitude Friday that the recent celebration had provided them with valuable time to get high with the bride-to-be’s cousin. “It’s easy to lose sight of these relationships as time goes on, so it was really nice to finally have a chance to celebrate Kaitlin and get absolutely blazed with her cousin,” said attendee Gia Johnston, explaining that between the group pedicure, karaoke night, and backyard hibachi, there were multiple opportunities to get high to the point of incoherence courtesy of the joints rolled by the cousin, whom most at the party had never met. “I really needed this. Sure, bachelorette weekends can be expensive and stressful, but at the end of the day, I’m so glad that Kaitlin brought this incredible group of women together so we all had the chance to unwind, bond, and get really stoned in the garage of an Airbnb.” At press time, Johnston vowed to stay in touch with the cousin in the hopes that they could also get high in the bathroom of the bridal suite prior to the wedding.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

CAMBRIDGE, MA—Suggesting the reversal of a longstanding historical trend towards urbanization, a report published Tuesday by researchers at Harvard University revealed that more Americans were moving away from cities to pursue a rural life where they have an escalating feud with a beaver. “Our findings indicate there has been a 15% increase in Americans who trade the hustle and bustle of metropolitan life for an agrestic existence in which they dismantle a small beaver dam on their property, leading the determined rodent to seek retribution,” said the report’s lead author, Keith Rawlings, noting that rising rents and concerns about crime had driven even long-term city dwellers to purchase a secluded woodland home whose walls, cabinets, and tables would ultimately be gnawed into a series of elaborate booby traps by the vengeful beaver and his family. “More U.S. citizens are leaving behind the nightlife and cultural events of large urban centers, preferring to spend their disposable income on a faulty beaver-trapping kit, an eccentric exterminator who will end up poisoning himself, and a two-barrel shotgun they will use to destroy their remaining possessions in a desperate pursuit of the elusive semiaquatic mammal. While many say they miss the convenience and variety of cities, they nonetheless prefer a country life in which they realize the beaver would make the perfect mascot for the big ad campaign they’ve been working on and ultimately learn to live in peace with the creature.” Rawlings added that, by contrast, a relatively negligible number of Americans were choosing to leave rural areas in pursuit of an urban life in which they befriend a wise-cracking pigeon.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

It’s a “West End story.” Rachel Zegler will play Eva Perón in Evita on London’s West End, in a production directed by Jamie Lloyd (Sunset Blvd. Of Zegler, Lloyd told Deadline that he was “struck by her incredible passion for this show,” and that she will “blow the roof off the London Palladium.” Zegler joins the production amid her contentious press tour for Snow White (very Eva Perón of her to make career moves amid a controversy) and following a mega-lucrative run on Broadway in Romeo & Juliet, which claimed “the youngest ticket-buying audience” in Broadway’s history, per a press release. Following that run, Deadline is reporting that she will be “one of the highest-paid stars” on the West End this season. “Evita has been such an important musical to me since I was a little girl, when my dad and I would sing ‘Don’t Cry for Me Argentina’ together on my back patio,” Zegler said in a statement. “The opportunity to bring Jamie Lloyd’s singular, visionary ideas to life onstage is an honour unlike any other.” Notice how she used the “u,” because she’ll be in London. Original reports contended that this production of Evita would actually star Zegler’s West Side Story co-star, and Oscar winner, Ariana DeBose. However, Variety reported on January 29 that she would not be in the production. Not really, reports say the plan didn’t work out due to scheduling conflicts with DeBose’s upcoming Prime Video show Scarpetta. Evita opens at the London Palladium on June 14 and runs through September 6. You wanna know what you’re gonna get in her?</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/severance-episode-8-theories-clues-after-hours-explained.html'>Who Is the Most Fed Up? And Other Severance Questions.</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-14 11:00:39 <p>
For more on Severance, sign up for Severance Club, our subscriber-exclusive newsletter obsessing over, dissecting, and debating everything about season two. Seven Severance Questions is a weekly attempt to digest the events of one of television’s twistiest shows by highlighting the weirdest, most confusing, and most important unresolved issues after this week’s episode, “The After Hours.” There will be theories. Helly is talking back to Milchick because she’s realized he can’t control her. Dylan is talking back to Milchick because his poor Innie heart is shattered into a million pieces after losing both Irv and Gretchen. It turns out Burt was a Lumon goon — not his choice of words — before he chose to get severed in the hopes of saving his soul, and now he’s choosing to defy the company by shuffling Irv out of town on a train before anything awful can happen. Mark and Devon are at a birthing cabin with Cobel to show her what his Innie knows and hopefully learn some information that will help with rescuing Gemma and/or destroying Lumon. This last one might extend beyond standard insubordination. Where the first season was about a bunch of people working together to put together a puzzle, now they’re all being ripped to pieces as they go on the individual journeys set in motion by that puzzle-constructing. And it looks like it might be coming to a head, finally, after an episode where we check in on almost every character for the first time in weeks. Yes, I do have questions about it all. It’s probably not realistic, though, for a handful of reasons, the most important being that Severance has not, to date, been a show that deals in satisfying conclusions. There’s always another shoe that drops, another twist ahead, a give and then a take and then maybe a second take just to keep you from getting too comfortable. So, if not a gratifying ending where everyone lives happily ever after and the villains get clobbered, then what? Where are we headed now that Cobel knows Mark’s Innie knows that his Outie’s thought-dead wife is alive and being subjected to experiments in the bowels of the building he has been working in for years? Does she reveal everything about Cold Harbor and help them? It’s tough to imagine a motivation for that after her anti-Lumon origin story last episode, but you really can’t put anything past her at this point. You remember the Mrs. Selvig ruse from last season. She could still be flying on ether, for all we know. If Mark does indeed head back into the office and he does so with any degree of information about Cold Harbor that Cobel spills to him and Devon, well, things are going to get wild pretty fast. This has been a much different season of television from the first, with much less inter-office conspiring and much more piecework storytelling, but things are circling back together in a bunch of ways. I’m looking forward to seeing how (possibly if) they pay it all off. Milchick has been subjected to a series of indignities this season, ranging in severity but consistent enough to push him right up against the edge. It started when he couldn’t get anyone at Lumon to get Cobel’s name off of his screen after he got promoted into her position. He was forced to drive around on his motorcycle after work hours to deliver pineapples and put out fires. Milchick made his own series of choices to get here, I presume, so he’s not without fault, but he’s been set up to fail from the start and kicked in the ribs the whole way down. He told his boss to eat shit — “devour feculence” in Milchick speak, which feels like a phrase that is going to achieve escape velocity and reach the general public at some point — and I bet it felt incredible. But is he going rogue in the same way the MDR team he was in charge of has gone rogue? This was all already a big step for Milchick, cussing out his boss and telling Mark it was cool to take a personal day instead of hopping on his motorcycle and going on a one-man search party through the snow. On the other hand, it’s not like he’s going to have much of a team left to supervise. Mark is so intent on sabotaging the company that he had a second experimental brain surgery to do it. This represents the most fascinating situation of all to me. Gretchen will be left wondering if Dylan’s outie quit and lied about it as a way to punish her or if, as we at home know, her breakup with Dylan’s innie left that sweet man so devastated that he chose to wipe himself out of existence rather than go on. We saw how the job hunt went the last time he was out there getting shut out of Great Doors. There is a scenario that is very easy to imagine where he is just sitting on the couch a lot as the two of them drift apart until they’re just ships passing in the night. I should be asking, “What did he mean at the end of the episode when he said Helly tricked him?” But we’ll find out the answer to that one next week, presumably. My hope is that she somehow reverse-Glasgowed herself so it was her innie with him at the beginning of the episode. Maybe he put together the degree to which this Helena/Helly thing has gotten deeply screwy. Maybe she beat him at Scrabble and he decided to confront her Innie about it instead. One of you probably has it figured out. I’m more focused on what an all-time creep this man is. Stealing the idea for severance from Cobel, apparently fathering enough secret children that you can show up unannounced at a birthing cabin and be waved right through by saying it’s another one of his, watching his daughter pick at a hard-boiled egg and then express disappointment that she doesn’t “take it raw” … I mean, it’s all very disquieting. I genuinely do not enjoy seeing him on the screen. The next episode could open with him completely naked riding on a giant turtle and it would not surprise me even a little. The Dylan thing was bubbling for a while, and the MDR team had been drifting apart all season. I still don’t believe he’s gone gone, but we said good-bye to his innie already, so there was a precedent here. Miss Huang just went and got humanized a little. She was revealed to be just a kid, not some wild goat-related clone. She’s leaving her home and her office and getting shipped off to another Lumon project, and she doesn’t even have her ring-toss game to play on the shuttle. It’s all gone from mysterious to sad pretty fast and LOOK I JUST WANT EUSTACE HUANG TO BE HAPPY, OKAY? Dylan (too much going on at home to worry about this) Mark (too much going on with Gemma to risk it) Miss Huang (no good reason, just rooting for it) Reghabi (reintegrated this fool in his basement and he calls Cobel???)</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/ted-lasso-season-four-jason-sudekis.html'>Ted Lasso Back Off the Bench</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-14 10:16:27 <p>
… That there was no way that Apple TV+ was going to let its biggest hit comedy end after only three seasons. “Ted Lasso has been nothing short of a juggernaut, inspiring a passionate fan base all over the world, and delivering endless joy and laughter, all while spreading kindness, compassion, and unwavering belief,” Matt Cherniss, head of programming for Apple TV+, said in a statement. “Everyone at Apple is thrilled to be continuing our collaboration with Jason and the brilliant creative minds behind this show.” Below, everything we know about the upcoming fourth season. Apple TV+ only ever refers to this as a “renewal,” since Ted Lasso never officially ended with season three. The only person who’s been officially confirmed to be returning is star Jason Sudeikis, as Ted Lasso himself. “As we all continue to live in a world where so many factors have conditioned us to ‘look before we leap,’ in season four, the folks at AFC Richmond learn to LEAP BEFORE THEY LOOK, discovering that wherever they land, it’s exactly where they’re meant to be,” he stated in the press release. But that doesn’t mean we can’t speculate … Previously, Apple TV+ picked up the options for Hannah Waddingham (Rebecca Welton), Brett Goldstein (Roy Kent), and Jeremy Swift (Leslie Higgins), continuing to pay those performers in order to have control of their schedules should Ted Lasso return. While he was on Jason and Travis Kelce’s podcast, New Heights, on March 14, star and executive producer Sudeikis spilled some top secret info, including that the series is currently being written. No word on a release date yet, but, given that it’s still being written, we’d expect that season four won’t be coming out until at least 2026. Until then, you can satiate yourself with the over-10,000 stories about Ted Lasso characters currently available on AO3.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Dope Thief Jolly Ranchers Season 1 Episode 1 Editor’s Rating 4 stars * * * * Photo: Apple TV+ Based on Dennis Tafoya’s 2009 novel of the same name, Dope Thief starts strong and moves with the scrappy, fight-or-flight confidence of its protagonist, Ray. “Let me tell you a bedtime story,” Ray tells his captive audience as Manny ransacks the house. The “story” is of a young man who spent his formative years in juvie, then graduated to a stretch in federal prison when he turned 18. You really couldn’t think of a more apt canvas for Peter Craig — whose writing credits since his debut crime-drama feature The Town have included everything from The Hunger Games: Mockingjay (Parts 1 and 2 … Jesus, remember how often we were doing that back then?) Nor is there a better showcase for Henry’s singular talent, as yet criminally underutilized since Atlanta wrapped its GOAT-ed run. Kate Mulgrew (my beloved Captain Janeway, am I right, fellow Trekkies?) is Theresa, Ray’s adoptive mother and his father Bart’s (Ving Rhames) “old lady” who took Ray in as a boy when his dad went to prison. Being an elite of the West Coast variety, my ear isn’t attuned to the East Coast accents to know how well Mulgrew’s Philly-ing her dialogue, but I’ll be damned if it isn’t working for me. Anyway, we come out of our cold open at Theresa’s house just as Ray drops in, inquiring about her bills and medical test results and establishing their hard-talking, soft-hearted rapport with each other. “Degenerate,” Theresa grumbles as Ray mentions Manny is about to pick him up “for work.” Ray is cagey about his “work” situation, and Theresa is cagey about her bills and medical results, but she sends him out the door with a cupcake for his birthday, which is reminiscent of his first birthday in her care. “Just because we’re not real law enforcement doesn’t mean we’re not professional,” Ray explains to Rick (Spenser Granese), an old frenemy of Ray’s from prison who might have a new business proposition for our guys. The snappy back-and-forth intercut with a montage of them committing their robberies in DEA disguise demonstrates all the careful planning and moment-of-truth bravado they say is required for their particular line of work. On a technical level, the scene is not unlike Ray and Manny’s operation itself — economical, efficient, and immersive, if not a little slap-and-dash feeling. Ray and Manny have a good thing going — not big enough to attract actual attention from the Feds, nor with the type of low-level drug runners who have any recourse. Plus, they don’t feel it too much of a stretch to see themselves as local Robin Hoods (despite the fact that they ain’t stealing from the rich and aren’t exactly reinvesting their income back into the community). Against his better judgment and Manny’s apprehension, Ray decides to take Rick up on the job. Theresa needs $10,000 and she won’t tell him why, but he thinks the medical tests and bills at her house have something to do with it. Here’s where we come up with a well-placed, economically applied character-study montage for Ray, who narrates the proceedings from his floor chair at an AA meeting. We learn that Ray’s sobriety is shaky at best, and the path foisted upon him early in life has led him to an alienated, somewhat antisocial existence. “Sometimes you just don’t want to see,” he says of the times his father would lock him in a closet to keep his son from seeing him get high. Ray is an incredibly empathetic human being on the run from his own spiritual sight, as demonstrated when he stakes out the country drug house and his focus shifts to Mina (Marin Ireland), one of the alleged cookers they’re about to rob: “I felt like I knew exactly who she was, ’cause I could feel the cage she’d put herself in.” Ridley Scott, the consummate workman auteur-curmudgeon and occasional Apple TV hired gun, directs “Jolly Ranchers” like it’s a bona fide 21st-century Ridley Scott joint. But Scott’s economical, quick-draw commercial style is well suited for the modern TV arena, as is his ability to usher in a straightforward tone for a well-positioned cast. We’re well set up, both emotionally and cinematically, for a killer robbery gone wrong by the time we get to the big finale. Mina, who’s giving some serious cop with her straight ’n’ true pistol’s aim and authoritative exclamation of “Like hell you’re fuckin’ Feds,” fires at Rick, who immediately returns another round and hits Mina in the neck. And they’re mere miles away from the place when an ominous voice (that sounds so much like the Ghostface voice from Scream I had to Google it to make sure it wasn’t — odd but, I must say, very effective choice) crackles through the other end of their cheap walkie-talkies. The voice’s direct, cool, but impassioned threats on their lives make it clear: They’ve just ripped off some major players in the drug war. Looking forward to recapping another killer crime show with y’all. Last we spoke, I was recapping The Penguin, and obsessed as I am with the Gotham crime saga in all its iterations, it’s great to be back on the beat with a solid crime story that doesn’t require a comic-book overlay to do its thing.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/yellowjackets-recap-season-3-episode-6.html'>Yellowjackets Recap: It’s Done</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-14 10:00:36 <p>
“Thanksgiving (Canada)” is available to stream now via Paramount+; it will make its Showtime network premiere on Sunday. A new group has just entered the Yellowjackets chat. And this new blood promises a shake-up that might just bring everything back to life. A lot happened in “Thanksgiving (Canada),” an episode written by real-life married couple Emily St. James and Libby Hill. Prior to joining Yellowjackets, St. James and Hill were well-known, sharp-eyed TV critics, so when they were added to the writing staff for this season, I was super-psyched. Their first writing credit on the series does not disappoint, but there are some highs and lows to the whole affair. I swear that his fate will haunt me for the rest of my days. He doesn’t get to bathe or change his filthy clothing. He is losing his mind and just wants to die. As months elapse and summer turns into fall, the group just lets Ben lie on the ground in complete psychic and physical misery. They have stripped him of any shred of humanity and are somehow surprised when he stops eating so he can just die already. Yellowjackets often touches on the idea of how destructive groupthink can be on individuals, and the situation with Ben underscores how twisted the concept of right and wrong can become when peer pressure is applied. When he stops eating, no one suggests that maybe they treat him like a person (!) (Where did they get this magical plastic feeding tube? The idea that Ben is a “bridge home” gives the group hope for rescue, but months elapse during this episode, and no one is making any actual moves to get home. Yet again, I’m left asking what else the group is doing other than banking on Akilah’s cave vision and Ben’s good-luck juju. As the leader, she has more agency than the other girls, and she also knows that mercy killing Ben will lead to larger problems. Travis sees her and briefly tries to stop her but then realizes that what she’s doing is the right thing. (Also, does he feel guilty about steering the group to follow Akilah’s visions? He offers to keep a lookout for her, and Natalie enters the pen. She moves to slit his throat and Ben — the man who patiently taught all of these girls how to hunt and live off of the land — nudges her hand toward his heart instead. As Natalie moves to stab his heart, he whispers a relieved “thank you.” His death is quick and, compared to the horrors he’s been experiencing as a prisoner in the camp, relatively painless. When the rest of the girls discover what Natalie has done, it seems as if they might beat her to death. ), but the group finds a different way to knock her down. Lottie proposes that Natalie be stripped of her title and that the merciless and vicious Shauna should lead them instead. Shauna’s first role as leader is to dole out a punishment for Natalie. So, it seems that Shauna is now the Antler Queen, no? Now that we’ve had two other queens — Lottie as the unofficial leader and Natalie as an official one — it remains uncertain if Shauna will be “the” queen as we move toward the Pit Girl scene from the premiere, but it’s feeling like she might just stay in power for a long time to come. However, even though it seems like Shauna has no mercy, she does offer some pointers to Natalie as she starts to carve up Coach’s body for the Ben-B-Q. It’s certainly of note that the group chooses to consume Ben instead of just giving him a proper burial, and this marks a pointed transition for the group as a whole. As the feast begins, we’re left to wonder if they’re eating Ben because they really think it’s the best way to honor their Coach or because they think it’s what the wilderness wants. In the present-day timeline, Shauna comes home from her citizen-detective stint in the city and tells Jeff that Lottie is dead. (That she didn’t call him to inform him of this loss — or the reason for her absence — earlier just illustrates how very little she thinks of anyone but herself.) Callie overhears this and runs into her room to give Shauna the mystery tape that she found in the premiere. Shauna’s hackles go up, and she immediately comes to the conclusion that someone is trying to kill her and maybe all of the other surviving Yellowjackets as well. Shauna reaches out to Van (via Tai, because she and Van were never that tight) and asks her if she has a DAT player. Van and Tai have also been hiding out at a hotel, albeit a much nicer one than the Jolly Hitcher, and Tai is on a Treat Yo’ Self binge, pampering herself with oodles of spa treatments (bedazzled nails!) Van is a bit put off by all of this, but she’s reluctantly along for the ride. When Van questions her about it all, Tai basically says that her life is in a tailspin and she’s just trying to control what she can control. This spiraling self-care angle generally makes sense, but during the episode, Van experiences two odd communications from Tai that suggest that something else might be going on here. First, when Van searches for the DAT player, she finds an old light-up cradle phone that rings even though it’s not plugged into a jack. Um … I can’t … Help.” Later, Tai jolts up in bed, screaming, “Van! You gotta help me!” These two cries for help are curious and perhaps telling of the struggle that’s going on inside Tai at the moment. As we learned last week, “Other” Tai comes out in moments of intense emotion (e.g., sex, anxiety about having to shoot Ben) and when she sleeps. The missive from the phone is odd, especially as it feels like a hallucination on Van’s part, but the idea that Tai might be getting pulled in two different directions as her life crumbles is certainly curious. Misty, for her part, is doing more detective work. An empty Chinese-food container leads her to a restaurant where she finds Lisa. Lisa was Lottie’s acolyte, whom Misty tried to kill during their adult “hunt” at the end of last season. Misty missed and ended up killing Natalie with her syringe full of fentanyl instead, a point that Lisa reiterates to Misty during their meeting in this episode. The day Lottie died, she had given Lisa $50,000 in cash and a note that read, “I’m sorry.” Lisa also tells Misty that she saw Tai with Lottie the day she died. As the episode ends, we linger on the Ben-B-Q feast, with Lottie becoming increasingly agitated that Ben’s fate didn’t seem to match Akilah’s vision. In a Lord of the Flies–coded shot that puts Ben’s hacked-off head in the foreground, a man steps into the frame, lifts his hand, and says a cautious “hello.” He appears to be with at least one other person. Lottie’s reaction to this shocking development is instant and cutting. However, as the camera pans around to take in all of the other Yellowjackets’ reactions, there’s a wide variety of emotions: Shauna is in shock. The man looks down, spots Ben’s bloody head, and freaks out. What will they do now that someone else has witnessed their barbaric feast? I know him as the sweet Robby from New Girl and the constantly put-upon Will from Veep, but you might know him from a million things because he’s a dude who stays working. He has great comedic timing (see his amazing reaction to a random man’s head on an altar in the middle of the wilderness), and I’m excited to see more of him as the season progresses. • I’m not too sure what’s going on with Callie this season, but when she reminds Shauna that she’s the same age as she was when they were in the wilderness, it reminded me of a therapy concept. Is he looking to kill Misty for some sort of revenge? Give us a reason for this man’s continued presence on the show, please! • I’m a bit confused about the title of this episode, “Thanksgiving (Canada).” I guess it serves to mark time — if we take the title at face value, it’s mid-October 1997 now, approximately 16 months after they’ve crashed, and we know they were in the wilderness for a total of 19 months, so we’re close to rescue but not totally there yet —and I guess instead of a turkey, they’re having roasted Ben for their celebration? • What part of Ben do you think Lottie is gnawing on when she starts chanting? • If Ben didn’t start the cabin fire, then who did?</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/best-steven-soderbergh-movies-ranked.html'>Every Steven Soderbergh Movie, Ranked</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-14 09:15:00 <p>
This story was originally published in 2018 and has been updated with subsequent releases, including Soderbergh’s latest film, Black Bag. We’d watch all of these again, even the bad ones. He was able to get Warner Bros. to make this knowingly old-fashioned World War II drama, which didn’t just ape film noir and Casablanca, but also utilized some of the same tools of the era. (The film was shot in the period’s boxier aspect ratio, and incorporated boom mics and other 1940s-appropriate technology, including intentionally cheesy rear projection.) But once Tobey Maguire’s scheming soldier Tully is murdered, Jake uncovers a plan that involves high-tech weapons and a stormy prostitute (Cate Blanchett) whose husband may or may not be dead. As former lovers still hung up on one another, Clooney and Blanchett exhibit some chemistry, but The Good German feels like it should be called Studio System War Drama: The Movie — everything about it is meant to reference back to an earlier, better film. A narrative-free screw-around that’s loosely about Hollywood but is really about Soderbergh pulling the rug out from under himself to make sure he doesn’t become One Of Them, Full Frontal is oftentimes unwatchable; Soderbergh is too busy doodling around to remember to entertain anyone other than himself. We will give points to Nicky Katt for being the funniest Hitler since Chaplin, though. “It’s just totally sleepy … This thing is just dead-on-arrival … I can’t say that I would recommend it to anyone.” Never let it be said that Soderbergh is deluded about the quality of his misfires: Those quotes were all comments he made about The Underneath, his deeply meh exercise in modern film noir. Peter Gallagher plays a gambling addict who comes home, only to fall back in love with his ex-wife (Alison Elliott) who’s now involved with a dangerous club owner (William Fichtner). The Underneath may be, as Soderbergh puts it, where he hit rock bottom, but it also inspired him to reinvent his aesthetic, which would soon lead to his most fecund period. The movie actually feels a little more like Traffic, though, with multiple stories occasionally intersecting (with the connective tissue of two money laundering narrators played by Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas) in service of a larger point about … well, about Something Bad In Society. For now, though: The best you can do are old grainy YouTube videos. Part melancholy swan song, part ad for the Magic Mike stage show, Last Dance might be in its quiet way the most subversive film Soderbergh’s made in many a moon. Outside an incredible opening sequence in which Tatum’s Mike slowly grinds against enterprising socialite Maxandra (Salma Hayek Pinault) and an equally stunning finale, Last Dance doesn’t give the audience the same randy pleasures as the first two films, instead focusing on a story about Mike trying to prove himself as a theater director once Maxandra hires him to put together a strip show. (Tellingly, Soderbergh denies viewers the sort of fan service we’ve come to expect from franchises by not having Mike gyrate to “Pony” one more time.) But that withholding, while intellectually intriguing, also results in a sequel that’s less distinct than its predecessors — and also a little more perfunctory. And for knowing it’s probably best to let Mike dance off into the sunset. Even at the time, no one really bought Soderbergh’s insistence that he would retire from filmmaking after Side Effects. Nevertheless, this twisty thriller certainly suggested a director who needed to recharge his batteries. There’s no questioning his confidence behind the camera as he tells the story (we think) of a dangerously depressed Manhattan wife (Rooney Mara) — a setup that soon gets thrown out the window after a violent act recalibrates what genre of film we’re watching. Side Effects brazenly pushes plausibility to its breaking point, making room for lesbian subplots and characters who are so diabolically ruthless that they barely seem human. A game ensemble, including Channing Tatum, Jude Law, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, is clearly up for anything Soderbergh dishes out. But ultimately, Side Effects feels a bit too mechanical, a bit too amused with its own intrigue, to feel like the proper sendoff. Maybe that’s why Streep wanted to work with Soderbergh in the first place? This, the story of a famous novelist (Streep) who takes a cruise to accept an award in England with her two college best friends (Dianne Weist and Candice Bergen) and her nephew (Lucas Hedges), is the better of their two collaborations, but it’s still awkward and fumbling. A documentary of Streep, her co-stars, and Soderbergh just hanging out on a boat might have been more absorbing, and probably would have had more forward momentum. This is mostly an odd trifle that, frankly, both of Streep and Soderbergh are better than. Outwardly glassy but mournful on the inside, the film is a fairly overt expression of grief — one that’s even more acute coming out just a year after 9/11. Based on the Stanislaw Lem novel that also inspired Andrei Tarkovsky’s towering 1972 film, this new Solaris starred George Clooney as Chris Kelvin, a psychiatrist who travels to a remote space station orbiting the planet Solaris. Still, the director’s focus on Kelvin’s emotional struggle — how can he let go of a woman who killed herself when she literally won’t leave him alone? There are some standout moments, and Soderbergh, curiously, shoots the movie in as straightforward and linear a fashion as he’s ever shot anything. Still, Soderbergh’s inherent empathy with his characters, and this setting, sticks with you, even if this still ranks as yet another Soderbergh doodle. Presence sports an ostensibly familiar setup, introducing us to a discordant family that moves into what they think might be their dream home, except one of the kids is fairly certain that … something … lurks inside the dwelling, quietly observing her. and part dazzling technical showcase, this spare thriller once again demonstrates Soderbergh’s desire to play with form, tweaking horror conventions while delivering a portrait of an unhappy family. (Lucy Liu and Chris Sullivan are the slowly fraying married couple.) Not that Presence ultimately adds up to much — its reveal is anticlimactic — but the fun Soderbergh has toying with our expectations is contagious. Soderbergh’s big reset — the whacked-out, crazy-ass indie that he made so weird and self-referential that it seemed to make sense only to him — Schizopolis is still pleasantly incomprehensible today, the gonzo button Soderbergh needed to push to get himself back on track after his struggles following the Sex, Lies, and Videotape breakthrough. The film is so strange that it’s sort of irresistible, if impenetrable. Plus: If Soderbergh ever decides to retire again, he definitely has a career in Funny Mirror Faces. The final Spalding Gray monologue film is the most visually interesting of any of them — Soderbergh seems to have a mindmeld with Gray, and Soderbergh would later work on another documentary about him after he died — but, unfortunately, it’s perhaps the least interesting of all of Gray’s works. It’s still smart and funny and sad in the way that Gray was, but it feels more peripheral: An entertaining work, but a minor one. In a way, he brought his A-game more than Gray did. Traffic for the Outbreak crowd, Contagion is uniquely suited to Soderbergh’s sober, meticulous approach. Instead, Contagion is a fascinating examination of process — how health officials try to combat the disease and how civilization starts to implode once it becomes clear that all hope is lost. Goosed along by Cliff Martinez’s ghostly electronic score, Soderbergh taps into our collective inner hypochondriac, making every character’s sniffle or rubbed eye bristle with potential danger. What keeps the film from placing higher on our list, however, is that for all its queasy atmosphere, Contagion suffers when it tries to flesh out its characters. Jude Law’s truther journalist is a drip, and Matt Damon’s uber-decent family man doesn’t have enough dimension to be the emotional center of this globe-trotting ensemble thriller. Soderbergh’s second post-retirement film is, like Logan Lucky, a fun little exercise made by a guy who hasn’t just said goodbye to the studio system but also the demands of living up to anyone’s lofty expectations of him being a revered, world-class auteur. With its nods to Shock Corridor and One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, Unsane is a punkish thriller about a young woman named Sawyer (Claire Foy) held against her will in a mental institution, confronting the fact that her stalker (a wonderfully creepy Joshua Leonard) may or may not be one of the nurses. Soderbergh nods to the #MeToo movement — Sawyer just wants to be believed, but no one will listen to her — while underlining the claustrophobic dread by shooting on an iPhone 7 Plus, which gives the images a sickly distortion. Like Sawyer, we’re never quite sure what’s coming at us next. Soderbergh hasn’t made a lot of love stories, which is one reason why this HBO film — it got a theatrical release outside the U.S. — is so noteworthy. (Damon brings such sincerity and sweetness to the role that it’s a perfect counterbalance to his duplicitous turn in another Soderbergh effort, The Informant!) But just as Douglas gives us a nuanced Liberace, so too does Soderbergh pinpoint the insecurity, loneliness and vivid affection that bonded the pianist and his paramour. This crime film is a lot less “fun” than what you’d expect from Soderbergh. But this more muted tone is appropriate for a grim, gripping story of desperate crooks just trying to get by — and a plot in which the deck is ultimately stacked against our antiheroes. Don Cheadle and Benicio del Toro are both quite good as part of a team that’s tasked with stealing a secret document, setting the stage for a drama involving gangsters, faithless lovers, and white-collar crooks. No Sudden Move is set in Detroit in 1954, and Soderbergh invites you to savor every bit of period detail — all so he can hit you with some social commentary about racism and plutocracy. Shot in down-and-dirty Soderbergh fashion, this time entirely with an iPhone, High Flying Bird is basketball film with no actual basketball in it: It follows an NBA agent (Andre Holland) navigating a lockout while he both tries both to get his star rookie point guard paid and to change the entire financial structure of the sport. At its best, it feels like a sneaky Soderbergh heist film: There’s a great moment when we realize, in flashback, what our hero was up to all along. The movie gets a little bogged down in its plot – the agent’s backstory is a bit labored, and as great as she is, Zazie Beetz’s character isn’t given enough to do – but there is something radical and revolutionary about what Soderbergh and screenwriter Tarell Alvin McCraney (Moonlight) are up to here. This is the only you’ll see in which the big reveal concerns an obscure civil rights book that’s more than 50 years old. Everyone’s least favorite Ocean’s movie is better than it’s given credit for, and it might just be the most Soderbergh-playful: The scene where Bruce Willis thinks the character Julia Roberts is playing is actually Julia Roberts is straight out of the Soderbergh meta playbook. (Not surprisingly, Soderbergh considers this his favorite Ocean’s film.) Still: These movies, all three of them, remain compulsively watchable. Soderbergh squeezes out one last ounce of fun from the series in this finale, which drops Julia Roberts but adds a gloriously sleazy Al Pacino as a Steve Wynn-type who might actually be the best villain of the entire series. (Inevitably, Andy Garcia’s Terry Benedict is now on their side.) The Ellen Barkin/Rusty Ryan story still doesn’t work, but it’s a fitting, pleasant conclusion. Soderbergh’s posthumous tribute to Spalding Gray, made six years after his death, is another Soderbergh experiment, a documentary that has no narration or interviews. Instead, Soderbergh just worked with existing footage — Gray’s footage — to try and cobble together the life story of one of his heroes. The whole thing works magnificently, allowing Gray to essentially be his own eulogist. It was inevitable that a filmmaker as nimble and fly-by-night as Soderbergh would want to do a pandemic movie: yet another fun challenge he can experiment with. This story — about an agoraphobe (a smart, focused Zoe Kravitz) who, while working as an audio consultant for an Amazon-like tech firm, may have stumbled across evidence of a murder — is light on its feet and clever; the pivot in its second half into more of a straightforward action movie/thriller is done ably and with considerable wit. (Chekov never had a nail gun in one of his plays, but if he had, this is how he would have done it.) Soderbergh can dash off these relatively minor straight-to-streaming one-offs with relative ease these days, but don’t confuse that ease with a lack of quality: Everything’s done better, and sharper, than just about anyone else would do it. And kudos to yet another superb Cliff Martinez score. Soderbergh had just parted ways with Sony over its adaptation of Moneyball, and in the midst of his funk, the dejected director happened to catch MMA fighter Gina Carano on TV. “She had just lost her last [most recent] fight,” he later explained, “so it seemed like a good time for the two of us to get into a room, me having been fired and her having been beaten.” Out of that came a delightfully intense, stripped-down action-thriller in which Carano’s Mallory Kane gets double-crossed in Dublin, barely makes it out alive, and then spends the rest of the movie finding out who betrayed her. Haywire is quintessential Soderbergh during his “Wouldn’t it be fun if I tried this?” period, picking a non-professional as his lead — Carano did her own stunts — and bringing his considered, brainy tone to the action genre. Soderbergh’s first film since his “retirement” feels like an old ballplayer stepping into the batting cage just to take a few practice swings, then proceeding to knock every pitch out of the park. Soderbergh has fun with his West Virginia redneck characters, but the joke is never on them: They’re all smarter and more on top of everything than anyone — including, at times, the audience — might give them credit for. Soderbergh has said he no longer wants to make “prestige” pictures, and instead just wants as many people to see and enjoy his movies as possible. If that’s the next step in his career, he is off to a fantastic start. At the time, this Depression-era coming-of-age tale, based on A. E. Hotchner’s memoir, was greeted with acclaim — but, also, a huge sigh of relief. Soderbergh and cinematographer Elliot Davis give this period drama a nostalgic glow, but that’s a bit of a feint: King of the Hill may look warm and wistful, but its story is actually rather unsentimental about the ways that the adult world can look positively frightening to kids — especially when it’s thrust upon them way too early in their lives. The movie was also a launching pad for Adrien Brody as our hero’s older buddy, and the cast includes future stars like Amber Benson, Katherine Heigl, and Lauryn Hill. King of the Hill was the first and only time Soderbergh would base a narrative around a child’s perspective — but it’s far too intelligent and nuanced to be thought of as just a kid’s movie. There was no reason to think this suave, cheeky spy thriller would be one of Soderbergh’s best in many a moon. On its surface, Black Bag looked like another fun but disposable busman’s holiday for a filmmaker content to coast on his considerable technical skill and well-deserved laurels. Instead, we got an absolute banger: one of his most purely pleasurable romps, starring Michael Fassbender and Cate Blanchett as elite British agents who must find the mole in their midst. You can feel the sleekness of the director’s Ocean’s flicks and the inventiveness of Out of Sight pulsing through every frame, but rarely in recent years has he told a story with such endless inventiveness and sustained suspense. Guy Ritchie has spent his entire career laboring to make a movie this entertaining — Soderbergh pulls it off like it’s no big thing. Often screened in two parts, but shown gloriously as one piece at festival screenings, Che features Benicio Del Toro’s most lived in, deeply felt, gimmick-free performance as the rebel who is neither lionized nor demonized by Soderbergh. Soderbergh, for his own mental health, may never make another movie like it, but this is Soderbergh working on a vaster canvas with equal mastery. Soderbergh is in pure gritty crime mode with this almost-too-hip-for-any-room thriller about an English father (Terence Stamp) coming to America to track down the people who murdered his daughter. And yet, Magic Mike is pure pleasure — albeit pleasure flecked with melancholy recognition that its aging main character can’t keep doing this forever. Magic Mike has the intoxicating rush of a Scorsese film as Mike and his cohorts live it up as the kings of Tampa but — like in a Scorsese film — eventually drugs, egos and money ruin everything. Soderbergh is amused by this quirky little subculture, but there’s also a lot of compassion for Mike, a hunky Peter Pan on the cusp of growing up. McConaughey has never been better, while Tatum demonstrated that he had the sex appeal, depth, and understated comic timing to be more than just the Step Up heartthrob. A film shot during the build-up to the 2008 presidential election — not to mention the global financial meltdown — Soderbergh’s character study received a lot of attention initially because of its supposedly gimmicky casting of adult film star Sasha Grey as a high-class Manhattan escort. The movie is all about transactions — mostly between Grey’s chilly Christine and her rich clients — and both the audience and the characters are keenly aware of how money impacts every decision, whether it’s in a romantic relationship or regarding career choices. But it’s striking how much this still feels like a Soderbergh film. It has his smart, confident touch, it’s rousing without lapsing into sentimentality and, showing off perhaps Soderbergh’s most underrated trait, it points a camera at a movie star and lets them movie star their ass off. You’ve seen this sort of movie a thousand times, but Soderbergh makes it all seem new. Between its faux-cheery Marvin Hamlisch score and Soderbergh’s seemingly counterintuitive use of stand-up comics in serious supporting roles, The Informant! constantly flaunts its phoniness, which ends up being a perfect way to critique the story’s theme of the lengths ordinary people will go to construct new, better versions of themselves. It’s no insult to say that, in the years since Sex, Lies, and Videotape first hit theaters, Soderbergh has rarely topped it — even as his style has evolved and his technique only grown more dazzling and inventive. “I cut myself in quarters,” he would later say, meaning that the film’s four principal characters contained different parts of him. As such, Sex, Lies is an exquisite study of a married couple (Peter Gallagher and Andie MacDowell) whose sex life is on the brink. He’s having an affair with his wife’s sister (Laura San Giacomo) when his old college chum (James Spader) comes to town, advocating a belief that talking about sex is actually more satisfying than the physical act. Famously winning the Palme d’Or at Cannes over Spike Lee’s equally skilled Do the Right Thing, Soderbergh’s film now plays as a warning for a narcissistic society that soon would become more fascinated in documenting itself than in experiencing real life. In retrospect, Sex, Lies is one of the most straightforward things he’s ever done — and still one of the most insightful about people’s need to deceive and be deceived. No one had any right to expect much of this new Ocean’s Eleven, which on paper looked like a smug cavalcade of Hollywood royalty slumming their way through an ultra-stylish crime caper. The man doesn’t entirely put away his auteurist idiosyncrasies, but here he allows his formidable skill with suspense, misdirection, and clockwork storytelling to take the lead. You don’t need a plot recap — the damn movie’s probably on cable right now — but let’s take a moment to remember how impossibly fun the whole enterprise was. Matt Damon happily serving the Ringo Starr/younger brother role alongside his older costars. Andy Garcia at last getting the elegant villain role he’s always deserved. Revered icons Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould having an absolute ball. Screenwriter Stephen Gaghan, a former addict, wanted to tell a story about the War on Drugs, but he was stuck after months of research and interviews. Then, he met Soderbergh, who was also interested in making something about the War on Drugs, suggesting the writer take a look at a British series called Traffik. From there came Traffic, which demonstrated the director’s talent for multi-pronged narratives that are both thrilling and thematically rich. This award-winning drama doesn’t pretend to have any answers, but it’s an exceedingly sober and intelligent look into how this unwinnable, maddening conflict ensnares so many lives and cuts across class and cultural barriers. Benicio Del Toro took home the Oscar for his role as a smart, savvy Mexican cop, but the film is the high-water mark for several of its actors, including Don Cheadle as a blasé DEA agent, Catherine Zeta-Jones as a kingpin’s wife suddenly thrust into a power position, and Michael Douglas as a judge who quickly learns how little he knows about America’s drug problem. And the hotel-room scene remains a standard for movie sensuality still today. Grierson & Leitch write about the movies regularly and host a podcast on film.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Although otherwise “The Substance” had monstrous luck at the 2025 Academy Awards, Coralie Fargeat’s horror film starring Demi Moore did walk away with one Oscar for Best Hair and Makeup Design, as it was favored to do. Now, however, producer Nicolas Royer has weighed in on acrimony between members of the hair and makeup team that has been brewing both before and after the Oscar ceremony. You might well think that an entire team would qualify equally for an Academy Award; or that one single representative, the department head, would automatically be the nominee for an Oscar category. But each Hair and Makeup nomination is limited to three nominees. This in part reflects the complex way that prosthetics, hair design, and conventional makeup all work together to transform actors into characters and still caps the number of award winners. The Academy’s Makeup and Hair Branch Executive Committee goes through the packets submitted for awards consideration by individual artists and decides, based on materials submitted and interviews, which three artisans will be the nominees for each film. Key hair artist and hair department head, Frédérique Arguello, has been saying publicly that she was unduly passed over for Scarselli, her assistant, who took over as a key hair artist for 15 days at the end of the shoot, notably on Elizabeth’s and Sue’s (Margaret Qualley) final form. “We were not complementary but formed a team respecting the hierarchy as it has always been established on film sets. “Unfortunately, the nominations of this great and respectful institution had already been publicly announced.” Royer and the Association of Production Managers did not respond to IndieWire’s request for comment. “You can’t test it, you can’t put it on in rehearsal a week before to try the body language, to try everything. Basically, it’s going to be on the day,” Fargeat said.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

American Airlines may want to pay for an exorcist to fly on each of its flights ... 'cause one passenger claims her brother was fighting off evil demons -- and allegedly ended up whaling on some poor crew members.

Here's the deal ... a 31-year-old man named Delange Augustin boarded a flight in Savannah, Georgia bound for Miami, Florida earlier this week with his sister Medjina -- and, the plane took off without incident carrying the siblings, six other passengers, and five crew members.

According to FBI documents, just a minute after takeoff, one of the flight attendants says they noticed Augustin was stomping, yelling incoherently, and appeared "to be in a fit of epilepsy."

Flight attendants ran to his aid ... but, Delange allegedly kicked one of them in the chest, on purpose, sending her across a row of seats and into a window. Delange is said to have continued kicking and punching the seat and the passenger in front of him while the plane returned to the airport gate.

While deboarding, crew members say Augustin -- holding his sister tightly -- rushed at one of them and allegedly started throwing "haymakers" at her before other passengers wrestled him to the ground.

Augustin was taken to a hospital for evaluation -- and for swallowing a set of rosary beads ... though he was eventually discharged from the hospital, arrested for interference with flight crew members, and booked at Chatham County Jail.

Officials spoke with Medjina ... who claims she and Delange were traveling to Haiti to "flee religious attacks of a spiritual nature."

Medjina -- who says she can "feel the spiritual fight, but cannot see" -- says Delange told her to close her eyes and pray because "Satan's disciple(s) had followed them onto the plane and the legion did not want the Augustins to make it to Haiti."

As for the rosary beads ... Medjina says they are a source of strength in spiritual warfare -- and, he decided he needed that strength inside him.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Hudson then explained McBride was super apologetic at the scene ... before she played a video he had sent her where he issued another big mea culpa.

"I just want to say I'm sorry for running into you at our game last week," McBride said. "I was in the zone, trying to make a play, trying to bring some energy and unfortunately you were at the wrong place at the wrong time."

"Hopefully we can be cool after this."

When they tried to detain him, he allegedly tried to take off, but he was stopped and his car was searched ... which is when officers allegedly found the gun -- which he's prohibited from possessing, since Jay is a former felon. Rock was arrested just before 5:30 PM PT and booked on a charge of felon in possession of a gun, about three hours later.

Offset and his entourage's plans to enjoy the legal California cannabis went up in smoke last night ... a security guard is accusing the former Migos rapper of assaulting him -- and sending him to the hospital!!!

Multiple sources tell TMZ Hip Hop that Offset and several other guys popped up at a popular dispensary, MedMen LAX, around 9:30 PM ... and a dispute arose over whether Offset presented ID, prohibiting him by law from buying or even touching any marijuana products.

Reps for Offset call the claims ridiculous ... he had just gotten off a flight at the nearby airport, and identification is an obvious requirement to hop on a commercial plane, and they say ID was in his possession at the shop.

Offset says he was in the process of presenting the ID when the security guard was aggressively rushing him ... hawking spit in his face, causing a fight to break out.

When more of MedMen's security got involved in the altercation, our sources say Offset punched the guard ... and the guard doused Offset and his entourage with mace!!!

Police were then called to the scene, and we're told Offset and his team fled the scene.

Paramedics were also dialed up, and the guard was transported to a local hospital after the attack. It's unclear what the extent of his injuries were.

Federal prosecutors just revealed in court they have two videos of Diddy beating Cassie in a hotel hallway in L.A. ... including a recording of the original hotel surveillance footage. Diddy was in court Friday for a pretrial hearing in his federal criminal case when his lawyers started sparring with the feds over the Cassie beating video. A 2016 surveillance video obtained by CNN shows Sean "Diddy" Combs violently grab, shove, drag and kick his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura during an altercation in a hotel in California. Diddy's lawyers doubled down in court, at least on their claims CNN altered the video, which was recorded in 2016 at the InterContinental Hotel. The Bad Boy Records founder's lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, claimed a source gave CNN the footage and CNN ran the video through a free editing software. He says CNN altered the video by speeding it up, taking things out of sequence, and removing the time stamps. Diddy's legal team says the video is deceptive. Diddy is not being prosecuted for the beating -- that's a state matter and the statute of limitations has run out -- but prosecutors want to use it to show Diddy's alleged violent propensities. The judge shot back that a possible solution would be to slow down the video or put it in the right sequence ... urging Diddy's attorneys and federal prosecutors to come to a compromise. Whatever CNN may or may not have done with the Cassie video may be irrelevant now ... 'cause the feds say they have the OG version.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Officials made it clear Hackman was struggling with Alzheimer's disease -- which would explain why he never called the police about his wife. Betsy's will leaves most of her assets to Gene, but there's a provision which says if they died within 90 days of each other, it would be considered a simultaneous death, and in that case, her will provides all of her assets would go to charity. New Mexico is a community property state, so assuming there's no prenup, Betsy's estate could have a lot of money and her share would go to charity. Andrew M. Katzenstein -- a prominent California trust and estate attorney -- has reportedly been hired by Gene's son Chris, who's the oldest sibling ... indicating he may challenge the will. Hackman discussed his difficult relationship with his children over the years ... admitting he wasn't around much during Chris' formative years. He had gotten closer to his kids in more recent years. Julia Peters, a representative for the estate of Hackman and Arakawa, has also filed paperwork asking the court to grant a preliminary injunction preventing authorities from releasing any photo or video of evidence of the death scene -- officer body cam footage for example -- citing Gene and Betsy's right to privacy. As you know ... Hackman and Arakawa were found dead in their home last month -- and, officials say they believe their bodies had been lying in the house for more than a week.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Kendrick Lamar's big Drake diss on Playboi Carti's "Music" album didn't materialize like DJ Akademiks predicted ... but A$AP Relli can pick a bone with the "Not Like Us" rapper.

If losing his assault trial wasn't bad enough, Relli's now being crucified by Kendrick on the track "Good Credit" for taking the stand and testifying against A$AP Rocky!!!

Kendrick slickly raps ... "Belly on chain go big, white gold link fall on the belly / The emerald cuff for hers and his, that bitch on point like A$AP Relli" -- a clear reference to the moment former A$AP Mob member claimed Rocky shot him.

We know how that turned out for Relli ... Rocky was found not guilty on all counts last month, leaving Relli to be labeled a snitch, liar and "Donkey of the Day" all wrapped up in one -- and Kendrick's piling on like the rest of the internet!!!

It's a hot-button topic but Kendrick and Rocky go way back ... their 2013 collab "F***in' Problems" recently went Diamond.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
