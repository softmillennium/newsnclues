AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is scheduled to stand before judges today at the International Criminal Court, days after his stunning arrest in Manila on murder charges. Duterte, wearing a jacket and tie, listened to the hearing through headphones, often with his eyes closed. Duterte was arrested Tuesday amid chaotic scenes in the Philippine capital after returning from a visit to Hong Kong. ″There will be a day of reckoning for all,″ she said, as excited crowds around her chanted ″Duterte!″ and ″yes, yes!″ “Other leaders facing ICC arrest warrants, like (Russian President) Vladimir Putin and (Israeli Prime Minister) Benjamin Netanyahu, should take note that even those who seem untouchable today can end up in The Hague.”</p>

Is a deadly past replaying for Congolese as M23 rebels march on Kinshasa amid presence of Rwandan and Ugandan troops? Tariffs and threats to annex Canada fall into Donald Trump's wider vision for US dominance in the world, experts say. A sense of optimism is being felt across Russia, but some remain sceptical about the possibility of peace. Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Algeria produce nearly half of the world's dates.

The former central bank chief takes over at what he has called “a time of great peril” for Canada, with Trump attacking its sovereignty and economic security. TORONTO — Former central bank chief Mark Carney was sworn in as Canada's prime minister on Friday, taking over at what he has called “a time of great peril” as the country faces a trade war with the United States and annexation threats from President Donald Trump. “The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First state,” Trump said in a social media post this week. “The only constant in this unjustifiable trade war seems to be President Trump's talks of annexing our country through economic coercion,” Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly said his week. A federal election must be held by the end of October, but Carney is expected to call one shortly.</p>

Some say incursion achieved many goals while others wonder if it cost Ukrainian lives for no tangible gain “We have no wish to occupy this territory,” Zelenskyy's aide Mykhailo Podolyak told the Guardian in late August. By the beginning of this year, Ukrainian military planners could see Russia making a sustained effort to concentrate forces on Kursk. They say that while the withdrawal may be fraught, it has so far passed without enormous loss of life or stubbornly holding on to undefendable positions. And we showed how shameful it is for the Russians, that they can't fight Ukraine without North Koreans.”</p>

US President Donald Trump requested Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday to ‘spare' Ukrainian troops being pushed back from Russia's Kursk region, expressing hope that the war could soon end. The US president warned that thousands of Ukrainian troops were “completely surrounded” by Russian forces, in a “very bad and vulnerable position.” He said, “I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared. This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II. This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II.

Grasping for a familiar metaphor, a chorus of western heads of state declared this week that “the ball was in Russia's court” after Ukraine agreed in talks with the US on Tuesday to an immediate 30-day ceasefire. To his admirers, it was a masterclass in Putin's diplomatic manoeuvring, flanked by the seasoned foreign policy veterans Sergei Lavrov and Yuri Ushakov – both with decades of experience. Moscow has long excelled at delaying negotiations, offering just enough hope of progress to keep talks alive while avoiding major concessions. Putin's remarks and Zelenskyy's response have drawn a clear dividing line between the two sides' positions. Putin may further revive broader security demands from 2021, including limits on Nato's military presence in countries that joined the alliance after 1997, when its expansion into former communist states began.</p>

JERUSALEM (AP) — Palestinian militant group Hamas said Friday that it has accepted a proposal from mediators to release one living American-Israeli hostage and the bodies of four dual nationals who had died in captivity. It added that Israel's negotiating team would return Friday from Qatar's capital, Doha. He warned that any Israeli deviation from the terms would return negotiations to square one. The White House announced last week that American officials had engaged in “ongoing talks and discussions” with Hamas, stepping away from a long-held U.S. policy of not directly engaging with the militant group. Hamas is believed to be holding 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others.</p>

The effects of Donald Trump's economic attack on Canada are so wide-ranging and so damaging that they are likely to overshadow all other issues in the coming months. US trade tariffs, if held in place for an extended period of time, could push Canada's fragile economy into a recession and unleash a cascading chain of knock-on upheavals. An election would also put limits on spending for political parties, which disproportionately affect the cash-flush Conservative party. Earlier on Friday morning, Justin Trudeau formally resigned as prime minister, capping a nearly decade-long tenure that saw a rise in favourability in his final weeks as he stared down threats to Canadian sovereignty pushed by Trump. Notably, Carney brought his former leadership rival Freeland back into cabinet, as she assumed the role of transport minister.</p>

Liberal party leader Mark Carney was sworn in as Canada's new prime minister on Friday amid a raging trade dispute with neighbouring United States triggered by President Donald Trump. Francois-Philippe Champagne will be his finance minister as Dominic LeBlanc was shifted to manage international trade amid a raging tariff dispute with Trump. The ruling party's rebound was attributed to Trudeau's resignation in January. The US president has vowed to use “economic force” to make Canada a US state and has slapped steep tariffs, which drew immediate and proportional retaliation from Trudeau's government. Economic uncertainty triggered by tariffs has hampered businesses and spending plans, Bloomberg reported.</p>

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaks with reporters following the G7 foreign ministers meeting in La Malbaie, Quebec, Canada, on Friday, March 14, 2025. “I've never heard President Trump say that Russia has a right to take all of Ukraine and do whatever they want there,” Rubio told reporters. In addition, the G7 diplomats discussed, but did not detail, imposing further sanctions on Russia — including the possibility of selling seized Russian assets to fund Ukraine's defense — should Russia not accept and respect a ceasefire and providing additional support for Ukraine in that event. Russian President Vladimir Putin said he agrees in principle with the ceasefire plan but set out a host of details that need to be clarified before it is accepted. After Trump reiterated in the Oval Office on Thursday that “Canada only works as a state,” Joly stood firm.</p>

Powell has also become No 10's de facto chief adviser on foreign policy, filling a vacuum left by John Bew, who had the role under three Conservative prime ministers. This has prompted concerns in sections of Whitehall that Powell is spinning too many plates and cracks will begin to show. Special advisers were told on Tuesday that the role would be filled by Henna Shah, an ally of McSweeney who has been serving as No 10 director of party relations and will play a supporting role to Powell. David Lammy is currently a bit player, but he's not the first foreign secretary to find himself in that position.” Powell also helped advise Lammy and Starmer on foreign policy issues in opposition, and the foreign secretary is said to have argued that Powell should be brought into government after Labour won the election.</p>

The exchange of warm words between Trump and Putin is likely to cause further alarm in Kyiv and European capitals, already spooked by signs of the new US administration cosying up to Moscow while exerting pressure on Ukraine. Trump repeated Putin's claim, writing that thousands of troops had been “completely surrounded” during the retreat. Putin told his security council that he had heard Trump's appeal, and said the lives of Ukrainian troops would be spared if they surrendered. Peskov's statement was echoed by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, who said there were “reasons to be cautiously optimistic”. Despite apparent optimism from the White House, US intelligence services have reportedly assessed that Putin remains committed to achieving “his maximalist goal of dominating Ukraine”.</p>

Carney's defeated his rivals on Sunday in a race to become leader of the ruling Liberal Party, despite lacking prior political experience. This unprecedented move has sparked interest, especially given Carney's background in navigating complex economic crises. His first major challenge will be addressing the strained US-Canada relations, which have hit an all-time low. Carney replaces Justin Trudeau, who served as prime minister for over nine years. In a statement, Carney emphasised his commitment to defending Canadian sovereignty, saying he would only meet with Trump "when there is respect for Canadian sovereignty."</p>

Duterte, wearing a jacket and tie, listened to the hearing through headphones, often with his eyes closed. Duterte was arrested Tuesday amid chaotic scenes in the Philippine capital after returning from a visit to Hong Kong. ″There will be a day of reckoning for all,″ she said, as excited crowds around her chanted ″Duterte!″ and ″yes, yes!″ “Other leaders facing ICC arrest warrants, like (Russian President) Vladimir Putin and (Israeli Prime Minister) Benjamin Netanyahu, should take note that even those who seem untouchable today can end up in The Hague.”</p>

“Germany is making its large contribution to the defence of freedom and peace in Europe.” The conservative CDU/CSU bloc, which won last month's election, and the Social Democrats, who are in talks to form a new government, put forward a deal that will relax Germany's strict debt brake, allowing an increase in defence spending and a €500bn (£420bn) “special fund” dedicated to infrastructure reforms. Germany must “do something now … anything else would be irresponsible,” he said. He said it “laid the foundation for Germany to get back on its feet and protect itself”.

"Pakistan's peace and prosperity are linked with it (terrorism). There will be no prosperity without peace,” Sharif said while speaking at a high-level meeting.

Hussein referred to an operations room formed by Syria, Iraq, Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon at a recent meeting in Amman to confront IS, and said it would soon begin work. The current interim president of Syria, Ahmad al-Sharaa, was previously known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani and fought as an al-Qaida militant in Iraq after the U.S. invasion of 2003, and later fought against Assad's government in Syria. While Syria's new rulers - led by the Islamist former insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham - have pursued IS cells since taking power, some fear a breakdown in overall security that could allow the group to stage a resurgence.</p>

Under Trump's plan, Gaza's more than 2 million residents would be permanently displaced to allow massive reconstruction as a high-end “international” leisure and business destination. Initially, Egypt and Jordan were suggested as destinations for displaced Palestinians, but both strenuously opposed the plan. Arab nations have offered an alternative multibillion-dollar reconstruction plan that would leave the Palestinians in place. Netanyahu has hailed Trump's proposal as a “bold vision”, while Bezalel Smotrich, Israel's far-right finance minister and a longtime advocate of what he calls “voluntary” emigration of Palestinians, has recently said that Israel was working to identify countries to take in Palestinians. Sudan was among the four Abraham accord nations that agreed to normalise diplomatic relations with Israel in 2020 but was plunged almost immediately into a civil war marked by widespread atrocities, including ethnically motivated killing and rape, according to the UN and rights groups.</p>

US President Donald Trump said on Friday there is a "very good chance" the war between Russia and Ukraine can end after "productive" discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday. "We had very good and productive discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia yesterday, and there is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end," Trump said in a Truth Social post, adding that he had requested that Putin spare the lives of "completely surrounded" Ukrainian troops. The Truth Social post did not say whether Trump and Putin had spoken to each other. He said Russia and the US would work out the timing of a phone call between their presidents once Witkoff had briefed Trump.

Mahmoud Khalil felt as though he was being kidnapped when he was handcuffed and shackled and rushed from New York to immigration detention in Louisiana last weekend, his lawyers wrote in an updated lawsuit demanding that the Columbia University graduate be released from custody immediately. One of his lawyers, Donna Lieberman, told CNN on Friday in a TV interview: “This is a targeted, retaliatory and extreme attack on the right of free expression” and said Khalil was being detained “for having ideas.” “They're not claiming he did anything illegal they just don't like what he has said,” she added, warning: “It's an attempt to bully students, faculty and the rest of us … this move to quell free speech is absolutely terrifying.” “Throughout this process, Mr Khalil felt as though he was being kidnapped,” the lawyers wrote of his treatment. He was denied release during a federal court hearing in New York on Wednesday and his arrest has sparked protests.</p>

Witkoff reportedly held talks with Russian officials after President Putin laid out his conditional agreement on Ukraine's proposed 30-day ceasefire. The Russian leader stopped short of backing Kyiv's proposals completely but said he wanted to discuss “issues” with Trump. On Friday, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of deliberately setting conditions for a ceasefire to “complicate and drag out” the process.

Vance has said he would be “shocked” if President Donald Trump supported the idea of American nuclear weapons being based in Poland. Vance argued that while “people like Joe Biden” are “sleepily walking us into the nuclear conflict,” allowing Russians and Ukrainians to “bleed out,” Trump has engaged in “tough diplomacy,” enlisting his entire administration to settle the Ukraine conflict. Polish officials are reportedly calling for militarization to address the alleged threat posed by Moscow. Russia has consistently denied allegations that it poses a military threat to European NATO nations. President Vladimir Putin has dismissed such claims as “nonsense,” accusing EU leaders of using them to instill fear among their populations and justify increased military spending.</p>

The Trump administration has accused Hamas of making “entirely impractical” demands and stalling on a deal to release a US-Israeli hostage in exchange for an extension of the Gaza ceasefire. “Unfortunately, Hamas has chosen to respond by publicly claiming flexibility while privately making demands that are entirely impractical without a permanent ceasefire,” the statement added. “Hamas was told in no uncertain terms that this ‘bridge' would have to be implemented soon – and that dual US-Israeli citizen Edan Alexander would have to be released immediately,” the statement said. Hamas abducted 251 hostages during its attack and killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. It also allowed much-needed food, shelter and medical assistance to re-enter Gaza.</p>

Last week, CK Hutchison struck a deal to sell a majority stake in Panama Ports Company, which holds the contract to run the ports of Balboa and Cristóbal until 2047, to a consortium led by the US financial giant BlackRock. “[Critics] say this is a spineless, grovelling, profit-seeking move that sells one's integrity for personal gains,” said the opinion piece. “It is power politics packaged as a ‘business behaviour',” stated the opinion piece. “This deal is an act of hegemony by the US, which uses its state power to infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of other countries through despicable means such as coercion, pressure and inducement.” CK Hutchison, which is controlled by the billionaire Li Ka-shing, has always maintained that its business operations are independent of China, which took control of Hong Kong from the UK in 1997.</p>

Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry puts the Palestinian death toll at more than 48,000, a figure that does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.

Rodrigo Duterte has become the first Asian former leader to appear before the international criminal court, where he stands accused of committing crimes against humanity during his notorious “war on drugs” which is estimated to have killed as many as 30,000 people. The 79-year-old politician was allowed to follow Friday's proceedings via video link from a detention centre after the presiding judge, Iulia Motoc, noted that he had endured “a long journey with considerable time difference”. Duterte became president nine years ago after promising a merciless, bloody crackdown that would rid the country of drugs. Rachel Chhoa-Howard, Amnesty International's south-east Asia researcher, said Friday's hearing proved that no one was above the law. “The very institution that former President Duterte mocked will now try him for murder as a crime against humanity,” she said.</p>

Local residents carrying food wade through a flooded road in Naypyitaw, Myanmar, Saturday, Sept. 14, 2024. BANGKOK (AP) — The United Nations food agency said on Friday that more than 1 million people in the war-torn nation of Myanmar will be cut off from food assistance due to critical funding shortfalls. The WFP said the cuts will also impact almost 100,000 internally displaced people, including Rohingya communities in camps in Myanmar's western state of Rakhine, who will have no access to food without WFP assistance. More than 700,000 have fled from Myanmar to refugee camps in Bangladesh since August 2017, when the military launched a clearance operation against the minority in response to attacks by a rebel group. Still, more have fled toward Bangladesh and elsewhere in recent months as violence surged again when a group called the Arakan Army started fighting against Myanmar's security forces.</p>

Moscow and Washington are currently in talks over the possibility of future cooperation with Gazprom on international projects, including in the Arctic region, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing Russian and European officials. US-Gazprom cooperation could involve joint projects in Europe and Asia, several sources said, adding that it could be part of Washington's broader push to weaken Russia's ties to China and Iran. Earlier this week, German news outlet Correctiv reported, citing its own investigation, that Russia and the US were negotiating a major deal that would allow the resumption of Russian energy exports. The months-long discussions could reportedly involve US companies buying parts of the Nord Stream pipeline infrastructure and stakes in three German refineries owned by a subsidiary of Russian energy giant Rosneft. President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia could resume gas exports to Europe through the undersea pipeline once Moscow and Washington reach an agreement on energy cooperation.</p>

Beijing had tried to "subvert, obtain secrets, lure members of the armed forces and influence public opinion", Lai added. On Wednesday, Taiwan's Defence Ministry confirmed that a retired air force major had leaked classified military intelligence to China in exchange for payment. It also recently extended the length of mandatory national military service for all men from four months to one year.</p>

The most concrete measure announced was plans to re-establish a peacetime military court system to prosecute “military crimes as sedition, aiding the enemy, leaking confidential information, dereliction of duty, or disobedience”. Taiwan was ruled under brutal martial law for decades, and abolished its military court in 2014 after backlash over the handling of an investigation into the hazing-related death of a young recruit. Opposition KMT legislator Wang Hung-wei said her party wasn't “totally against it” but accused the ruling DPP of backflipping on its long-held positions. China's government this week concluded its annual Two Sessions political meeting, during which officials emphasised their continued objective to annex Taiwan and punish leaders it sees as “separatists”. Chen Binhua, spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, had said on Wednesday: “If the ‘Taiwan independence' separatist forces provoke, exert pressure, or dare to cross the red line, resolute actions will be taken in response.”</p>

When Gastal first publicly shared his abuse, the Catholic diocese of Lafayette, Louisiana, had already paid more than $4m in confidential settlements to nine families whose children who were molested by Gauthe. The family alleged that Gauthe tried to ingratiate himself with them by bringing their child a toy truck during his hospitalization, as Minnesota Public Radio once reported. Both the civil and criminal cases against Gauthe – who once reportedly told a psychologist that he had molested more than 300 children – made international headlines after being covered extensively by regular Guardian contributor Jason Berry. Meanwhile, after a Pulitzer prize-winning Boston Globe investigation in 2002 exposed its local Catholic archdiocese for having covered up the widespread sexual abuse of children by its clerics, Gastal told CBS that he struggled to hold down work because of the extreme post-traumatic stress and insomnia with which he had grappled after surviving Gauthe's abuse. For the longest time, I just tried to black all this out so it wouldn't hurt me no more.”</p>

He said: “We can only keep future generations safe from climate change if all major emitters act. Writing in the Guardian, he added: “Climate action at home without pushing other, larger countries to do their fair share would not protect current and future generations. The world's biggest greenhouse gas emitter is profiting from record exports of electric vehicles, solar panels and other low-carbon goods.

President Donald Trump's tariffs are set to make an impact in the EV sector as well, so warns Tesla. In Germany where Musk is supporting a far-right political party, sales fell almost 70% compared to January last year. Trump also said on Truth Social this week "Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla." "Wow, that's beautiful," Trump said as he eased his way into the driver's seat of a Model X.</p>

The United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is facing a funding shortfall of $2 billion for this year, Axios reported on Friday, citing two people familiar with the matter. ICE has struggled with budget shortfalls in recent years, but the financial strain has worsened as the agency attempts to meet Trump's directive to deport "millions" of unauthorized immigrants. This effort requires extensive resources, including increased staffing, additional detention facilities, and more transportation for deportations. While Congress has approved an additional $500 million for ICE as part of a stop-gap spending bill currently being debated in the Senate, this amount is only a fraction of what the agency says it needs to maintain its current operations through the end of September, according to the Axios report. This pattern is not new—an analysis by the Government Accountability Office of ICE's budgets from 2014 to 2023 found that the agency has regularly overspent and had to rely on funds from other DHS departments.</p>

More than 8,500 fatalities have been recorded in the hostilities, according to official figures. At least 20 peacekeepers from the Southern African Development Community (SADC), including Malawian, Tanzanian, and South African soldiers, have also been killed.

Until now, supersolidity had only been observed in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), a state of matter formed when a group of bosons is cooled to near absolute zero, causing them to occupy the same quantum state. However, a team led by Antonio Gianfate from CNR Nanotec and Davide Nigro from the University of Pavia has now demonstrated that light itself can exhibit this peculiar behavior. “At temperatures near absolute zero, quantum effects emerge,” the researchers explained. Beyond computing, the ability to manipulate light in this way could revolutionize optical devices, photonic circuits, and even fundamental quantum mechanics research. Scientists anticipate that future research will refine these techniques, enabling more stable and controlled formations of supersolid light.</p>

On Tuesday, the Jaffar Express, traveling from Quetta to Peshawar with 440 passengers, was ambushed by armed rebels. Freed hostage Mehboob Ahmed, 31, suffered multiple gunshot wounds and described how some captives tried to escape. Some succeeded, but many were shot dead as the armed men opened fire," he said. While Baloch rebels have long targeted security forces, installations, and foreign projects, this is the first recorded hijacking of a passenger train. "Now that the state has abandoned its hostages to die, it will also bear responsibility for their deaths," he said in a statement on Thursday.</p>

Elon Musk's Tesla has warned that Donald Trump's trade war could expose the electric carmaker to retaliatory tariffs that would also affect other automotive manufacturers in the US. The company, led by Musk, a close Trump ally who is leading efforts to downsize the federal government, said it wanted to avoid a similar impact to previous trade disputes that resulted in increased tariffs on electric vehicles imported into countries targeted by the US. “For example, past trade actions by the United States have resulted in immediate reactions by the targeted countries, including increased tariffs on electric vehicles imported into those countries.” Trump has imposed significant tariffs that will affect vehicles and parts made around the world. This week Trump said he was buying a “brand new Tesla” and blamed “radical left lunatics” for “illegally” boycotting the EV company – a day after Tesla's worst share price fall in almost five years.</p>

Trump claimed on Friday, apparently based on information fed by Putin, that “at this very moment, thousands of Ukrainian troops are completely surrounded by the Russian military” and that he has asked Putin to spare their lives to avoid what he described as “a horrible massacre, one not seen since the second world war”. French president Emmanuel Macron said on Friday that Russia must accept a proposed 30-day ceasefire deal put forward by the United States and Ukraine. US president Donald Trump urged Putin on Friday to spare Ukrainian troops being pushed back out of Russia's Kursk region and said there was a “very good chance” the war could end. This Friday is only getting better for presumed next chancellor Friedrich Merz as Germany's constitutional court threw out several challenges by opposition parties against the plan.</p>

Putin produced a long set of obfuscations and new demands that would be unacceptable to Ukraine. Thursday's events showed just how hard it will be for the Trump administration to move Russia away from its position and into serious negotiations on a ceasefire. Retired Adm. James Stavridis said Thursday the Russian leader was staking out a careful line: “If you put it on a scale between ‘nyet,' ‘no,' and ‘da,' ‘yes,' he's right in the middle,” he told CNN's Jim Sciutto. While President Joe Biden rallied the Western alliance effectively to provide Ukraine with arms, ammunition and financial aid that saved its independence, there was never a track for peace talks with Putin, who was ostracized after his invasion of Ukraine three years ago. But will any such pressure be brought to bear on Putin, now that he, unlike the Ukrainian leader, has spurned Trump's terms?</p>

Several other extermination camps have been found in Mexico, and mass graves turn up nearly every week. Navarro's group — called the Searching Warriors of Jalisco — had been hearing since last year about young people who arrived at bus stations in the Guadalajara area, responding to online ads for jobs as security guards, electricians or farmers. Some people who failed or didn't follow orders were killed, and their bodies cut up in pieces, according to the accounts. One reason the camp has caused such outrage is that authorities were already aware of it. In recent days, authorities have identified six areas with underground graves at the site.</p>

Soldiers from the Belgian Special Forces perform a mock medical evacuation during an European Defense Agency joint military training exercise at Florennes airbase in Rosse, Belgium on Nov. 30, 2016. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has warned that Russian forces could be capable of launching an attack on European territory in 2030. “The way they go about it is intensely political, so we wouldn't prescribe any way of changing this — whether to go for conscription, elective conscription, bigger reserves,” a senior NATO official said on the condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to brief journalists unless he remained unnamed. Eleven European countries have compulsory military service: Austria, Cyprus, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden, and non-European Union nation Norway. Germany's professional armed forces had 181,174 active service personnel at the end of last year — slightly lower than in 2023, according to a parliamentary report released Tuesday.</p>

The southern Italian city of Naples was struck by a 4.4-magnitude quake early Thursday that caused only minor damage and sent 11 people to hospital, officials said. One woman was injured after part of a ceiling fell, and several others suffered cuts from glass that broke in the quake, Manfredi said. Seismologists have reported a fresh increase in activity around the Phlegrean Fields over recent weeks. Authorities last summer conducted drills in preparation for a major emergency as the frequency of temblors increased. The surface has been pushed up 1.3 meters (4.3 feet) since 2006, which is higher than prior to the last major event in 1984, but seismologists have emphasized it is impossible to predict when an eruption or stronger quake might occur.</p>

Pulling a train by the strength of your teeth is no easy task CAIRO — Pulling a train by the strength of your teeth is no easy task. But for Egyptian wrestler Ashraf Mahrous, also known by his nickname Kabonga, it's just one of several things he can do to show off his astonishing strength. Mahrous this week received formal recognition by the Guinness World Records in three categories, including the heaviest rail pull using only his teeth. On Thursday, crowds gathered at the Ramses train station in downtown Cairo to watch and cheer him on as he pulled a train — weighing 279 tons — with a rope held by his teeth for a distance of nearly 10 meters (33 feet).</p>

Russian leader's comments signal there will be difficult negotiations ahead that could frustrate President Donald Trump's hope for a swift peace deal. Trump said the United States had discussed territorial and other issues that could be in a final deal. Putin also talked about how Russian troops were advancing against the remaining Ukrainian forces in its southern Kursk region. Putin's talk of lengthy discussions over the terms of a ceasefire would probably mean that fighting will continue, and hundreds or thousands more lives could be lost — a prospect at odds with Trump's stated desire for an end to the bloodshed. It would also allow Russia to capture more territory and continue its slow advance in eastern Ukraine.</p>

OCOS, Guatemala (AP) — As the United States government works to effectively extend its border security objectives south into Central America, countries like Guatemala have come under renewed scrutiny and pressure to step up their own border enforcement. The patrol was part of stepped up border operations since January, said Col. Juan Ernesto Celis. The soldiers on patrol are looking to stop illegal arms, drug and human trafficking across Guatemala's borders. Ann Marie Argueta, spokeswoman for Guatemala's defense department, said Thursday that the military wants to not only protect against crimes that threaten the population, but also prevent “incursions into national territory by transnational organized crime.”</p>

Greg Barbaccia, the United States federal chief information officer, sent the message on Wednesday, in response to questions about whether cybersecurity employees' work is national security-related, and therefore exempt from layoffs. "We believe cybersecurity is national security and we encourage Department-level Chief Information Officers to consider this when reviewing their organizations," he wrote in the email to information technology employees across the federal government which has not been previously reported. Describing "skilled cyber security professionals" as playing "a vital role in mission delivery and information assurance," he said, "We are confident federal agencies will be able to identify efficiencies across their non-cyber mission areas without negatively affecting their agency's cyber posture," he added. In testimony earlier this month, a former cybersecurity director at the National Security Agency,  Rob Joyce, said the mass culling of workers from federal payrolls would have a "devastating" impact on cybersecurity and national security.

Israel says it took extraordinary measures to avoid harming civilians in the 15-month war, which has been paused by a fragile ceasefire. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his former defense minister, accusing them of war crimes, which they deny. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. Israeli experts who have treated former hostages say some were subjected to physical and sexual abuse in captivity. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants.</p>

Iran's 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has mocked Trump, but officials in his country also have offered conflicting signals over whether negotiations could take place. Araghchi, who took part in negotiations for Iran's 2015 nuclear deal, later toughened his tone and said talks couldn't happen under U.S. pressure, following Khamenei's lead. Meanwhile, Iran's Foreign Ministry on Thursday summoned ambassadors from France and Germany, as well as the British chargé d'affaires, to complain about them backing a closed-door Security Council meeting Wednesday at the United Nations. But in January 1979, the shah, fatally ill with cancer, fled Iran as mass demonstrations swelled against his rule. The Islamic Revolution followed, led by Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and created Iran's theocratic government.</p>

All these will strengthen Kyiv's position in negotiations and deter Russia from breaching any deal, they say. Russia hasn't committed to it yet, and many here are skeptical that Moscow will deal in good faith. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is hosting a summit by video this weekend to discuss the still-undefined international force that would back any long-term truce. The idea of a European force in Ukraine backed by air and sea power has gained support, but it's certainly not unanimous. A peace deal could unfold in multiple phases, others have said, with more countries joining the coalition as plans advance.</p>

More importantly, Nova Scotia has set a new benchmark with its bold Free Trade and Mobility within Canada Act, which adopts mutual recognition, the simple principle that if a product or worker is certified in any Canadian province, that's good enough for Nova Scotia. Even when international sourcing becomes more expensive, an internal tariff that high means buying domestically still may not feel like the better option. Some of the hoops Canadians are expected to jump through when moving goods and services across provincial borders can be ludicrous. Other provinces have since followed with incremental steps, joining agreements to facilitate labour mobility and direct-to-consumer alcohol shipments. No wonder 88 per cent of small businesses surveyed say eliminating internal trade barriers needs to be a top priority.</p>

On Thursday, new inflation data showed price increases slowed in February — but economists saw warning signs that the central bank may interpret as reasons to continue waiting. But if tariff clarity is delayed indefinitely, it's hard to imagine rate cuts not sharing that itinerary. What triggers a stock market sell-off today might actually boost corporate profits later this year. “If the Fed makes monetary policy decisions based on policies enacted today, they could make substantial cuts to interest rates in 2025," said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank.

Most other companies are in Taiwan, which leaves those supply chains pretty exposed if tensions ratchet up with China. But Intel hasn't been able to capitalise on its position, and in fact, it's haemorrhaged billions of dollars lately. And again, farmers have traditionally been a very sort of intransigent lobby group in India, which is why I'm doubtful this will happen.

If a trade war weakens the US dollar through inflation, Bitcoin could actually benefit, says Eugene Epstein, head of trading and structured products at Moneycorp. If US equities continue falling it is hard to envision a strong crypto market, at least in the near term,” Epstein said. Since early February, Bitcoin ETFs have seen significant outflows as uncertainty looms over the broader economic landscape. That's why some traders in the industry choose to not base their strategies solely on tariffs. For Bob Walden, head of Trading at Abra, tariffs are “just a headline” that influences short-term investor sentiment but doesn't alter the market's fundamental conditions.</p>

Since 2024, VASPs operating in Argentina have been required to register with the registry of virtual asset service providers, also known as PSAV. As global law firm DLA Piper explained, Argentina's push for clearer crypto regulations intensified one year ago after the CNV implemented registration requirements and said crypto issuers would be subject to securities laws. An October Chainalysis report determined that Argentina had overtaken Brazil as the largest Latin American country for crypto inflows at roughly $91 billion between July 2023 and June 2024. Argentina tops Latin America's crypto adoption list in terms of value received between July 2023 and June 2024. As Cointelegraph reported, Milei publicly endorsed the memecoin before it suddenly plunged in value, fueling allegations of a rug pull.</p>

Bitcoin's recovery near $85,000 shows solid buying at lower levels, signaling that the downside may be limited. A move above $89,000 could liquidate roughly $1.60 billion in short positions, according to CoinGlass data. The inflows of $13.3 million into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on March 12 could not be sustained, and the ETFs recorded outflows of $135.2 million on March 13, per Farside Investors data. The relative strength index (RSI) is showing early signs of forming a positive divergence. If the price rebounds off $1.20, it will indicate a possible range formation.</p>

Despite Bitcoin's decline since Trump's win, analysts say it is not the worst crypto downturn in history, pointing to past cycles with deeper losses and less liquidity. “For those who have been through multiple cycles, this is just part of the process,” Trezor analyst Lucien Bourdon told Cointelegraph. While many were optimistic, some investors, such as BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, accurately predicted a crypto sell-off following Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. Since then, Bitcoin has tumbled more than 18%, with the total crypto market capitalization erasing almost all gains that came from Trump's election win, dropping 25%. Gox collapse wiped out 70% of Bitcoin's trading volume, leading to an 85% drawdown in a market with no institutional support and far less liquidity,” Bourdon said.</p>

According to blockchain analytics firm DWF Labs, at least eight insider wallets withdrew $107 million in liquidity, triggering the massive collapse. DWF Labs' report comes a week after New York lawmakers introduced legislation aimed at protecting crypto investors from rug pulls and insider fraud, amid the latest wave of memecoin scams. “There's always a degree of risk when launching any token, something which can't easily be fully mitigated,” he said.</p>

Any delay, he said, was caused by FTX's failure to share relevant records promptly. Its liquidators also pursued claims against collapsed crypto firm Terraform Labs through a $1.3 billion claim in Terra's bankruptcy case. At the same time, FTX, which filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, has been undertaking its own recovery efforts to reclaim funds. In November last year, it filed a trio of lawsuits, one against SkyBridge Capital and its founder, Anthony Scaramucci, to recoup funds spent by former FTX CEO Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried on sponsorship and investment deals. Another suit was filed against crypto exchange Binance and its former CEO, Changpeng Zhao, to recover $1.76 billion worth of cryptocurrency sent to the exchange as part of a July 2021 repurchase deal.</p>

“Defendant Bancor DAO has failed to answer or otherwise defend itself within the time allowed, and that plaintiffs have demonstrated that failure,” wrote district court clerk Philip Delvin on March 13. According to the plaintiffs, who filed the suit in May 2023, Bancor deceived investors about its impermanent loss protection mechanism for liquidity providers and also claimed its token was an unregistered security. They said Bancor's ILP operated at a deficit and tried to cover by launching a new product, v3, which promised “some of the most competitive returns anywhere […] without asking users to take on any risk.” Bancor is an onchain liquidity protocol that enables automated, decentralized exchange across blockchains.

An Arkansas crypto mining group has taken action against two state officials who they claim enforced an unconstitutional law restricting a foreign-born US citizen's mining activities. The Arkansas Cryptomining Association is suing two Arkansas state officials, arguing that they enforced an unconstitutional and discriminatory state rule prohibiting foreign-born American citizens from engaging in crypto-mining activities, among other things. Kempton noted that these rules were enforced against crypto mining firm Jones Eagle LLC, which is run by Qimin “Jimmy” Chen, a naturalized US citizen of Chinese origin. Kempton also said the prohibitions and penalties imposed under Act 174 infringe on the federal government's authority to investigate, review and take action on foreign investments. District Court Judge Kristine G. Baker said on Dec. 9 that the Arkansas state officials were barred from enforcing Act 174 against Jones Eagle until further notice.</p>

Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn granted a temporary restraining order on March 12, requested by Bitcoin miner Consensus Colocation and systems owner Stone Ridge Ventures against Mawson Hosting, which provides hosting and colocation services for Bitcoin miners. The Bitcoin miner has been seeking injunctive relief to regain control of their equipment and prevent Mawson from using them. Mawson Infrastructure Group and Consensus Colocation did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph's request for comment. In a March 6 legal complaint, lawyers acting for Consensus accused Mawson of mining Bitcoin (BTC) with their rigs — valued at $30 million — since Feb. 28, generating daily profits of between $100,000 and $200,000 while blocking access to them both physically and through VPN access. “On its face, it was operative only prior to April 1, 2024, and only in narrow circumstances relating to the replenishment of a deposit,” lawyers acting for Consensus said in the suit.</p>

US state Vermont has dropped its “show cause order” against crypto exchange Coinbase for allegedly offering unregistered securities to users through a staking service. Vermont's Department of Financial Regulation said in a March 13 order that in light of the US Securities and Exchange Commission tossing out its case on Feb. 28, it would follow suit and rescind its action against Coinbase without prejudice. Now that Vermont has opted out, Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal said in a March 13 statement to X that the other states with staking actions should take a “page from Vermont's playbook.” A growing number of firms facing legal action from the SEC have had their cases dismissed in the wake of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who took a hardline stance toward crypto, resigning on Jan. 20. Crypto trading firm Cumberland DRW was among the latest to have its case dropped on March 4, while the regulator is reportedly wrapping up its enforcement action against Ripple Labs after more than four years.</p>

Ethereum core developers have decided to create a third testnet, Hoodi, to better prepare for the Pectra upgrade, which has now been delayed until at least late April after the first two testnets encountered several bugs. Pectra was initially slated to launch on Ethereum mainnet in late 2024 but has faced repeated delays due to client readiness issues and synchronization bugs in the first two Ethereum testnets, Holesky and Sepolia. That would see at least 20 million test staked-Ether (ETH) distributed across 11 client teams and five staking operators. Beiko noted that aspects of Pectra may still be tested on Sepolia and Holesky. Crypto-focused venture capital firm Paradigm also called on Ethereum core developers to ship faster protocol updates to achieve more milestones on its technical roadmap and maintain its competitive edge as a leading layer 1 blockchain.</p>

Chinese scientists have unveiled an artificial intelligence (AI) "agent" that makes its own decisions without requiring specific instructions from a human operator. It's still early days for Manus, however, with some users reporting crashes and other issues such as a tendency to get stuck in an infinite feedback loop. Reporter Caiwei Chen, who had access to Manus for MIT Technology Review, wrote that the experience was "like collaborating with a highly intelligent and efficient intern." However, Chen also noted that Manus sometimes lacked understanding of what it was supposed to do, made incorrect assumptions and cut corners. Some examples Manus AI has demonstrated on its website include planning a detailed holiday itinerary, analyzing the stock market and screening job resumes.</p>

The End-Permian mass extinction killed an estimated 80% of life on Earth, but new research suggests that plants might have done okay. The mass extinction that killed 80% of life on Earth 250 million years ago may not have been quite so disastrous for plants, new fossils hint. This is consistent with other evidence from Africa and Argentina, where plant populations seemed to have shifted gradually rather than dying off dramatically and then repopulating, said Josefina Bodnar, a paleobotanist at the National University of La Plata in Argentina who was not involved in the research. The end-Permian extinction is particularly interesting to scientists because it was driven by greenhouse gases, much like climate change today. Studying these ancient catastrophes can give us a sense of what to expect under atmospheric carbon dioxide levels people have never experienced, Gastaldo said.</p>

Someone taking a walk in the snowy hills near the Swiss capital of Bern last winter would have been perplexed by a giant white balloon rising into the low-lying clouds. Near the hilltop where the balloon was tethered, they would have found a group of researchers launching a drone, then flying it upwind to sprinkle crystals of silver powder into the fog.

“We use the natural cloud as a laboratory,” says Ulrike Lohmann at ETH Zurich in Switzerland, a member…

Pi belongs to a huge mathematical group called irrational numbers, which go on forever and cannot be written as fractions. Despite this difficulty, over the past 300 years, mathematicians have established different proofs of pi's irrationality, using techniques from across mathematics. The specific math involved is often incredibly complex, typically requiring a university-level understanding of calculus, trigonometry and infinite series. However, rather than proving pi is irrational directly, it's also possible to confirm irrationality using a different property of the number. Although pi's universal importance may arise from this intangible irrationality, seven or eight decimal places is usually more than sufficient for any real-world applications.</p>

When their Big Three of Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal have shared the court, they've been outscored by 3.3 points per 100 possessions. Ishbia interrupted a question about potentially trading him and starting over by saying it would "never happen." Ishbia then went a step further, promising that "we will win championships here in Phoenix." Beal has a no-trade clause and is owed $110.8 million in the two seasons that follow this one. Given how Phoenix has operated during Ishbia's tenure as owner, though, putting together a contender will be enormously difficult.</p>

He may have a deep affinity for Dallas, but DeMarcus Lawrence apparently doesn't have much love for his former team, the Dallas Cowboys, who employed him during his first 11 NFL seasons. One can assume that Lawrence's comments won't sit well with Jerry Jones, who undoubtedly takes the team's championship drought more personally than anyone on the planet. We know for certain that former teammate Micah Parsons isn't sitting well with the remarks, either. Lawrence promptly followed up with a defense: "Calling me a clown won't change the fact that I told the truth. Jones' run with the Cowboys includes the quickest turnaround in NFL history (the Cowboys won their first Super Bowl under Jones three years after going 1-15 during his first season in Dallas) and a then-record three Super Bowl wins over a four-year span.</p>

Commissioner Brett Yormark has not publicly committed to the AQ model for his conference, but it's fair to say every league has at least considered the concept of play-in games for those AQ spots. While the possibilities are preliminary -- and almost endless -- at this point, there are at least two models to consider to determine those two Big 12 automatic qualifiers. Let's take it a step further and dream up the composition of those two divisions based on geography … Because of that philosophy,  neither TCU nor Baylor got into the four-team field. The stakeholders have been warned extensively about doing so by media analysts.</p>

Kansas missed its big chance to fill that role -- along with a lot of rims Thursday. It is drafting on months-old accomplishments and about to get its lowest NCAA seed in years. The Jayhawks, now a pedestrian 21-12, were going to hold that underdog designation a) only if they won Thursday in the Big 12 quarterfinals against Wildcats and b) because they had backed into their current plight to begin with. While the NCAA Tournament fate of Kansas and Iowa State is still to be determined -- Kansas State is out -- let's just say plenty of tickets will be available for the tournament's final four: Houston vs. Baylor and Texas Tech vs. Arizona. 6 seed, now has lost its most conference games since Self was a sophomore at Oklahoma State 42 years ago.</p>

However, on that list, you'll notice the Ravens, Steelers, Cowboys, Chiefs and Eagles have been able to win pretty consistently since their "worst" offseasons. Aaron Banks was obscenely overpaid for an average guard and Javon Hargrave is 32 coming off a season-ending injury. This front office believes they can build a winner around Purdy for years to come, whether the rest of us do or not, is another question. The 49ers actually had a one-year deal in place with Kendricks last offseason before he changed his mind and went to Dallas. All of this gives me reason to believe claims that the 49ers' Super Bowl window is closed are premature.</p>

With exactly one month left before the playoffs, we can spot 10 possible NBA contenders in a hope-filled view of who could win it all. Speaking of the Celtics, this year's version is trying to defy recent history and show back-to-back champs can still be a thing. Jamal Murray has a high ceiling but also lulls that can be worrisome, particularly if your goal is title or bust. While New York fans might bemoan the lack of surety and "respect" in this tier, it's for good reason. And their individual defensive pieces, particularly on the perimeter, suggest defensive-minded head coach Tom Thibodeau may be able to flip that switch come April.</p>

That raises two questions: If North Carolina beats Duke, will it affect the Blue Devils' seed? It will not assume a result would be different if both teams were at full strength.

Rodgers is reportedly trying to decide whether he will either retire or play a 21st season in the NFL. Teams be warned: An NFL team executive told CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones that teams still waiting for the future Hall of Famer to make his decision should "do so at their own risk." Former NFL GM Doug Whaley said on Wednesday that Rodgers is "holding the entire Steelers organization hostage" during a Pittsburgh radio hit. The Steelers are indeed reportedly waiting for Rodgers to give them an answer, although NFL Media reported Wednesday morning that it could be weeks before a decision is made. If he were to sign with Cleveland, Wilson could find himself in a position battle with Kenny Pickett, who was traded from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia shortly after Wilson was signed by the Steelers last offseason.</p>

Both the Giants and Steelers have discussed the parameters of a potential deal with Rodgers' representation, Dianna Russini reported on the "Scoop City" podcast Thursday, and the quarterback's agent has already informed both clubs he intends to make a decision on his next destination soon. Some inside Rodgers' camp have already indicated "it's gonna be the Steelers," per Russini, but "nobody in Pittsburgh believes that" since no official communications have stated as much. In other words, the Giants would like Rodgers, and might be willing to pay the most money to secure his services, but they aren't necessarily desperate to get him so much as any quarterback. Others have loosely linked Rodgers to the Vikings, who also declined to re-sign Daniel Jones in free agency, but there's been no indication yet that Minnesota brass is serious about committing top dollar to Rodgers with McCarthy already in tow. Inside all three teams -- the Giants, Steelers and Vikings -- are personnel executives who believe Rodgers can still play "at a very high level," Russini noted, despite the 41-year-old's lackluster two-year run with the Jets.</p>

With new talent and strategic roster moves, some teams have already emerged as leading candicdates for successful season. These are teams who will likely be in the playoff mix and could even break through. Angel City FC: A lot will depend on how interim coach Sam Laity can get young players out the gate. Adding Yazmeen Ryan, Delanie Sheehan, and Messiah Bright were good steps in a competitive direction, but what tactics head coach Fabrice Gautrat settles on is the big question. Chicago Stars FC: They made the playoffs in 2024, but their competitive decline happened with a skid into that postseason.</p>

The program added a few key transfers, including tight end Carsen Ryan and defensive lineman Keanu Tanuvasa from rival Utah. While the program added quarterbacks Kaidon Salter (Liberty) and Julian Lewis (freshman), it's highly unlikely they can just count on 300 yards of efficient passing per game heading forward. Kansas boasted All-Big 12 performers Mello Dotson and Cobee Bryant at defensive back last season, but both are off to the NFL. Trent Battle should step into a bigger role after dealing with injuries and most of the offensive line is back, but modest improvements aren't enough. Running back Jahiem White should fit perfectly within a Rich Rod offense, but almost every other projected contributor is brand new to campus.</p>

With play stopped, another one came 15 seconds of real-time later after he appeared to mouth the words "that's f---ing bullshit" at the official who dinged him.

Fox News host Jessica Tarlov on Thursday summed up Americans' displeasure with President Donald Trump's second term as she argued that Democrats' messaging is “going pretty well” despite some “painful moments.” The White House has seen brutal polling data in recent days as most Americans disapprove of the president's handling of the economy, per a new CNN poll, while a separate Reuters/Ipsos poll found about 57% of Americans believe Trump's economic moves have been “too erratic.” Tarlov's remarks arrived as part of a panel discussion on messaging from the left as Democrats are hiring influencers, including some who have advised them to keep things real and “be meaner,” according to a new report by independent journalist Tara Palmeri. Tarlov went on to blast conservatives who have claimed that there are “fake” constituents at the town hall events. Wall Street Tumbles 10% Below Its Record After Trump Escalates His Trade War</p>

Yellowjackets has had its fair share of death by cannibalism — but which character exit was the most brutal and gruesome? “For us, it's never been about if [there will be] cannibalism,” creator Ashley Lyle told IndieWire in 2023. All thing considered, Coach Ben Scott (Steven Krueger) had a more tame death after being tortured by the girls. She was then punished for Ben's death by being forced to prepare him as their next meal, which the audience didn't see.
